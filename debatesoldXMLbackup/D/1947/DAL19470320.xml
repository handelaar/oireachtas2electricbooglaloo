      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether the Dáil will be given an early opportunity of discussing Government policy in relation to the international trade discussions at present taking place in London, which discussions have for their object the proposed elimination of commonwealth trade preferences in exchange for reciprocal trade concessions to the States of the Commonwealth by the United States of America and other countries; and whether, in view of the possible adverse effect which decisions reached in these discussions and negotiations may have upon our producers, he will make an early statement to the Dáil on the matter.</P>

      <P>An opportunity for discussing this matter will arise on the Vote for Industry and Commerce which, I understand, the Minister is anxious to take as early as possible in the new financial year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>I regret that the supply position does not permit of an extension of the supplementary bread ration scheme to any additional classes of workers other than those to whom the scheme applies at present, or to whom I have intimated that it will apply if suitable administrative machinery can be devised. The total supplies of wheat and flour available to the end of June are now definitely known and there is no prospect that they can be increased. They will be barely adequate to maintain existing distribution with a minimum of carry-over stocks.  A further extension of the supplementary scheme can, therefore, be effected only by reducing the general ration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Risteárd Ua Maolchatha</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that the present curtailment of Córas Iompair Éireann services has created very serious problems for farmers and merchants in the <Col N="2466" /> transportation of goods and merchandise; and if he will arrange, during this period of dislocation, to allow vehicles of any kind whatsoever to carry goods and merchandise for reward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The transport position is being kept under constant examination. Direct road freight services have been put into operation from the principal supply centres linking in many cases with the distributive road services attached to country railheads. In addition to their own vehicles Córas Iompair Éireann have organised a pool of private hauliers resident in Dublin as an auxiliary fleet to augment their own vehicles in conveying lorry load traffic to all parts of the country. Private hauliers resident in the country districts are now being brought into this pool of transport and the network of the services is rapidly being extended.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that transport facilities for the equitable distribution of essential supplies throughout all parts of the country would be improved by the adoption of the proposal contained in the question.  The extension of the public road transport services which is being effected ensures the fullest utilisation of available vehicles and the more effective control of petrol supplies allocated for goods haulage. Furthermore, it provides that facilities are equally available to all persons and generally throughout the country, and that public transport is provided on a published scale of charges.  It also prevents a possible diversion of existing haulage facilities from essential fuel traffic to more lucrative but less important work.</P>
      <P>While changes in existing arrangements will be made if circumstances so require, I am strongly of the opinion that it is preferable to endeavour to deal with the situation by the extension of the services of statutory transport undertakers than by any other method. A proposal for the utilisation by Córas Iompair Éireann of the carrying capacity of private motor lorries, when returning unladen to their base, is at present under examination.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that, towards the end of last year, permits for the use of coal were substituted for those relating to turf in the case of hotels in Wexford; that, in February, 1947, the permits for the use of coal were cancelled and the permits for the use of turf were not restored, and that, in those circumstances, the hotels are now without fuel of any description; and whether he will take steps to ensure that these hotels will be enabled to procure fuel to carry on their business of catering for the tourist traffic in Wexford area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that allowances of coal in lieu of turf were made last autumn to certain hotels, including a number in Wexford, with a view to reserving all the available supplies of turf for the maintenance of the household ration over the winter.  Because of the failure of imports these coal allowances have had to be discontinued. I could not agree to divert to hotels supplies of turf which are essential to the maintenance of a minimum domestic ration and in these circumstances hotel managements in common with industrial concerns generally must endeavour to meet their requirements by obtaining supplies of wood fuel by their own efforts.  In areas where firewood will henceforth be rationed, licences will be given to hotel proprietors to purchase limited quantities from producers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dingle Harbour Commissioners applied for a State grant to meet the entire cost of the works mentioned in the question.  I have examined this application and have decided that the prospects of increased trade at Dingle Harbour would not justify expenditure on the scale proposed particularly as substantial expenditure on improvement works there by the State in 1930 did not result in a subsequent expansion of trade. In the circumstances no purpose would be served by sending engineers to inspect the works proposed.</P>
      <P>There appears to be scope for the development of Dingle as a fishery harbour and the commissioners have been informed that the Minister for Agriculture as the fishery authority would be prepared to consider assisting with a scheme for improvement works directly related to such interests.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that Kilkenny and other towns in the Nore valley were subjected to heavy flooding last week as a result of the recent abnormal <Col N="2470" /> weather.  The only effective remedy for the periodic flooding occasioned by the River Nore lies in the execution of a comprehensive drainage scheme for the entire catchment area.  The formulation of such a scheme under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, will be duly considered, but as has already been indicated in An Dáil on several occasions, there is little likelihood that the Nore area can be reached at an early stage of the drainage programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give us any indication of the number of years which must elapse before even a survey is taken of the Nore catchment area and can he not say roughly when it is likely that drainage works will begin on the Nore and is he aware that there are several local problems on the Nore which could be tackled before the introduction of a full drainage scheme? Is he aware that there are many places on the Nore where there are obstructions by old mills, trees, weirs, and islands in the river which could be dynamited and so give some measure of relief.  Further, is the Minister aware&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion put forward by the Deputy for temporary relief measures of the kind suggested by him is not feasible and such works, if carried out, would leave the last position worse than the first because it would only increase the flooding in the lower regions of the river.  In reply to his further question I am not in a position to state exactly when a scheme can be prepared for the Nore area.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that even on the figures given here by the Parliamentary Secretary the other night there would be at least 1/3½d. due to Corporal Gallowey even when 16/2½d. was taken from his pension in respect of the married quarters?

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister then suggest that regulations exist in the Army which are going to keep a soldier with a quarter of a century's service in the Army marooned in married quarters in the barracks, by virtue of the fact that there is no housing accommodation outside, and is it because of these circumstances the pension duly earned by him is going to be withheld and he is going to be charged three times the amount for the rent of the place that he would be charged if he was a serving member of the Army?</P>

      <P>The position is that every week in the year men are completing their periods of service &mdash; their <Col N="2472" /> contract with the State &mdash; and they are complying with the regulations.  This is one abnormal case which the Deputy has taken up, and I think he would be well advised not to encourage this man and perhaps other individuals, to do something that they should not do and that they have no right to do.</P>
      <P>A contract has been completed with them.  This man has been in the Army for a period of 25 years &mdash; that is true. He gave good service.  He received all the amenities that the Army can give during that period and he has, in the normal way, completed his term of service.  He is now bordering on 50 years of age.  I do not know if the Deputy is suggesting that every soldier, when he reaches the end of his service, should be retained in the Army; I do not know what the Deputy is seeking, but I would like to impress upon him that it is the normal procedure. There is not a week in the year that officers, N.C.O.s and soldiers reach the end of their service and go out in the normal way.  It may be there is some difficulty in this case about housing accommodation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Can the Minister suggest any way in which this man can get accommodation and, if the Minister cannot do so, does he not realise the condition of this man and his family and has he nothing else to offer beyond saying &ldquo;regulations&rdquo;?</P>

I was hoping in order that the views of the House might be tested on this matter, because I think the Minister has an open mind, that you would permit me to move an amendment, the purpose of which is to substitute £500 for £400.  I was hoping that you would permit me to do that so as to ascertain the feelings of the House and that the Minister might cooperate in ascertaining the real feelings of the House by permitting the matter to be decided by a free vote.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The attitude of the whole House is that they want to facilitate the Minister in getting this Bill through.  I do not think it necessary to go over all the ground I travelled yesterday.  The sole purpose of my amendment is to provide some cover for the widows and orphans of men who, if this Bill be passed in its present form, will not be covered for widows' and orphans' pension purposes where the remuneration of such men exceeds £400 per year. Everybody knows that that class of person is not able to make provision for <Col N="2506" /> his wife and children in the event of his death to insulate them against the inevitable poverty consequent on the death of a bread-winner in such circumstances. I, and many other Deputies I am sure, have had experience of persons in that category.  On their death it is found that they made no adequate provision for their widows or children with the result that the unfortunate widows and children have to go from one charitable organisation to another trying to get whatever assistance they can, feeling ashamed at having to do it, and not being in any sense specially or technically qualified for the difficult task of getting assistance from such organisations.  I have seen women and children endeavouring, in almost indescribable ways, to get a pittance to keep them out of the work-house.</P>
    <P>In all these cases, failure to make provision for the widow and children is due to the fact that the family income is inadequate to make any real and effective provision for the widows and children in such circumstances.  I want to try to assure that provision is made for such adversity and that some cover is provided for widows and children of persons who have over £400 per year and up to £500.  Personally I should like to see the limit extended beyond £500 but that is not the purpose of my amendment to-day.  I would be satisfied if the Minister would raise the ceiling from £400 to £500 so as to provide cover for the widows and children of deceased persons who are unable to make any provision for their wives and children, in the event of their death.</P>
    <P>The whole arrangement is on an actuarial basis.  It has an insurance foundation.  In this case, the State can provide, because of the whole structure of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, a better class of cover than can be provided by outside private companies, and when we have the opportunity to-day of providing cover for the widows and children of men with over £400 per year without inflicting any burden on the State, surely we ought not to neglect that opportunity. I venture to say that whatever might be the viewpoint of the male members who would be compulsorily insurable <Col N="2507" /> under the National Health Insurance Acts, if this amendment is carried, if the widows and children are consulted, they will regard cover of this kind for widows' and orphans' pension purposes as very valuable.</P>
    <P>I want by this amendment to extend the cover to those with up to £500 per year, so as to mitigate the number of cases in which men die without making provision for their widows and children and consequently throw their unfortunate dependents on the generosity of charitable organisations or of such friends as are capable of providing them with temporary assistance.  I am sure that, in his heart, the Minister must be in favour of the amendment and I urge him to accept it.  If he is prepared to do so, I urge him to leave the question at issue, which is not a Party issue but a purely humanitarian issue, to a free vote of his own Party.</P>

I have heard only Deputy Norton in favour of the amendment.  I do not know whether the other Parties are taking, as it were, a neutral attitude, but if there is no opposition, I am prepared to agree to the amendment.</P>

      <P>I expressed an opinion yesterday and the Minister can take it that it was entirely a personal opinion.  What has transpired here to-day does not suggest to me that I ought to change that opinion.  I say that, in an unconsidered way, the Dáil ought not to raise the limit from £400 to £500 and thereby, without serious consideration, bring 15,000 additional people into the national health insurance scheme which is passing because of its inadequacy and general unsatisfactory nature.  I understand that the Minister is not quite clear as to how many people will be brought in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>When the Minister is on the eve of bringing in a comprehensive scheme, I feel that an additional number of people, 15,000 or more, ought not to be brought into a scheme which, as I say, is unsatisfactory and which is just being patched up now by the addition of a few shillings for each class of beneficiary.  Deputy Norton indicates, and it is implied in the amendment, that this need not necessarily put an additional burden on the State.  He is, therefore, asking a machinery, which is not too satisfactory at present, a machinery which has been declared, in respect of its lower branches, at any rate, to be less well paid than the lowest classes in the Civil Service, to deal with 15,000 new cases. I cannot conceive that the Minister can leave the wages or salaries position of the workers of the national health insurance society at their present level&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are invited to accept this amendment on the ground that it does not necessarily impose, for administrative purposes, any additional cost on the State, that is, that the present underpaid staff is to be asked, until the comprehensive scheme comes in, to do additional work on its present sub-normal standard of payment.  I take it that the widows' and orphans' question of which Deputy Norton speaks will, adequately or in a reasonable way, be dealt with under the Minister's new scheme, and all the pressure that can possibly be piled up outside the scheme ought to be left there to force quick conclusions and consideration on the part of the Government with regard to that comprehensive scheme.</P>
      <P>I think this proposal contains a possible element of unfairness to 15,000 people rather than the element of conferring a benefit on any of them and it is my personal opinion that we would act wrongly if we brought in the additional people now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that, before putting his proposals before the House, the Minister and his officials and the authorities <Col N="2509" /> of the National Health Insurance Society went carefully and fully into the whole matter and, after mature consideration of every aspect, selected £400 as the ceiling.  I have heard no argument and no substantial expression of opinion which might be a substitute for argument for the case put up, but, in speaking in this way, I am stating entirely my own opinion, and I do not intend or wish to bind any other person in the House.  I think, however, that the House would make a mistake if it brought in these additional people at this stage.  They should be left outside, without the imposition which this Bill will impose on them, to utilise the pressure they can bring to bear, if they want a comprehensive scheme to deal with their widows and orphans, on the Government to speed up their consideration and their proposals in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pleasure in supporting Deputy Norton's proposal and I appeal to the Minister to accept it.  Recently, in my constituency, there were two cases in which widows and orphans were left in the position to which the Deputy has referred.  We should not defer or postpone doing justice to these people because a number of officials in the National Health Insurance Society seem to be badly paid.  If the logic of that argument is applied right through, the Bill should not go through in its present form until their grievances are rectified.  I earnestly appeal to the Minister to come to the help of people such as those referred to by Deputy Norton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with the principle of the amendment, but I do not agree that this is the time at which, or the way in which, it should be done.  This is either a national health insurance scheme or it is not.  We have been arguing here and outside &mdash; some of us, for years &mdash; that the scale of benefits even for a man on £2 per week, is hopelessly inadequate. We now get some little increase up to 22/6 per week.  I want to suggest that if you bring in people&mdash;and this applies to a certain extent to the proposal in the Bill&mdash;you are bringing them in without notice &mdash; this Bill is going <Col N="2510" /> through the House in record time&mdash; and compelling 15,000 people and their employers to contribute to an insurance scheme.  There is no use in giving people who live and have responsibilities up to the £500 per year mark 22/6 when they are knocked out.</P>
      <P>I should like to see this but I should like it to be in a comprehensive scheme.  I know, of course, that the National Health Insurance Society is in favour of this amendment.  I do not know whether the Minister is in favour of it or not.  This would be a help from an actuarial or financial point of view to the society because you are bringing in a class of people now who cannot afford to be in.  I would say that the percentage of the additional 15,000 who claim benefit will be far smaller than the percentage of the ordinary members.  We are trying to deal with this as if it were a permanent comprehensive measure.  It is not. Deputy Norton said yesterday, and very rightly, that it was not a scheme that could be regarded as insurance or that could be helpful so far as the health of the nation or the members is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like Deputies to get it into their minds that when this scheme was originally initiated the scale of benefit was equal to the weekly wage paid at that time to the vast majority of the members of the association.  The vast majority of the members of the association in those days were unskilled labourers and domestic servants and the rates of benefit fixed by the British Government at that time were equivalent to their wages and in some cases were in excess of their wages.  One of the reasons, if not the main reason, why local insurance societies, before the unification, gave additional benefits in kind rather than in cash was that if at that time they increased the statutory cash benefit it would have equalled and, in some cases, would have exceeded the full wages which would be paid to many of the members. The committees of the societies, which were made up of the members and local people who had a knowledge of local conditions of work and wages, came to the conclusion &mdash; I think rightly &mdash; that it would be an incentive to malingering if <Col N="2511" /> a man found that he could get more in cash at the end of the week by remaining in bed than he could get if he worked.</P>
    <P>The scheme contained in this Bill can scarcely be described even as an amendment of the insurance code.  The Minister has not had an opportunity of examining it and I feel that it would be a mistake in the present circumstances to have this amendment carried. Personally, I would be one of the most ardent supporters of a raising of the ceiling in this matter if we were dealing with the comprehensive measure that we have been promised by the Minister.  This will be a help to the society from the actuarial point of view.</P>
    <P>I do not think it will be fair to the 15,000 &mdash; or whatever the number may be &mdash; who are going to be brought in. Twenty-two and sixpence nowadays is not health insurance.  You can call it what you like, but do not call it health insurance.  I appeal to the House to be slow in passing this amendment, not because I am against it in principle &mdash; I am not; I am entirely for it &mdash; but I do not think it should be put into a purely temporary measure such as this is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one point.  If you are faced, as we are faced from day to day, with cases of a man dying, having an insurance policy for, say, £200, £300 or £400 which passes on to his wife and children as being their only means of existence, with no cover whatever once the insurance policy is expended, surely it is essential that we should endeavour to make provision for such a situation with the utmost expedition.  Deputy Mulcahy says, wait until the comprehensive Bill comes along and discuss the matter then.  What is the purpose of delay in providing cover for widows and orphan children?  I can see only one reason, that is, that as they have suffered all along, they should go on suffering for another while until this House can make up its mind what is a comprehensive National Health Insurance Bill.  In my view, every development of national health insurance that takes in a greater number of <Col N="2512" /> people and provides the cover contained in this Bill for widows and orphans is a desirable social development. We are living in an age in which only the very wealthy can make provision for themselves.  The ordinary wage earner or salary earner has to rely on the resources of the State.  He is incapable of making adequate provision and it is only by a nation-wide insurance such as is contained in the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act that it is possible to give the contributors under those Acts the cover that is at present provided for them.  If I had time and had a blackboard and chalk here I would convince any intelligent person&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that even to get cover for widows' and orphans' pension purposes it is worth his while to pay the entire contribution for widows' and orphans' pension and the entire national health insurance contribution, the employer's and the employee's.  I claim that I have convinced a considerable number of people who went out of the national health insurances scheme when they earned a salary in excess of £250 per annum that it is good business for them to pay the entire national health insurance contribution, which must be paid if they are to become voluntary contributors under the Act, and thus get cover for widows' and orphans' pension purposes.</P>
      <P>Let any member of the House go into any insurance company's office in Dublin to-morrow and announce that he is prepared to pay, say, 1/6 a week, that he is 50 years of age and that he wants to take out a policy which will give his wife 10/- per week when he dies, the first child 5/- per week and each other child 3/- per week, with a 50 per cent. supplementary allowance on those figures, and find out what the insurance company will quote him.  No insurance company would dream of accepting a premium of that kind to provide such cover, and without any medical examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because I know it is of advantage to the insured person and gives <Col N="2513" /> him cover that he could not otherwise get from an insurance company at that premium that I advocate the amendment so strenuously.  I am concerned in the matter all the time for the welfare of the widow who, having no income of her own, has to depend on the provision her husband has made for her.  I am concerned for the young children who are helpless and who cannot influence the father's investments. These are helpless people.  They depend on the wisdom and the affluence of the father for what they get when he dies.  Therefore, I want to try to make provision for them and I appeal to all the members of the House who want to provide for them to vote for the amendment.  If they do, I do not think they will ever have any reason to regret it, because I know that many orphans and widows in future will get a national cover against widowhood and orphanhood.  They will not get it if this amendment is not carried.</P>

      <P>Might I ask then whether in respect of bringing people in here compulsorily the Minister would consider bringing in an amendment that would enable people &mdash; no matter what their income is&mdash;to come in voluntarily in respect of national health insurance?  Put a limit if you like, but I think the limit might be left out.  I suggest as a temporary measure, for the purpose of carrying through on the present scheme of national insurance until we get a more comprehensive one, that that would provide a fairer and more equitable way for people who wanted and <Col N="2514" /> who desired such facilities as are in this Bill to make provision either for themselves for health benefit or for their widows and orphans.  An additional compulsion up to as high a level as £500 in respect of a scheme that we are only hatching at the present time is unsatisfactory.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy's scheme sounds very well but he is leaving out the consideration of what would happen the employer's contribution and, besides that, it does not meet the case where a man is inclined to be improvident.  Deputy Norton spoke very truly when he said that this would provide a safeguard to people who cannot at the present moment get it as cheaply and it does provide a safeguard where the breadwinner is not as provident as he should be and where the wife and children have no protection. I cannot see why Deputy Mulcahy should make so much of the fact that this is only a temporary expedient. Even if it is, and even if we could hope that the next 12 months would see a fully comprehensive scheme introduced, would it not be as well in the meantime, now that the opportunity does present itself, to cover as many people as we can reasonably persuade the Minister to include?  I cannot see that it is a really serious argument and, without venturing into controversial matters, I would like to remind Deputy Mulcahy that it has very frequently been stated in this House that the purchasing power of the £ now is only equivalent to 10/- pre-war and when the ceiling pre-war was £250 surely there is an additional argument to include £500 now.</P>

      <P>Nobody is arguing against the merits at all.  It is only a question of the proper way to do it and <Col N="2515" /> one of the things that makes me suspicious about it is the Minister's willingness to accept it without having an opportunity of having it examined from an actuarial point of view.  I happen to know a little about the National Health Insurance Society over a long number of years and mind you, if they jumped to taking in an additional 15,000 people overnight after, we assume, prolonged investigation and consideration before they came down to this £400, I think there is something in it.  I would like the Minister to state here, for the benefit of the House, if Deputy Norton's amendment is passed, how many widows of the people who will be brought in under that amendment compulsorily will benefit within the next six or 12 months.  I would like the Minister to answer that, as I say, for the information of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I look on this as a very simple matter.  I can see that £500 now is only the equivalent of £250 then and that if £250 was the ceiling pre-war, there seems to be no valid reason why we should not make this alteration. I do not quite agree with Deputy Morrissey that because the Minister has hastily and hurriedly and without very much consultation, apparently, adopted this change or agreed to this amendment there is a catch in it or that there is something wrong with it.  The Minister and the Minister's Department are not infallible.  I think they have frequently made mistakes and that they have frequently changed their minds before.  The fact that they have changed their minds in this matter does not mean that they are trying to put over in this House something which is wrong or that they are trying to fool Deputies in some way or another.  I have in mind a particular case of a young married man with a large family who died rather suddenly and who had made a fair provision for himself, to the extent that he had insured his life for £1,000.  I found on looking into the matter that the widow was not entitled to a contributory pension, and I found on investigating the matter that £1,000 was a comparatively <Col N="2516" /> small sum for a widow with a large family and with no housing accommodation of any kind.  The house that she occupied was only rented by reason of her husband's occupation.  She had, therefore, to seek housing accommodation and to seek to support her family on an entire capital sum of £1,000.  I think that cases will arise in connection with people who have over £400 and under £500 income and, I think, looking on the matter, that there is a sound case for raising the ceiling to £500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true, of course.  I agree with what Deputy Cogan said that the fact that I may change my mind does not mean that there is any catch in it.  When I was considering this Bill it was a question of putting in £350, £400 or £500 and there were arguments in favour of as low as £350 and arguments in favour of £500 but on the whole, as I explained on the Second Reading, I took what I considered to be the equivalent to the 1939 figure, that is with the rise in wages. That is, that the average rise of a £5 wage in 1939 is up to about £8 now. That is why I decided on these amounts.  You can look at it from another point of view.  If a pound was worth so much in the thirties, what is it worth now?  You might not arrive at any different position.  It is really a matter of opinion &mdash; individual opinion.</P>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey asked how many would come in within the next six or 12 months.  Probably not very many. It takes three years to qualify for a widow's pension.  The only thing I may put as a counter-argument to Deputy Morrissey is that they will be in sooner.  I do not want the House to be under a false impression as to what I said to the Ceann Comhairle, that Deputy Morrissey or Deputy Norton could argue that the Exchequer is not liable under Section 17 to contribute. Now the Exchequer will contribute. That is an argument that could be used, but, in fact, the Exchequer will contribute the two-ninths.</P>

We have no intention of voting against the amendment.  I may have in some way conveyed that I was doubting the Minister's honesty in this matter.  I have no doubt at all about that, but one is inclined, after a little experience here, to be a bit suspicious as to whether a particular proposal will work out in the way the House hopes, if the Minister is willing to accept it. Deputy Mulcahy and myself indicated that we were not opposed to the amendment on its merits; we merely questioned whether it was wise to do it in this patch-work way and so hurriedly.</P>

That situation cannot be remedied unless in one way, and that is by the Minister stepping up the administration grant.  I am sure the Minister does not desire the society to be operated on the basis of under-paying those engaged in such valuable national work.

      <P>This Bill arises out of a recommendation made by a committee which was set up after a discussion on a Supplementary Estimate.  The committee considered the question of making awards of medals, certificates, etc., to people who performed acts of bravery.  That committee expressed a wish that the whole scheme might be placed on a statutory basis.  I move:</P>

This was an informal committee set up following the passing of the Supplementary Estimate.  When that committee came together, it was felt that the whole business should be put on a statutory basis.  Consequently we have this little Bill.  At the time the Estimate was before the House, there was a general demand that there should be some power to make an award of compensation in the case of persons who lost personal property as a result of, say, immersion in a river in attempting to save life.  Deputy Dillon made some rather amusing observations on the matter at that <Col N="2521" /> time and I opposed it myself but, on reconsideration, the Government agreed that we should make some provision for compensation in certain cases where the Minister for Finance is satisfied that such an award is desirable. This Bill makes provision for that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>At this hour of the day I have very little sympathy with the idea of setting out in the forefront of the Bill a description of bravery such as appears in it.  I feel that it belongs to a type of civilisation other than ours.  I feel that at this hour of the day the civilisation to which we have been used for years is breaking down because deeds of bravery cannot sustain it.  The world is looking deeper into what are the sources of bravery and fortitude.  I have no great sympathy with the proposal. I think that people should be allowed to be brave as a piece of ordinary civic duty, and that if they have to get recognition, their local council might very well thank them for it.  At any rate, I do not sympathise very much with the general idea of the Bill, and I think that the whole idea, if there is an idea in it, falls down on the machinery of the Bill.  If the idea is that people who distinguish themselves by acts of physical bravery are to get recognition in a national way, and if we are to have a Presidential office at all, I feel that the President, as the national father of the State, ought to appear on it in some kind of way.  If he has to have some kind of body to consult, to know whether he is suitably acting in matters of this kind, I do not see why it should be necessary to bring the Lord Mayors of Cork and Dublin, the Chairman of the General Council of County Councils and the Chairman of the Red Cross Society together for that purpose.  The President has a body associated with him that is not overworked, that as a consultative council in this particular matter might be quite as representative a council as the rather heterogeneous council that is mentioned here.  I refer to the Council of State.  I feel that assuming that a particular type of recognition is to be given as a national <Col N="2522" /> matter to deeds of physical bravery, the President ought to appear some way in it, and I do not think it necessary to get a kind of scratch team together in this way to act as a body to help them.  I would recommend seriously to the Minister that, if there is to be a body to consider this matter at all and if the President is to appear in it, the Council of State might give him all the advice and assistance he might want without setting up a special bravery committee in the way in which Section 2 proposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped that the Minister would have given us more information as to the intentions of the Bill other than that contained in the printed particulars.  For a number of years I have taken a very active interest in instances of bravery brought to my notice and I followed that up, in due course, by making representations to the Royal Humane Society. I should like at this stage to pay tribute to the very sympathetic manner in which these matters were dealt with by the society, as a result of which parchments and certificates of merit were forwarded to the Dublin Corporation at the various monthly meetings for presentation.  At some of these monthly meetings, we had eight, nine or ten cases of various acts of personal heroism.  Having attended a couple of meetings of this provisional committee, in my capacity as Lord Mayor, I am not impressed by the fact that it is intended to take up cases which have been already dealt with in the way I have referred to, because I have heard the view expressed&mdash;and I hope I may be wrong in my interpretation of these opinions&mdash;that it is intended only to deal with major cases of bravery.  If that is so it is a rather drastic decision and I should like to get from the Minister some further explanation of the expression &ldquo;deed of bravery&rdquo; which in the Bill is defined as &ldquo;an effort to save human life involving personal risk.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have daily experiences of instances where many of our citizens risk their lives in trying to save the lives of others.  I should like to know from the Minister whether it is <Col N="2523" /> intended to deal with such cases under this Bill and under the machinery that is to be set up, in the same way as they have been dealt with in the past. Another point that should be considered has reference as to the form of the trophy.  I have seen some specimens of the trophies submitted to the new council.  I am not opposing their adoption from the point of view that the inscriptions are made in the Irish language, but I feel that if you want to encourage a spirit of good citizenship, these trophies, when they are exhibited on the wall of a house, should have something on them to indicate their meaning.  Families, as a rule, cherish any trophy of that kind; they look upon it as a recognition of deeds of bravery performed by some member of the family.  They feel that their meaning should be clear and that there should be no necessity for anyone to ask them any questions as to what they really mean.  I have seen some of these trophies.  They have just a few words of Irish on them which I unfortunately do not understand and which, I believe, only a very intellectual Irish scholar would know.  I suggest that the trophies should have a bilingual inscription so as to let people know what they meant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Where it is a question of a person risking his or her life in order to save the life of another person, it is something which should get recognition and should get recognition in a very definite way.  One of the most common forms of that here is the case of people risking their own lives in an attempt to save other people from drowning.  We have numerous cases of that in Dublin, both as regards the Liffey and the canals.  In very many cases, the person who risks his life by jumping into the Liffey to save the life of somebody in danger, or into a canal to save a child, very often destroys the only suit of clothes he may have.  Will there be any machinery to replace that suit of clothes other than going around with a hat?  We ought to do away with going around with the hat.  It seems to me that one thing would be laughing at the other, if that person is to get a medal, a parchment or a trophy, while <Col N="2524" /> his suit of clothes is replaced by going around with the hat.  If money is to be paid by the State, the man whose one suit of clothes is destroyed cannot afford to wait for the ordinary red tape methods.</P>
      <P>Further, I should like to know if it is intended that this scheme will replace the activities of the Royal Humane Society?  Are we to take it that, when this Bill becomes law, the activities of that society in this State will cease, or are they to continue to operate?  That is a point on which we should like some information and, if the Minister is in a position to give it, we should be glad if he would do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the Bill to prevent the Royal Humane Society from continuing its activities, if they wish to do so.  Representations were made by Deputies at different times that there should be some Irish recognition of acts of the same kind as those recognised for years by the Royal Humane Society, but if that society wishes to carry on, I do not think anyone will interfere with them. Section 5 provides for compensation in respect of loss of clothing or effects of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Doyle, I left it completely in the discretion of the council. I think it was Deputy O'Sullivan who was Lord Mayor at the time, and they were very keen on getting the Minister out of this matter altogether and on leaving the council free to make the awards&mdash;apart, of course, from the monetary awards in which the Government would have to have some say. They felt that what was a major act of bravery or a minor act was a matter to be settled by them.  I expressed my personal view when speaking on the Estimate.  I did not like the idea, on the few occasions on which I had to present medals, of having to give any man a bronze medal, when another man was coming up for a gold medal, but I imagine that is what they intend to do.  I have left them free to make <Col N="2525" /> their own decisions and I think that was the wisest thing to do.  They probably would not act, if they were to be told by any Minister what they were to do.</P>
      <P>The matter of the Council of State was discussed on the Estimate, and Deputy Dillon thought, as Deputy Mulcahy now seems to think, that this would be a proper activity for that body.  The reply I made them is the same as the reply I make now.  The Council of State was set up for a particular purpose under the Constitution, and to ask them to do this work would be asking them to do something they were never intended to do.  On the other hand, the council we have here could not, I think, be more representative. The council will consist of the Ceann Comhairle for the time being, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, the Lord Mayor of Dublin and the Lord Mayor of Cork, the Chairman of the General Council of County Councils, and of the Irish Red Cross Society, and the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>I do not think it would be possible to get a more representative council, and, if I had thought that any council we might propose would wish to be put on a statutory basis, I would have waited until I had the Bill before bringing in the Estimate.  It was only at the unanimous request of the council that I brought the Bill in.  I feel rather like Deputy Mulcahy about deeds of bravery.  I do not like this kind of thing myself, but the majority of people do.  They like to hand these trophies down to their descendants, and there is no reason, when people feel that way about it, that they should not have them and why we should not have an Irish decoration, as well as an English decoration.  Let them get both, if they wish.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>When we left this matter yesterday, I was putting it to the Taoiseach that he must realise now that every Party in the House is against the proposal in the measure.  I asked him whether he would consider that between then and now, with a view to seeing whether the Bill should not be withdrawn and the case before the courts dealt with in the manner in which, I understand, it is at present being dealt with, that is, that there is a motion before the courts asking to have the case dismissed on grounds of non-prosecution. When we consider the nature of the measure before us and what is involved in it we must say that, not only is the general proposal a contentious one which is opposed from every side of the House except the Government Party, but it is of a kind, as we saw last night, that could lead to the expression, possibly in an acrimonious way, of opinions and differences that at the present moment could not help this House to achieve anything with regard to the problem that this Bill suggests or to deal in any way with the important matters that the House requires to deal with.  Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13, in Committee, could each give rise to a very long and possibly very acrimonious discussion that would bring in all kinds of intangible <Col N="2527" /> matters about which there could not be any agreement, about which opinions would be expressed that would introduce an utter lack of harmony and very considerable conflict between personalities in the House, that would disturb the whole atmosphere in the House for dealing with the vital problems that are in front of us.  Everybody realises, if it were only after the discussion we had on the agricultural situation last night, that very serious problems exist for this House in relation to matters that confront the country and that, apart altogether from the immediate problem created by the weather and spring agricultural work, in matters of trade and finance and in various international matters there are very serious problems affecting perhaps the whole well-being and sound economic existence of our people.  There never was a time in the whole of our history when it was more important that there should be no conflict of personality or no conflict of opinion in the House that would prevent us bringing our minds to bear in a co-operative and harmonious way on the problems before us.</P>
      <P>It must be clear to the Taoiseach, from the opinions expressed in this House last night, that the Dáil is anxious to do its own work and feels the courts ought to be allowed to do their work.  I wish to express no opinion on the merits of the claimants in the case before the court at the present moment, but I feel there is no way out of the present situation except to allow the courts to decide upon the matter that is at issue before them now. I think it would be better for the future political and economic well-being of this country that the courts should decide even wrongly in that matter than that we here should prevent ourselves from doing our own work because we wanted to argue matters that at the present moment are arguable before the courts.  It would be a negation of the law that we would take the law into our own hands and, by a majority decision, determine that a case should be taken out of the courts and that we should decide a case that was a matter of law, in this House, by a majority decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2528" /> However, the Taoiseach is perfectly well able to appreciate what that position is as far as the opinion of the House is concerned and where the implications of squashing by Parliamentary majority a case that is already in the court might lead.  I would ask him fully to consider the matter and to change his whole attitude with regard to these particular proposals.  At this stage, in view of the fact that I hope the Taoiseach will change his mind with regard to his approach to this matter, I do not wish to discuss in any detail the proposals that are involved in the Bill but I feel that to press this Bill against the unanimous wish, apparently, of the other Parties in the House, would be to do a serious political disservice to the country at the present moment and, perhaps, very serious economic disservice in very difficult days.  I plead with the Taoiseach to realise the attitude of the House on this matter, to take that into consideration and not to press the House to divide on this Bill.</P>

      <P>Oh, no.  I will read what the Deputy said, as far as I have it here:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I think that is regrettable, if some consulation might have avoided that.  I think anybody with any connection with that matter in the past or having any connection with the law, must agree that the courts could not arrive at a settlement of any satisfactory kind in a case of this particular nature and that any court action simply meant frittering away money.  It is regrettable that money has been frittered away in legal costs since 1922 when the matter could have been decided in a sensible way <Col N="2529" /> and some decision come to without giving the courts an expensive job which they could not be expected to do.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will appreciate that I could not mean that the courts could not decide that a particular claimant was not entitled to the money but that, if asked to say how the money could be disposed of, the courts could not come to a conclusion as to how the moneys could be disposed of, that if these moneys are going to be disposed of in any particular way, it must be by consultation with people that were involved in the matter and the making of a suggestion that would enable the courts to agree that they saw no objection to that being done. But I do not think that the Taoiseach can interpret my remarks as meaning that I do not think the courts competent to decide that a particular claimant is or is not entitled to the moneys.  I did not wish to convey any suggestion of that particular kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the form in which it is here in the official record it does contain a fundamental truth.  I will come to that a bit later.  I want to repeat to the House that I did not take the initiative in this.  The moneys had lain there since 1924.  Any organisation that felt it had a claim, including the present organisation claiming, could have made a case before the court if they felt they were entitled, over that long period.  They did not do so.  I did not feel, from the public point of view, that we were compelled to do so either, until the death of the surviving trustee brought the matter, through the executor of that trustee, to my attention, and he suggested that this matter should be cleared up.  My approach to it was this: These funds <Col N="2530" /> have been lying there for nearly a quarter of a century&mdash;almost a generation&mdash; and, if they are going to be disposed of, it is better that they should be disposed of, if possible by agreement, by the people who were immediately concerned with their collection and who knew precisely what they were collected for.  I felt that there was no point anyhow in not going ahead, mainly because this generation knew what the funds were collected for and that they would be able to dispose of them in a manner which would be consonant with the purpose which the subscribers had in mind.  I was asked to bring in legislation and deal with it.  I think I pointed out at the time that I regretted the matter had arisen but, as it had arisen, that we were prepared to do it, at least that I was prepared to recommend to the Government that it be done, but that the first thing that should be done would be to get in touch with the existing officers of the organisation who were the governing body at the time and who were entitled as long as the funds were there to dispose of them.  They had been handling the funds of the organisation from one Ard Fheis to another and they could have used them any particular way they wanted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of historical interest, after the signing of the Treaty&mdash;some time in December, 1921&mdash;there was a meeting of the standing committee, and on the proposal of, I think, the late Arthur Griffith and Michael Collins I was unanimously chosen as trustee.  There had been two trustees in the organisation at that particular period.  There had been two treasurers, but there was no trustee and, in view of the possibility of a difference of opinion, I was chosen, at that particular time, as the sole trustee.  One of the treasurers&mdash;Mrs. Wyse Power&mdash; approached me, probably at a subsequent meeting, and asked me did I wish to have steps taken to transfer the property of the organisation to my name.  As I had hoped that the organisation would be able to find some way of keeping together, I did not wish to take any action that would seem to indicate any pressure or any particular desire to get control of the funds as trustee, and I said there was no <Col N="2531" /> hurry about it.  There were two meetings of the Ard Fheis of Sinn Féin at that particular time.  One held in February was adjourned to a date in May.  At these two Ard Fheiseanna an effort was made to keep the organisation together, ending up in the Pact which meant that the organisation was the organisation that contested the then General Election.  I do not know if it paid the expenses of both sides in that particular election but, at any rate, the organisation had not divided. The organisation only could be regarded as having divided and gone different ways when the Civil War started.</P>
    <P>I believe that we have a duty to the people who subscribed that money.  I believe that in particular I have a personal duty, apart from anything else, to try to see, first of all, that the trust be defended, although I am not making any claim as a trustee in virtue of the decision that was taken at that time, and that the national moneys that were subscribed be not wasted. That has been my attitude towards it. The executor of the late Mrs. Wyse Power, Judge Wyse Power, went to meet the various people who were still alive, and when you look through the names you see how very few are now alive.  He went to those people, urged them that they should come to a meeting with me, that we should sit down and try to arrive at some scheme so that I would be in a position in coming to the Dáil to give a scheme agreed upon by the surviving members of the executive of the organisation which at that particular time controlled the funds.  As I told the Dáil already, there was only one dissentient to coming together and trying to work out some sort of a settlement.  I believe that dissentient was interviewed later and I do not know to what extent he was willing to waive the opinions which he had at the beginning but, at any rate, at that particular stage a plenary summons was served on Judge Wyse Power and on the Attorney-General, clearly served because it was known&mdash;the matter having been spoken of&mdash;that these consultations were taking place and that legislation was contemplated.</P>
    <P>For over 20 years any organisation <Col N="2532" /> that claimed it had a right to these funds could have made that claim in court at any particular time.  They did not do it until there was a suggestion of disposing of the funds by legislation in a way that might accord with the original intention of the subscribers.  When I heard that, I said all right, let them go to the courts.  We waited for three years, during which time a considerable amount of money was spent by the defendants in preparing to meet that case, so that these moneys would not go to a source where it was considered they did not belong.  When I heard quite recently that the bill of the defendants had already gone up to something like £5,000, I asked myself: &ldquo;How long more will this continue and what will be left?  Are we going to have the old thing that where money is disputed the whole money goes in legal costs?&rdquo; The Attorney-General and the other defendant brought a motion for dismissal of the action unless the plaintiffs came for trial.  When they were thus compelled&mdash;and only when they were compelled by the action of the defence, who had, as I have already said, gone to considerable expense in preparing their case to defend the fund&mdash;what happened?  They found that their solicitor, who had not been paid, refused to hand over the documents to another solicitor.  Then we had an action brought into the court to get these documents from the former solicitor and the judge dismissed it. He would not give them the order they required and then they appealed to the Supreme Court.  Anybody who has had any experience at all of cases of that kind, where defence moneys can be got out of the fund itself, knows that there is no real incentive on the part of either side to bring these proceedings to a close.</P>
    <P>Every conceivable type of motion is brought forward by one side or the other in order to try to meet the case against them at a particular time.  I considered that if there was over £5,000 spent before the matter came to trial in the first instance how much more of it was going to be spent by the time they would be finished in court with all these cases.  My own belief <Col N="2533" /> is that the court would settle this thing, if it could, by directing that these moneys be returned to the original subscribers as being the simplest and the most just way of doing it.  But it is obvious that that cannot be done. There is no chance of finding out who the subscribers to that fund were.  It was portion of a general fund and you probably could not get a list of the subscribers at that particular time, so that the device of returning the moneys to the subscribers is out of the question.  But, of course, it is open to a court that would be considering matters of this sort.  They would say, probably, &ldquo;Well, what about applying it to some purpose which was common to the parties who were in the original organisation and who afterwards split away from it?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I tried for a number of years, from 1924, to get agreement between the various parties who could be regarded as having an interest in these funds at the time they were subscribed, to get them to agree to apply them to some purpose which was common to the various parties.  The one obvious thing that was in common and that remained in common all the time was the restoration of the language&mdash;the steps to be taken for the restoration of the language and help for the language movement. I failed during that particular time, and others who were trying it independently of me failed, to get that agreement.  The position held by some was that these funds should be at the disposal of some particular organisation, some particular body.</P>
    <P>It has been said that there is something unconstitutional in what we are doing.  I have heard nobody trying to make a case as to the grounds on which our action is unconstitutional.  I take it that this Parliament is sovereign and can make the law and that the duty of the courts is to interpret the law.  We are sovereign except in so far as we are expressly forbidden to do certain things by the Constitution, and it is essential to show that we are doing something which is repugnant to the Constitution before it can be said we are acting unconstitutionally.  If it should happen, through some misunderstanding or oversight, that the <Col N="2534" /> Oireachtas did do something which was, in fact, unconstitutional, then it would be held to be null and void to that extent by the Supreme Court if the matter were brought to the Supreme Court's attention.  So we cannot, in fact, act unconstitutionally if the matter is brought to the attention of the courts.  The Supreme Court is there to decide matters of that particular kind.</P>
    <P>It has not been brought to my attention in any way that what we are doing is unconstitutional.  In fact, in the opposite direction, any opinions given to me have been given in the sense that I have indicated, that there is nothing unconstitutional in this.  If somebody on the opposite side says there is, then I say it can be tested in the ordinary way in which unconstitutionality in Acts of the Legislature is tested.  We cannot, therefore, be doing anything that is unconstitutional&mdash;I mean, we cannot do it effectively.</P>
    <P>On the question of what is the court that should try this particular issue, I said a few moments ago that there was a fundamental truth in what Deputy Mulcahy said before this developed on the particular lines upon which it has developed&mdash;that there was a fundamental truth in what Deputy Mulcahy said on First Reading and that was that there is something more in this question than the mere legal question of continuity, something very much more. I feel perfectly confident that if the courts should on some legal technicality decide that the body that claims these funds should get them, everybody in the country would say: &ldquo;They may have decided on the legal technicality, but fundamentally they are acting unreally, that it is an unreal decision, divorced from the circumstances that then obtained and divorced from the circumstances that obtain now.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>All right.  The real position is this, that these moneys are not the property of the people who claim them; they were never in their hands.  These moneys belonged to the organisation up to the early portion of 1922.  These are the moneys that the old organisation of Sinn Féin collected from the people of Ireland to carry out the national purpose at that time, and if you read the Sinn Féin Constitution of 1917, as it was amended in 1921, you will see what the purposes were at that particular time.  You will see, so far as this part of Ireland is concerned, these purposes could not be regarded as purposes which would be the object of an organisation at the present time.  It is quite obvious they could not be.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knew perfectly well that a defendant in a case of this kind, unless he admitted, and unless he was to be taken as admitting, the claim of the plaintiffs, would have to deny their claim, and deny it in whatever terms he thought were <Col N="2536" /> going to be best, because of something which is a legal technicality.  He says that, of course, was my attitude.  What happens is that when a lawyer has put in a defence in a case like that, if he is not going to be taken as accepting the claims of the plaintiff, he has to controvert them so that they may be tried by a court.  No other course was open to the Attorney-General but to deny the claim in the way in which he did.</P>
      <P>Coming back now to the situation as it was, these moneys belonged to a national revolutionary organisation. Before Dáil Éireann was set up Sinn Féin was organised with a view to having some central body which could be regarded as the council of the nation.  These moneys were subscribed at that particular time and over that particular period to enable that body to function in so far as it could function. When Dáil Éireann was established the need for such a council disappeared, but up to that time that council was the civil arm just as the Irish Volunteers were the military arm of the organised nation.  If ever there were funds that belonged to the nation and not to a mere political Party, then these funds are they.  Deputy Mulcahy, apparently unconsciously, was right in saying that the ordinary courts were not the courts to try this.  I say that this is a very much better court than the ordinary courts to try this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Dáil Éireann.  I say that Dáil Éireann is in fact much more entitled to be regarded as the successor of that organisation, whatever might be said in law, and to the equitable rights in these moneys.  That is my own view.  Sinn Féin was intended at the time to be a substitute for a national Parliament.  When the national Parliament was set up that national Parliament became the civil arm of the nation and these funds in <Col N="2537" /> my opinion were subscribed with the intention and for the purpose of establishing that national Parliament.  To say that an insignificant little group, no matter what technical grounds they may put forward, could be regarded as entitled to the possession of these national funds is just absurd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could not the courts be permitted to say so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They might.  They were being permitted to say so until we reached the point where these moneys were in danger of being frittered away. The defence in order to protect the funds had necessarily to incur expenses to meet this case.  Were we to permit that to continue?  I do not think it would be right that we should do so. I think this House is entitled to take these national moneys and to dispose of them.  They are undoubtedly national moneys in the broadest sense. They have lain there now for practically a quarter of a century.  Most of the people who during that time might have been entitled to dispose of them have since died.  Judge Wyse Power had a consultation with them four or five years ago and four or five of those who were then left have since died.  I can see no wrong precedent being established in our doing this.  These funds are in a unique position.  There is no question of denying the rights of the courts in this matter.  There is no question of setting up what might be regarded as a wrong precedent.  We are perfectly within our rights in doing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disposal of these funds is another matter.  When I was introducing this Bill first, I said that I was not wedded to the method by which they were being disposed of; in fact, I myself made some objections to the scheme similar to the objections which were advanced here subsequently by some of the Opposition.  I always think that money distributed in this particular way is not distributed perhaps in the best possible way.  It is extremely difficult to arrange for the distribution of moneys in a proper way under such a scheme. But this scheme was put up to me and this was a scheme of which a large number of people approved&mdash;members <Col N="2538" /> of the old executive&mdash;and which they were prepared to support.  That being the case, even though I was not particularly pleased with the method of its distribution, I agreed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the disposal of these moneys, I do not think it is unreasonable that they should be used to help some of those who suffered to establish our independence.  On various occasions here we have tried to meet cases of hardship by various Acts. Legislation of this particular kind must always be very general in its nature and it is not always possible under such legislation to meet particular types of cases.  Added to that difficulty, you have the further one that large numbers will make application who do not really come within any of the specified categories.  To do benevolent work of this kind, you must have some group or nucleus prepared to examine these applications and to go into the question of meeting requests for assistance.  Such assistance must only be given to those who are obviously in need and obviously entitled to it under the particular terms of reference.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies say that this is a poor way to meet particular cases of hardship.  It may be a poor way, but, to the extent to which it is a help, it is a help if it is administered properly. I myself know of a case of two sisters. Their brother was out in 1916 and he was killed in action at that time.  They are in very needy circumstances. Under a fund of this particular kind it might be possible to give them some assistance and in my opinion that is the particular type of case which should be met.  I know of the mother of a man who was out in 1916 and who subsequently played his part and later lost his life.  She needs attention, both medical and otherwise.  She is in very needy circumstances.  I think hers is a case which should receive attention and help from the board that it is proposed to establish under this Bill.  The trouble is, as was pointed out by an Opposition Deputy, once a fund of this kind gets publicity, applications pour in from all sorts of people who think they come within the terms of reference.  The necessity, therefore, <Col N="2539" /> arises of having to set up some kind of offices to have these cases examined&mdash; somewhat in the same way as examinations were carried out by the Military Service Pensions Board, for example. That, of course, may mean wasting money, too, and it was for that reason that I myself was not altogether happy about this particular method of distribution. If the matter lay solely in my hands, I would like to see this fund applied for some national purpose in which the administrative costs would be practically nil.  With the exception of those who spoke of &ldquo;confiscation&rdquo; and so on, the only difference apparently between us now is whether it is opportune to bring in this Bill at this particular moment or whether we should wait till the court acts. How long would we wait?  Remember that at any time that you could come in, the same argument will be put up, that you should not interfere with the courts at any stage whatever, no matter what motions are being brought in.  I do not believe that the people who are looking for these funds have any hope whatever&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows full well that he is only trying to make the case that there has not been a formal decision.  We know that a decision has not been taken, but we do know enough of the attitude of the court to realise that if the Attorney-General or the other defendant have ever to show that it is necessary for them to meet any possible pleas that might be put up, and that they had to incur expense, that expense is likely to be allowed to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to look at it from the point of view of what the court is likely to do.  If I might refer again to the statement made by Deputy Mulcahy, he said that we were negligent in not taking action before this and preventing a waste of money from an earlier period.  The Government stepped in only when it was quite obvious that there was no determination on the part of these people to seek the funds in a positive way and that their attitude of mind was going to be that they did not care what expense the Attorney-General would be put to so long as they could keep the case going and prevent a decision.</P>
      <P>So far as the question of the court to decide this matter is concerned, I have said that I believe this is the court. If it is suggested that there are Deputies here who are voting against this proposal, that is not an unusual thing.  It is not unusual when the Government brings in a motion to find the Opposition combining as one to oppose it.  I take it that we stand here on the basis that this is the National Assembly and that decisions are made here by a majority vote; the Government are in the majority by virtue of being elected to this House by the people in a majority, and they represent the will of the people in the majority.  As long as they are here, they must be taken as representing the people's will.  I believe these are national funds and I believe that it is this House, and not the court, that will decide what is to become of these national funds.  I believe that this House has a perfect right by a majority, no matter how that majority is composed, to come to a decision on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose then to let this matter be decided by the House, so far as the Second Reading is concerned.  After the Second Reading is through, on. Committee Stage, if any suggestions can be put forward as to how a committee of this House can be got together to give advice as to a better way of spending these national funds, I shall be heartily in agreement with <Col N="2542" /> such a procedure.  I am very anxious that these funds should be treated as national funds, that they should not be frittered away, and that they should be applied for some national purpose.  One way would be to devote them to some of the national purposes held in common by the various parties into which the Sinn Féin organisation of that day has been split up.  Another way that has been suggested is to use the funds to help what might be called the wounded soldiers, those who have been injured in the fight for our independence.  With regard to the suggested benevolent fund, it has been a deep regret to me to see cases like some of those mentioned that we cannot help.  I see no way of helping, except by some form of benevolent fund, although, as I have indicated, I do not think a very big sum would be required to help those who are genuinely in need of help.  I have often wondered, independently of this question, whether we could not get some sort of benevolent fund to deal with these hard cases.  I do think that it is a shame to see the mother of a man, who had been in the fight and lost his life as a result of the national struggle, in the circumstances in which I know one mother to be.  Though I know of only one case, there probably would be others.  I think if we were to establish something in the form of a benevolent fund it would be useful, if we could get a practical way of administering it. That is the trouble with all these funds.</P>
    <P>I was hoping that if these funds could not be disposed of in any better way, they might be disposed of by establishing a benevolent fund of this kind.  I do know, of course, that there might be some difficulty about getting a suitable board.  The chairman is indicated, but the other members of the board are to be appointed. I should like very much if we could get some sort of an agreed board in which we all would have confidence&mdash;confidence in their discretion in regard to safeguarding the funds and only using them in the particular cases where they were absolutely necessary, because the board would have to pursue a very conservative line.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is simply taking up the position that unless we can get agreement in this House, unless we can get the support of the Opposition, we can do nothing.  The majority have rights too, you know, and when we took the view that this was a matter of national importance, that this money should not be frittered away, then I think we have a duty here <Col N="2551" /> to decide that that decision has to be taken in the ordinary way.

      <P>After the expenses that have been incurred there is something more than £15,000 here involved. I think the discussion of Section 10 alone in this House is going to cost the nation much more than £15,000, and if we are thinking of saving national resources, the national resources being £15,000 odd in the Sinn Féin Fund, we ought to think about the other national resources.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Grady)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies opposite have been insisting on a statement of Government policy with regard to drainage.  That statement is very easily made.  It is enshrined in the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, which was based on the Report of the Drainage Commission, 1938-40, paragraph 107 of which states that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All future arterial drainage operations should be conducted on the basis of comprehensive schemes embracing entire river catchment areas and not otherwise&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and it is proposed to implement that policy as speedily as possible.  But we will not be stampeded into ill-considered action, nor forced to take steps which, perhaps, would lead to the condemnation which we have seen in paragraphs 40, 83 and 84 of that report.  In paragraph 40 of the Drainage Commission Report we are told that the Act of 1924, about which strangely enough speakers on the Opposition Benches were discreetly silent, did not achieve the results expected from it.  It had been hoped that all the existing districts requiring overhaul would have been put into good order and handed over to the county councils for future management.  It goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Many complaints have been made to us in the course of oral evidence that the work was done in an arbitrary way without consultation with the local occupiers, that some of the work done was inefficient, that proper supervision and control was not exercised over the labour employed resulting in an uneconomic work and high repayment charges.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In paragraphs 83 and 84 they go on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The outstanding feature of the Arterial Drainage Act in the past is the piecemeal manner in which the work has been planned and carried out,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Act of 1925 did nothing to alter the position.  It continued the haphazard creation of individual districts without consideration of the interests, problems and requirements <Col N="2555" /> of river basins as a whole.  The very method of initiating schemes introduced by the Act by which any six ratepayers could set the machinery of the Act in motion was repugnant to the idea of a planned drainage policy and facilitated piecemeal development.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a thing we want to avoid in the future and that is why the measure passed in 1945 makes it obligatory on the commissioners that all future schemes will be of a comprehensive nature.  At this stage it might be well, perhaps, if we were to outline the procedure necessary under that Act.</P>
    <P>In anticipation of the passing of the Act an engineering and valuation survey of the River Brosna was taken up in August, 1942, embracing an area of 95,000 acres and extending to rivers and tributaries for a total distance of 530 miles.  That survey was completed in July, 1944.  The designing of the scheme was taken in hands and a comprehensive scheme for the entire area was placed on exhibition on the 11th November, 1946.  In accordance with their right some 50 persons have submitted observations which must be considered by the commissioners and any other observations submitted by the local authorities within a period of three months must also be considered in consultation with the Ministers for Industry and Commerce, Agriculture and Local Government.  It may be necessary to amend the scheme in certain respects after that consideration and then the scheme will have to be submitted for the approval of the Minister for Finance.  Added to that a survey of the rivers Glyde and Dee in the Counties of Louth, Meath, Monaghan and Cavan was begun in July, 1944, and was completed in November, 1945, involving a mileage of river and channels of 550 and embracing an area of 27,000 acres.  The designing of the scheme is still in hands and it is hoped to place it on exhibition this year.  As well as that the River Feale&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary make that clear?  The survey work in these counties has been done&mdash;is that what you mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2556" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>No drainage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>No drainage&mdash;certainly not.  As well as that the River Feale, including the Brick and Cashin, is also in hands.  The survey was begun in July, 1945, and ended in August, 1946. There they are confronted with a difficult outfall problem.  At the same time the opportunity was taken by the engineers in the district to survey other smaller areas&mdash;the Maine, the Lee at Tralee, and the Akeragh Lough and Banna.</P>
      <P>The next point with which I would like to deal is the maintenance inasmuch as allegations have been made that the maintenance of existing schemes has been neglected.  The appointed day under the Act was March 31st, 1945, when the drainage rates were abolished in favour of a poor law rate on the county at large.  That, I might mention, relieved a great many of the alleged beneficiaries under the Act of 1925 of the blister that was imposed on them owing to the inadequate provisions of the Act to which Deputy Hughes, in the course of his remarks, referred.  The control and management of these rivers were transferred to the county councils and, in accordance with Section 30 of the Act, the county councils have to submit reports to the Commissioners of Public Works annually.  I have seen these reports and I am satisfied that the maintenance of these rivers is being carried out now in a much more satisfactory way than was ever possible in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the negligence in regard to the Barrow.  Deputy Hughes will be interested in this.  In the year 1945-46 a sum of £7,184 16s. 1d. was expended on maintenance and in the current year 1946-47 a sum of £7,882 has been provided.  With regard to the question of plant and machinery to which various speakers referred, since March, 1943, the Commissioners have been endeavouring to secure machinery adequate for the major problems confronting them, but so far with very little success.  To date they have secured only two medium-sized dredgers but it is hoped to obtain two more fairly soon.  Owing to the Government control in Great Britain where <Col N="2557" /> priority is given to firms engaged in housing, the excavation of coal, and the manufacture of cement and bricks, it will not be possible to obtain supplies of these dredgers before 1948.  The position in the United States is somewhat similar.</P>
    <P>Despite that handicap, however, it is hoped that as soon as the necessary legal formalities have been complied with, operations will be commenced on the Brosna.  As an example of the unnecessary work imposed on the Commissioners under the 1925 Act no fewer than 669 petitions were submitted under that Act and of these only 60 were approved by the occupiers.  The consideration of these petitions involved a considerable amount of unnecessary work on the part of the staff of the Board of Works.  Of these 60 schemes approved by the occupiers 51 have been completed.  In passing, I would say that of these 51 schemes not one of them was completed within the period of office of the previous Government, despite all the allegations that have been made about the delay of their successors in office.</P>
    <P>It is obvious to any impartial observer listening to the debate that when Deputy O'Higgins approached this question of the motion standing in his name, he came to the House unprepared to deal with it and, on looking around, he saw that there was no member of the Party sufficiently interested to enter into the discussion. Then he sought to cajole me by an old Parliamentary trick to step into the breach and carry on the debate until such time as he would be ready. Because I did not do so, Deputy O'Higgins became angry.  He was angry with me because, after six weeks in office, I had not completed the entire drainage of the country.  He was angry with the Government because they kept his Party out of office for 15 years.  He was angry with the people because they did not take him seriously.  Who would take the Deputy seriously if we are to take his remarks, as reported, as a sample of his intelligence?  I shall just quote a few of them.  He told us in the course of his remarks that the previous Government had carried out the <Col N="2558" /> drainage of the largest river in Ireland &mdash;the Barrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary give the reference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall.  If the Deputy will look at column 1461, Volume 104, No. 10, down about the twentieth line, he will find this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Despite all the trouble and turmoil of the times, during their short period they carried out the drainage of the biggest river in Ireland&mdash;the Barrow.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He went on to refer to that portion of the River Shannon at the confluence of the Brosna and the Shannon and said that he had paid a visit to that area.  He added:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I happened to inquire down there how many people had left, how many young people had gone from that immediate area because of the lack of work, because there were no wages and no living for them there.  The number was amazing and it was enough by man-power alone to drain that immense river.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins seriously asserts that whatever the number of men, let it be 100 or 200, they could by man-power alone drain that immense river. Yet, while making a statement of that kind, that a few men like that, without any other assistance, could drain the River Shannon, he wonders why the people are not taking him seriously.  I think the titbit of his remarks, which you will find reported in column 1462, was this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The late Mussolini took over responsibility for Italy many years ago when portion of Italy was suffering from the same disability as we in this island.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He goes on to refer to the magnificent achievement of the great Mussolini in the drainage of the Pontine Marshes.</P>

    <P>I thought it rather intriguing to hear Deputy O'Higgins in a moment of mental aberration falling back on the old ideas, giving an indication of the real mentality of the leaders opposite. He told us, incidentally, that that was the first operation of the great Mussolini. I think his memory is somewhat <Col N="2559" /> defective in that.  My recollection is that the first act of Mussolini's political career was to march on Rome.  If Deputy O'Higgins had been taken seriously some years ago in his efforts to found a similar organisation in this country, probably we would have seen a similar march in this country.</P>
    <P>I think I have said sufficient to indicate that this problem of drainage is one that cannot be solved overnight. Statements were made from the Opposition Benches that my predecessor in office gave the impression in introducing the Bill that the problem was so urgent that we wanted the Bill forthwith and then that, having got the Bill, he did nothing to implement it.  If there was one criticism that could be levelled against my predecessor it was that he had too pessimistic an outlook in regard to drainage.  In my opinion, that was a realistic outlook.  It is very easy to say that you can get all these things done overnight but, as anyone who has experience of drainage knows, unless the drainage scheme is properly planned and executed, your last position is going to be worse than your first.  It is precisely because we do not want to commit the mistakes of our predecessors that we, in future, will be careful to ensure that every drainage scheme will be comprehensive and embrace the entire river catchment area.</P>
    <P>With regard to the allegation of delay which is the obvious inference to be drawn from remarks of Deputies opposite, if any of them is interested enough I have a table which will give the facts in regard to the 1925 Act, the dates of commencement and completion of schemes, and it will be seen that both that Act and the 1924 Act were so defective in their financial provisions as to render the operations under them utterly useless.  I say that it took the Drainage Act of 1945 to remedy that situation and to remove from the shoulders of the unfortunate people who were affected by these Acts, the blister imposed by such financial arrangements.</P>

      <P>I have already informed Deputy Coogan in reply to a Parliamentary question that I am not in a position to state when the drainage of the River Nore in Kilkenny can be undertaken.  A similar question could be put down in respect to every river in Ireland as a result of the unprecedented weather we had recently. Flooding has occurred in nearly every river in this country, and not merely in this country but across Channel and on the Continent of Europe.  I cannot give a categorical answer to the Deputy's question as to the exact date on which the work can be started or anticipate the decisions of the commissioners in this matter.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether I should say that I was astonished by the Parliamentary Secretary's speech because, to be honest, I did not expect much from the Parliamentary Secretary. But one would expect that a man in his position, charged with the responsibility of looking after drainage, under the particular Act to which he referred would deal with the matter in a more constructive way.  The motion before the House in the names of Deputy O'Higgins and myself reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That in view of the extent of flooding throughout the country this year the Dáil expresses its disapproval of the Government's inaction in failing to operate the Arterial Drainage Act passed in March, 1945, and calls for an immediate statement of the Government's policy in the matter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So far as getting information is concerned, we got none from the Parliamentary Secretary.  He merely indulged in abuse and vilification.  He knew that was the only defence he had to a reasonable request from this Party for information as to what was happening in regard to national drainage and what was the Government's policy in regard to it.  If the land of the country were as dry as the Parliamentary Secretary's speech, we would have no drainage problem at all.</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary is utterly callous and disinterested in regard to this whole matter.  His attitude to this reasonable motion was wrong from the very beginning.  When he was asked in a reasonable way by Deputy O'Higgins to speak after me, he refused to do so.  Obviously, on a motion of this kind, the House would be anxious to know what Government policy was so that we could discuss and make suggestions with regard to the policy announced by the Parliamentary Secretary, but the Parliamentary Secretary refused to accommodate the House in any way.  As a matter of fact, it was only with extreme reluctance that he took part in the debate, and we are speaking overtime now because he failed to come in when he should have come in and should have insisted on doing so.</P>

      <P>Before we started this evening.  Instead of dealing with this matter in a constructive way and bending whatever ability he has to giving <Col N="2562" /> useful information to the House, he indulged in abuse of Deputy O'Higgins. Deputy O'Higgins had good reason to feel annoyed, because the Parliamentary Secretary refused to announce, after my introductory remarks, what Government policy was.  The Parliamentary Secretary's technique in the matter was to hold his hand, to withhold information from the House until the last moment.  He is compelled to come in now, and, to accommodate him, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has to grant him overtime.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary indulged in most extraordinary remarks regarding what was done under the 1924 Act.  Whatever was done under that Act was done.  Nothing whatever has been done under the 1945 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary told me a moment ago that no drainage work had yet been done under the 1945 Act.  Survey work could have been done any time within the last 15 years.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows that and he knows that we did not need an Act of Parliamentary to carry out survey work.  It could and should have been carried out any time since the Drainage Commission Report was submitted and, in fact, that report recommended that that work should be carried out.  There is no use in the Parliamentary Secretary attempting to give that type of excuse when the problem is a real one.  Let us realise that we are living in a country which has almost the highest rainfall in the world.  We should lead the world in national drainage policy and technique. I venture to suggest that we have not got an expert on national drainage in the Parliamentary Secretary's Department because they have no practical experience.  We have neglected drainage so much that we have not got a man fully qualified and I am not reflecting on any of the technicians in the Department in saying that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>They got some experience on the Barrow when that scheme <Col N="2563" /> was in operation and the Barrow scheme was practically completed when Fianna Fáil came into power.  There is no use, again, in trying to suggest that nothing was done under the 1924 Act. Whatever was wrong with the 1924 Act &mdash;and no Act that was perfect ever passed this House or any other Parliament&mdash;we ought to appreciate that our ideas ought to improve as we grow older and that the experiences we glean from the operation of Acts ought to be an advantage to this Parliament and the country.  I did not hesitate to refer to what I thought was wrong with the financial provisions because it was not my purpose to make any political capital.  I am more concerned with getting real work done than in trying to make the mean political capital the Parliamentary Secretary indulged in. I have nothing but contempt for that sort of mentality, and it is the reason the country is in the rut it is in to-day, from the point of view of production and better standards for the people.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, as I say, is utterly callous to, and disinterested in, the hardships the people have to suffer.  He referred to the Barrow and the Nore and told us about some of the survey work done.  The Barrow and the Nore flow through the finest land in the country, fine, fertile, arable land, and destruction and erosion are taking place there every day.  We are permitting flood water to destroy valuable assets in the form of arable land, and that is not the greatest damage, because the damage being done to the health of the people is incalculable.  I have witnessed in the last couple of days conditions in the town of Carlow and Leighlinbridge that are appalling. I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary thought it worth his while to go down to Carlow, Leighlinbridge or Kilkenny to inform himself as to what the people were suffering, or does he feel that, now that he is a Parliamentary Secretary, it would be <i>infra dig.</i> for him to go down there to see what the poor people have to put up with and what they are putting up with silently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one can measure the loss which these conditions mean to the country in the matter of the health of the people <Col N="2564" />&mdash;the appalling condition of their homes, left in a slimy, dirty and filthy condition, with sewage matter flowing through the doors.  No one can measure the repercussions which those conditions have on young families.  The attitude of the Parliamentary Secretary, the man charged with responsibility, is that we are not going to be stampeded into ill-considered action. For 15 years, they have done nothing in regard to drainage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not know that there are rivers like the Nore, with which Deputy Coogan and the Minister for Education are concerned at the moment?  The Minister went down there and saw for himself the conditions arising from the events of the past few days.  The Bishop of Kilkenny and the leaders of society have shown extreme concern for the shocking conditions that have occurred there in the last few days.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows well that it is unprecedented. That has occurred, not so much because the weather was unprecedented and the rainfall very heavy, but because the river has been neglected for years.  The bed is silted up.  There is vegetation in the centre of the river.  Trees that have fallen across the river are lying there, blocking the flow.  Then when the heavy rainfall occurred, we are surprised that we have the City of Kilkenny and Thomastown flooded and we are surprised that the same conditions obtain is Carlow and Leighlinbridge, on the Barrow.  The Barrow has been drained as far as Athy and the job was a good one, but does not the Parliamentary Secretary appreciate that the waters are allowed to flood all the quicker on the town of Carlow and Leighlinbridge on the lower reaches?  Does not the Parliamentary Secretary realise that there is valuable land at New Ross which, a few years ago was arable, and <Col N="2565" /> where shows were held, which has been a quagmire for some years past?</P>
      <P>We talk about our resources and the development of the country while we allow valuable assets to disappear. The Parliamentary Secretary sits back and his defence is, we want to avoid in future schemes the mistakes that have occurred in the past.  We must avoid them but I say to the Parliamentary Secretary, so far as the 1945 Act is concerned, of which he is boasting, that it contemplates carrying out the work on a comprehensive basis, an entire catchment area basis and completing the job.  He must amend the Act in order to deal in a temporary way with the real problems that exist and that are causing flooding.  If all the schemes are put on a list and we have to wait until the Barrow and the Nore are reached on the list, the people will have to suffer on for years. Temporary relief must be provided for these people and, if we cannot provide that temporary relief under the present measure&mdash;and I believe we cannot because it provides for a comprehensive scheme on an entire catchment basis &mdash;the Act must be amended.</P>
      <P>One of the most important things that we must do in this House is to push this work forward and to get a very big scheme of national drainage put into operation.  There is no use in doing it river by river on the basis of doing a complete job over a period of possibly 50 years.  That is not good enough.  We are exporting many of our young people.  Great Britain reclaimed 1,000,000 acres during the emergency and brought them into production.</P>

      <P>It includes drainage. There are pictures of it, and I can give the Parliamentary Secretary some of them to look at in his spare time, if he wants them, where it was done by drainage, and by equipment, and by man-power.  Irishmen worked on that job.  Why cannot we keep those men at home and put them into employment to increase the wealth of this country?  We prefer to give them as an asset to Great Britain.  They are a liability on this country while they are being reared and educated and when they become an asset we export them to build up sterling assets that we will never be able to cash.</P>
      <P>That is the policy.  It has been a policy of neglect and the Parliamentary Secretary was not in a position to defend it because, he said, he is only a few months there.  His predecessor was there.  There are any number of rivers in this country that could be relieved to a great extent by manpower alone, without any machinery, and nothing has been done about it. If the Parliamentary Secretary will face up to his job, he will have put before this House immediately a substantial Supplementary Vote for this purpose and let us get on with the work and, if necessary, have the Act amended to provide temporary relief. If the Parliamentary Secretary has any appreciation of the problem he will realise the long period it must take to do the work on a complete catchment area basis and that very acute problems will be put on the long list.  We cannot afford to put these problems on the long list.  The Parliamentary Secretary must face up to his responsibilities and to the realities of the situation.  I feel that the Act must be amended to provide temporary relief.</P>

      <P>Possibly, the Parliamentary Secretary is over-studying the report, and is not giving enough of his attention to the problems.  I give him this bit of advice: having studied it for so long, leave the report aside for a while and get down to the job of relieving the unfortunate people who <Col N="2568" /> have suffered so much and, if you have not the power in the Act, have the Act amended, and get the money that is necessary.  The money cannot be spent to better purpose in the interests of the health and comfort of the people and in the interests of production.  Appalling conditions have been created and in many cases finance has to be provided locally to help the people and to tide them over their difficulties.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not attempted to deny that there has been neglect and that this matter has been put on the long finger.  I hope he will make up his mind here and now to face up to his responsibilities and to get a move on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the basis upon which income is assessed for the purpose of the means test in the case of persons entitled to old age pensions, blind pensions, and widows' and orphans' pensions, requires revision and in particular that in assessing income for such purpose, no cognisance should be taken of (a) gratuities paid to a pensioner by members of his or her family whether in cash or in kind; (b) any benefits received otherwise than in actual cash, and (c) casual moneys earned by the pensioner, and requests the Government to take all necessary steps accordingly.</P>
      <P>In rising to propose this motion on the Order Paper standing in the names of Deputy Costello and myself, I might explain to the House that it is being taken to an extent out of its order on the paper, owing to the illness of one Minister and another Minister being engaged in the Seanad.  I received an amount of documentary information from various organisations interested in the particular groups of pensioners referred to in the motion, but that information is not with me this evening, as I was not aware that this particular motion would be taken this evening.  However, the motion is in itself explanatory.  I submit to the House that this is not an unreasonable request to make at this particular time, in view of the circumstances that exist and the generally admitted situation, which requires a review of every State income, from the smallest salary or the smallest wage, up to the largest salary and the largest wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion which, in effect, deals with only three classes, old age pensioners, blind pensioners and the pensions of widows and orphans, asks Dáil Éireann to express the opinion that it would be advisable to carry out a revision.  It does not make any demand on the Government; it merely requests a re-examination of the conditions of these people in the light of the circumstances that exist to-day. It asks, further, that in the course of <Col N="2570" /> that revision, special attention should be paid to the advisability of not taking into account for the purpose of assessing means (a) moneys paid to the pensioner by members of the pensioner's family, (b) gifts made to the pensioner in kind and not in cash and (c) any casually earned money which the pensioner may earn.</P>
    <P>It is agreed on all sides that in view of the changed economic and financial conditions in this country and the acute spiral in the cost of living it is unreasonable, unjust and unfair to ask even the officer carrying the highest salary in the State to continue to exist on the same salary as he had prewar. It has been stated, rather unexpectedly, in so far as it was completely out of time, by the Minister for Social Services, that he intends to make a proposal to Dáil Éireann to increase these particular pensions by a certain amount.</P>
    <P>This motion is not asking for an increase: it is asking the Government, in revising these pensions schemes, not to dam absolutely and ruthlessly all the wells of charity and all the little streams of assistance that may reach the very poorest people in our midst. It asks them, if a good daughter or son abroad in England sends £1 back now and then to an aged mother or father, £1 hard earned but £1 representing more than 20/-, representing a gesture of love and affection, of gratitude and appreciation for all that aged mother or father did for them, that the pensions officer should not step in and investigate and cut the unfortunate parent's meagre pension because of occasional gifts of that kind.  It asks further, that if some kindly, benevolent neighbour, perhaps an ex-employer, who had that person in his service for perhaps 20, 30 or 40 years, animated with the Christian spirit displayed by a Samaritan, seeing that old age pensioner endeavouring to eke out a meagre existence on his estate, sends to that old age pensioner an occasional bag of potatoes, a bit of butter, a few poultry or fowl, or something to make that old age pensioner's life a little bit more comfortable and a little bit happier, those gifts should not be taken <Col N="2571" /> into account in order to reduce the income allowed to that unfortunate old age pensioner, blind pensioner, or widow.</P>
    <P>It has now been announced as the policy of the Government&mdash;the considered policy which must be carried out as an urgent and imperative measure in view of the existing terrible circumstances&mdash;that they feel compelled to increase the old age pension by the princely sum of 2/6 a week.  Assuming that some ex-employer of some old age pensioner is giving that old age pensioner a few shillings a week&mdash;giving the maximum allowed without reducing the pension&mdash;and that that ex-employer comes to the same conclusion that, in view of the appalling rise in the cost of living, he will increase his little grant to this old retainer by the sum of half a crown, the result under the present system is that the extra half a crown given by the State must be immediately taken away.  That must be done or the person who is helping that aged person to a very slight extent must deny any increase to the individual. I do not think that was intended. I do not think that can be defended. I do not think there is any justification for the State taking into account gifts from a relative in cash or in kind.  It may be and probably will be said that those were the conditions in the old age pension scheme years ago and before the present administration took over.  That argument does not hold water.  That may have been the system years ago but are we never going to improve conditions?  If things were bad in the past are they to remain bad in the future and for all time?  Is there no progress to be made in any direction because of the fact that things were backward years before?  Surely, that is an argument against progress in any direction.  Surely, that is an argument against increased State assistance of any kind or in any direction.</P>
    <P>We all know that the relations between Government and public&mdash;between the Government of a State and the individual citizens of every State&mdash;have changed radically and drastically in the last 20 years and that day by day government in all States is becoming more <Col N="2572" /> and more responsible for services, social and otherwise.  They are becoming responsible for services the responsibility for which now would have been regarded as lunacy in any administration 25 years ago.  All that progress is healthy.  All that progress is good and sound.  All the progress is welcome. Again, it is common sense and sound administration to launch any scheme on strictly rigid lines.  You must find out at the beginning exactly how you stand.  But those rigid lines must be relaxed with time.  That is normal. That is customary.  The argument that the situation was such 15, 20 or 30 years ago is not an argument.  It cannot be defended and it should not be listened to.</P>
    <P>The next point is that it is Dáil Éireann&mdash;the whole of Dáil Éireann&mdash; that votes this money.  It is not voted just by the Government or the Government Party.  It is voted by the people of Ireland and it is the people of Ireland who subscribe the money.  It is subscribed by every taxpayer and not just by those of the Fianna Fáil Party. I say without fear of contradiction that the people of this country, with their big generous Irish hearts, would assent to the request made here and that the people of this country would agree, if it were explained to them and if they had the same knowledge of these particular tests and barriers that we have here, that it is wholly unreasonable that because a son or daughter in England or America sends home some little assistance to the parents above a certain figure that the pension of those parents must then be cut, or the pension of the blind brother or the blind sister, or the pension of the related widow with her orphan children.  That would not be the desire of the people.  It would not be the desire of the taxpayers, rich or poor. It would not be their desire that gifts of any kind&mdash;food, clothes, or cash&mdash; should be taken into account for the purpose of reducing the pension.  The mere fact that the gift is made in kind indicates in itself the necessity for such a form of external assistance.</P>
    <P>The third class referred to in this request for exemption is the class where the opportunity for casual earnings <Col N="2573" /> arises.  Casual earnings of old age pensioners should not be taken into account for the purpose of reducing the pension.  We are living in a country that gradually and progressively is becoming depopulated.  We are living in a country where in the last harvest there was not enough manpower or woman-power to save the harvest without practically disbanding the Army and, to a great extent, the Civil Service, while at the same time urging people to leave their ordinary occupations and avocations in order to lend a hand on the land to save the people's food supply and save the nation from starvation.  To lay it down in such a situation that any old age pensioner who gave a day, or two, or three days now and then as a casual helper in a harvest field or did an odd day out fishing off our coast&mdash;and the population is without fish at a time when volunteers are feeding on our fish and making money out of it&mdash;would lose some few shillings a week off his pension was a travesty of all social justice.</P>
    <P>The request made here is a simple request.  We ask for a revision of this machinery.  I take it that there is a revision being carried out at the moment in every Government Department with regard to all State services.  We ask that a revision be carried out and that in carrying out that revision this particular little outside assistance to the pensioner should not be taken into account.  That is the request made in this motion.  It is to put this request that I stand up here to-night.  I feel that the request finds an echo in the heart of every single Deputy irrespective of his geographical position in this House or of his political affiliation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I think that very few will question what Deputy Dr. O'Higgins said in his closing remarks, that he doubts very much if there is any member of this House or any Party who would not be in favour of this motion. There is not a member of this House who has not almost daily come up against some glaring injustices in dealing with this question of the means test as applied to the aged, the blind and widows.  I want to mention an <Col N="2574" /> aspect of the means test particularly as it applies to the blind and the aged that is not adverted to in this House and that is only adverted to in the country when certain people want to make Party political capital.  I am not concerned whether what I am now going to say is misrepresented or not and I am not concerned as to whether certain members of the House may seek to make capital out of it.  In relation to this means test one thing is very often forgotten and that is that, in the days of the British Government, the maximum allowed to a blind pensioner or an old age pensioner was 20/- per week.  In other words, a person's means could be assessed at 10/- a week and he would still be entitled to a full pension.  A change was made in that in circumstances and for reasons into which I do not propose to go now but which I would not shirk at all if I were challenged on it.</P>
      <P>In any case, the position has definitely worsened from the time the British Government were here so far as the aged and the blind were concerned. Prior to the passing of that particular Act if the pension officer assessed the means of the applicant at 10/- a week, the applicant would still be entitled to the maximum pension of 10/-.  After the passing of the Act, if the means were assessed at 10/-, the maximum old age or blind pension which could be given was reduced to 6/- and that is still the law.  I want Deputies to keep that as well as various other aspects of the means test in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. O'Higgins gave certain examples.  There are many other examples which could be given but there is certainly one effect which this means test, as at present and for years past administered, has had and that is that it paralyses any desire or attempt at thrift amongst people.  The means test, as it has to be administered at the moment, has the effect that a man who has reached the age of 70, who has been a spendthrift, who has had a bigger income all through his lifetime than his neighbour but who has wasted it, who has lived extravagantly and who has never attempted to save a 1/-, gets a full pension automatically.  That is his position when he comes to the <Col N="2575" /> age of 70.  On the other hand in the case of the man who has worked hard, who had to live on a smaller income, who was thrifty, who was encouraged by the State not only for his own sake but for the good of the State to be thrifty, and to invest his money in savings certificates, that very virtue is brought up against him when he applies for the pension and his pension is accordingly reduced.</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of a skilled worker, a member of a craft union in this country, who throughout his lifetime has been actually contributing to the superannuation fund which is run by the trade union or the organisation to which he belongs.  When he reaches the age of 70, the State uses that against him and reduces the amount of the State pension which he will get. We are in this extraordinary position that if an employer with whom a man has been working for the greater part of his life is a kindly man who knows that this old workman has no immediate relative or no home to go to, if he is reluctant to throw that man out when he comes to the age of 70 knowing that his only choice, if you can use the word &ldquo;choice&rdquo; in that connection, is the county home&mdash;because he cannot take a room in a village or a town much less in the city, pay rent and keep himself on 10/- a week&mdash;if the employer decides to give him his bed and his board in return for doing some small jobs around the yard, that very fact is brought against him by the pension officer and is assessed against him. His claim for a pension is refused entirely or he is given anything from 1/- up to 10/- a week.</P>
    <P>Let us take another case which is quite common.  The son in a family is married and his father or mother reaches the age of 70.  They are in very poor circumstances and the son, naturally enough, likes to offer the shelter of his home, no matter what sacrifices it may mean to himself or his family, to his mother or his father. He wants to give them a bed and enough to eat.  That very circumstance is used against them to reduce their pension.  I think that any Deputy in this House will know from <Col N="2576" /> practical experience that this means test has not been and cannot be impartially and uniformly administered. It very often depends on the particular pension officer and his knowledge not only of the circumstances but of the values involved.  Does not every Deputy know that, in the same townland, you will find two persons over 70 years of age, one of whom gets the pension and the other of whom is refused the pension, although, to the knowledge of everybody in the parish, the person who gets the pension was infinitely better off before getting it than the person who is refused?  That is common, I should say, to every parish and it is due, not to any desire on the part of the investigating officer to be harsh or unfair, but to the fact that this machinery cannot be administered in an equitable way.</P>
    <P>I do not know what case the Minister will make on this motion, but I think he will find it hard to make any case against it on the merits.  I do not think he can do so.  I remind Deputies and the Minister that we are too much inclined to talk about the old age pension in terms of a maximum pension of 10/- a week.  We have to remember that there are thousands of old age pensioners who are not getting 10/- per week and we have to remember this further fact, that, in order to qualify for the maximum old age or blind pension, a person has to be practically destitute, and, as was said by the mover of the motion, if any person, for charitable or other reasons, wishes to come to the assistance of that blind or old age pensioner, or, for that matter, a widow, that charity is used against the pensioner.</P>
    <P>I want now to refer to an aspect of this matter to which I have referred on numerous occasions over the years. This is a most glaring example of what happened.  Following the 1914-18 war, there were thousands of old people&mdash; there are not so many now, of course, but there are still some and probably are some more, arising out of the recent war&mdash;who had lost sons in that war and to these old people the British Government awarded pensions or gratuties. I remember when the Old Age Pensions Commission, of which I was a member, <Col N="2577" /> was sitting many years ago, I got particulars of a considerable number of cases, not only from my own constituency but from other constituencies. I went to the trouble of having these checked and I found this happening, that, where they were getting, say, 10/- per week from the British Government before the Act to which I refer was passed, immediately that Act was passed, the old age pension was reduced to 6/- as a maximum.  That went on for some time and the British Government then discovered that the Irish Government were saving 4/- per week at their expense, and they cut the pensions they were giving from 10/- to 6/- and made the Government here pay the full old age pension.  That was the sort of thing that went on.  It is still going on to a lesser extent and I am sure that similar cases will arise as a consequence of casualties in the recent war.</P>
    <P>Let me give another case&mdash;one that is brought to my notice fairly frequently and one which strikes me as deliberately cutting across the original intention when these pensions were given.  It is, I am sure, quite a common case.  It is the case of a road worker, 68 years of age&mdash;and I want to remind the House that a road worker is not a full time permanent employee; he is not paid wet or fine and in the light of the weather of the last six or eight months, Deputies will appreciate what that means&mdash;whose wife reached the age of 70 and applied for the pension. She would not get it because her husband was working for the county council and earning 35/- or 40/- a week. She would have been refused on the same ground, if he had been working for any farmer, but, if her husband ceased to work, she would get it and would have to get it.  When he reaches 70 in two years' time and ceases to work, both he and his wife will be entitled to the maximum pension and will have to get it.  Citizens of this country who have lived and worked all their lives in the country up to the age of 70 are entitled to something from us.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up much time on this and I am, therefore, merely skimming over a number of points <Col N="2578" /> because I am sure there are many Deputies who want to speak, and I will leave it to them to develop the points. There is one other aspect to which I want to refer, that is, the means test in relation to widows, and particularly the widows of what are called small farmers.  I am speaking from recollection, but I think I am right in saying that the test there is an £8 valuation. I want to tell the House and particularly members who have knowledge of the country, of land and of £8 valuation holdings, so-called, that a widow left on an £8 valuation holding with orphans and with a non-contributory pension, cannot work that holding herself. What is she to do?  Depend on the charity of her neighbours to work it or attempt to employ labour?  A woman who has worked up to 50, 60 and 65 years of age and, for that matter, up to 45 years of age, on an £8 valuation holding and has reared a family, if she loses the bread-winner, is entitled to any help the State can give her.</P>
    <P>I know the answer we will get to all this.  I presume it will follow the old hackneyed lines of the money, what it will cost and so on.  I have been listening to that over a long number of years. I heard it thrown out, not only by this Government, but by their predecessors. The extraordinary thing is that whenever money is required for matters which are less worthy than this there does not seem to be any difficulty in finding it.  I am satisfied that if, as a result of the revision asked for in this motion, there is an improvement in the means test situation, the money can be found.  I am satisfied that it is not beyond the wit either of the Government or of this House to make a saving out of a Book of Estimates for £52,000,000 that would meet whatever extra charge would be occasioned by it.</P>
    <P>Let me say in conclusion that when the Government ultimately decided to introduce children's allowances they had to take what was undoubtedly a very important and a very big decision as to whether there should or should not be a means test in relation to children's allowances.  They decided after full examination that there should be no means test and there was not a <Col N="2579" /> means test.  So far as I know, it is working out equitably and I do not think there is any abuse.  I suggest there is a better case for not having a means tests or, at least, for not having the particular type of means test that there is at the moment in connection with old age pensioners.  I will content myself with that because there are many other Deputies who wish to contribute to the debate.  I second the motion moved by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I have come into this House the question of old age pensions has been discussed in various forms.  One advantage of the motion now before the House is that it concentrates entirely on the question of the means test.  On the other occasions when old age pensions were discussed an opportunity was provided for the Minister to concentrate in his reply on the inability of the State to meet any increase in the rates of pension and to gloss over the case that was usually made in connection with the means test.  I want to be as frank as I was on a previous occasion and to say that it is my personal view that the means test in connection with old age pensions should be abolished.  I agree with Deputy Morrissey that there is an excellent precedent for that in the case of children's allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will make one confession.  The Fianna Fáil Government are credited or have been credited for a number of years with keen political intuition. Whether they deserve that reputation or not, I do not know, but that is the general opinion outside.  It baffles me to know why it is that, particularly in recent years, they have turned a deaf ear to pleas made in this House and which were made, obviously, because they represented a very strong current of public opinion.  The Minister should know as well as every other member of his Party that there is no question causing such heartburn at the present time as this question of old age pensions. Members of the Fianna Fáil Party, like every one of us here, must have their daily lives occupied with attention to this particular question. <Col N="2580" /> If it were viewed only from the point of view of political expediency, I cannot understand why the present Government has so far resisted the appeals from this very important section of the community.</P>
    <P>I view the matter from a higher plane.  As I have said in the House recently, I hope at some stage to be old.  When that time comes, I should like my position to be at least such as to give me a certain amount of peace and security so far as ordinary means are concerned.  That peace and security are being harshly denied to a very large section of the people at the present time.  In the official returns for 1942-43 the number of pensioners was given as 146,000.  Of that number 22,500 were in receipt of less than 10/- a week and of those who were on the bare line of 10/- the figure is 124,576. The House will appreciate that that 124,000 refers to people whose income in the very nature of things does not exceed 16/- a week.</P>
    <P>If you add the range of people who have, say, between 16/- and £1 a week &mdash;of the number of which we have no estimate&mdash;you have a fair idea of the number of people who are interested in this particular question.  The attitude of mind of the present Minister was expressed here last week when he said that he did not regard these particular services&mdash;and he named the services, and they included old age pensions&mdash; as being sufficient in themselves to meet the case of the recipient but that they should supplement out of their own means whatever was required on balance.  I dispute the Minister's contention in that respect and I suggest that it is not a proper approach to a very great social problem.  It is obvious that a very large section of our people could not have any private means of their own but it does so happen, for the purpose of this debate, that we can discuss at least 22,500 people who are in receipt of less than 10/- a week because they have some little means.  The Minister will readily appreciate that the value of money when the means test was introduced and its value now are poles apart.  It defies imagination how any individual could attempt to exist on 16/- a week <Col N="2581" /> at the present time.  I suggest to the Minister that while he may make the plea that this is one aspect of what he has already described as a comprehensive scheme of social insurance, to be dealt with at a later stage, there is no insuperable difficulty to implementing that particular section of the old age pensions code now.</P>
    <P>I take it the Minister will be in a position to give us an indication of the cost.  I do not care how much it costs because the happiness of the aged people should be the criterion of a progressive State.  I suggest that we cannot call ourselves a progressive State while we have so many of our citizens in a state of destitution or bordering on destitution.  Comparisons have been introduced in regard to this question. I repeat one.  I take the case of New Zealand, where a married couple, under their present pensions code, can have an allowance of £3 5s. 0d. a week and, in addition &mdash; as indicating their approach to a means test &mdash; can have £1 a week of their own, £500 in the savings bank and can own their own home.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this question that I wish to mention. Members of old age pensions committees have found it absolutely futile to attend meetings.  I know that is the position so far as the City of Dublin Old Age Pensions Committee is concerned. Week after week that committee meets to receive these poor old people.  It is pitiable in the extreme to hear them having to disclose this little bit and that little bit, as the case may be, and being turned down as border-line cases.  All the time, the committee is powerless and can do nothing.  It would be idle for the committee to tell these people that it is the law.  A person of 70 years of age does not give two straws what the law is.  All he is concerned with is how much he can receive from any source, from the State or otherwise, to ensure his survival.</P>
    <P>Now Deputy Morrissey referred to the question of trade unions having their own superannuation funds.  That is perfectly true.  It is an old custom of the trade unions to have a small superannuation fund in addition to <Col N="2582" /> their usual scale of benefits but immediately they attempt to apply those they come under the hammer of the law so far as the means test is concerned and, as a result, they are forced to adopt subterfuge methods to get round the law.  The same happens with large companies.  Take, for example, Córas Iompair Eireann.  Only two nights ago I had two of these men, grand old types, at my home with notices in their pockets.  They were in receipt of 16/- a week from the company, and because the company knew that a week hence they would reach the age of 70 the pension was automatically reduced to 6/-.  The company took the view that since the pensioners could not receive the 10/- a week from the State and still be in receipt of their 16/- they would transfer their liability to the extent of 10/- from the company to the State.  I attempted to explain to these poor old people what was involved.  One is utterly powerless to attempt to state that it is the law that is being enforced so far as that is concerned.  Is it too much to ask the Minister at this stage, and I am not overstating the picture when I say that he would be doing something that would be very welcome to this House as a whole and to the individuals who would benefit, if he would signalise this occasion of his new administration by an advance of the kind that has been suggested?</P>
    <P>It would be an encouragement to companies like Córas Iompair Éireann and other companies, because there are quite a number of decent employers in this city and throughout the country who would be prepared to come to the aid of old faithful servants if they know that in doing so they will be in alignment with the State and that the State will set that example.  Is it too much to ask that at this stage at least that measure of justice and equity will be given to our old people?</P>
    <P>The question of the increase of the old age pensions does not arise in this motion.  I would like that it would, but it so happens that it does not come within the scope of the debate.  There is one aspect of the motion that does not personally appeal to me or to my colleagues and that is wherein a recital is made of certain sources of income <Col N="2583" /> which would indicate, not purposely I am sure, that it would be confined merely to charitable sources.  We would prefer, as has been stated in the House on previous occasions, that a figure would be stated below which the State would not intervene: that the individual in question should have income from any source he liked up to £1 and that it should not be reckoned so far as the granting of the pension is concerned.  Now I want to appeal to the Minister again.  He has an opportunity now, and I would appeal to him not to use this occasion merely to state that it will be included at a later stage.</P>
    <P>There are a number of people whose hearts would be gladdened by a measure of advance on this particular occasion and I would ask him to consider this.  He knows as well as I do and every other member on the other side of the House that if there is one aspect of the pension code that causes more irritation and hardship it is this question of the means test.  Just imagine an elderly person being subjected to all sorts of close personal investigation about his private life, amounting almost to inquisition.  It tends to degrade the human individual who naturally at that stage, having gone through a gruelling of that description, would much prefer to say: &ldquo;Well if I have no other means I will go into the workhouse or some institution of that kind rather than submit to this.&rdquo;  It is deplorable at this stage of our history that we should have to appeal on a matter of this kind.  Let us take the view that this State can be progressive on its own resources and that all these restrictions, vexatious and irritating as they are, can be swept aside and that this reasonable measure &mdash; and it is reasonable &mdash; asked for and sought for in this resolution, will be responded to by the Minister in the spirit in which it is being made in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFlorenceODris" hpid="Mr. O'Driscoll Mr. O'Driscoll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Driscoll</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to say a few words on this very important matter.  I have been very impressed by the statements which were made by the other Deputies.  I have for a long <Col N="2584" /> number of years been a member of a pensions committee, and during the course of those years I have come across many cases where the old people were treated unfairly.  I cannot see how the Minister and the Government can make any justification for the means test.  There is no means test in the Children's Allowances Act, as Deputy O'Sullivan reminded the Minister. There is no means test in the case of a young man of 21 even if he has a million pounds who gets married and fulfils the other requirements. But the old men and the old women who produced the wealth of the country, who kept the last Government there and who are keeping the present Government here, when they reach 70 years of age, have to go through a very rigid examination as to their means.</P>
      <P>My experience is this: when an old man or an old woman reaches 70 years of age they put in their claim for the pension to which they are justly entitled and the Minister, or his officials, use every method they can to prevent them from obtaining it.  I would like to remind the Minister that when his Party, who are now the Government, came into power they took over that one fault from their predecessors &mdash; the way the old people were treated &mdash; and nothing has been done to improve the matter since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of my experience as a member of an old age pensions committee some very remarkable cases have come before the meetings.  I remember one time the case of a respectable old woman; she was 70.  It was the time of the economic war. Among her assets returned by the pension officer were four hens, and since then I have been bothering my head to know where the income came from the four hens.  Again, there is the case of a poor woman who was left a widow with a young helpless family.  One of her boys grew up to man's age, 21 years of age, and he said to his mother that he would go to England to work.  The mother, in order to keep him at home and because she could not carry on without him, made over the farm to the son.  She was 63 years of age at that time.  Unfortunately the son could not <Col N="2585" /> get married because there were too many children in the family and they had to be supported.  Seven years afterwards that poor old lady reached 70 years and when she applied for the old age pension the pension officer said to her that she had given over the farm to her son for the purpose of getting the pension.  She was 63 years of age when she gave the farm to her son.  How could anybody say that she did it for the purpose of getting the pension?  I was not a member of the Dáil at the time, but I put the case in the hands of our Leas-Cheann Comhairle and that woman got the 10/-, and she was entitled to it.  There are many other cases which I would like to put before the House.</P>
    <P>Neither this Government nor the last Government made proper provision for these people.  Many of them had sons who grew up.  After leaving school, they had nowhere to go and they joined the British Navy.  They sent home 10/- a week to the poor old father and mother who reared them and gave them whatever little education they could. They worked their fingers to the bone for their boys.  When these boys sent home the 10/- a week the pension officers put it against them in the record and deprived them of the pensions to which they were well entitled.</P>
    <P>On the Island of Cape Clear I knew of one man who, in the last war, lost two sons.  He and his wife were getting an allowance of 30/- or 35/- from the British Government.  The Irish Government stopped their pensions. I submit it was a criminal action on the part of the Irish Government to do that.  I would not think it so serious if the money were coming from inside sources, but when it was coming from an outside Government it was quite a different matter.  I am not blaming the present Minister for doing this, but I hope that he will try to remedy defects of that nature.</P>
    <P>Going back to the little boys who joined the British Navy at the age of 16 years, is it not better for them and for our country that they would be encouraged to think of the father and mother who reared them rather than spend in a foreign country whatever <Col N="2586" /> money they might send?  Because they are sending it home it is the first thing the pension officer will have on the record.</P>
    <P>I listened with great interest to Deputy O'Higgins, Deputy Morrissey and Deputy O'Sullivan.  They indicated what is happening in every district of the country.  I know very respectable members of pension committees, including clergymen, who resigned in disgust.  We are simply a rubber stamp; we have no power unless to make a recommendation.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland at the present time a single man or woman who reaches 65 years can get a pension of 26/- a week and there is no means test. I do not know what the Minister would do if he were living in Northern Ireland and if he were a poor man.  Would he vote for the abolition of the Border and lose 26/- a week?  Would he go home on the chance of getting thin? I think I am as good a patriot as the Minister or any other member of the Government and I know damn well I would stay in the North.  Do you want to break the Border at all?</P>
    <P>I know very well from my experience that the members of the Fianna Fáil Party who are listening to me, those who act on pension committees, have the same story as I have.  If this goes to a vote, I ask the Minister to allow the members of his Party to vote freely and then we will see what will happen.</P>

      <P>I was always in favour, if it were found possible by the Government, of abolishing the means test altogether or, if not, at least to reduce it somewhat.  I know of a widow in Limerick who married a man 61 years of age.  She was 50 years of age at the time of the marriage.  That man appeared to be in good health and had national health insurance stamps for 30 years to his credit.  Unfortunately, he died within 12 months after the marriage and that unfortunate woman, because he did not live for two years, was not entitled to a pension, a contributory pension or a non-contributory pension.  I appealed to the Department to give her a pension and I was told that as her husband was 61 years <Col N="2587" /> and as she was not married two years to him, she was not entitled to any pension.  She is Mrs. Organ of Limerick. I think a decision in her case is pending in the Department and perhaps the Minister will give some consideration to it.  I feel sure the Minister will favourably consider reducing the means test.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join in the appeal made to the Minister to remove the means test so far as its application to old age pensioners is concerned. I feel our appeal will not fall on deaf ears.  The Minister has shown recently that appeals made to him by members of the Dáil have been listened to.  The result is that there has been a change for the old age pensioners.  We hope there will be a greater change in the days to come.  Our immediate concern is to see that the means test so far as old age pensioners are concerned is removed.</P>
      <P>Some of the Deputies have already cited a few cases to the House.  I would ask the Minister would he make some inquiry in his own Department about the latest case which has come to my knowledge in the City of Dublin.  It has come to be known amongst the members of the pensions committee as the &ldquo;Pear Tree Case&rdquo;.  By the grace of God, a pear tree grew in a small yard in a Dublin area.  The old people who lived in the house decided that the pears would provide too great a temptation for the boys in the neighbourhood. We all know how boys climb walls to get apples and pears.  The old people where this pear tree grew decided to let the boys of the neighbourhood have the pears for about ½d. each.  The pears were sold to the boys at ½d. each.  Later the old people decided to apply for the old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The investigation officer came along. He examined the pear tree and he put a valuation on it.  Eventually he decided in either halfpennies or pennies that the pear tree produced fruit to the value of £3 12s. 6d. and he proceeded to assess under the means test £3 12s. 6d. for the pears.  He put that £3 12s. 6d. against the application and <Col N="2588" /> the claim was reduced to 4/- or 5/- instead of 10/-.  An appeal was taken and it was very justly decided on appeal &mdash; and I believe sanctioned by the present Minister &mdash; that the applicants were entitled to the full pension.</P>
    <P>Another case came to my notice in Malahide.  An officer went to a little cottage there where an old lady lived. He noticed that she had 23 or 24 hens and he decided that the old lady could not possibly eat all the eggs herself. After very severe examination he discovered that the old lady sold six dozen eggs at, I think, 2/- a dozen and he thereupon proceeded to deduct 1/- a week off her pension.  Under the Old Age Pensions Act units of 6d. are not accepted.  It must be an even amount of 1/-.  I understand that in this Malahide case an appeal was also taken and after some considerable time the old lady was awarded the full 10/-.  In the same area there was another old age pensioner in whose garden an apple tree grew.  In this case, too, it was decided that the apples must be bringing in a small fortune and 1/- a week was deducted from the pension I could cite many more cases because I know of dozens of them.  I attend the Old Age Pensions Committee in Dublin every Thursday and it is heart breaking to listen to the sad stories told by these old people whose pension rights are questioned.</P>
    <P>Cases have arisen where charwomen earning 2/- or 3/- for washing out a shop have had their pensions reduced accordingly, and in some cases rejected entirely.  Recently cases have come before our committee where employers were anxious to give old employees some assistance on their retirement. Under the present system of old age pensions if they give any assistance the pension is reduced.  The result is that private employers have no longer any inducement to give their old workers a grant of any kind because in the last analysis it is the Government which reaps the benefit of it.</P>
    <P>Recently in this House I raised a question about an old age pensioner whose son went to England and joined the British Army.  The son sent home an allowance of 7/- a week to his <Col N="2589" /> mother and 5/- was immediately deducted from the old age pension.  I do not entirely blame the Government for this because the law is there.  Now, I have suggested to some employers in Dublin that they should not give any financial assistance to old servants retiring from their service, and I have suggested to them instead that they should make some arrangement whereby they would pay for a basket of food every week for these old servants or pay their rent.  Another case which arises is where an old lady, the owner of a three-roomed cottage, lets one room to a lodger for 30/- a week.  That letting is taken into account and a 5/- profit is assessed on the 30/-.</P>
    <P>That old lady cannot get her old age pension because of that assessment. If the old lady loses the lodger or the lodger has not paid his rent for three months no allowance is made under the means tests and the assessment of 5/- continues on the empty room.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to go into all these cases, particularly those in connection with Córas Iompair Éireann and the old tramway drivers.  There are dozens of them.  There is an allowance of 16/- a week, but one week before a man is due to go out at 70 years of age an official document is sent to him telling him to apply for his old age pension and 10/- a week is then stopped from the allowance and they give him the difference of 6/-.</P>
    <P>The sad part of it is that under the means test, as laid down in the Act of Parliament, when an unfortunate ex-employee of Córas Iompair Eireann gets 5/- or 6/- per week from a son or daughter, that man does not get his full pension from the tramway company and cannot get an old age pension. I do not wish to detain the House, but let me, for the information of some new members, recall an occasion when I heard the Taoiseach making a speech in this House about 12 or 14 years ago in which he said: &ldquo;We have in mind the time when the small farmer and his wife can retire to another house on the farm, perhaps to the barn or to a cottage next door to the church, and the sons and daughters of that farmer can bring in all the food he requires in a basket.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It seems to be a Utopia now, but that was the intention.  It has never been possible to realise that intention because of this means test. It was a reasonable thing to expect that the old people would be allowed to retire and that the son or daughter would be enabled to assist them without having that assistance reckoned for the purpose of reducing their old age pension.  Any assistance that is given in that way is taken into account in the means test for the purpose of reducing the old age pension or of refusing it altogether.  May I say that this means test applies also in the case of pensions given to ex-I.R.A. men?  I mentioned last week the case of a man named Meade living in the Cabra area who is broken down in health; he was in practically every prison in England because of his services to the I.R.A.; he was in receipt of an I.R.A. pension and because his son or daughter got a job worth £1 or 25/- a week, his pension was reduced.  I have his permission, I may say, to mention his name in this House.  It has been pointed out there is no means test in the case of children's allowances and it has worked out satisfactorily.  I would ask the Minister, following his recent gesture, to accept this motion which has the support of every member of the House.  I know that so far as Deputies opposite are concerned, their heart is entirely with this motion, and that they are as strongly in favour of abolishing the means test as we are on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add a few brief remarks in support of the proposal for a speedy revision of this harsh means test, many aspects of which have been discussed by various speakers.  Deputies of all Parties have had experience of the hardships inflicted on many of our citizens because of the application of this means test. Deputy Morrissey has given some instances of the extraordinary manner in which this test is applied but I think that one of the greatest anomalies is that a widow who has to live on a pension of 5/- a week is not allowed to supplement it by earnings from any <Col N="2591" /> source exceeding 1/- without incurring a reduction.  Cognisance is taken of anything over a 1/- a week and she is supposed to live in the luxury that that 5/- per week can bring to her without attempting in any way to supplement that income.  Should she succumb to the temptation to accept a day's work at charring which may be offered her by a neighbour, her earnings will be deducted from the pension.  I have known &ldquo;umpteen&rdquo; cases of that kind and I could never understand why any Government should attempt to operate such ridiculous regulations.  The fact that a widow accepts the opportunity to supplement her income by doing a day's work with a neighbour is not going to inflict any hardship on the Exchequer. Surely it is not going to add to the expense of the Exchequer if the unfortunate woman is allowed to supplement her income by a day's wages offered her by her next-door neighbour? I think a provision of that kind should not be allowed to stand one moment longer on the Statute Book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey also referred to the hardship inflicted on people who have been engaged all their life in industrial employment and who have tried to make provision during their working years for the rainy day, whether through a benevolent fund, the Foresters or some other friendly society, the carpenters' society or some trade union or by buying Savings Certificates.  We spent thousands of pounds advising people to buy Savings Certificates through advertisements in the Press and in plastering the dead walls of our towns and villages.  I remember that I made this very statement in 1927 from these benches on the occasion of my first speech in the House and the then Minister promised to give attention very speedily to this matter, but the same hardships are still inflicted on thrifty people when they come to pensionable age.  We are still advising people to be thrifty but we do not play straight with them.  If they are thrifty, we penalise them when they come to the age of 70.  That is the corollary to the suggestion to be thrifty. Why do we continue to penalise a man who has been saving all his life to educate <Col N="2592" /> his children, who has put something away every week of his working life for the rainy day whereas the man who was in better circumstances, but who spent every penny he came up to, can come along, claim a pension at 70 and get the full pension without question?</P>
    <P>There is another type of person who gets a full pension without any question when he reaches pensionable age &mdash; the man who was continually under the influence of drink, who smashed windows, who did all the damage he could to his neighbours and who never worried about sending his children to school.  These men have been a burden on the State from the time they came into the world, proper wasters, but yet these are the very men who when they come to 70 years of age will get 10/- per week.  The man who never did a day's work, who spent perhaps most of his life in gaol, is given the full pension whereas the good citizen is penalised for his citizenship.  That is perfectly true and cannot be contradicted.</P>
    <P>These anomalies exist, and I cannot understand why they have not got attention long before now.  I appeal to the Minister, coming into his new office, to listen with attention to the pleas put forward.  The Minister himself knows these anomalies exist as well as any other Deputy, and I am sure that as the previous speaker said, the position will get his sympathetic attention.  I trust that he will be able to impose his will on the Cabinet and get them to agree not to wait for the bigger measure contemplated, because these anomalies, glaring as they have been for some time, appear all the more glaring in the light of the progressive methods in relation to social services adopted in every progressive country in the world.  It is really a stain on our character to allow these anomalies and the hardships they inflict to continue.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude on a note which has not been stressed particularly, but in which I am interested, the position of the blind.  The greatest hardship of all is being inflicted on our blind fellow-citizens and they are being penalised as if they were people with <Col N="2593" /> sight.  Lack of sight is the greatest calamity which God can inflict on anybody and these poor people have to try to carry on, isolated from the world and denied all the joys which those of us with the gift of sight have.  Surely their condition should strike a sympathetic note in the hearts and minds of everybody.  Yet, we find that they are subject to exactly the same test as people who have the gift of sight. Voluntary bodies are working on behalf of these blind people in order to rescue them from their nightmare, and I have the privilege of being chairman of the National Council for the Blind in my own city.  I have before me, although I was unaware that this motion was coming on, an appeal from a lady who has given her life to this work.  She says, and I think her own words speak best:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Our home teachers may teach a man, for instance, how to make simple rush baskets or a woman how to knit and they are proud when a saleable article has been achieved &mdash; proud of the pupil's skill despite the handicap and still more proud of the pupil's reawakened interest in life.</P>
    <P>Yet when a few shillings have been earned so commendably the shadow of the means test looms up at once. Pension officers are sympathetic &mdash; we have found them so &mdash; but the law is the law and if a single blind person is in receipt of 6/- from a local authority even 1/- per week earned regularly will leave him liable for reduction in pension.  We hesitate to encourage pupils to increase their output.  They feel uncomfortable, their only crime being the part-time occupation so stimulating mentally may work to their detriment financially.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the position of the blind.  They are naturally reluctant, being blind, to come forward, although they are encouraged to come out and mingle with their fellow citizens.  In Limerick, we have started a class in the technical school for blind people and we found it difficult to get them to come there. We must break down that barrier. Home teachers go into their homes to teach them this work, but the position is that if they get a few shillings for <Col N="2594" /> work done, the pension officer comes along and uses it against them.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that that is another glaring and outstanding case in favour of an immediate revision of the means test.  Why should these little allowances, which might be called handicap allowances, be treated as income?  In addition to the appeal made to the Minister on behalf of the widow and the old age pensioner, I particularly want to emphasise the appeal on behalf of the blind.  No moment should be lost in removing this hardship from them.  Anything they can do by their own efforts will be very limited and will not bring in more than a couple of shillings a week and that amount should not be taken into consideration in assessing their means for pension purposes.  Furthermore, if the local authority, through its welfare scheme, is prepared to supplement the 10/- given to these people, it does so purely because of their physical disability and why should that small payment be availed of to rob them of their pensions?  I think that is a matter which should have the Minister's immediate attention.</P>
    <P>There are other anomalies, many of which have been cited by the various speakers, but I think that sufficient case has been made to excite the Minister's sympathy and interest.  I hope that case will be successful in securing an early revision of this means test and the removal of these hardships.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that on this motion there is no playing to the gallery and I believe that there is a sympathetic House in this matter of the appeal on behalf of old age pensioners. I am glad also that this is a reasonable motion and not a motion calling for the complete removal of the means test. We must proceed by easy stages.  I am one of those who hold that no man is expected to live on his old age pension and I agree that it is given to him as a help and not as an amount on which he is expected to live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that a vast number of people in the country are getting the old age pension and also getting very good help from their families, but I am also satisfied that where people have to <Col N="2595" /> live more or less on their old age pension, there should be a far more liberal interpretation of the regulations.  The interpretation in that regard is too narrow.  The limit of means should be raised to a certain extent and we should allow £1, 25/- or 30/- before operating the means test.</P>
    <P>It is all very fine to demand that the Minister shall remove the means test, but it involves £4,000,000 or £5,000,000. If we can secure that amount by reduced taxation, by all means let it be done, but if that money cannot be secured without increased taxation, will the House stand for it?  I am a member of an old age pensions committee and we have dealt with cases of unfortunate people which, we were sure, would be sanctioned by the Minister, but we find the pension officer turning down these cases without giving any grounds for doing so.  I also know cases of people who got the pension in times gone by and who have fields of stock and 20 or 30 acres of land.  I know several of them &mdash; people who really needed no pension, who were very well off and who were able to put money in the bank.  These people are spoiling the chances of the unfortunate person who has to depend on the few shillings he gets from the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I know, has a hard job and I am sure that his heart is just as soft in relation to these people as our own, but the point is whether the State is prepared to raise taxation to the extent of the £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 involved in the removal of the means test.  Under this motion, we can do something.  We can raise the limit and give the poor applicant a chance of getting the pension.  If a man is in receipt of 5/- pension from the British Government &mdash; that is money coming into the house &mdash; it should not be taken into consideration when assessing his means.  If a man is getting a few shillings from his family, those few shillings should not be taken into consideration for that purpose.  Further, the wife of a man working on the roads should get the pension on reaching the age of 70 when they have no other means of living than the money he gets <Col N="2596" /> from working on the road.  This type of people are living in hard circumstances but there are other people who live by different means &mdash; thrifty people and some of them fairly comfortable.  I can understand the rigidity of the administration in their regard, but I think we are a little too narrow and that investigation officers are rather too slick in &ldquo;slipping it across&rdquo; many people.</P>
    <P>What I do not like about the whole thing is that most of the old age pensioners are in fear and trembling when they have to come before a committee. One would think that they were coming to their execution.  They are unable to answer questions and they shiver with fear, lest they slip.  We find that they have then to tell little fibs, because, if they tell the truth, they get nothing at all, and, even then, after telling all the lies, they are often found out.</P>
    <P>I knew one case of a man with a few cattle who was told that a buyer intended to come to see his cattle, but, unfortunately for that man, before the buyer came, the pension officer arrived. He saw this gentleman coming and thought he was a big jobber coming to look over his cattle.  The man asked him if those were his cattle, and he said they were and were they not fine cattle?  He asked what they were worth, and, of course, the pensioner gave him a great story of being a comfortable man and of the profit he was making.  When he had told his story, the pension officer said: &ldquo;You have made a mistake.  I am not a jobber; I am the pension officer.&rdquo;  Of course, the poor devil nearly flopped.  I am glad to say that he was well able to live without the pension.  It shows the position of the investigation officer.</P>
    <P>It is not right that the man who works all his life and who is thrifty cannot get a pension while the waster, the idler, finds no trouble in getting a pension but merely goes into the post office and gets the lady attendant to fill up a form to which he affixes his signature.  That is all he has to do to get his 10/-, and he in addition can command a half-crown from the home assistance officer.  It is putting a premium on laziness and idleness when <Col N="2597" /> the thrifty man is turned down and the waster gets the money.</P>
    <P>Children's allowances have been referred to.  In my opinion, we could have a means test in connection with children's allowances.  There are many people drawing that money who do not want it and who are able to bank it. If we had a means test in connection with children's allowances it might be possible to apply some of the saving thereby effected to the old age pensioners. A case could be made for a means test in connection with children's allowances but there is not much case for a means test in connection with old age pensions.  Something should be done for old age pensioners. We have raised the salaries of officials but we have not done anything for the old age pensioners.  The Minister informed the House the other day that he intends to increase the pensions by 2/6 a week.  I do not believe that that is enough.  Give 5/- or 10/- a week increase.  A half a crown is too niggardly.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the motion is reasonable.  I do not believe in high-falutin appeals to the gallery.  It is all tommy-rot to say, for the benefit of the gallery, that the means test should be removed and that there should be pensions of £2 to £3 a week.  The State could not afford that and the old age pensioner knows that he will not get it.  When we talk reasonably in this House something will come of it. The old age pensioner is not such a fool as some would have us believe. He knows what he should get and what the State can afford to give him.</P>
    <P>If the right type of people were getting more money and if some of those who are getting it were not getting it at all, the country would be better off. The Government should meet the men who need the money.  There is always too much playing to the gallery and our people are bamboozled.  This is a small State.  Reference has been made to what is done across the water, where the pensions are 25/- and 26/-.  We are a small country, very poor, with a big national debt piling up and our people emigrating.  We must cut our cloth according to our measure and pay what we are able.  We are giving 10/- to <Col N="2598" /> the old age pensioner.  I am satisfied that he should get 15/- and during war a bonus of 5/- in addition.  If an old age pensioner were getting £1 a week in the emergency he would be fairly well off and I think the State could afford it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a problem in deciding whether he should or should not remove the means test.  I have known men, 20 or 25 years ago, who were drawing the old age pension of 10/- a week under the Cosgrave Government. Instead of getting 10/- they could have been giving 10/- to some charitable organisation.  They were comfortable, wealthy men.  I knew one man who had 300 acres who applied for a pension. There is a good deal to be said on both sides.</P>
    <P>The Minister, starting a new Ministry, has a golden opportunity of making a name for himself.  I know he has a kind heart.  In fact if he had not such a kind heart he would be a better Minister for Agriculture, because he would be able to bow the heads of the other Ministers who were slipping it across him when the money needed for agriculture would not be given.  He has a chance now of sticking his heels in the ground and telling the Minister for Finance that there is a case here.</P>
    <P>The pensioner is entitled to an increase.  I do not say that the means test should be removed but its application should be more liberal.  If he has an income of 25/- a week, take that into consideration but do not count anything under that.  I have known several men who applied for a pension three or four times and who failed to get it and who should not have failed were it not for the narrow interpretation of the means test.  I am satisfied that many of these people could qualify for pensions and that they should get them.  There is one man who has been a cripple in bed for the last nine months.  He has applied three times and has been turned down, although the farm of 20 acres was signed over two or three years ago to his niece, who has two or three children.  This man has not a penny and he is living with his people.  A man of that type who worked hard while he was able and who, even now, weeds turnips and man-golds <Col N="2599" /> outside his door, should not be turned down while others who have 15 to 20 head of cattle have had 10/- a week for the last 20 years.  The case I have referred to is one in which the means test was most narrowly interpreted.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept this motion.  It is a reasonable motion. If the Minister accepts it he will be doing a good thing and will please a great many people and it will stop a lot of the talk at the cross roads as to what we should do and what we could do.  There is a great deal that we cannot do and it is better to tell the people that.  But we could do a little as regards those who need the money by a more liberal interpretation of the means test.  That would satisfy all of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting this motion, I consider it is a very reasonable one which is not making a very large demand on the public purse.  It does not ask for the abolition of the means test but for a revision of it and, as the Minister must be aware, a revision is long overdue.  Deputy Giles said that there are some people drawing old age pensions who are well off and who do not really need it.  That is perfectly true, and there are other people who should get pensions and who are turned down.  It is because the means test is not properly administered.  The investigation officer is asked to do a very difficult job.  Take a small farmer living in a mountainous area.  How is the investigation officer to assess the means of that farmer, who has a few mountain sheep that may be unproductive, that may be lost in snow or floods or ravines, two days after the pension officer inspects?  Some income is assessed on the valuation of the holding. In many cases the holdings are absolutely unproductive and, while the farmer may boast of a few black-faced sheep or maybe an old cow, the person may be absolutely destitute or depending on money from relatives in England, America or elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is past time to have a complete revision of these particular kinds of <Col N="2600" /> cases.  Account is taken also in the means test of money held in a bank or post office by the applicant for the old age pension.  In nearly every instance, at least in my county and in many other counties as well, the money is not the property of the old age pensioner and should not be assessed as such.  The money is the result in some cases of labour of the sons or daughters of the applicants in England.  That money is sent home and is jealously regarded as the property of the person who sends it.  It is the result of their labour in a foreign land and on the applicant's death will revert back to them.  It is the usual custom to send money home and yet it is assessed at the rate of 5 per cent. interest while, at the same time, we have laws in force that allow banks to take in money on deposit at 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>I remember the President of to-day, when he was Minister for Finance, being questioned on that subject about three years ago in this House and he admitted that such was the case: that income on money in banks was at the rate of 1 per cent., but was definitely assessed as being worth 5 per cent.  I cannot understand why such an injustice is allowed to continue.  Take, for instance, the case of a small farmer who has £200 in the bank.  Immediately his income on £200 is assessed at £10 when in actual fact he is only drawing £2 on 1 per cent. interest.  No explanation has come from either the previous or the present Minister for Finance on that subject.  Then there is the case where the family of the applicant did not emigrate.  The cash in bank or post office, as the case may be, represents a wage, a miserable wage I will admit, but it represents the savings of the man's sons and daughters who perhaps earned a few pounds in wages.  All the money goes into one common pool for the final settlement of the family, yet it is assessed against the applicant for the old age pension.  It is an injustice; it should not be.  Another case I come across very often is that of a person who is in receipt of some small pension from England or from the United States.</P>
    <P>That definitely should not be taken <Col N="2601" /> into account because, in the first place, these people should never have had cause to leave this country.  If they spent a portion of their lives, perhaps in some foreign army, in many cases it is not their fault.  I have not yet met a person who willingly left his own country for the sake of employment. They all go with certain pangs of regret.  They did not go, as has recently been said by the Minister for Finance, on the condition that they could have stayed at home.  Such is not the case.  They are forced to go.</P>
    <P>Now one last point that I wish to bring to the Minister's notice.  It is the very vicious system of going into a pensioner's means after his death.  I know one particular case of a person who applied for the pension and got the full 10/- because his means were low enough.  That person drew the pension until death.  The son of the pensioner came in for some money and that money belonged to the son.  On the death of that pensioner the son was billed by the Revenue Commissioners for all the pension that that person had drawn for a period of some four years and five months.</P>
    <P>That is a very vicious system altogether. It is perfectly wrong.  If a person with other means has got the old age pension it is quite clear that the investigation officer has failed in his duty.  If the person got the pension correctly in the beginning there should be no investigation into his money or means after his death and asking perhaps a young married man with a family who has only a small piece of land in the country to refund money that the old age pensioner drew and drew correctly during his time.  That definitely should be cut out.</P>
    <P>The Minister, no doubt, will ask us where the money is to come from.  The Minister for Finance, on a previous motion by members of this Party here asked us if we were going to tax tobacco, tea, sugar and so on.  Many ways have been pointed out to every member of the Government of how to save and curtail.  There are many extravagances that should be cut out and the money devoted to some useful purpose such as this or perhaps still more pressing purposes.  I would like <Col N="2602" /> to bring to the notice of the Minister for Social Welfare that there are many pensioners, particularly in towns, who are absolutely dependent on the pension and who are absolutely destitute. They are starving.  We all know how far 10/- will go nowadays.  Along with the revision of the means test some revision of the amount paid to old age pensioners is long overdue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In joining this appeal for some revision of the old age pension tests and the widows and orphans, I just rise to quote one case to the Minister for Social Welfare.  I have been interested in it for the last three years. The man in question under one Act was getting 10/- unemployment assistance. When he reached the age of 70 he was told by the clerks of the employment exchange to apply for the old age pension.  He applied and his case was investigated by the pension officer and he was told by the pension officer that he was not entitled to any pension by reason of the fact that his wife is employed in one of the bacon factories in Tralee and earning the small wage of 35/- a week.  The position, as I see it, is that if his wife relinquishes her employment she and her husband and daughter will have to exist on 10/- a week.</P>
      <P>I think this is a case that should receive every consideration.  A man can get 10/- a week under one Act and yet when he applies for a pension under the Old Age Pension Acts he is told by the pension officer that he is not entitled to it.  We in this country want to see everybody working but it is a fright to see a man deprived of the old age pension because his wife has to go out every morning and work until six in the evening for a miserable wage of 35/- to support him.  This case has come before the Department of Local Government on several occasions and I hope that the Minister for Social Welfare will give it every consideration and that he will see his way to grant this man the old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with widows' and orphans' pensions&mdash;non-contributory&mdash; every Deputy in this House is acquainted with people who are in receipt of those pensions.  Take the case of a <Col N="2603" /> woman with no dependents who is in receipt of a non-contributory pension. When she reaches the age of 45 her pension is withdrawn until she reaches the age of 55.  It is disgraceful to withdraw the pension of any poor unfortunate widow in this country.  Some clause should be put into that Act to give her a pension from 45 to 55.  It should be left to her until she goes to the other side.</P>
    <P>I join Deputy Keating in saying that there are people in this country, who, when they reach the age of 70, just put out their hands and get the old age pension.  But people who have worked for the greater part of their lives to educate their family and to put a few shillings away for their family are told, when they reach the age of 70, that they will get no pension because they have a few shillings behind them.  I appeal to the Minister to revise the means test and let the widows have their pension when they reach the age of 45 whether they have dependents or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been granted leave to move the adjournment of the Dáil for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, the widespread, acute and unprecedented distress and devastation caused by flooding in Kilkenny City, Thomastown and other areas, requiring the immediate provision of finance and supplies.  In doing so, I want to assure the Minister and the House that I am actuated by no sense of partisanship and I am not moved in any way by Party motives.  I am endeavouring to put before the House and the Minister the views, as given to me, of citizens of all classes and of all shades of political opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2604" /> I should like, first of all, to address myself to the picture which I saw in Kilkenny and Thomastown.  In Kilkenny City three out of four city parishes were affected by the flooding which took place on the morning of the 13th of this month and continued right down to St. Patrick's Day.  In that city John's Street, John's Quay, Irishtown, Watergate, Blackmills and the vicinity of the Black Abbey were inundated in most places to a depth of from eight to ten feet.  Some 191 dwellinghouses had to be evacuated.  A big number of these dwelling-houses are definitely dangerous to human life and their structure at present is such that there is grave danger of a number of them falling.  Many of them have been shattered and split in two and, in those which are structurally sound, the condition of things is so appalling that it will take many weeks to clean up the débris and to dry out the houses.  All classes are affected&mdash;shopkeepers, traders, owners of workshops, artisans, middle-class people, ordinary workers and, of course, the poor.</P>
    <P>I do not want to weary the House with details, but I must say that the conditions which I saw appalled me and would appal any person who visited the various places affected by the inundation.  I saw stretches of strong walls, eight to 10 feet high, for perhaps a distance of 30 yards, swept by the raging torrent as if it were mere cardboard or paper.</P>
    <P>I saw dwelling-houses completely gutted of all family possessions, personal belongings, furniture, kitchen utensils&mdash;everything was gone.  I saw the small workshops of artisans who depend for their livelihood on their daily labour in their homes.  I saw their equipment swept away by the flood. There was nothing left to those people, not even the clothes they wore the night before.  Many of them to-day are standing in their neighbours' shoes and wearing their neighbours' clothes. Their own clothes were swept away by the avalanche which hit them around midnight.</P>
    <P>Many of the shops in John's Street, in Irishtown and in Watergate have been completely gutted.  Everything in <Col N="2605" /> the shops, counters, shelving, stores, stocks of all kinds, have been swept away.  Ricks of hay and straw were lifted up and swept through the gates. Many of the gates were swept off their hinges and piers and walls were knocked down.  It is a scene of desolation in these areas.  All the business records of the traders are gone; all the ration cards are gone, all the coupons are gone, and all the supplies are gone.  The situation is such that these people are unable to carry on under the ordinary system of control which prevails.  They have to depend upon the goodwill and the charity of their colleagues in the various trades to give them the supplies necessary to meet the demands made upon them by distressed people.</P>
    <P>All red tape had to go by the board. These people have had to help one another as best they could in the appalling circumstances in which they found themselves.  I saw small printing works smashed up.  The Black and Tans in their most evil moments could never have created the havoc that was caused in some of these printing works. The principal bakery in Irishtown is out of commission, and will be for many days.  The gentleman who owns that bakery has to keep his customers supplied with bread which he has to buy from colleagues in the trade.  He has to pay the weekly wages of his workers who are idle, to the tune of £60 a week.  The local brewery has been completely smashed.  All machinery in the brewery is knocked about to such an extent that it is impossible for anybody but an expert to say whether or not that machinery can be put in motion again.  Some of the mills are affected by the water.  The stocks of corn, oats and wheat in them are affected by the water and it will take a long time to dry these stocks again.</P>
    <P>The trouble in Kilkenny has been caused not so much by the Nore as by a small river called the Breagha.  The Breagha comes in two forks down behind Parliament Street, under Parliament Street and under the brewery and apparently the bridges on the Breagha are so low and old fashioned that any abnormal rise of water cannot be taken under them.  Immediately <Col N="2606" /> there is a rise in the Breagha the bridge eyes fill up and the water must get out somewhere.  On this occasion the water got over the bridges and flooded the area all round.  The walls were broken down everywhere.  They acted as barriers for a time and the water banked up against them.  Then the walls gave way and a raging torrent came right down through the back yards and the gardens at Blackmills and in the Black Abbey vicinity.  It came right through the back doors of dwelling-houses and traders' shops in Irishtown, Lower Parliament Street and Watergate as far as Green Street and swept everything before it.</P>
    <P>I have seen shops completely gutted out as far as stock, shelving, counters and all that are concerned.  There is nothing left in the barbers' shops.  In the barbers' shops there is not even a basin or a mirror left.  There is an appalling situation in Kilkenny City at the moment.</P>
    <P>In Thomastown, the Mall, Market Street and Mill Street were completely inundated.  I have seen the water marks in the dwelling-houses and shops right up to the ceiling of the first floor and, in some cases, it passed the ceiling of the first floor and was going on to the second floor.  I was not able in the time at my disposal to get a completely accurate picture of the situation in Thomastown.  I saw a number of houses and I saw a number of shops.  I got an intelligent citizen to calculate for me the number of houses affected. He got as far as 74 and he could not think of the names of the rest, but he assured me it was well over 100.  The pavements in front of these shops and houses was torn up as if they had been blitzed by an atomic bomb.  The counters, the shelving, the presses, the furniture and the stock were left in an indescribable condition of chaos.  Most of it went in the flood because when this emergency arose inside the houses men in their nakedness had to go, at the risk of their lives, with hatchets to force the doors open in order to get this tidal flood out and when that happened everything in these houses below the first floor went with the flood.</P>
    <P>Some of the people affected are exNational <Col N="2607" /> Army men, recently discharged. Some of them had married and spent their gratuities in setting up a house and home and in the purchase of furniture, clothing and bedding and all those other essentials that go to make up the home life.  Everything that these men had is gone.  They have not even to-day the clothes they were wearing the previous day.  They are depending on the charity of their neighbours for the loan of suits.  The position is utterly appalling.  I cannot for the life of me see how these men&mdash; particularly the smaller artisan who had his business in his own home and the worker who resided in his own home&mdash;are ever going to rehabilitate themselves in life without some assistance from the State.  The amount of damage done in loss of property to the poor, to the worker and to the middle-class runs into several thousands.  I cannot at the moment give any idea of the amount to the House because I had not time to go into the matter in detail and it is impossible at the present time to estimate the damage that has been done to personal property, to dwelling-houses and shops, to traders' stocks and to household furniture.  All that has gone.  Small traders who have lived in the City of Kilkenny and in Thomastown with small capital are completely without their capital to-day.  Their capital, which was sunk in stock, has gone.  I do not know how these people are going to attempt to make a livelihood in either Thomastown or Kilkenny unless the State comes to their assistance. I certainly cannot see how the worker and the artisan are going to carry on unless the State is prepared to help them to rehabilitate themselves in some way.  Briefly, that is the position.  I do not want to overdraw the picture but the Minister for Education personally visited these areas and he saw everything that I saw.</P>
    <P>In the Dunmore, Jenkinstown, Three-castles and Ardloo area it is impossible to get any information at the present time.  Nobody can say what the plight of the farmers in that area is.  I have been informed that some of the places there are under eight feet of water and <Col N="2608" /> people are living in the top storeys of their houses.  What the position is as regards their stock, implements and land generally I cannot say and nobody will be able to say until somebody can get into them or they can come out to us.  These farms were inundated last year on the 12th August.  The people there are experiencing their sixth flood. On the drainage motion I gave particulars of the losses which these men incurred last year and I asked the Minister for Agriculture to come to the rescue in some way by giving some relief this year.  I asked for a special investigation of their conditions with a view to giving them some relief under the Tillage Order this year.  A chief inspector was sent down and made an investigation.  He was very sympathetic. But I was informed yesterday morning by a young man who got out of the Dunmore area that he has got his orders to till the same quota as last year.  These men will be lucky if they can till at all this year but they will till again at the risk of once more losing their crops.  Most of them lost all or the greater part of their crops last year.  I want to appeal again to the Minister for Agriculture to reinvestigate the problem now as it exists after the past week's inundation.</P>
    <P>The immediate problem is a serious one.  It is the problem of getting food, fuel, cement and commercial timber to these areas.  All books and records, writing cards and coupons are gone and the Minister for Industry and Commerce can only act on the basis that certain quotas have been fixed. These quotas must be rushed immediately to Kilkenny and to Thomastown. An emergency committee has been set up in Kilkenny and a similar committee has been set up in Thomastown. These two committees are investigating the problem of supplies as well as the problem of distress.  They will report with a complete list&mdash;if they have not already done so&mdash;of the traders' position and of what is needed now to get them going and to keep them going.  Men in the Thomastown area assured me that for four days they had no food.  There was no bread in the area because they depended on a local bakery which is now out of commission.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2609" /> The owner of this bakery is a young man of initiative and he has succeeded in getting bread from Kilkenny by means of a lorry.  The bakery in Thomastown is urgently in need of coal to dry out the ovens.  If the baker there can get a couple of loads of coal from Castlecomer forthwith he will, in a couple of days, be able to start baking again.  To that extent relief would be afforded to the people in Thomastown and to a certain degree to the people in Kilkenny, because the people in Thomastown are depending on Kilkenny for their bread at the moment.</P>
    <P>Commercial timber is required for many things.  I have told you that the scenes inside these houses are scenes of utter and complete devastation. Partitions, flooring &mdash; everything has gone, everything is torn up and tré-na-chéile. Timber is needed to put these homes into a habitable condition so that the people can return to them. Cement is urgently needed in Thomastown because the people are terrified to go back to their homes until cement protecting walls are built at the backs of their houses.  The walls have gone and the people have assured me that they will not go back until they are rebuilt.  No woman or child could be expected to go back in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Nore is still very high and is still in raging flood.  It has subsided from the streets, but it is still well over the banks.  Thomastown people have evacuated their homes and are depending on the charity of their neighbours for shelter.  Many of them are depending on the charity of their neighbours for food.  Practically all of them are depending on the charity of their neighbours for the clothes they wear to-day.  Now, we cannot stay too long with our neighbours or our friends. Little situations arise which become irksome and people begin to feel that it is time the visitor left.  That situation will arise in Thomastown&mdash;as it has arisen in every household at some stage&mdash;and unless immediate steps are taken by the local authority, by the health authorities and by the State to make these homes immediately habitable, then these people will have to be <Col N="2610" /> evacuated elsewhere.  In Kilkenny we have been successful in getting the military barracks to help us with the evacuation problem.  The central hospital has also been placed at our disposal.</P>
    <P>A number of these people will never go back, particularly in Kilkenny because they have been so terrified by their experience they have made up their minds never to return.  Others who left their homes are endeavouring to clean them up and to dry them out so that they can go back as quickly as possible.  They go out from the evacuation centres daily to do that job. Many of them are so disgusted with the size of the job and so disgusted with the repeated inundations they have had to suffer there that they will not go back.  They are sick and tired of the whole thing.</P>
    <P>They have made up their minds that here and now the matter must be set right.  They say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A crisis has struck us.  It is the gravest crisis that ever struck us.  It is a visitation from Providence, but we are going to use this visitation from Providence to ensure that the State and the local authority will come to our rescue and will put us beyond the reach of these floods in future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You cannot blame these people for taking that point of view.  You must sympathise with them when you remember that the women and children had to be taken from the upper stories of the houses at the dead of night in Thomastown and were in grave danger of being drowned were it not for the bravery and skilful management of the men manning these cots.  These people's nerves are so shattered from that experience that they are not going to risk it again.  They have definitely made up their minds on that.  That situation has got to be met but it is beyond the control of local funds.  It is too vast a problem for the local authority or for local charity.  Surely to goodness, in this Christian age, people should not be placed in the position that they are dependent on the charity of their neighbours to rehabilitate them in their daily lives?  Much, nevertheless, is being done by way of <Col N="2611" /> charity and His Lordship the Bishop of Ossory has set the lead in giving a subscription of £100.  I say that, even if we get £20,000 in that way it cannot accomplish very much in alleviating the position of the people affected in Thomastown and Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>You have there a housing problem that has got to be dealt with at once. Flooded homes have got to be put into temporary shape so that the people can go back to their homes.  Many of the houses in Thomastown are in a very poor structural condition.  I have seen cracks in the foundations and in the walls and the people are terrified that the houses will collapse on them, particularly in Mill Street.  I doubt if the people will risk going back to these houses, and homes will have to be found for them somewhere.  Whatever homes are there can be made secure by cement and timber and that job will have to be taken in hands at once.  It is not a job that can be carried out by the ordinary routine local administration, and it is such an urgent job that the Government must come to the aid of these people.</P>
    <P>The health problem is a very serious one.  The sewers are choked as a result of the flooding and many of the houses will not be free of water for months.  Many houses will have to depend on the Nore getting back to a normal level.  It will be only then that the damp in these houses will seep out. There is ground damp affecting the floors for a distance of from six to 12 feet which cannot seep out for many months.  Traders have had their cellars flooded and without pumping apparatus, it will be impossible to get the water out of these cellars for three or four months.  All their stock is meanwhile lying in the cellars.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to-night listening to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance speaking on the drainage motion&mdash;gravely disappointed. I never heard such a futile speech in my life.  Faced with the problem we have to face in Kilkenny and having put the picture of Kilkenny before him on the 12th of the month, two hours before the floods rose, all he could tell <Col N="2612" /> me to-day was that he cannot envisage the time when it will be possible to undertake a survey of the Nore.  As I asked him to-day, are we in Kilkenny to wait until there is a holocaust of human life to shake the inertia from which he suffers into some form of action?  He told us that the policy was enshrined in the Act of 1945, and that they would not be stampeded&mdash;&mdash;</P>

However, I want to say this, that in putting forward these demands I am not attempting to stampede the Parliamentary Secretary because I feel it would be impossible to stampede him.  I feel that if there was a stampede at the moment, in which we would all join, he would not have sufficient energy to join in it.  He contented himself with reading the Drainage Commission Report and suggesting that we could not have piece-meal development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall say no more on that line but I do want to put this view.  Arterial drainage as envisaged in the Act of 1945, was purely a problem for the relief of farmers whose holdings were being flooded.  Our problem in Kilkenny is both an agricultural <Col N="2613" /> and a public health problem. Owing to repeated flooding over a number of years, it has now become an acute public health problem as well as becoming an acute agricultural problem. The urban areas are suffering so much from these repeated floodings that many cases of consumption in Kilkenny and Thomastown can be traced to these inundations.  Ground damp will follow repeated inundations and in Irishtown, Green Street and the area round the River Nore, you can find ground damp.  You can see the marks of previous floodings and many people are suffering in health as a result.  As I have said, much of the tuberculosis existing there can be traced to it.</P>
      <P>It is essential to my mind that this matter should be tackled as a public health problem.  Breagha river will have to be diverted or these old bridges will have to be removed.  A number of bridges can be removed as they are not necessary to traffic.  The Nore is choked with old weirs or mills that are not used, with sallies, scrubwood, with islands and old trunks of trees.  I want to suggest to the Minister that, as a temporary measure, all these obstructions in the river must go. We must get the Nore moving at Kilkenny. For a mile above Greene's Bridge you will find the river obstructed with sallies and rubbish of all kinds.  At Greene's Bridge two eyes of the bridge are closed up and an island has been formed.  I understand that through the negligence of a previous surveyor that condition of things was allowed to happen.  The extraordinary fact is that this bridge, which should take the water from the Nore in high flood, has actually two eyes closed at the moment.  Surely that is not a job that should await arterial drainage.</P>

      <P>I suppose it is the job of the local authority&mdash;I do not know&mdash; but a bit of dynamite and a few labouring men could do a lot with the River Nore.  I do not say that tackling local jobs on the Nore is the right way to do it, and I know that, if you remove a big obstruction at one point on the river, you may create a new problem further down; but I say that there is an essential problem there of getting the river through Kilkenny as fast as possible, and at present there are numerous obstructions above and below the city which ought to go, particularly these old weirs and mills which are right across the river, with the result that islands are forming there.  A few sticks of gelignite would do a lot.</P>
      <P>I am sure that other Deputies want to speak on this matter, and I do not propose to delay the House, but I want to put it to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that, so far as the supply position is concerned, he should appreciate that we cannot carry out the ordinary regulations at the moment.  It is impossible.  The people have to help one another as best they can at the moment, and they are doing it, as the Minister for Education is aware For some weeks to come that position will obtain and the Minister will have to give a certain amount of latitude to the local committees and local traders to meet this emergency.  I am sure he will do that, but I feel that, between the local authority and the State, money will be found to rehabilitate these people, whose capital has been lost, and particularly the small traders, who cannot afford the loss of capital and cannot raise credit.</P>
      <P>I feel that the Minister for Finance will have to raise money to put the worker back in his home and give him his kitchen utensils, his little bit of furniture and his clothing.  These are all gone, and I say that task is beyond the reach of local charity and probably much beyond the reach of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an appalling visitation.  It is an act of God, I know, and it is unprecedented, but I think that we are the worst sufferers on this occasion of flooding&mdash;I really believe we are&mdash;and I feel that some form of compensation <Col N="2615" /> must be devised, particularly for the small trader.  There is no way of insuring against this risk.  No insurance company will undertake this risk of flooding.  I have put it to traders and I find that the premiums are so high that it would simply break them to attempt to pay them.  I do not know whether some system can be evolved, pending the drainage of the Nore, by which a State-aided insurance could be arranged for these people, to give them some hope that their problems will be solved in the future, if such a visitation should come again, and let us hope it will not.</P>
    <P>Arrangements have already been made to allot a certain amount of coal for the drying of houses.  Many of these traders will need coal to dry out their cellars, their stocks and their shops.  The brewery will need coal and the printing workshops and other places will need coal and, of course, the bakeries will need coal, if they are to get going at all.  I want to urge the Minister as forcibly as I can to cut out all red tape, all rules and regulations, and to send somebody or a number of persons down to Thomastown and Kilkenny, to deal on the spot with these matters, to take on themselves the job of investigating them on the spot and supplying the needs there and then, because if we are to wait for the ordinary administrative machine to function, I am afraid there will be more serious distress there than prevails at present.</P>
    <P>It is an occasion for extraordinary measures and I am appealing for these extraordinary measures.  Some have been taken already and, in raising this matter, I am putting just a bird's eye view of the situation, so that it cannot be said later that the Government had not a full appreciation of the position. Therefore, I appeal, in particular, to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to meet us in this matter of food, fuel, timber and cement supplies, and to get them rushed to Kilkenny and Thomastown as quickly as possible.  I want the Minister for Agriculture to come to the relief of the suffering farmers along the Dinan and Nore, and I want the Minister for Local Government <Col N="2616" /> to come to the rescue of the householders whose habitations are now ruined&mdash;some for ever&mdash;and cannot be reoccupied.  I want him to take whatever measures can be taken to put these people back in their homes immediately or as early as possible.</P>
    <P>I have raised this matter of the drainage of the Nore so often that I am sick and tired of it, but I want to stress that the people now have made up their minds that somebody has to do the job and that, if they will not do the job, they ought to get out and make way for those people who are prepared to do it.  Again, I want to stress that, although the Minister did think I was taking political advantage of this position, I am not.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that many of the suffering people whose cases I have seen are not supporters of mine. I can assure him, on the contrary, that they are supporters of his Party and I can assure him that many of the farmers who are suffering are supporters of his Party.  I am speaking for them, as well as for the workers and my own people.  Every class in the community are agreed on this.  Every class in the community are demanding drastic and immediate action and every class in the community are expecting it to take place at once.</P>

      <P>I support the appeal made by Deputy Coogan.  I was speaking to a friend from Kilkenny and he told me that an earthquake could not have created greater havoc than these floods have created in Kilkenny and Thomastown.  Deputy Coogan has left very little for anybody else to say. He has put the position clearly and fully, and I rise merely to support him and to ask the Government to do something and to do it quickly, to scrap all rules and regulations which are useful and necessary in normal times, but which must be scrapped in face of an emergency.  I know what it is to deal with people who have been flooded out. Year after year certain parts of Dublin are flooded, and generally what is wanted is food, fuel and clothing and a little money to help the people involved over their difficulties. Whether the Government have power <Col N="2617" /> to give such money, I do not know, but, as the authority in charge, they have, I say, power under any emergency regulations they like to introduce, to provide food, fuel and clothing, and, later on, to compensate them for the losses they have sustained.</P>
      <P>I want to remind the House and the Minister that there are such things as Sweepstake funds for hospital purposes. These funds could be used for the 100 families who have lost their homes and who may shortly become hospital patients, either temporary or permanent.  Before they become hospital patients the Government should appeal to those with money to come to their rescue.  I suggest that if the Red Cross Society, the Sweepstake authorities, the Government and the local council combine, they can ease the burdens of these people, arising out of the recent flooding. I know a very big number of Kilkenny people and I can say that they are a decent, hard-working body of people, who now, in their hour of need deserve not alone the support of our own part of Ireland but of the 32 Counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention to intervene in this debate but for the fact that I recall that our Government has in recent years secured the reputation of being one of the most generous Governments in Europe in the matter of providing both funds and goods for those in distress.  We have now reached a stage at which our Government should realise the truth of the saying that charity begins at home. Never in my five years' experience of this House did I hear a more sorrowful story presented as that presented by Deputy Coogan to-night.  It is a story of facts, as I am sure the Minister for Education will tell us, arising from the serious flooding in his constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the bounden duty of the Government to look after those people who are in distress.  Our own people come first.  In no other part of the country is there the state of affairs that exists at present in Kilkenny.  I represent a constituency neighbouring Kilkenny and I know that the statements that <Col N="2618" /> have been made by Deputy Coogan are true.  It is the duty of the Government to compensate those people.  It is deplorable that those people should have to return to their homes, without furniture, without clothing and in many cases without a proper home to return to.  It is something to which the Government cannot close their eyes.  It would be greatly appreciated if, instead of directing their attention to the distress in Europe, they would direct their attention to the distress that prevails at present in Kilkenny. It is regarded by the country as the Government's duty to look after the interests of these people.</P>
    <P>If the Government want money for this purpose, I am sure all they have to do is to apply to the House and I am convinced that from this side of the House the Government will receive no opposition to the provision of funds for the relief of the deplorable state of affairs in Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>I have so often spoken of the Nore in this House that I am beginning to feel completely weary of making appeals to the Government to have the drainage of the Nore carried out.  This year an appalling state of affairs has arisen. What will be the position next winter? Are the people of Kilkenny and Thomastown and even of my constituency&mdash;where they are affected but not to the extent Deputy Coogan has indicated&mdash;to suffer as a result of the neglect of the Government?  I believe it is neglect on the part of the Government that is responsible for that appalling state of affairs and I am of the opinion that if a proper scheme of drainage were put into effect on the Nore many of the very grave hardships that are being inflicted on these people would cease.</P>
    <P>It is only right, as Deputy Coogan has pointed out, that a message of deep appreciation should go from this House to His Lordship the Bishop of Ossory who has certainly played a man's part in helping the distressed people of Kilkenny.  He has shown by his generous subscription to the relief fund that has been opened his very deep interest in his flock in the diocese of Ossory.  I hope that his appeal will <Col N="2619" /> receive the response it so richly deserves.  I am sorry that the Government are leaving it to the people of Kilkenny and to the generosity of private individuals to finance the people in order that they may return to their former means of livelihood. It is the bounden duty of the Government&mdash;and the Minister cannot deny it &mdash;to see that compensation is paid to those people for their loss.  We should be deeply grateful to God that there was not a severe loss of life.  When there is some huge loss of life in Kilkenny or some other town the Government will wake up to their responsibility to take proper action.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a tendency on the part of the people of Kilkenny, Thomastown and South Laoighis to take the law into their own hands and one cannot blame them in the terrible distress that has come upon them.  The Government must take action.  If they do not want to take it, let them get out and let somebody else in who will take the responsibility of relieving these people in the terrible plight they are in at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Deputy Coogan has greatly exaggerated the consequences of the disaster that fell on Kilkenny and Thomastown during the past week.  It is, I think, well known that the floods of the week caused very widespread damage and loss in many counties but their consequences in Kilkenny were probably greater than elsewhere because they were more concentrated in their effect.  It is, I think, to the credit of the people of Kilkenny that local initiative responded immediately to the needs of the situation and that effective action was taken by individual citizens and organisations of citizens to bring relief to those who have suffered from the flood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An emergency committee was established, consisting of representatives of the Chamber of Commerce, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Red Cross Society, and other organisations, and made immediate arrangements for rendering all possible aid to those who had <Col N="2620" /> to vacate their homes and others who were seriously affected by the floods. From the reports that have reached the Government it is obvious that splendid work has been done by that committee, as was done by similar committees in other towns and districts affected by flood damage.  That committee helped to co-ordinate the efforts of governmental and other authorities to bring the needed aid.  The Department of Defence, through the Curragh Command, made available a quantity of beds and blankets from the Kilkenny military barracks.  The board of health made temporary accommodation available and also a supply of beds and bedding at the Central Hospital.  A number of the families who had to vacate their homes are being given temporary accommodation in the married quarters of the military barracks and the immediate action taken to cope with the crisis does, I think, reflect very favourably upon the spirit of self-help and neighbourliness amongst the people of Kilkenny.  I think the same is true of Thomastown. The information available to me would suggest that, relatively, the consequences of the flood were even more serious at Thomastown than in Kilkenny and a substantial number of traders there have been involved in heavy loss.</P>
    <P>It is true that the bringing of immediate relief to the sufferers is only a part of the problem created by the floods.  The advent of the disaster drew attention to many courses of action which should be taken to prevent the possibility of its recurrence and there are, of course, for the families and the traders concerned, also long-term problems.  A request was conveyed to the Government, through the Minister for Education, on Tuesday last, to authorise the purchase of coal for distribution to persons in urgent need of fuel, and authority to purchase 50 tons of anthracite was granted.  I understand that the distribution of that coal is being undertaken by the local St. Vincent de Paul Society.  To the extent that coal was needed to dry out grain stocks which had been inundated, authority was also issued to firms from which represen- <Col N="2621" /> tations were received.  I should like, however, to remove any impression that the prompt issue of the permits for coal to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul or the traders concerned indicates a position in which coal supplies are ample to meet requirements.  Everybody here knows that that is not the case.  Our coal stocks are almost on the point of exhaustion and the diversion of even these limited supplies of coal to purposes which were not contemplated some days ago inevitably necessitates that other essential purposes for which the coal was being reserved will be deprived of it.  It is unfortunate that this disaster fell on Kilkenny and on the country generally because, of course, the damage done by the flooding was not confined to Kilkenny, at a time when we were passing through a major fuel crisis in which our power to render immediate aid was consequently very limited.</P>
    <P>I have received no representations that there has been a general breakdown in the distribution of bread or flour.  I received from the Minister for Education a list of firms which had particular difficulties and I have arranged to have these difficulties investigated and removed to the extent that it is in my power to do so, but, properly ignoring the exact requirements of the regulations, arrangements were made by the traders, bakers, and millers to make available supplies which, I understand, were ample although some distribution difficulties may have arisen.  Neither have I received any application for special supplies of foodstuffs for bringing immediate relief to distressed families.</P>
    <P>If there is need for such immediate relief I would be prepared to grant facilities to charitable organisations catering for distressed families to obtain supplies of rationed foodstuffs. Apart from the question of compensation for losses, efforts are being made to facilitate the resumption of trading by firms which have been affected by the floods.  An officer of my Department will be in the area to-morrow and will endeavour to ascertain precise details of the position of individual traders.  It is necessary and desirable that the matter should be dealt with in <Col N="2622" /> a systematic and businesslike way and I would particularly ask for the cooperation of local traders' organisations. I understand the local traders' organisation in Kilkenny has already been active in endeavouring to take stock of the position and to see precisely what is required and it is, of course, very largely upon the advice of such organisations that the officer of my Department on the spot will act.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of financial aid, the House is aware that proposals that the Government should provide compensation out of public funds for losses due to flooding or to exceptional weather conditions have been made before in respect of other areas but that in no case have these proposals been adopted.  I think it is obvious that if the precedent were to be established now it could not be departed from and we would have to contemplate a situation in which there might be repeated claims of a similar nature which would undoubtedly be advanced and which would have to be admitted.  Losses due to abnormal weather conditions, flooding and other undeserved causes, arise frequently for traders and individuals and it would be a very serious step for the House to establish the precedent that in all such cases the general taxpayer should be obliged to provide compensation in cash.  Over the whole country there are many thousands of people, I think it would not be inaccurate to say tens of thousands of people, who have lost heavily by reason of bad weather and flooding in the past month and in the past year.  It is not possible for the Government to concede financial assistance to meet such losses in one area or for one class of person without conceding it to every area and to every class.</P>
    <P>The proposal to provide money out of public funds to compensate people in Kilkenny for their losses is a proposal to place a tax upon other people in other areas who have also suffered losses and who in many cases could advance an equivalent claim for compensation. Even during the past weekend floods occurred in other towns and, even if less widespread in their consequences and effects than in Kilkenny <Col N="2623" /> and Thomastown, nevertheless they imposed upon the individuals concerned losses of a similar kind to those suffered in Kilkenny.  Yet from none of these places has there come a proposal that the State should provide cash compensation.  I think that the principle of asking the general taxpayer to relieve local communities of the burden and obligation of helping their neighbours in distress is one that we should be slow to admit.  There is undoubtedly an obligation upon a local community in such circumstances which could be and should be met by local initiative and effort.  I am aware that that effort is being made in Kilkenny and, to the extent that cash assistance is considered desirable, I feel sure that an adequate sum will be raised by the voluntary local effort which is proceeding. I am convinced also that that effort should find support outside the area immediately affected because sympathy with the people of Kilkenny and Thomastown who have endured such losses is very widespread indeed. I think it is necessary to make it clear that the Government does not propose to establish the precedent of asking the general community to meet the losses from flooding in Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>I hope that the efforts which are being made in Kilkenny will enable many of the greater hardships to be alleviated and I feel sure that the local authorities there will not be remiss in taking such measures as are within their power to bring comfort and assistance to the people there.  There is, of course, a necessity for re-establishing traders engaged in the sale of rationed goods, in ensuring that the regulations which are in force for the control of those goods do not operate to prevent them obtaining supplies and meeting the requirements of their customers, and all necessary steps to that end will be taken.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of the repair of houses I think I can assure the Dáil that there will be no difficulty whatever in providing ample supplies of cement.  The position concerning commercial timber is very difficult and I would not like to promise unrestricted <Col N="2624" /> supplies of timber because, even in the abnormal circumstances that obtain in Kilkenny, the most rigid economy in timber must be enforced.  Subject to that economy in relation to timber and other materials, supplies for the necessary repair work will be made available.</P>
    <P>The situation that arose in Kilkenny, the flooding which affected both the town of Kilkenny and Thomastown, has, of course, occurred before and may occur again in similar abnormal weather conditions, and Deputy Coogan was right in stressing the importance of making long-term plans for their prevention or, at any rate, for minimising their possible consequences. I have complete sympathy with the people who, he says, having endured this experience recently, are reluctant to return to their homes.  I think there is an obligation upon the local authority to make provision for alternative homes for the people whose houses have become structurally unsound, or those whose homes are so located that the possibility of flooding will, in bad weather conditions, always be in the minds of their inhabitants.</P>

      <P>I do not know that they lack any power but, if they lack power, that lack will be made good and the Minister for Finance, within the limits of his statutory authority, will give very generous financial assistance to the local authority for the building of new houses.  I feel sure there will be little difficulty in ensuring that further financial assistance will be forthcoming out of the Transition Development Fund.  Certainly I can say that any effort by the local authority to provide new homes for these people, more suitably located, will be amply supported by the Government, financially as well as in making available the necessary materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2625" /> There is no point now in having a discussion upon the problems of arterial drainage.  Every Deputy knows that spasmodic drainage operations, not properly planned, have in the past often created floods where flooding was not a normal occurrence. Many hundreds of thousands of pounds have been put into drainage schemes which were incomplete and which either failed altogether to achieve any alleviation of flooding conditions, or merely operated to transfer a minor flooding risk from one district into a major flooding risk in another district. It was because our experience over a number of years in arterial drainage work made it obvious that arterial drainage could not be done at all unless it is done in accordance with a complete and widespread plan, that a drainage commission was established and that commission's report was accepted without modification by the Government and was the foundation of the legislation passed some time ago.</P>
    <P>To the knowledge of Deputies there are a number of reasons why arterial drainage cannot be done speedily.  If it were in the power of the Government to solve all the drainage problems of the country by a wave of the hand or by some administrative Order, there would be little difficulty about getting it done.  It is because it is necessarily a long-term business, involving examination over a period of time of the flow of water in the rivers and tributaries and the planning of the work so as to avoid the concentration of flooding at particular parts of each river, that it has to proceed slowly.</P>
    <P>I was rather puzzled by the fact that, while Deputy Coogan spoke so emphatically about the need for speedy action in relation to arterial drainage, he stated that the main damage in Kilkenny was done by the River Breagha and was largely attributable to the unsuitability of the old bridges over that small river.  I think that the local authority should be asked to take action immediately to remove unnecessary bridges which are impeding the flow of water and substitute more suitable bridges for those that have to be retained.  I think I can undertake that the Minister for Local Government, <Col N="2626" /> within the limits of his statutory powers, will give financial assistance in that work.  For my part, I will ensure that whatever materials are required will be made available.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Deputy's reference to the flow of water in the Nore being impeded by obstructions under the arches of bridges there would seem to indicate either that the experience of the local authority over a long number of years had created little need for the clearing of these arches, or that there was some failure to appreciate the necessity for keeping them clear.  I do not believe, however, that the local authority will fail to take immediate steps to remedy that defect if the remedying of it would have any beneficial consequences in reducing the risk of flooding.</P>
    <P>So far as all these matters are concerned, I can sum up by saying that the Government will give the fullest possible support to any plans made by the appropriate local authorities, either in relation to the provision of housing, the erection of embankments or cement walls to contain the flow of water, or the repair or reconstruction of bridges.  Any practicable plans along those lines upon which the local authority propose to engage will be supported in every way.  If the local authority feels that to carry out these plans it is necessary to obtain financial support from the Government, then such financial support will be forthcoming, within reasonable limits. Certainly any application from the local authority for financial support for these purposes will have the most sympathetic consideration.  So far as the immediate problems of individuals are concerned, the emergency measures to cope with the urgent consequences of the disaster must obviously be taken on the spot.  They are being taken on the spot by an energetic committee on which no organisation established by the Government could improve.  Whatever help that committee requires will, if possible, be provided.  I have not been informed that they have had any complaints in relation to the distribution of foodstuffs to needy people which has been impeded by the restrictions upon the sale of rationed goods.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2627" /> If they have such complaints that their work, in order to be carried through successfully, requires that special facilities should be given them such facilities will be granted without delay.  The bringing in of supplies to traders whose stocks have been destroyed is being undertaken where the necessity for it has already been brought to our attention and the problem that arises in that connection is being examined on the spot by an officer of the Department.  Certainly I can give the House an undertaking that no red tape will hold up speedy action in that regard.  In the case of traders in drapery goods and similar products speedy action is not so important, but the necessary measures to enable such traders to replenish their stocks will be undertaken.</P>
    <P>In regard to all these matters it is clear that a local investigation of circumstances will be required and it is hoped that in that local investigation responsible traders' organisations will co-operate.  The only aspect of this matter upon which I am unable to agree with the Deputy is the claim that public funds should be utilised to compensate people for losses due to flooding.  That claim has been made in the past from other areas and will, no doubt, be made again in the future because we cannot hope that floods will not arise again at some time in the future.  I think it is much better that local action should provide for the relief of hardship arising from such losses.  Such local action is, in fact, being taken in Kilkenny.  I believe that the local committee, which is taking action down there, is on the right lines and I should like to express my hope that they will receive generous and whole-hearted support, not merely in Kilkenny but from all parts of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me, having listened to the Minister now, that the tremendous initiative and resource shown by the Kilkenny people in dealing with the actual flood&mdash; initiative and resource which were responsible, one might say, for the complete saving of life there in very extraordinary and difficult circumstances <Col N="2628" /> and developing into a committee for the purpose of standing over the situation&mdash;have rather encouraged the Government to wash their hands of any responsibility which would compel them to look frankly at the situation that exists there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to be unfair, but I do say that that suggests itself to me and I would like the Minister to hear me.  In the past it has always been felt that the Government cannot make the taxpayer generally responsible for loss and damage due to flooding, or any other disaster. I think that that fact has prevented the Government somewhat from coming too close to the Kilkenny situation in order to find out exactly the dimensions of the disaster that has overtaken the unfortunate people down there.  It is possible that a disaster, whether through flooding, through fire, or through storm, could bring damage in some particular part of the country which could not be adequately dealt with by any local organisation or by local finances or by way of subscriptions, such as is being done in Kilkenny at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the description of the situation in Kilkenny which we have had both in the daily Press and in the House here to-night from Deputy Coogan, I do not think we are in a position to say that the disaster in Kilkenny is of a kind which does not go beyond the limit with which we can expect local effort and local organisation to cope.  The Minister has indicated that the disaster there has drawn attention to the many courses of action which could be taken to prevent a possibility of such an occurrence in the future.  I do not know what the Minister has in mind, particularly in that regard, and he did not go into detail in the matter.  He indicated that the immediate problem of supplies would only partially solve the difficulty there and that both families and traders would be left with long-term problems.  If a certain number of families and traders are going to be left with long-term problems we have not yet envisaged the situation in all <Col N="2629" /> its aspects properly.  I do not think we are in a position to say that such a situation can be met by locally collected subscriptions or donations of any particular kind from either local people, or even from the country at large.  From the description which we have had I am rather wondering if a local committee, which will deal with the immediate and urgent problems in Kilkenny, is equipped at all to estimate accurately the particular damage done to houses, property, buildings and machinery and make a general assessment of the losses sustained.</P>
    <P>I think that is something which the Government could not expect a local committee to do and I think all the resources of the Office of Public Works on the engineering and surveying side should be placed at the disposal of the committee in order to assess properly the damage done.</P>
    <P>Here in the City of Dublin we had a problem in regard to bomb damage.  In that case there was no question as to whether the State would accept responsibility for paying compensation both for the loss of property and for the loss of goods. Compensation was even paid in the case of people displaced from their work over a particular period.  In recent years we have passed very, very rapidly into a state where the State has come to regard itself as a kind of regular insurance scheme for all its citizens.  Now, there is a certain kind of damage which is passing in its effects.  Land may be flooded but the flood will subside and the land can again come into use.  That is not so in the case of household effects damaged or destroyed by flood.  The people in Kilkenny and Thomastown and all these other areas cannot hope to replace their household effects&mdash;the accumulation of a number of years of effort&mdash;without undertaking an intolerable and superhuman burden.  I think the State should take some responsibility for that and make some effort to help those people re-establish themselves. Damage by flood on such a scale as has taken place in recent weeks is something that cannot be insured against.  The economic well-being of a city and a substantial part of the <Col N="2630" /> country is at stake and I do not think the State can entirely wash its hands of all responsibility.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Government and the Minister not to make up their minds too quickly that the State cannot and must not provide financial assistance to rehabilitate these people.  The small traders cannot re-establish themselves without substantial assistance of one kind or another.  The fact that the Government would appear to have made up their mind that they cannot give financial assistance should not prevent them from taking some responsibility to make a proper survey as to the extent of the disaster.  They should not fix their minds rigidly on the line that the Kilkenny problem is something for which they need accept no responsibility and that it is something in which they must not establish a precedent by offering financial assistance to recoup the people for the losses which they have sustained.</P>
    <P>In a disaster of this magnitude&mdash;and I doubt if there were any occurrences throughout the country equal in magnitude to the Kilkenny disaster&mdash;when the loss is fully envisaged, and the long-term problem of the families, the traders and manufacturers, of whom the Minister speaks, is considered, I doubt if the State can get out of it. I would ask the Minister to provide the local committee with all the assistance the Government can give, which means all the assistance which is necessary, to get the people and traders in the matter of supplies over their present difficulties and that they will also put all the expert assistance they can at the disposal of the local authority so that the damage can be properly assessed.  I think it is only then the Government can safely say that it is a problem that they can wash their hands of.  From the description we have had of the disaster, I doubt if the Government can do that now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that, if at all possible, the drainage Department should send some of their expert engineers to consult with the local engineers so that something may be done as a temporary measure to help the people there?  I am afraid that if <Col N="2631" /> something is not done there will be panic there if ever the river rises again.  I know the official attitude is that drainage of the Nore must be dealt with on a comprehensive basis, but there are a number of responsible citizens in Thomastown and Kilkenny who believe that the removal of the obstructions from the river will improve the situation in both these towns. That may cause flooding of agricultural lands further down the river, but I am afraid that that will have to be faced in order to relieve Kilkenny and Thomastown.  Even at the risk of that, I would suggest that this temporary work should be carried out, because the Parliamentary Secretary and his predecessor have indicated to us that there is no estimate as yet of the number of years that may elapse before the arterial drainage of the Nore can be undertaken.  The situation is such that we cannot wait for that.  I think that some special investigation ought to take place at once to see what can be done to relieve the situation which confronts the people of Kilkenny and Thomastown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>I shall suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should have the position examined, but it does not need any specialised knowledge to understand that the drainage of a river must begin at the estuary and that work up the river which merely expedites the flow of the water, until drainage work is carried out at the estuary, merely makes flooding more certain.  Merely to take action, prompted by local apprehensions, and not based on scientific principles, might be an unwise course there.  On that account, I feel certain that the engineers of the Board of Works would be very hesitant about recommending such a course until they were satisfied as to the consequences both in the immediate locality of the works and further down in the river.</P>

      <P>The alternative is that if we have to wait from 25 to 50 years for the drainage of the Nore we have to face the problem of shifting a large part of the population of Thomastown <Col N="2632" /> and Kilkenny from their present dwellings.  The people living in such areas as Watergate, Irishtown and John's Quay will have to be removed to the higher reaches of the city.  We must either erect some protective works which would minimise the risk of flooding or rehouse some portion of the population.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not know that the high floods in recent weeks have developed as the result of the obstacles in the river and that if we removed these obstacles, the flooding is bound to subside?  The river is at present cluttered up with all sorts of dead timber, sallies, etc., which are impeding the flow of the water.  I am quite satisfied that as a temporary measure we could improve the flow of the water without causing any inundation in the area of the estuary.  If the Minister has any idea of the problem, he must appreciate that a temporary improvement can be effected there without causing any danger to anyone lower down the river.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have intimated that I shall request the Board of Works authorities to investigate that possibility. I do not claim to be an expert, unlike the Deputy, but I know that experience in the past has shown that even drainage works carried out by skilled engineers have been complete failures in many cases and have created floods instead of remedying them.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware of the necessity for the erection of a new school at Cill Mhuire, Lissard, West Cork, to replace the old insanitary building now used; and if, in view of the fact that the efforts made to induce the manager to take action in this matter have, so far, been without result, he will state what further steps he now proposes, with a view to securing the erection of this much-needed school.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the need for the erection of a new school to replace the present Kilmurry Boys' and Girls' National Schools, Lissard, County Cork.  My Department has been in correspondence with the manager in the case over a prolonged period, but certain preliminary steps have still to be taken on the manager's part before a grant can be sanctioned from State funds towards the cost of the new school.  Every effort will be made by my Department to have the case expedited, with a view to enabling a grant to be sanctioned and the erection of the new school to be proceeded with as soon as possible.</P>
