    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether, in order to promote cordial relations with the Parliaments of Commonwealth Nations, he will take such steps as may be practicable to promote the Parliamentary Association (Irish Branch), which caters for Commonwealth Parliaments and the United States Congress, in Oireachtas Éireann, for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach) Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire very much to promote the most cordial relations possible with other Parliaments, particularly with the Parliaments of the States of the British Commonwealth and with the Congress of the United States.  I do not consider, however, that the Empire Parliamentary Association, in its present title and form, is suitable for that purpose in our case.  The word &ldquo;Empire&rdquo; does not apply to this country, and, therefore, our participation in an association so entitled would tend to create misunderstanding, both at home and abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the United States of America is not a State member of the British Empire?  Is he further aware that the self-governing Dominions of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa are not members of the Empire and that at least some of them share our view that that was a bloody and undesirable organisation, and take pride in the fact that they shared with us the task of converting that Empire into a Commonwealth and, in view of <Col N="1310" /> the fact that we played no small part in converting an Empire of evil memory into the Commonwealth it is to-day, why does the Taoiseach continue to obstruct the efforts to promote the Parliamentary Association in this Dáil, when it is active in every other Commonwealth Parliament and when it has established friendly relations with the United States Congress?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the opinion of the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will tell me?  He says the word &ldquo;Empire&rdquo; grates upon his ear.  Does he recall that neither this country nor the five other States I have mentioned&mdash; Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and the United States of America&mdash;admit they are members of an Empire, but four of them share membership in the Commonwealth and one is an independent republic on its own?  Why is it beneath our dignity to enter into an association into which the United States of America and Canada and the Union of South Africa are prepared to enter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the association is of the Congress of the United States.  I know there was some arrangement being made by which there would be circulation of some Congress news in a journal of the Empire Parliamentary Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that at meetings of the association members of Congress have attended as representing the Houses of Congress, and is he aware that the Union of South Africa, which asserts its membership of the Commonwealth as distinct from Empire, has always been a member of the association and, if it is acceptable to the successors of Botha and de Wet, surely it should be acceptable to even so ardent a patriot as the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only to state that if we were members of the Empire Parliamentary Association it would lead to a misunderstanding which would be undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we not members of the Imperial Institute of Technology? Do we not belong to various Imperial Research Bureaux which come under the Department of Agriculture, and do we not appropriate moneys every year for our subscriptions to these bodies? Does that misrepresent our position, or is it because the Minister is not the big shot in this organisation that he does not want to become a member?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that serious inconvenience is occasioned to the rural community in the Kanturk and Newmarket, County Cork, districts by the fact that no distributing and receiving depôt for the accommodation of their goods is available in <Col N="1312" /> those towns since the closing down of the Córas Iompair Éireann goods stores; and if so, if he will direct Córas Iompair Éireann to reopen these goods stores to serve as depôts, as the present service by lorry, without such depôts, is unsatisfactory and expensive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by Córas Iompair Éireann that they are providing a door-to-door road service for goods in the Newmarket and Kanturk areas.  The goods depôt at Newmarket has not been closed and the depôt at Kanturk has been temporarily reopened for traffic.  The question of keeping the Kanturk depôt open is being examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state why Robert Fletcher, Stramillion, Monasterevan, County Kildare, a county council worker, was refused a supplementary bread allowance by his Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Fletcher's application was refused because he was not engaged in a class of employment to which the scheme for the grant of supplementary bread allowances applied at the time of his application. Mr. Fletcher was informed on the 21st instant that I am now prepared to accept an application from him and the necessary form has been despatched to him.</P>

      <P>The preparation of a draft of a White Paper on the reorganisation and extension of the health services had, as the Deputy indicates, reached an advanced stage of preparation a year ago and it was hoped at that time that it would be soon published.  Then it was subsequently <Col N="1315" /> decided to establish a new Department of Health under a separate Minister, further consideration of the White Paper had to be deferred until the new Minister had been appointed and assumed responsibility for the statutory functions involved.  Since I was recently accorded responsibility for the administration of the Department of Health, I have been giving close consideration to the matters of policy to be reviewed in the programme of reform.  I am not yet in a position to indicate the precise date by which the White Paper will be published, but it is my earnest desire that it be made available for public consideration at the earliest possible date and I am pressing forward its preparation accordingly.</P>

It will take the form of a Statutory Order, copies of which will be laid on the Table of the House.  As is suggested in the question, the material for a reprint of the existing rules in consolidated form was completed more than a year ago. A mere reprint would, however, have necessitated close adherence to the text of the existing rules, which frequently called for modernisation and improvement.  It was, therefore, thought better to have the text redrafted by the Parliamentary draftsman as a Statutory Order in modern form.  This occupied a considerable time.  The balance of the delay was due to printing difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In my statement during the debate on the adjournment on 17th April and in my reply to a question in this House on Tuesday, 22nd April, I have already given information in regard to the losses of live stock suffered by farmers as a result of the abnormal weather in recent months. There is nothing of substance I have to add to the information already given.  The reports received by me were of a sufficiently serious nature to warrant my introducing the special scheme announced on Tuesday last. The following are the main features of the scheme:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Farmers who suffered abnormal losses of cattle and sheep as a result of the severe weather in the early months of 1947 will be eligible for interest-free loans, to be used for the purchase of cattle and sheep.</P>
      <P>The loans will be repayable in four instalments over a period of four years, but the first instalment will not fall due until 18 months after a loan is issued.</P>
      <P>Two sureties will be required in each case.</P>
      <P>As a general rule, the maximum amount of a loan will be limited to five times the poor law valuation of the applicant's holding.</P>
      <P>Applications for loans will be made to the Department of Agriculture, which will investigate them in detail through its local offices.</P>
      <P>The loans will be issued by the Agricultural Credit Corporation, Limited, on the recommendation of my Department and repayment will accordingly be made by the borrower to the corporation.</P>
      <P>The latest date for the receipt of applications for loans is 31st May, 1947.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in certain mountain areas losses have been very severe and that in these areas it may be difficult for very poor farmers who have lost practically all their stock to obtain sureties?  Does <Col N="1323" /> the Minister not realise that there is a danger that people who have suffered very acutely may not be able to avail of this loan scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the possibility of perhaps some cases of the type to which the Deputy has referred, but I think he will realise that, since there is no question of an investigation of title and no question of taking a mortgage, we must have some security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider as an alternative in such cases that a loan for a smaller amount might be granted to people unable to obtain these sureties?  A loan of twice the poor law valuation might relieve people in very desperate circumstances and would not involve too heavy a burden on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

Schemes somewhat similar to this have been administered in previous years.  They have been administered on the basis of the applicants supplying sureties of the type I have in mind, and, throwing my mind back to that period, I cannot say that I can recollect any farmers who were unable to get the two sureties provided for here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides that the head of the judiciary shall be the chairman of a board, the function of which it is to take seisin of a matter which this House is asked to withdraw from the jurisdiction of the very judiciary over which the Chief Justice presides. Let us consider what that means. In this country, there is a Constitution, and the aim and object of that Constitution is that, if at any time the Executive of this State seeks to infringe the fundamental rights of one humble citizen standing absolutely alone, that citizen can appeal to the judiciary. They stand in a position of independence and security which enables any one amongst them, from the Chief Justice down to the puisne judge, to restrain by order of the court the Executive from doing anything until such time as the Executive has appeared before the judge and satisfied that judge that the thing they propose to do is in accordance not only with the statute law but with the Constitution which controls all statute law. Mrs. Buckley and other plaintiffs come into court.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Deputy to look at Section 10.  This is a question of whether the Chief Justice should be chairman of the court, and if the Deputy looks at Section 10, he will see that the staying and dismissal of the pending action is in that section. On the previous day&mdash;I looked it up here&mdash;there were 20 columns of debate and that debate ranged over the personnel of the courts, the disposal of the funds, the fitness of the board, the plaintiffs and the removal from the courts.  We cannot have a duplicate debate.  There is ample opportunity of debating the matter on which the Deputy is now speaking on Section 10, where it is quite relevant.  I submit that we might dispose of Section 4 on the question whether or not the chairman of the trust board shall be the Chief Justice.  The Deputy will appreciate that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate the Chair's feeling in the matter and its anxiety to provide for the expeditious disposal of public business, but I am sure the Chair will also understand the view of one who feels that the appointment of the Chief Justice to a position such as that envisaged in this Bill is a most loathsome outrage on the law &mdash;shameful, disgraceful and wholly inexplicable.  With due respect, I shall not let it pass without expressing my amazement that the head of the judiciary was ever a party, as he is alleged to have been a party, to this shocking transaction.  I am disgusted and horrified that the political head of a Government should have gone to the Chief Justice with any such request as the Taoiseach admits having addressed to him.  Consider the facts.  Mrs. Buckley, a citizen of this State, of the merits of whose case I know nothing, claiming to have a right&mdash;no more than that&mdash;moves in the courts.  The Taoiseach, on the Second Stage of the Bill, knowing more of the circumstances of this lady and her associates than I, says she is poor, insignificant, so lacking in means that she has not the wherewithal to prosecute her suit. I have never heard in any other democratic country such adjectives used to disqualify a litigant.  The courts are there to protect the poor, the insignificant and the weak.  The tariff racketeers, the profiteers and the subscribers to the Government funds &mdash;are these the people the court must protect?  They are well able to protect themselves.  It is just for such a person as this, who is poor, insignificant and put to the limits of her resources to finance the means of putting the courts in action that the independence of the judiciary has been established.  It appals and shocks me that the Chief Justice of Ireland would allow his name and high position to be associated with the proposition that because someone is poor, insignificant, bereft of resources and unable to prosecute her suit, she should be denied the protection of the court, that the Chief Justice should be told she will not be allowed to tell her tale before the courts because it might not suit the <Col N="1336" /> Government of the day.  I have the horrid feeling that we are witness here to a grave and irretrievable step downwards. I have seen many things that were precious to liberty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir.  The horrible feature of this is that the Chief Justice is brought in.  If the Taoiseach had proposed to come in, set the judiciary aside and establish a Parliamentary tribunal before which this thing could be consummated and done, then we might, at least, think of the judiciary resenting this procedure, remaining silent but indignant at this trespass on their rights and we might hope that, when we brought this Bill before them &mdash;as I am happy to think the Leader of the Opposition will most certainly do &mdash;and asked them to pronounce upon its constitutionality, we would not be in the position of asking the judges of the courts to declare that the Chief Justice himself is not fit for the office he holds.  Remember, if we bring this Bill before the court, sitting on the bench before us, presiding over the court that is to try the constitutionality of the Bill is the Chief Justice, who, if we are to take the Taoiseach's word, has been consulted and has declared his readiness to be a party to this shameless and disgraceful transaction.  What is terrifying me is that I see Deputies in this House&mdash;many of them knowing as well as I do the gravity and the evil of this thing&mdash;who are ashamed or afraid to take their stand.  Some are so silly that they do not understand. Some do not realise the catastrophe it is for freemen when in the State in which they live the independence of the judiciary is gone.  They do not realise that because they have grown up under the safe protection of the law.  They do not remember the day when the mere Irish were denied that protection, when any minion of the Executive could trample their rights under foot just for being Irish or Catholic.  They were faced with the horrid knowledge that there was no tribunal to which they might appeal.  If the Chief Justice of this State presides over this tribunal, we are faced with the position that <Col N="1337" /> either he ceases to be Chief Justice or one of the most precious qualities of the judiciary, who are trustees of our liberties, is gone.  There is no escape from that.</P>
      <P>Even at this eleventh hour, I ask the Taoiseach to withdraw this section. I ask him to consider the position that will exist when that Bill comes before the Supreme Court, if, as I hope he will, the President directs that this matter be referred to the Supreme Court for prior determination as to its constitutionality before he signs it.  If the court over which that Chief Justice presides determines that the instrument setting up the tribunal over which the Chief Justice has himself consented to preside, violates the fundamental rights of our people and had it been allowed to pass would have resulted in the denial of justice to poor insignificant, ineffective people, what will the Chief Justice do? If it be found that this strikes the foundation of the Constitution, if it be established on the Taoiseach's authority that the Chief Justice himself had a hand in it, can he continue to sit upon the bench as the protector of the Constitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I challenge the Taoiseach now to justify to this House the proposition that the Chief Justice should preside over the tribunal the function of which is to deliberate matters that have been withdrawn from that Chief Justice's jurisdiction by the intervention of the Legislature during the process of the litigation in question.  I ask the Taoiseach to tell us, in his judgment, what the Chief Justice's position would be if the majority of his brethren on the Supreme Court Bench held this Bill to be a flagrant violation of the Constitution.  I ask the Taoiseach to tell us if he has, since the Second Stage of this Bill was before the House, called the Attorney-General and asked him to give him a true record of what passed between the Attorney-General and the Chief Justice when the Attorney-General approached the Chief Justice as the messenger of the Executive.  Did he tell the Chief Justice the full nature of the thing it was proposed to do? Are we to take it that the Chief Justice, having been apprised of the <Col N="1338" /> nature of this transaction, approved it?</P>
    <P>Are we to learn to-day that, before the issue as to whether this law conformed with the Constitution or not was ever argued in the High Court, the Chief Justice has gone on record as approving it and declaring it to be that which he is bound by oath to determine judicially only after he has heard both sides and given due consideration to the arguments laid before him?  Let the Taoiseach answer these questions and let the Deputies of this House who may have failed to realise the significance of what they are doing in this Bill open their eyes now, before it is too late.  Here is the very cornerstone of liberty.  The office of Chief Justice is the key-stone of the arch of freedom in our society.  Fracture that and all will ultimately come down.  Inevitably, if this section passes, the office of Chief Justice is disreputable in the land.  The man who made it so, the Taoiseach, who is responsible for this proposal, has done very few things in his career for which there was not a purpose and the man who strikes at the independence of the judiciary, the man who shakes the confidence of the people in their ability to get from the judiciary that protection without which democratic freemen cannot live, and has a purpose for so doing, must have lost the scruples that a man who really loves liberty should entertain.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Taoiseach to justify this thing; he knows he cannot.  In a panic, to avoid a silly political exposure of his silly illogical past, to avoid being shown up in the courts, saying on the one hand that Sinn Féin collapsed in 1924 and on the other that he was president of Sinn Féin in 1926, he is prepared to jeopardise the very judiciary itself, to shake the foundation of the constitutional position of every citizen of this State.  To such extremities will vanity carry a man.  If he cannot save himself, then I say to those around him: &ldquo;Save him from himself and prevent him from persisting in this most wicked undertaking.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the position is even more despicable than Deputy Dillon suggests.  Deputy Dillon has pointed out the Chief Justice <Col N="1339" /> as acting in this matter against people because they are poor and insignificant, but I think that the Chief Justice also is being made a tool of the ruling Party and, in a manner humiliating to his office and humiliating to his person, he is showing that he is incapable of resisting being made a tool of the Party that put him into the office in which he is.  He is doing it in full and secure knowledge of the blow that he is striking at our courts as independent institutions which ought to act independently and in clear knowledge of each particular case.  The Taoiseach stated on the 20th March, at column 2532:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When I heard quite recently that the bill of the defendants had already gone up to something like £5,000 I asked myself: `how long more will this continue and what will be left? Are we going to have the old thing that where money is disputed the whole money goes in legal costs'.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The claim that we are asked to brush aside as not proper to be decided by the courts is one in which the defendants in the action have already thought it worth their while to spend £5,000.  They have spent that in preparations to meet the case and the claim that has been put up against it. Surely, that very figure and the enormous amount of work that the defence felt themselves called upon to do in order to resist the claim is evidence enough that there was some kind of case to be met in the courts.  Any Chief Justice, even if he had little respect for his office when it was a question of being ordered by his Party to submit to their wishes in the matter, would realise that here was a case which, with the enormity of the work that had to be done to meet it, showed that it was a case that should be left and should be decided by the courts.  In this matter the Chief Justice is simply submitting himself as a tool to the ruling Party that put him into power, and in that way he has shown, as has been said before, that he is not fit to occupy the position into which he has been put&mdash; that he is degrading his own personality and that he is degrading the office which, in the interests of the country as a whole, he should be very scrupulous <Col N="1340" /> to adorn, and adorn in an independent spirit.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In this case the Chief Justice was asked by the Attorney-General whether he would act in case the Dáil passed this Bill and in case such a body for the disposal of the funds was set up.

      <P>Here we have a case that at this hour of the day the Taoiseach and every-body else might very well look at with a detached mind&mdash;that is as to how these funds were to be disposed of. They might very well look at that in a detached way.  A case might be made by any body of citizens before the courts for a claim to these moneys. They could wait for a court decision on that matter.  I am perfectly clear in my mind as to what the decision of the courts on the claim of any body in the country to these funds would most likely be.  After leaving the case lie before the courts for years, and after leaving the trustees expend, as the Taoiseach has indicated, up to £5,000 for the defence, then suddenly and for no purpose that we know of the Government step into the matter.</P>

The courts are being humiliated and despised by the action of the Legislature in this particular kind of way. The Chief Justice agrees and in that dirty mess he offers to sit himself as the chairman of a group to decide what is going to be done with these funds.  I think that the action of the Government in the matter of putting the Chief Justice into this particular position is disgusting and despicable.

      <P>Will I not?  I always enjoy the &ldquo;poluphloisboios thalassa&rdquo; from the opposite benches.  The attack here on the Chief Justice is something that is new to this House. It is an attack that has not the slightest justification for it.  What is proposed in this section is that if this Bill is passed&mdash;it will be null and void if it is not passed constitutionally: this board would not be set up if the Bill did not pass and was not held to be constitutional if it was questioned&mdash; and the board was set up, in that event the Chief Justice should either act as chairman of the board which was legitimately set up by the will of the Oireachtas, or, more probably, that he should nominate a chairman to act as chairman of the board.  That is not a new thing in Bills.  That type of proposal is found in quite a lot of Bills where it is a question of getting somebody to act as chairman or of nominating a chairman, so that there will be no suspicion of want of integrity.  One would imagine that, in agreeing to act in these circumstances, the Chief Justice was guilty of some heinous crime&mdash; that he was a party to the whole of <Col N="1343" /> these transactions as the Opposition claim to put it.  He was a party to nothing further than to consent to become chairman if and when this body was set up, and it could not be set up unless it was set up legally and properly. One would imagine that he was going to derive some advantage from its being set up which was going to influence his judgment in any other particular position in which he might be called upon to act. What advantage is he going to get? The advantage of sitting in a very difficult position to decide, if applicants come for help under the Bill, whether they were properly entitled to it.  It is not the sort of thing that one goes running after.  It is an onerous duty. When the Chief Justice or any other judge is named in a Bill and asked to perform functions of that sort, he is approached in the spirit of asking a person to perform a public duty, a duty which he does not have to perform. We had to appoint a tribunal not very long ago.  When the judges were asked to sit on that tribunal over and above their ordinary work, one asked them simply to perform a public duty.  They are asked to perform that public duty because they are considered as being persons above reproach in regard to their conduct of it.  It is suggested that this might come before the Supreme Court.  Nobody here, at any stage of this Bill, has suggested any ground on which it could be held to be unconstitutional.</P>

But, suppose it were contested <Col N="1344" /> and that it was referred by the President to the Supreme Court, do you think that the Chief Justice, because he gave a conditional promise that he would act as chairman if this board was set up, on the understanding, of course, that the Bill was constitutional, was legal, would be in any way prevented from sitting on that bench and giving a fair judgment as to whether it was constitutional or not?</P>

      <P>He has not consented to anything except to the contingent possibility that if this board is set up and set up legally, in that event, he will act as chairman.  That is not in any way becoming a party to the consideration as to whether it is legal, constitutional, or anything else.  I have just as good an appreciation as the Deputy has of what a judge in a case like that ought to be concerned with and I see no reason why the Chief Justice, if this matter was brought before him as a result of action by the President for consideration, should have the slightest hesitation in sitting upon that court beside his colleagues and deciding upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only those who wish to attribute wrong motives to people, as the Deputies yonder have done, who would have such thoughts in their minds.  This clause in the Bill was put in because it was considered that it was in the public interest that if this board was set up there should be as chairman of it a person who would be above reproach as far as the disposition of the funds that would be at the disposal of the board is concerned.  That, and that <Col N="1345" /> only, was the consideration that prompted the chairman being mentioned in the Bill as the Chief Justice or a person whom the Chief Justice might appoint.  All this nonsense, this attempt to disparage the Chief Justice, either as far as his judgment was concerned or his position was concerned, is the despicable thing that has happened in this debate.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition, when he began, did so in a different way. One has only to read, as we will when we come to deal with this in a more appropriate place, what the Deputy said when the thing was begun.  But he had not at that time met his legal colleagues.  He had not at that time considered with them what was going to be the plan of attack upon this Bill. He approached it then, on its First Reading, in the way that one would expect this matter would be approached in this House but it was thought a suitable line of attack to attack the Chief Justice and to attack us, the Executive, in this particular case and to suggest that because the Chief Justice was asked, as he had been asked in numbers of Bills, to act in a capacity as an impartial chairman, that there was some connivance between him and us at sapping the independence of the judiciary.  The whole thing is make-believe and the country understands it as such.  We have listened to the Deputy talking about this poor woman.  I did not speak about her wealth or otherwise.  I spoke of the body.  When I was speaking about this I said that the body that claimed these funds was an insignificant body compared with the organisation to which the funds were originally subscribed.</P>

      <P>I used the words &ldquo;originally subscribed&rdquo; and I did that, not to say that because she was poor she should not get justice, but to point out to the House that the organisation claiming these funds was not by any means in substance the same sort of organisation as the organisation to which the funds had been originally subscribed.  It was for that reason that the body was mentioned <Col N="1346" /> as an insignificant body.  The Deputy, of course, is only anxious always to get some basis on which he can ride off, or pretend to be riding off, on high principles.  He wanted then to pretend that the reason why I had introduced that at the start was that they were of this sort that they were not entitled to get justice.  The whole thing is absurd.</P>

      <P>Not a bit of it.  Shrewd, calculating and resolute, he knows the nature of what he is doing but in this he sins against the light.  This device of inviting the Chief Justice, under Section 4, had no other purpose, he says, than to secure that there should be impartiality as between the parties. In his own Second Reading speech he made it perfectly clear that it was not an occasion for detached impartiality, that it was an occasion when the heirs to a great political organisation could be allowed to dispose of the funds that belonged to that organisation.  I have no reason to complain of that.  Why should not they?  But the issue joined in action here is, who are the heirs? It is a new principle in law if one of the claimants shall use his machined majority in an acquiescent Party to trample on the rights of the other by legislation steamrolled through this House <i>ad hoc.</i>  Does anyone imagine that that is what was in his mind? He talks of the people down the country understanding whatever the Opposition say.  He very rarely reveals his inner thoughts, but there is the key in the purpose of this section. He wants to deny to Mrs. Buckley and the other trustees the protection of the courts but he does not want the people down the country to understand what he is doing.  He wants to be able to say to the people down the country: &ldquo;I do not prevent her from appearing before the judge.  Here is the Bill. The Chief Justice himself, I say, shall be the judge.  Who says I denied her access to the courts?  I gave her access to the Chief Justice to ensure that justice and equity would be done.&rdquo;  He <Col N="1347" /> has persuaded a big body of our people, and a large number of Deputies in this House will say to themselves: &ldquo;Well after all, if all the Taoiseach did was to remove the matter from Judge Davitt's hands and put it into the Chief Justice's hands, what harm did that do Mrs. Buckley?&rdquo; The Taoiseach did not come down in yesterday's shower.  There are very few people who can thread their ways through his labyrinthine mind.  There are very few people in this country who understand better than he how to fool our people. I do not claim to be able to counterfeit his subtleness, resourcefulness and unscrupulousness.  But this much at least will be said, so that those who read it, if they want to read it, will not surrender these precious rights. I am happy to think that we have the assurance of the leader of the Opposition that every legal resource at our disposal will be employed to prevent the President signing this damnable Bill.</P>

Here is a new departure&mdash;a judge's person brought into discussion in the Dáil.&rdquo; He has never heard the like.  Has ever anyone in any democratic Legislature in the world seen the like of that Bill? Is it not true that in any other circumstances had the Chief Justice's person become the subject of debate in this House the Ceann Comhairle would have remonstrated?  He would have forbidden the Deputy to proceed and every one of us would have known that he was right.  Why is he silent now? Why have we the right to argue the merits of the Chief Justice's person? Why are we within the Rules of Order in canvassing his name up and down the floor?  Because the Taoiseach sought to use him, sought to shelter under it, in that disreputable sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the facts?  Let us canvass them carefully and examine them specifically.  We do so on the Taoiseach's own authority and I do so at some length and in detail.  The Taoiseach says, with poison dripping from his tongue, it is suggested by the Opposition that the Chief Justice will be partial if this Bill should come before him&mdash;that he will act against his conscience.  Who ever suggested that? No one in this House suggests that it is the intention of the Chief Justice in any conceivable circumstances to act against his conscience.  If this Bill is brought before his court&mdash;and there is no other court before which it can be brought&mdash;his four brother judges on the bench beside him are in this dilemma that, if they condemn the Bill as a grave infringement of the Constitution, they say by implication before the country that the Chief Justice himself was a party to a trespass on the Constitution and in a case where he himself knew that one of the parties was insignificant and poor, and for those reasons are gravely embarrassed in the prosecution of our cause, whether it was well-advised or ill-advised to initiate it.  The Taoiseach said: &ldquo;I never said she was poor.&rdquo;  He did.  He said: &ldquo;So insignificant were these plaintiffs that they could not even raise the money to pay their bills.&rdquo;  That was the sneer.  He said they were unimportant people, so insignificant that they could not raise the money to pay their bills.  He was right.  They are poor and insignificant and, to judge by their correspondence, exceedingly silly. Belonging to the Party to which they do, I would not expect them to be anything else.  But, because they are poor and silly and insignificant, that is no reason to deny their rights under the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1349" /> The Taoiseach gets into a passion when I say that the Chief Justice is a party to this Bill.  As reported in column 744, Volume 105, `No. 5' of the Official Reports, in the initial stages of the discussion on this section, the Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Deputy is an adept at the false suggestion.  He suggests, first of all, that the discussion here could have been anticipated.  The Attorney, I take it who went to the Chief Justice, could, in the Deputy's view, have anticipated what would be stated here in the course of the debate.  Everybody knows it would be quite impossible to anticipate it. When I came to this House with the Bill, I came on the grounds...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach then proceeds to state the grounds.  Then, as reported in column 746, the Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In this case the Chief Justice was asked by the Attorney-General whether he would act in case the Dáil passed this Bill and in case such a body for the disposal of the funds was set up.  I understood he accepted that and that is why, when I was asked about this before, I said the Chief Justice had been consulted; but the idea, when consulting the Chief Justice, that one could anticipate the phrases used here in connection with any argument that might arise, is clearly absurd.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Maybe I am only a simple creature.  I know it takes a subtle mind to understand the Taoiseach.  But does the paragraph I read out contain the implication that the Chief Justice was consulted?  Does it or does it not? Let us read it again:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In this case the Chief Justice was asked by the Attorney-General whether he would act in case the Dáil passed this Bill and in case such a body for the disposal of the funds was set up.  I understood he accepted that and that is why, when I was asked about this before, I said the Chief Justice had been consulted;...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is there some strange subtlety of meaning concealed in these words which cannot be deciphered except by <Col N="1350" /> reference to a dictionary which has caused me to use a paraphrase calculated to justify the rousing of the wrath and indignation of the Taoiseach?  He, as Deputies will remember, was walloping the table not ten minutes ago because somebody said that the Chief Justice had been consulted.  I said it&mdash;on the authority of the Taoiseach.  I said he was consulted.</P>
    <P>I want to know, when counsel who are instructed appear before the Chief Justice to argue that the Bill about which he was consulted is unconstitutional and should be so declared by him, are we to believe that his four brethren on the bench can be asked reasonably to declare that the Bill is unconstitutional and that, in so far as the Chief Justice was consulted, he gravely erred in giving his assent? Because, if we are, remember that in a matter of this kind there is only one judgment of the court.  In their prior discussion, the justices may have various opinions, but, finally, they will take a decision as a court and that is the decision that will be communicated to the public, to the Oireachtas, and to the President.  Are we to take it that the people of this country will be edified and their confidence in the Chief Justice confirmed and strengthened by the picture of that same Chief Justice delivering a judgment of his own court to the effect that, &ldquo;this Bill is so grave a trespass on the fundamental rights of the citizens of this country, as guaranteed by the Constitution, that we forbid the President to sign&rdquo; or that, &ldquo;I was consulted before it was brought before us and I undertook to function under it and I was a party to the procedure&rdquo; which it will become the duty of this House to discuss when Section 10 is before us?</P>
    <P>Is there a single Deputy who considers that the interests of law, of propriety, of confidence in the judiciary, or any useful purpose can be served by the retention of this disgusting section? Is there any other country in the world save this where the Chief Justice could survive the commission of such a blunder?  Possibly he has allowed himself to be walked into this. Possibly he did not realise the implications of the thing he was doing.  But <Col N="1351" /> is there anyone on any side of this House who knows anything about jurisprudence or the principles underlying the law who will get up and make a case on its merits for the head of a judiciary to accept in advance the chairmanship of a tribunal to which a cause is about to be referred by <i>ad hoc</i> legislation which has been taken out of the seisin of the court over which he presides and which should never have got into their seisin if those courts did not believe it to be a proper matter for the courts to determine?</P>
    <P>Four long years this matter has rested upon the records of the courts over which the Chief Justice presides. Could there be more conclusive testimony that the judiciary of this country felt that it was a proper matter for judicial examination and determination, because that is what matters, not the prudence of the litigants, not the ability of the counsel that represented them or the diligence of the attornies who prepared their cause, but the simple, unqualified question, though they be foolish, though they be improvident, though they be poor and insignificant, had they a right, under the law, to the protection of the judges?  The whole judiciary over which the Chief Justice presides, have, by their action, made it manifest that they think they have.  I dare the Taoiseach to deny&mdash;&mdash;</P>

But in all our trials, never once before has the attempt been made to set aside the judiciary and, at the same time, for the benefit of the people down the country, employ the Chief Justice as the chairman of an <i>ah hoc</i> tribunal for the purpose of persuading the people down the country that the judicial character of the proceedings was not going to be seriously disturbed.  If this thing is done, we will all live to regret it, except, perhaps, the Taoiseach, because I am not persuaded that he does not know what he is doing.  I am beginning to think he does.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach tries to excuse the action of the Chief Justice in this matter by suggesting that it has been put to him in this particular way: &ldquo;Are you prepared to obey the will of the Oireachtas?&rdquo; If the will of the Oireachtas expressed in this Bill puts him into Section 4 as the person to act as chairman of a committee to disburse funds taken away from the jurisdiction of the trustees and taken away from a review by the courts, a point arises as to the will of the Oireachtas.  I am sorry Deputy Kennedy is leaving the House, because I was glad to hear somebody besides the Taoiseach raising his voice in this matter. &ldquo;`Are you prepared to accept the will of the Oireachtas?&rdquo; That is how the Chief Justice accepted this position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the will of the Oireachtas? Surely the will of the Oireachtas is something that is expressed by vote after it is discussed in the House?  But what discussion are we having here? In the vote on the Second Stage every Party in the House, except the Government's Party, voted against these proposals. The only voice we heard from the Government Party was the voice of the Taoiseach.  It has been suggested he is interested in a particular way in getting this action stopped.  Let us get away from that.  The Chief <Col N="1354" /> Justice was asked if he was prepared to accept the will of the Oireachtas. Let us hear the mind of the Oireachtas first, and then it can express its will by a vote.  Will any member of the Government Party put to us the reason why he thinks the Chief Justice should be put into this position?</P>
    <P>We do not want to repeat things or elaborate points, but here is a case which, by a particular plaintiff, was taken before the courts and was accepted by the courts as a case properly to be tried.  The defendant had to go to such extremes of preparation to meet the case that £5,000 was spent to date.  Will any member of the Government Party argue that, in a country where we expect the courts to be independent of the Executive, a case of that kind should be taken out of the courts and an Act passed here, and that it should be passed here against the wishes of every Party in the House except the Government Party?  Do not have it said, or do not put us in the position in which it can be said, that the will of the Oireachtas was expressed in such a way that after arguments were put up here on a particular question, the members of the Government Party met behind closed doors and that then the Taoiseach came here and rammed the decision of that Party meeting down the throats of members of other sections of the Oireachtas by the silent weight of the Government Party marching into the Lobby.</P>
    <P>I ask the members of the Government Party to discuss this matter with us.  We are now on the net point of the Chief Justice.  The Taoiseach has indicated the situation in which we are all placed by putting the Chief Justice into the position in which he agrees beforehand to sit on this committee and to act as chairman of the committee. We have as a constitutional safeguard the provision that we can appeal to the President in certain circumstances and by a certain routine, if we consider that an Act passed through the Oireachtas is unconstitutional or offends against the Constitution. Having gone through that routine, the President can refer the <Col N="1355" /> matter to the Supreme Court after having heard the representations put up to him and having consulted with the Council of State.  However, by bringing the Chief Justice into a measure of this kind in this way, even that safeguard is almost taken away from us because the Chief Justice is committed beforehand to the general provisions of this Bill.  He is committed to them in so far as he is going to accept the chairmanship of the committee which is to take charge of the funds that are the subject of the action before the courts.  If we are talking of the will of the Oireachtas, then I appeal to members of the Government Party to let us hear something of their will in the matter because it is nothing less than sandbagging the Oireachtas and sandbagging even the Presidential office in the matter, if proposals of this character are to be pushed through this House by the Taoiseach bringing in a Bill here, giving his own arguments and interpretation of it and using the silent weight of the votes of his Party in the House and putting it through against the desire of every other member, whether belonging to a Party or an Independent.</P>

      <P>Lest it might be thought that this Bill affects only Deputies Dillon and Mulcahy, I would like to say, while not a lawyer but one who has always had great respect for the law and who generally takes a great interest in cases of major importance, that I am very interested in this Bill.  On the Second Reading of the measure I think I put a point which the Taoiseach seemed to have over-looked, namely, that seeing the amount of money that would have to be paid to this tribunal for the administration of these funds, it was scarcely worth while, in fact that it was a waste of time, to introduce a Bill of this nature. I understood at the conclusion of that debate that the Taoiseach was more or less prepared to withdraw the Bill or at least to endeavour to secure unanimity as to the form the Bill should take.  Again as a layman, as a man of common sense, and as one who, though not a lawyer, knows that the <Col N="1356" /> law when boiled down is nothing more or less than common sense, I want to put a straight question as man to man to the Taoiseach.  Do not let him accuse me of playing a political game because I have been 20 years here, elected on my own record, without playing politics.  I want to make that clear.  Why was there any necessity to consult the Chief Justice prior to the introduction of this Bill?  I want to know is it customary for any Government when introducing a Bill, let it be a Sinn Féin Funds Bill, an Industrial Bill or a Finance Bill, to consult the Chief Justice before that Bill is introduced and ask the Chief Justice what his attitude will be in the event of the Dáil passing the Bill.  That is a blunt question, subject to no variations, and I want a straight answer to it.</P>
      <P>Again, I want to put it straight to the Taoiseach: what was the subject-matter of the discourse that took place during the interview between the Attorney-General and the Chief Justice?  So far as I understand, the Attorney-General when interviewing the Chief Justice occupies the same position as a solicitor does in relation to a K.C. when briefing him for a High Court action.  What did the Attorney-General convey to the Chief Justice?  What did he say to him? Did he express the views of the Taoiseach himself?  In fact, did he deceive the Chief Justice by what he said in getting the Chief Justice, possibly under false pretences, to give his consent to act as chairman of a board to deal with a matter that was the subject of a pending law case?  Unheard of! I am neither a solicitor nor a barrister.  I do not occupy the position of either Deputy Dillon or Deputy Mulcahy.  Again I want to emphasise that I am only a layman, possessed of a certain amount of common sense, but I want to state here and now that an instance was never known in the history of the Legislature of this or any other country, where the Chief Justice was asked his opinion as to the merits or demerits of a particular Bill about to be introduced into this assembly or any other assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find that in the course of the <Col N="1357" /> debate the Taoiseach has given as one of his chief reasons for introducing the Bill the fact that the people who were in charge of these funds were an insignificant body.  But the principle is there.  There is a principle at stake. Let me show by an example what I mean, and this should especially appeal to members of the Labour Party. Take a union the membership of which is 500 strong in a particular year. Then there is a falling-out between the members and a rival union starts. They dissociate themselves from the parent union.  That goes on for years until, at length, the parent union has suffered so much from the differences that have existed for a number of years that they find their membership reduced possibly from the initial 500 to about ten faithful members who remain true to the union.  When the union was strong it built up a fund amounting to, say, £1,000 or £2,000. This is important.  Does the Taoiseach hold, if the leader of the rival union happens to become subsequently the head of the Government, that he can come in and by a majority of this House pass a Bill to prevent the men who remained faithful to the parent union doing whatever they liked with the funds, even if they went to the length of throwing them into a river or down a sewer?  That is straight talk, and when Deputy Kennedy speaks about the Chief Justice in this connection, I ask him has he read the Bill. It does not strike me from the stupid way he sits in his seat that he ever read the Bill.  You cannot tell us anything about respect for the law.  I respected the law when he and the Taoiseach were destroying this country and violating the law.</P>

I ask the Taoiseach to make very clear what exactly did go on, because it is my view, and the view of the people I speak for, that, without a shadow of doubt, it belittles the Chief Justice to be let into&mdash;if that be the phrase&mdash;becoming chairman of this board when there was a danger of the matter coming before him in the courts for decision.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have any business conducted if we are to have everybody shouting across the floor. That is the only sort of protection I need.  In this matter, I have no qualm of any sort.  Deputy Dillon has played about with the word &ldquo;consult&rdquo; and he then went on to the word &ldquo;approve&rdquo;.  It is a small step to &ldquo;consult&rdquo; as to whether he would consent to act and then to say he approves of the Bill.  It is no concern of the Chief Justice to approve of the Bill&mdash;that is a matter for the Oireachtas.  The question of the merits or demerits of the Bill was not for the Chief Justice.  I take it that when he saw the Bill he realised, as I would if I were in his position, that it involved a certain situation for himself as Chief Justice, if the Bill was legally passed and he consented to do a public duty in acting.  Whenever the Chief Justice or any other judge is mentioned <Col N="1361" /> in a Bill, he is mentioned because it is thought by the Government who framed the Bill that he would be the best person to act in that capacity and would give public confidence in doing so.</P>
      <P>An attempt is made then to suggest either that we had got the Chief Justice to act under false pretences, or that he was a party to the Bill.  Neither of these propositions is true.  He was not deceived.  He was asked by the Attorney-General whether he would consent to become chairman, or to nominate a chairman, and he consented. He has no further responsibility and is not involved in the Bill except to that extent.  I repeat that the attempts to attack the Chief Justice were unwarranted and are a poor service, either to the country or to the judiciary.  If the Opposition had wanted to deal with this on its merits, they could have objected to the Bill on the ground that it would not be appropriate for the Chief Justice to act in that capacity in this case, and the matter could have been argued on that level, but they chose to take it away from that level and deal with it on a personal level.  I say again that I think it was a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not mind what suggestions Deputies may make about my action. I can defend myself but, from the point of view of the courts and of ordinary, common decency, the attacks to which I have referred were unworthy of those who made them and unworthy of this House.  The general question of staying the action of the courts will come up for discussion later and I do not propose to go into it now.  The only question at issue is the propriety, or otherwise, of having the Chief Justice act as chairman. On the question of propriety, I have no hesitation in coming to a conclusion. In many other Bills which could also have become subjects of appeal to the Supreme Court, we indicated as chairman of boards the Chief Justice or other member of the Supreme Court.  If it is suggested that, because a Bill may sometimes come before the Supreme Court for determination as to whether it is constitutional or not, we are not to indicate a member of the Supreme Court in such a Bill, <Col N="1362" /> then I think the contention is absurd. In most Bills in which judges are introduced in this way it is as people who are to do a public duty.  They will not be asked to perform that public duty unless the body on which they are to function, or over which they are to preside, is legally set up.  They have no interest in the matter save the performance of a public duty.  They derive no benefit from it.  An onerous duty is usually placed upon them and I cannot see how it can be suggested that, because a person is to be called upon to undertake an onerous duty, he is incapable of passing judgment on a different question&mdash;whether a Bill is legal or not.  Nobody has suggested that the Chief Justice could have any interest in this Bill.  Deputies stopped short, at least, at that.  I do not think that that suggestion could be made.  I have, therefore, no hesitation in holding that it is not contrary in any way to the public interest, to the independence of the judiciary or to any proper principle of democracy that we should retain this clause as it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach finished his speech by saying that it was not contrary to the interests of justice, to democracy or to the functioning of the courts to retain this clause.  It is because it is contrary to all three that it is opposed.  I think that the Chief Justice should not be abused.  This House should try to protect him and should try to protect the office of Chief Justice, forgetting all about the particular occupant at the moment.  If the position were as simple as the Taoiseach tries to make it appear, we should be dealing with a different matter altogether.  But the Taoiseach is not the simple or innocent man he sometimes pretends to be.  We know from experience that the proposals he puts before the House from time to time are not as simple or as innocent as he represents them to be. If anybody has been unfair either to the Chief Justice or to the position of Chief Justice, it is the Taoiseach.  The judiciary is supposed to be free and completely independent of the Government of the day.  Because of that, the ordinary citizen, no matter what his political views be, has the utmost confidence <Col N="1363" /> in the impartiality of the occupants of judicial offices, from the Chief Justice down.  But if it is sought to make use of them in this way, how long will that confidence remain?  The Taoiseach spoke about the Chief Justice and other members of the judiciary having been mentioned in other Bills which came before the House.  He spoke in a general way. No Bill ever came before this House&mdash; and we had some extraordinary Bills during the past 15 years&mdash;of the same type as this Bill.</P>

      <P>Exactly, but never has such an outrageous attempt to set aside the courts and the judiciary been made as is being made in this Bill. We have had previous experience of that.  I do not think that the Taoiseach should be proud in refreshing our memories about it.  However, let me deal with the measure before us.  As an ordinary layman, like my friend, Deputy Coburn, I want to know what the position of the Chief Justice will be if, as appears likely, this Bill is challenged in the Supreme Court on the ground that it is <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution?  Will that not be putting the Chief Justice and the Supreme Court, as a whole, in an absolutely impossible position?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to make my own speech and state my own views on this section.  I am surprised at Deputy Donnellan standing up and telling us on this section that he and his Party have an open mind on the matter.  I should not describe that as an open mind.  I should describe it as a blank or completely empty mind.  It shows that members of this House and Leaders of a Party in this House cannot grasp the cardinal importance <Col N="1364" /> of a measure such as this and the importance of the principle at stake. This is not a matter merely of the destination of Sinn Féin funds.  There is a far more vital principle at stake. I am perfectly satisfied that the Taoiseach is as conscious as any other member of the House of the injury which is being done to the courts by bringing in this Bill.  I am not one of those who ever under-estimated the Taoiseach.  Therefore, I say that this is being done absolutely deliberately and of set purpose.  If the law is to be completely at the mercy of whatever Government may be in power for the time being, then we shall cease to have any law. Remember, the Party opposite will not be always in power.  Remember that the machinery being used here to-day in relation to litigation in connection with the Sinn Féin funds can be used by any other Government for any other purpose.  I am not concerned with the merits of the case before the courts. That is not a matter for us but for the courts and that is what the courts are there for.  This House will be completely stultifying itself, it will be out-raging the duties which we were sent here to perform, if this Bill becomes the law of the land.  It will be outraging justice and undermining completely the confidence which the people have, I am glad to say, in all our courts.  That is really what is vital, that is what is fundamental, despite the Taoiseach's attempt to gloss it over as being something of little importance. I am not concerned very much with what transpired between whoever went to see the Chief Justice and the Chief Justice.  I would be terribly concerned to find that the Chief Justice had been constrained to accept the position set out in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach who is usually very careful and very precise, as we know, in the use of his language&mdash;more so than anybody else in this House&mdash;said that the Chief Justice was &ldquo;informed&rdquo; of this matter, was &ldquo;informed&rdquo; that his name was going to be put in the Bill.  I asked him what he meant by that and he said: &ldquo;I mean just that, that he was informed&rdquo;.  Later on, before he sat down, he changed that <Col N="1365" /> a little&mdash;he was &ldquo;asked and consented&rdquo;. Which was the correct one?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;It is no business of the Chief Justice to approve of this Bill or any other Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I bet that sounded very true in the ears of many Deputies on the other side&mdash;but it is a most insulting misrepresentation. It is perfectly true that the Chief Justice, in all human probability, makes it a rule, owing to the exalted office he holds, to avoid perusing the Bills that come before this House, because he is the custodian of the Constitution which operates on every Bill passed by this House. Therefore, everyone will readily understand that it is no business of the Chief Justice in advance to approve a Bill. But suppose the Chief Justice is approached by the Attorney-General and asked: &ldquo;Chief Justice, the Executive is bringing before Dáil Éireann a Bill and in it there is a provision that you, the Chief Justice, are to act as the chairman of a tribunal,&rdquo; is there any Deputy with the temerity <Col N="1366" /> to suggest that, without making any inquiry whatever as to the nature of the tribunal, how it was to be set up or for what it was to be set up, the Chief Justice replied: &ldquo;All right.  I will act as chairman of anything.&rdquo;  I do not believe the Chief Justice did that.  I believe that, when the Attorney-General went to him and said: &ldquo;The Executive are about to introduce a Bill and in Section 4 it is proposed that you should preside over a tribunal to be set up under it,&rdquo; the Chief Justice said: &ldquo;Well, show me the draft of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>But this House has no power.  The Constitution guarantees that a judge appointed under the Constitution shall not have put upon him any other duty or obligation than those he is required to discharge by his oath of office and refusal to undertake any other function shall not be a ground for removing him from his judicial office.  That goes to the very root and essence of the independence of the judiciary.  No Act of this House once a judge has been appointed, and in a special sense a Chief Justice, can add to his duties, detract from his emoluments, or impose upon him any obligation in addition to those he has under-taken on oath in his judicial office without his express consent.  Therefore, before we could effectively impose upon the Chief Justice the obligation to preside over a tribunal set up by this House we must have his prior consent, and in this case, according to the Taoiseach, we have his prior consent.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach says very glibly that in a number of other Bills the Chief Justice is to preside over a tribunal. I would like to get the titles of those Bills.  Where are they?  I challenge the Taoiseach to say to this House, has any Bill been passed by Oireachtas Éireann since the founding of the State in which the Chief Justice is to preside over a tribunal appointed <i>ad hoc</i> and take seisin of a matter at trial before the courts after the courts had been estopped from hearing that which they themselves had declared to be a fit subject for hearing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the most serious section of any Bill that I have heard discussed in my 16 years' membership of Dáil Éireann.  This section puts in issue the whole status, dignity and integrity of the office of Chief Justice of Ireland. No graver matter at any time has ever occupied the attention of this House, and we are asked to do this thing on the representation that the Chief Justice has been dragged into this business, and the Fianna Fáil Party has been whipped up to march into the Lobbies for its achievement and to save what?  £8,000.  In the course of the earlier discussion of this section it has emerged that, of the £28,000 in court, probably £12,000 has already been appropriated towards the expenses of the plaintiffs and defendants, and that, in the event of an appeal being taken to the Supreme Court by the parties, it is quite likely that another £8,000 might go.  We are left to conclude that all this is being done for the preservation of £8,000.  Is there any Deputy in the House who would have objected if the Taoiseach had come to the House and said: &ldquo;I feel this money is being dissipated away but, rather than lay my finger on the sacred <Col N="1369" /> principle that the Legislature shall not interfere with the independence of the judiciary, I give notice that I am going to ask the House to provide money from the public purse to replace whatever is dissipated in this litigation, and I do that rather than call in question the independence of the judiciary by legislating to terminate judicial proceedings that are going on.&rdquo;  Would any of us object to that?  Would we not have said: &ldquo;There is a man who understands the sanctity of law, there is a man who realises that rather than call in question the independence of the Courts and their power, their absolute power to protect the individual against the Executive, however insignificant the individual is or powerful the Executive may be, he comes frankly to the House and says that he is going to ask it <i>ex gratia</i> to provide trustees of the £28,000 to choose a committee to prepare a scheme just as if this had been the £28,000 that the Sinn Féin Party had lying in their account when the march of events caused other organisations to bulk largest in the life of this community.&rdquo;  How simple that would have been, how sane and how prudent!</P>
    <P>As my friend, Deputy Coburn, was saying when it was sought to shout him down there is a strange analogy between it and the trade union whose membership was being sapped slowly by a break-away union: it finally awakes to the fact that the break-away union has taken ten members, leaving 1,000 in the parent union.  The stage was later reached when the break-away union had 1,000 members and the parent union only ten, and they go to law, the break-away union now being the big one claiming the right to the funds that had been acquired by the parent union over the years.  The break-away union provides the personnel of the Government of that day and, having gone into court to protect its rights, the old union, hated by the Executive of the day, wakes up one day to read in the paper that its proceedings in the court have been stopped, that a Bill is before the Dáil to set up a tribunal, that the Government will not see these painfully accumulated funds frittered away in useless litigation <Col N="1370" /> and that, in any case, the courts are not the body best suited to give a judgment in this matter, because it is not dry legal principles but the living, breathing, history of a trade union that should really determine the merits of the case.  Some indignant soul rises in this House and says: &ldquo;How can you take from these people their right to go to the courts and get justice under the law?&rdquo; And out of the Statute Book of Ireland is drawn that Bill.  If we did it once, why should we not do it again and, in 1947, the Chief Justice of the day was consulted and not only approved the course proposed but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Before, then, we could put in the section, after consulting him, we must have got his consent. There is no escape from that. We are all agreed that it is unthinkable that he gave his consent without seeing the Bill and we know from the Taoiseach's telling that he did see the Bill.  If he saw the Bill, he read the Bill and, if he is the Chief Justice of Ireland, he understood the Bill.  These facts being granted, are we not entitled to ask, when his mind came to operate on the question will I say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or will I say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the request for permission to put my name in Section 4, is it conceivable that he decided for &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or for &ldquo;no&rdquo; without first asking himself: &ldquo;In the event of this tribunal being constituted, do I approve of the nature of the task which it is asked to undertake?&rdquo;</P>

Do Deputies in this House consider that that is a suitable rôle for the Chief Justice of Ireland to play?  Remember that in the meantime, he will have occupied that strange employment which to the Taoiseach, not surprisingly, seems as easy as rolling off a wall, of presiding over the Supreme Court while it determines whether the Act, the implementation of which depends on the Chief Justice's undertaking to play a part, is a trespass of the Constitution.  In the meantime he may well have had to declare or find himself in the position that two at least of his colleagues know that he has done entirely wrong or he may find himself in the position that having given an undertaking to do this job his four brethren of the Supreme Court bench will tell him that he cannot do so without violating the Constitution.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say that I never heard Deputy Dillon going so far with misrepresentation as he has done here.  He compared what was before this House to a trade union.  A trade union is an organisation made up of members who subscribe so much a week or a month as laid down by the trade union organisation.  This Sinn Féin Fund we are discussing here at the moment has been subscribed by the people of Ireland towards the fight for freedom.  I cannot accept the analogy from the Deputy and I am sure the Deputy does not believe in it himself. The Taoiseach came into the House and in a very few words he told the House the position.  He stated that this money was collected by the people of Ireland for a certain purpose and that no other organisation had more authority or power to distribute that money than the Oireachtas.  He made the points very clear about the money. That was explained and accepted.  Yet we hear talk about interfering with the courts.  This is a very simple matter and I am definitely convinced that the attitude adopted by the Taoiseach on this matter is the correct one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach said he wanted to see this job done fairly, impartially, and with a sense of high integrity.  To achieve that end he nominated the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in order to show and to convince the <Col N="1375" /> people of this country that these funds would be disbursed in a most conscientious and honest-to-goodness manner. I have listened to Deputy Dillon.  Of course he is a very fine man and he has had longer experience at speaking than I have had but I really cannot understand why he is so nervous and why he is so uneasy and why he drew so many analogies regarding this matter.  Surely there are Parties on both sides of this House who were all together at one time and who subscribed towards that fund, and is not it only just and human that there should be a spirit of co-operation to pass an Act that would disburse these funds as the great majority of the members think they should be disbursed?  To do that a Bill has been brought in in a most judicious and honourable manner by the Taoiseach and I fail to see how any man should come along and misrepresent it.  I thoroughly disagree with the points made by the last speaker.</P>

      <P>Speaking earlier about the present attitude to the will of the Oireachtas, I said that I challenged any Fianna Fáil Deputy to discuss with us the reasons why it was thought fit that the Chief Justice should be put into this particular position.  Apparently, &ldquo;challenged&rdquo; was not exactly the right word to use and I want to put the right word into its place.  I want to appeal to members of the Fianna Fáil Party to discuss this matter with us here&mdash;Tá Béarla agus Gaeilge aca chuige. Deputy Burke is wrong in saying that any analogy was drawn between the body that created these funds and a trade union.  What was pointed out was that if you do this in connection with these funds, somebody else on some other day may do it in connection with trade union funds.  The funds were collected by the nation as a whole and, as Deputy Burke says, people on both sides of the House had something to do with the collection of them.  It is <Col N="1376" /> because we hold to the spirit in which these funds were collected and the purpose for which they were collected that we object to what is being done with them and particularly to the Chief Justice being made a party to it.</P>
      <P>It is not without a certain amount of significance that in our old literature we are reminded of the people who got the grace of the Christian faith before the coming of St. Patrick; that out of three so recorded one was Conor Mac Nessa who got the grace of the Christian faith because of his deep humanity manifested when he heard the story of the Crucifixion; another was Cormac Mac Airt who got it because of the justice of his ruling as a king; the other was Iodh Mac Morrainn, who got it because of the justice of his judgment as a judge.  In the building up of these funds and the work we did for them there was one particular writer amongst others whose writings inspired us very much.  Many Deputies will remember the story by Standish O'Grady of the veiled player, describing Ireland's position at that particular time as a chess player playing against a veiled player.  There always came a time when Ireland, by the moving of its pieces on the board, was in the position of winning the game, but the veiled player swept the pieces off the board so that there could not be a termination to the game.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, it would be tragic if the remnants of a few thousand pounds of the funds so collected to establish the State here and to give us an Irish judiciary and Irish courts, sovereign completely in their own domain, made part of the Constitution here, and absolutely independent of the Executive, could be the instrument and the cause of subverting our courts here to the Executive in power.  That is what this Bill proposes to do.  In spite of the fact that a case before the courts has been running on for four years now, because of the possibility of inconvenience to the Government Party, a Bill is being brought in here to take the case out of the courts, and, by the will of the Oireachtas, to give us a precedent that by a Party majority <Col N="1377" /> operating through this Oireachtas a case brought by an Irish plaintiff before a sovereign and independent Irish court, whatever be the merits of that case, can be withdrawn from the court and a decision refused.</P>
    <P>It would be a very tragic thing if those who were inspired by the desire to sweep away for ever the veil of the veiled player who was playing against Ireland in the old chess game and to sweep away the trickery in our international relations should live to see the day when some people who were a party to these funds and who ought to remember the past motives and ideals would be so careless, simply because there may be political inconvenience as to the fundamental things that we worked and fought for and set up here, as to risk the destruction of these things sooner than have this political inconvenience.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke did not address himself to the real merits of the case.  The Taoiseach asks: &ldquo;What is the task of the Chief Justice?&rdquo; The principal task of the Chief Justice in this matter is to lend his name and his patronage, by sitting on this tribunal, to taking a case out of the Irish courts that should never be taken out of them.  The courts should be allowed to judge the case that is before them and then, when the courts have been allowed to judge the case, the position with regard to the courts and the possibility of the courts settling or doing anything about these funds will be thrown into a particular perspective.  But, so long as there is a plaintiff before the courts who has spent thousands of pounds on a case, which is so far recognised to be a case by the defendant that £5,000 has already been spent upon it, then those who have any of the spirit of Sinn Féin, any recollection of the Sinn Féin tradition, should not allow this Parliament to trample on the courts set up to be independent of this Parliament and to have complete and independent responsibility for interpreting the Acts of this Parliament.</P>
    <P>I say that the introduction of the Chief Justice into this section is not only degrading to himself and the courts and prejudicing the rights of the <Col N="1378" /> people in relation to the courts in the future, but as has been said already, it prejudices the constitutional rights of the people to appeal through the President to the Supreme Court against an Act passed through this Oireachtas. That is contrary to our Constitution. I should like to hear some other Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party on this matter.  I should like them to put the problem we are discussing here in its proper perspective.  As planned in this section, the Chief Justice is asked to trample on the sovereignty and independence of the courts in order to save a bit of political inconvenience to the ruling Party.</P>

I never belonged to Sinn Féin.  I belonged to the Nationalist movement.  I had no part in the collection of this money.  I had no part in the work that Sinn Féin did.

      <P>I would like to correct one remark.  Deputy Mulcahy has spoken as one of those who knew something about the manner in which these funds were collected.  Deputy Mulcahy spoke when this Bill was introduced and here is what he said on that occasion (Volume 104, column 1756):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I think anybody with any connection with that matter in the past or having any connection with the law, must agree that the courts could not arrive at a settlement of any satisfactory kind in a case of this particular nature and that any court action simply meant frittering away money.  It is regrettable that money has been frittered away in legal costs since 1922 when the matter could have been decided in a sensible way and some decision come to without giving the courts an expensive job which they could not be expected to do.  It is for these reasons that I raise a technical objection to the Bill but we shall be glad to see the terms of it and to give it any consideration that may be necessary.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I think it is necessary to put into juxtaposition with that quotation of mine a version of that given by the Taoiseach on the 20th March, 1947 (Volume 104, column 2536):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Deputy Mulcahy, apparently unconsciously, was right in saying that the ordinary courts were not the courts to try this.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would like to hear the Taoiseach reconcile the terms of my statement when opposing in a technical way the introduction of this Bill before we saw it, with the suggestion that I said that the ordinary courts were not the courts to try this.  As regards the statement read by the Taoiseach, the only thing I might object to in reading it now is that it was rather commenting here on a case that was before the courts, because the only suggestion I can find in this is that the courts would be a very difficult place to arrive at a decision as to what should be done with these funds.  But I do not think that the courts would have much difficulty in deciding the claim of a person claiming the funds.  There may be something warranted in the expenditure of all the money to establish the claim that is before the courts, but I cannot easily imagine a group of people legitimately, at least effectively, before the courts of to-day claiming that they are the legal and legitimate descendants of Sinn Féin.  I do not want to go into that matter any further, but if the Taoiseach wants to read into that statement a suggestion of mine that I approved of passing legislation here to quash a case already in the courts, he is welcome to put that interpretation on it, but the Taoiseach must be in a very difficult position.</P>

My association with it goes back to 1907, to the time of the memorable by-election in Leitrim when Dolan was nominated.

For these reasons, I support the Bill.  I make no apology to a man like Deputy Mulcahy who has given such long service in the <Col N="1385" /> national cause and, least of all, to Deputy Dillon.  I think the Taoiseach is doing a good day's work to put an end once and for all to the squandermania which has set in in what is left of the old headquarters of Sinn Féin. I should like to know if this fund did not exist, what would be the Sinn Féin executive to-day or would there be any executive?

      <P>So well he might.  He says that, when he came to read this Bill, there was one section of it which made him like it real well and that was that this whole business was to be given over to a high-up judge, a higher judge than the judge who looked into it before.  May I say to Deputy Walsh that two and three-quarter hours ago I said that one of the purposes of the insertion of this section was to persuade the people down the country that the Taoiseach was not taking this business out of the hands of the judiciary but that what he was really doing was taking it out of the hands of a low-down judge and putting it into the hands of a big high judge and that the decent, innocent, simple people down the country would swallow that.</P>

      <P>The very thing which I forewarned the House against, and which the Taoiseach most angrily denied, Deputy Walsh says is the very reason he intends to vote for the Bill. The Taoiseach has emphasised that nothing was further from his mind than the creation of such an impression. Does it make any difference?  It is six to four on Deputy Walsh walking through the Lobby with the Taoiseach and the pair of them, by their own disclosures in the House this afternoon, are poles apart&mdash;one denying the existence of the executive of Sinn Féin and the other asserting it, one glorying that this matter has been taken out of the hands of a lowly judge and put in the hands of a lofty judge and the other denying that that transaction is in contemplation. Of such is Fianna Fáil. Will they blame me if my last words on this section are &ldquo;God save Ireland&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>If the Chief Justice were not nominated in this section, if some person other than the Chief Justice were nominated, we would then have Deputy Dillon shouting that it was another Fianna Fáil wangle, that somebody had been put in for some sinister political motive, but because the Chief Justice has been put into this section as chairman, Deputy Dillon and other members of the Opposition want to create the impression that the judiciary are being interfered with.

The debate has strayed a very long way from the principle involved in the section, which, as I say, is simply whether the Chief Justice is the proper person to be chairman of this board or not.  That is the issue before us, and I do not know how even Deputy Dillon has the hardihood to suggest that there is something wrong in this section simply because the Chief Justice is so nominated.</P>

We had a considerable amount of money and it got into the hands of the solicitors, and I have the documents in my possession to show that they manoeuvred it until there were no fewer than 12 adjournments <Col N="1390" /> and practically nothing was left but the amount of the costs of the law agents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is even worse than Deputy Mulcahy has described.  We have now a board which is to be presided over either by the Chief Justice or as set out in Section 4.  Then we have ordinary members to be appointed by the Government. Each one of those ordinary members is under the control of the Government.  He is to hold office until he dies, resigns or is removed from office.  Provision is then made to enable him to resign under sub-section (4), and provision is made in sub-section (3) that as soon as anybody either resigns, dies or is removed from office, another appointee of the Government is to take his place.  Then you come to the all-important question: How is a person to be removed?  The machinery there is novel, but certainly plays into the hands of the Party.  A committee consisting of three persons is to be nominated by the Chief Justice&mdash;that is to say, the Chief Justice who has taken his position in this, in disdain of his own court, and at the request, possibly at the orders, of the Government. These three people are to inquire into and report upon the question whether or not a particular, ordinary member of the board shall cease to hold office, and if by a majority they say that that should be done, then that man leaves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The machinery for the inquiry is to be set going by the Attorney-General. So far, the distinction that has been made between the Attorney-General and a judge is that a judge once appointed is put in a position of independence. First of all, he is appointed for a particular term and can only be removed by a very special procedure, which is not ordinarily going to be <Col N="1392" /> operated against him, and his salary cannot be changed downwards while he is in office.  Therefore, so far as the ordinary practice can go, the judges in this country are put in a position in which they can be independent and are expected to be independent.  In opposition to that, the Constitution quite boldly sets out that the Attorney-General is a creature of the Government. He is appointed by the Government and can be removed from office at any moment.  The position now is that we are to have a board composed completely and entirely of Government appointees and if they happen to show some sort of independence and do not operate in the way the Government want, then the Government press a button and their other appointed person, the Attorney-General, comes in. They get him to make a request for an inquiry into whether or not a person should be removed from office and the board which considers that is to be a group of three, appointed by the Chief Justice who, as far as the debate goes to-day, has been told to take up this post by the Government and more or less told what he is going to do. Deputy Mulcahy was quite right&mdash;it would be almost better to say that the whole lot are appointed by the Government and removable at the Government's pleasure and let it be seen that that is so, instead of keeping it in this other way, by a letter quietly and secretly sent to the person who does not do what the Government wants. That is the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Taoiseach has got sick of hearing the facts established.  Is it or is it not a fact that the Attorney-General is removable at will by the Government?  I suggest it is.  I await a denial of that, but I do not think a denial can come.  The <Col N="1393" /> Attorney-General is, therefore, under the full control of the Government in this matter.  The board is to be appointed by the Government.  They are going to be people whom the Government will hand-pick for their purpose. That is evident from the section. Even if one of those handpicked men decides to take a course that is not in accordance with the views of the Government, surely it is right to say that the creature of the Government, removable from office by them, is the person who will set in operation machinery to get a recalcitrant member removed?  If there is any one of these statements I have made capable of any qualification or is wrong as I have stated it, I would like to hear what the qualification is or where I am wrong.  It goes without denial.</P>

      <P>One looking at the section might have said, before the discussion in any event, that there is the guardianship of the Chief Justice. Three people are to be nominated by the Chief Justice, but now it emerges that the Chief Justice has been first of all consulted.</P>

      <P>I am not speaking of the Chief Justice <i>qua</i> chairman but <Col N="1396" /> in a new capacity, the man who is going to be approached on request by the Attorney-General.  The Attorney-General, I say, holds his office at the sweet will of the Government, and that Attorney-General, holding his office in that way, is going to request the Chief Justice to inquire into a particular matter.  The Chief Justice, who has been paraded before the House in a certain way as chairman, swings around and has another function to discharge. He is the person who is to nominate three people.  Is it likely that the Chief Justice who has so little care for the judicial independence of his colleagues &mdash;the judicial independence set out in the Constitution&mdash;is going to be very particular and very conscientious as to the people he will appoint in this matter, particularly as it has emerged from the debate, I understand, that the Chief Justice has been pretty well ordered in respect of the chairmanship?</P>

      <P>I cannot segregate these things.  If an individual who is Chief Justice is paraded in a particular way as accepting the office of chairman, I cannot think of him as being a different type of character when it comes to nominating three people to make an inquiry of this sort.  We might as well have it open and frank and without any evasion that this committee is going to do what the Government want it to do.  Whatever little cloak there may be for the public, the background is quite clear, and it is that the Government are going to control this committee. The committee will give these moneys, taken out of the jurisdiction of the courts, to such friends of the Government as the Government want the moneys given to.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 6.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 6, we again see the ubiquitous chairman.  If the Chief Justice remains to be chairman of the board, he shall, if present, be chairman of the meeting.  If he is not present, the chairmanship is taken by a member of the board.  Sub-paragraph (2) give the chairman a second or casting vote and under sub-paragraph (3) the board may act notwithstanding one or more vacancies amongst its members as long as there is a quorum of four.  Then, under sub-paragraph (5), the board is to regulate the procedure and business of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regulation of business is all right but they are to regulate procedure. What they are to do is set out in Section 12, 13 and 14.  It means that they are going to distribute a sum of money that is somewhere in the region of £24,000 and in so doing they are to regulate their own procedure.  Already, by the sections that the Dáil has passed, they are definitely a handpicked and well-picked sort of jury and they are to do anything they like, on any evidence they like.  They are to regulate their own procedure.  There need be no evidence remaining for anybody to question.  There need be nothing that anybody could question or raise any comment about.  They are to regulate their own procedure, the method by which they will distribute the money, the evidence upon which <Col N="1399" /> they will do it, the records they will ask for in relation to the various things that are set out in Section 13.  It is a hand-picked Board not merely as far as its membership is concerned but, apparently, lest they might leave any record on which people could afterwards judge them for their actions, they are given here the completest power simply to decide at their own sweet will.  There is always a suspicion that this is only a way of distributing £24,000 amongst needy followers of the present Government.  It is clear from this section that that is what is aimed at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The same as there is in the Military Service Pensions Act, which talks about records being brought forward and the records that will be put before the board and the statements that will be made on them. That is one example, from the rather inefficient legislation which the present Government have introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It had to distribute money on the grounds of certain terms of reference given to it with regard to service.  This is to distribute money on the grounds of the terms of reference given in Section 13.  The Military Service Pensions Act set out the way it was to be done.  It did not set out procedure to the final point but it certainly prevented the people from just distributing the money to their friends. This does not prevent that.  In fact, it is obviously aimed to allow that.</P>

      <P>On this section, we have to complain of the same set-up that there is with regard to the chairman and the members of the board.  The board is to be allowed to appoint such and so many officers as they may think proper.  There is no limitation whatever as to the numbers.  There are no terms of reference given to the board with regard to the qualifications of the people they are to appoint, no statement as to whether they are to be civil servants on loan or anything like that. No statement has been made to this House from which we can judge how long these people will be there, what their duties are likely to be, and how long this will take them.  The board is given power to remove any officer for any reason it likes, without in fact giving a reason.  The board pays them whatever it likes.  The board may be composed of the needy people who have to be provided for who, of course, may not be the people referred to in this Bill, but political partisans who want a bit of a lift.  They can be provided for, and then a few extra henchmen can be brought in as servants and given whatever salaries the board likes for so long as the board likes.  The board will be constituted as to the main part of the membership by Government nominees and as to the rest by the Chief Justice.  Was there ever such a racket as this?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a pivotal section.  This is a section which means that an action now in court is to be taken out of court.  It is to be taken out because we have been told, first, that the court might give an unreal decision; secondly, that the court is apt to give decisions based upon narrow legal interpretation, and, thirdly, that the court could not get the facts properly before it, whereas the Dáil can.  On these three main grounds this section stands.  I do not know what is the narrow legal interpretation that is feared, and the House has been given no enlightenment on that.  I do not know what is an unreal decision, except it be a decision that would not appeal to the present Government. Then we are told that this House is competent to have the facts brought before it and to pass judgment upon them, whereas the court is not.  This <Col N="1408" /> House has not had any facts put before it to come to any conclusion.  The proposal is that the action ought to be taken out of the court and transferred here for decision.</P>
      <P>We are asked to make a decision. On Second Reading the House has already made a decision.  Looking back on the debate, all I can find said on the merits of the case is the statement made by the Taoiseach, <i>ex parte</i>, that the present plaintiffs are an insignificant group, that they could not possibly establish their affiliation with the group for whom the funds were first raised, and that they have no case. They are an insignificant body, to start off with; they have certainly no way of establishing their affiliation with the body for whom the moneys were held in trust, and they have no case.  I do not think any judge would come to a conclusion on a statement of that type, or would pass judgment on it.  If the courts are being discredited because they will not take an easy and quick decision on that sort of a statement of defence, then that recorded in the Dáil debates will redound to the credit of the courts and will not redound to the credit of this Assembly.</P>
      <P>I asked the Taoiseach to tell me the distinction between these funds and any other funds.  I can conceive many answers, but the only one I got was that there are quite a number of other funds where the moneys had been wasted by actions in the court.  I do not know whether that was intended to forecast that on many future occasions we will have similar types of legislation passed like this, brought in to save trusts being despoiled by those who want to take them to court.  It is the only line towards which the Taoiseach's argument pointed.  The worst of that type of argument is that the more exaggerated it is, the less case can be made for removing this from an adjudication by the court.  If it is quite clear that the plaintiffs are insignificant, with no possible affiliation as between themselves and the people by whom the trust was accumulated, and if they have no merits, it is very hard to think of a judge coming to an unreal decision with such clearly established facts as those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1409" /> Then, when the argument developed, we were told that not merely might a court decide in favour of these plaintiffs, but it might even decide that they had such merits that they ought to get their costs out of the funds.  So, in relation to people who have so little merits that on a real decision they ought to get no costs we propose to give them their costs.  The argument about depleting the funds then falls to the ground.</P>
    <P>The other point, urged in a subsidiary way, covered what is called the delay and, on the question of delay, the Taoiseach made the point that this action was started at a particular time and there was no activity following on that.  I pointed out there was a procedure whereby a defendant, after a certain period has elapsed, can give notice of trial and can bring it to a head.  The answer I got to that from the Taoiseach was that there was no procedure and it was fortified by this not merely insulting but meant to be insulting statement, that people who are better lawyers than ever I could be informed him that there was no procedure whereby a defendant or plaintiff lying idle in a case could bring the matter to court.  There is such a procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Was not the argument put forward that the plaintiffs, having inaugurated this action, could not be got into court and my counter to that was that the defendants had it in their power to bring it to court?  A denial came and there was a query as to whether that could be done.  The very rule of procedure on which the defendants have operated contains a statement setting out what I speak of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was referred to on the Second Reading.  Of course it <Col N="1410" /> was said.  The rule upon which the defendants have so far acted contains a statement about the procedure.  The rule is that after a certain period has elapsed, and issues have been joined, if the plaintiff does not give notice of action the defendant may do either of two things; one is that he may go into court to have the action dismissed for want of prosecution, and the very rule that says that goes on to say that they may serve notice of trial themselves. I suggested that and it was denied.  If it was not denied why did not the defendants do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not.  They took the other action; they moved to have the matter set aside for want of prosecution but they could have set the matter down for trial.</P>
      <P>The point is being made that the defendants could not have applied to have it set down for trial.  I answer that they could.  Is it agreed that the defendants could have served notice of trial in this matter?  I assert very precisely and very definitely that they could, that they could have brought this matter to a head, always of course subject to this: that the plaintiffs might have made the plea, in excuse of their delay, that the matter was complicated and required a great deal of documentation and that it was not ready.  If the court believed that plea, the court would not order the action to be brought to trial there and then.  That could only be done if the court were satisfied, and had established to it on the grounds of argument, that there was good reason for the delay.  I think there can be no doubt that one of the arguments upon which the Taoiseach relied was that this action was long-standing, that the plaintiffs had not moved on it and that there was no way open to the defendants of bringing the plaintiffs to court.  I say that is a wrong statement as made by the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Taoiseach is very doubtful if he made the statement in that form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that it is a wrong statement.  But let us assume <Col N="1411" /> that it was not said, that there was no such assumption made by the Taoiseach. It is then agreed that the defendants have it in their power to bring this matter to a head.  Why did they not bring it to a head?  Why did they not serve notice of trial? Why did they not force the pace? Why did they not, feeling assured as they apparently did that this was only a matter of delay and that the real action was not going to be proceeded with, take the step open to them under the rules, of getting the matter set down for trial?  There are two answers.  One is that they did not want themselves to have it brought to trial.  The second is that they did not believe that the delay was anything extraordinary, having regard to the documentation that had to take place. In any event, they could have forced the issue and asked the court to order the matter to be put down for trial.</P>
      <P>There is another matter on which the Taoiseach definitely misled the House on the question of delay.  This action was listed for trial.  This action was listed for trial twice, and listed by the plaintiffs.  Of course the matter had to be presented here as if the action were unreal, that the plaintiffs never intended to go ahead with it, that they merely put in their summons and the statement of claim and allowed the matter to lie there.  On these various grounds I say that the Dáil has not been treated fairly.  I say that when the courts come hereafter to deal with these cases, it will be shown that what the Taoiseach was afraid of, was not that the funds would be frittered away but that he and many members of his Government would be paraded as witnesses. That is what the Taoiseach wants to avoid and not the squandering of the funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already alluded to the fact that certain letters passed between the plaintiff organisation and the newspapers. Might I refer the Taoiseach to column 2539 of the Official Report of the 20th March last?  As reported there, the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;I do not believe that the people who are looking for these funds have any hope whatever&mdash;&rdquo;. On that I interrupted: &ldquo;That can be tested in the right way.&rdquo;<Col N="1412" /> The Taoiseach went on: &ldquo;It cannot be tested; it has taken five years to bring the matter to trial and it has not been brought to trial yet.&rdquo;  I responded: &ldquo;The defendants can set it down for trial.&rdquo; To which the Taoiseach rejoined: &ldquo;The defendants cannot.&rdquo;  I then asked him: &ldquo;Have you been advised on that?&rdquo; And the Taoiseach's answer was: &ldquo;I know this, that the people who are in charge of this matter know the law as well as Deputy McGilligan.&rdquo; I was not far wrong in my recollection of what happened.  The Taoiseach did deny, and certainly got it presumed by the Dáil that he had been advised on that by people who were well versed in legal matters, that the defendants could have set it down for trial.  If the Taoiseach would like to have a copy of the report, we have got it.</P>

What I say is that, when the passage quoted by the Deputy is read in the context of my speech as a whole, it will be clear that I was referring to the position as it was at that moment. In fact, the defendants had served a notice of motion that the action be dismissed for want of prosecution.</P>

      <P>In a serpentine way. Why the Taoiseach should parade himself as knowing anything about legal procedure except that he must parade himself as knowing everything, I do not know.  However, it is quite clear what the Taoiseach's attitude is.  It is brought out in one significant matter. The plaintiff organisation sent a letter to the newspapers in connection with this whole business.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> adopted the attitude that as the matter was <i>sub judice</i> it could not be referred to, but the <i>Irish Press</i> had no such scruples.  They published the letter but cut one sentence out of it.  It is a significant sentence, the sentence in the letter in which they said: &ldquo;The evidence of Mr. de Valera would be very important.  He must be aware that we propose to subpoena him as a witness in the action, as he was president of Sinn Féin from 1917 to 1926, when he resigned to found Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;  That is the sentence that was cut out of the letter.  The <i>Irish Press</i> purported to publish the letter from Sinn Féin with that excision.  They know well how wounding that would be to the Taoiseach, because is was a giving away of the whole business. They knew that a lot of their readers did not know that, but perhaps some of the witnesses knew it and that is what has to be evaded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not speaking for the plaintiffs in this; I do not know how strong their case is, I do not know whether they are an insignificant body, that the Taoiseach thinks they are, or a really important body.  I do not think that insignificance enters into it.  I do not know whether they can claim an affiliation with the old Sinn Féin organisation or whether the court would say clearly on the facts that they cannot, <Col N="1414" /> but I do know that the defence plea put on the files against them is that this money was lodged in court in 1924 and that, prior to that date, the Sinn Féin organisation was defunct and that, therefore, nobody can claim to be the inheritors of it now.  That is stated by the Attorney-General of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach called a meeting of that organisation, as president of it, in the early part of the year 1926 and tried to get a certain resolution carried.  He was beaten and left as a minority, leaving the majority behind him.  It will take a great deal of arrogance to say that the court will decide that, just because the Taoiseach left the organisation, the organisation stopped at that point, but the legal adviser of the Taoiseach has put boldly on the files that that organisation was dead two years before.  That is why Sinn Féin, the present group, rightly claim that the Taoiseach would be an important witness, because he paraded before the country as president of Sinn Féin up to the year 1926 and left, not carrying the majority of that body with him. How it lies in his mouth to say that if he were brought in by the Attorney-General in support of the contention on the file that that organisation was defunct prior to 1924, or at least by 1924, he stands over that, I cannot understand, and, as I said before, he would be in an unhappy position in that respect.</P>

      <P>If the Taoiseach thinks he would be in a happy position, it is strange that he would not give himself the few bits of happiness he has had in recent years by going down. I have suggested before, and I suggest again, that there is no necessity for this fund to lose money.  If the courts would only take the Gaiety Theatre for the action and charge admission fees, they would make twice as much as is in the fund.  Think of the number of people in the country who would like to hear the Taoiseach on his oath telling what happened in the background of Sinn Féin between 1924 and 1926.</P>

In a court, one does not get just the onesided view across that you may get across through a propagandist organ. There is no doubt that the whole point in this is not any matter of conscience or scruple about the money which is going to be lost, or anything like that, but the question of evading service of a writ as a witness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have to do with Sinn Féin.  This was an organisation which was parading itself as a little bit of a hybrid concern.  It was partly Sinn Féin, partly the successors of the Second Dáil and partly a new group, a conception of the Taoiseach's, Comhairle na dTeachtaí.  It was going to be the last remnants or the decaying remnants of the Second Dáil, with such people as might have come in by election from time to time, elections which the Second Dáil did not recognise, but at which certain people stood for election, and, as newcomers coming into their ranks, they avidly welcomed them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things I looked up, in case the Tánaiste was left here to argue this matter, had reference to a matter questioned at this meeting which was as late as 18th&mdash;19th December, 1926. Mr. Seán Lemass said that he held a position on the Executive as head of the Department of Defence.  &ldquo;In that position,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I sanctioned certain military acts, for example, the raid on Mountjoy in November last.&rdquo; That was November, 1926, and he as Minister for Defence, if you please, in a defunct organisation was sanctioning a raid in which lives might have been lost, and he claimed later the power of <Col N="1416" /> life and death.  &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;it is a most astounding suggestion that my action needs any ratification from this body.  I think that we should resent that very much; these acts were just as valid then as they are now; I, as one of this body, in giving my saction to this act gave it all the justification it needed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was then an attempt to pour oil on these troubled waters by the president at the time, the president of the association, who was not the Taoiseach, and Mr. Lemass comes in again to ask: &ldquo;Is it suggested that these acts were invalid at the time?&rdquo; There then follows an explanation from the Taoiseach, and, if anybody wants an exercise in confused thought, I suggest that they read the next three sentences.  I will not attempt to read them here.  Later, Mr. Lemass comes in again to ask: &ldquo;When you said that these acts require validation, does that mean that any acts I did as Minister for Defence were not valid?&rdquo; Would it not be interesting to hear Mr. Seán Lemass paraded as a witness in this case and asked whether he sanctioned a raid, an armed raid, on Mountjoy in November, 1926, and asked by what authority he did it and then presented with that document which is a record from the files which were caught and having pointed out to him that he there said he required no validation for his acts, that he was Minister for Defence in a particular organisation and then being reminded that the Attorney-General in this case had put on the files of the courts the defence that the organisation was defunct from at least 1924.</P>
    <P>That is only one of them.  There are many gems in this.  I thought the Tánaiste was going to remain for this debate and I picked that one out for his enjoyment, but there are many other gems from the Taoiseach himself in this document.</P>

      <P>That I would love to hear explained on oath also.  Leaving that document aside, did Sinn Féin exist as an organisation as late as 1926?  Was the organisation in existence at the time when the Taoiseach proposed a resolution before that organisation and was defeated by a counter-resolution proposed by the late Father O'Flanagan?  Was the Taoiseach president of it?  Did he leave as a defeated minority and is it possible for the people who now put this forward as plaintiffs to say that they have the right of succession from the group the Taoiseach left?  I am not sure that my dates are right but somebody authorised the man who is the present Minister for Justice to go to Moscow on one occasion to look for help.  I think it was Sinn Féin.  I wonder if the Taoiseach would correct me in my dates.  On what date did that happen? Was it near 1924?  I think that it was. So that the defunct organisation sent a member of that organisation to Moscow to look for aid from the people at whom we are now so horrified.  To look for aid for what?  To beat down the legitimate Government in this country.  At the moment, President Truman is getting America to lend money to Greece because there are certain guerillas in Greece who are being financed by Moscow to beat the legitimate Government of Greece.  President Truman is throwing the United States of America into the scales against that. What about producing the Minister for Justice before the courts and having him sworn to say by what authority he tried to get Russian aid&mdash;a thing which President Truman is objecting to in respect of another Government&mdash; against the legitimate Government of this country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far, I put it to the Dáil that the only argument is what the Taoiseach said.  Nobody else has submitted any argument.  The Taoiseach's argument is that these people are insignificant, that they have no merits and that their claim would not be substantiated before any court except there was an unreal verdict.  Is that Deputy Moran's idea of the courts&mdash;that people who are insignificant and without merits might get a decision from them?  The Taoiseach told us on another occasion that the courts are not capable of understanding the facts in the background of this action but that this House is.  Let us take our competence to understand the facts for granted.  Have we been given <Col N="1421" /> the facts on which to operate our minds?  Has Deputy Moran been given the facts?  Certainly, not in this House.  If Deputy Moran thinks there is a case to be made for this section, I should like him to make it and tell us where the weaknesses are in the plaintiffs' action and where the weakness is in the courts which does not permit of a weak action going before them lest that weak action should not suffer the fate of all weak actions which go before the court.</P>
      <P>We are trying to take the action out of the court.  Having done that, let me remind Deputies of the remainder of the story.  We are going to pay the costs incurred so far.  We are told that £8,000 has already been incurred in costs.  I have met no person yet who read that statement by the Taoiseach who gave it credence.  Anybody I have met has gasped his astonishment at the figure of £8,000 presented by the Taoiseach as the amount of costs already incurred.  If the Taoiseach gives us that figure again, as I suppose he will, I want him to add to it&mdash; to tell us who prepared that figure for him.  Was it a costs drawer?  Was it a civil servant thinking of a number and multiplying it?  Was it a taxing master?</P>
      <P>Whichever of these three brought that figure to the Taoiseach's mind, will he say&mdash;I do not want the details &mdash;what evidence anybody brought before him to enable him to say that the costs so far incurred were in the region of £8,000?  That is the sum we are not going to save in this action. That is to be paid in any event.  It will be interesting afterwards, if this Bill be passed and if we can get the information, to learn what sum was, in fact, paid.  I believe it will be found to be nearer half the sum the Taoiseach mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I ask consideration of this point.  It is a point on which I was contradicted previously but I am not going to bother about that.  If these plaintiffs go into court with as bad a case as the Taoiseach says they have, they will not get any costs.  I do not know what fraction of that £8,000 is supposed to represent the costs incurred by them. That sum can be saved if the Taoiseach's <Col N="1422" /> case is as strong as he makes it out to be.  If the plaintiffs are insignificant as a group, have no merits and cannot establish their right to this affiliation, they will lose their action and their costs.  It is clear that costs can be given against them but we need not take that into account because they, probably, could not pay.  But they need not be fed out of this fund and should not be if their case is as bad as the Taoiseach says.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the main basis of the attack by Deputy McGilligan is.  If you take sub-section (1) of Section 10, that this House should interfere with this particular action, one would think that it was the first time that this House has interfered in this particular way.  We had it quite recently in connection with a number of claims being brought under the Military Service Pensions Acts and this House interfered.  It is not correct to suggest that these funds are on the same basis as an ordinary trust fund, and no one knows that better than Deputy McGilligan.  These funds are, from their very nature and for the purpose for which they were subscribed, more or less a national type of fund. There was an action pending, we are told, for a period of approximately five years.  No one knows better than Deputy McGilligan that the plaintiffs would have gone ahead long before the five years expired if they thought they had a possibility of succeeding.</P>

Having got that far, and having put the other side to the cost of going that far and to further cost if they are going to bring the matter to a conclusion, he knows before the trial ever comes off that he is going to stick them for that.  He is still in a bargaining position and Deputy McGilligan knows that quite well.  I am sure that never in the Deputy's experience has he known of a case in which the plaintiffs have sat back for a period of over five years and refused to do one thing or the other.</P>

      <P>The Deputy wants to have it both ways.  He knows quite well that it is the choice of the defendants to move under whichever procedure they think seems fit.  The Deputy's complaint seems to be that the defence in this particular case did not move as the Deputy might direct them for his own particular ends.  It was solely for the defendants to say what particular line of country they would take, as the Deputy well knows. They followed the procedure laid down by our legal rules and the Deputy's complaint is that they did not take a particular line that he would suggest and that would suit his argument here now.</P>

      <P>What are the realities? You have this action dragging on all <Col N="1424" /> these years and a very substantial amount of costs incurred that are to come out of the fund.  The plaintiffs have the bargaining power that they are going to drag on for another few years, possibly ten years, and we will ultimately come to the position when there would be nothing in the fund. It would be completely exhausted. The Deputy seems to be perturbed that this matter has been dealt with by the House.  This House is the proper body to deal with this particular type of matter, as there are some people who have inherited difficulties in connection with the matter and unless this Bill was introduced there would be no way out for them.</P>
      <P>The suggestion was made in the House earlier by Deputy Dillon that the Chief Justice was being used as a tool by the Government.  I speak subject to correction.  It was suggested long before this writ ever was issued and long before this squabble came about in the courts, that this House should deal with the matter; and at the time that suggestion was made, the present Chief Justice was not sitting as Chief Justice.  His predecessor was.  I do not know if it would be suggested now by Deputy Dillon that the former Chief Justice was being used as a tool for this particular purpose.</P>

      <P>I listened with amazement to the suggestion that the Chief Justice was being made a tool of by this particular Party.  If any other individual had been suggested to carry out the functions envisaged in this Bill for the chairman of the board, the very first people creating a further smoke-screen about the infringement of the rights of democracy and interference with the courts and Fianna Fáil trickery would be Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Dillon, just as they tried to attack us to-day on the grounds when we appointed the one individual who could be suggested as impartial, the Chief Justice, to carry out these functions. The fund is there, though a certain amount of it has gone.  The principles in this Bill for the administration of the fund would appeal to most thinking Deputies as the most expeditious way of dealing with the matter. After these people sitting down for all these years and refusing to go any further and still squandering more and more of this fund, if they are allowed to continue, whatever is left would be of very little use, judging by the figures that have been given and certainly would be insufficient to form a reasonable nucleus for the purpose we set out to achieve under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other criticisms have been offered of this measure.  Dealing with a difficult matter like this and taking into consideration the surroundings and the whole picture from the time it emerged in the courts to the present day, the duty certainly devolved on someone to do something about it.  The only people in a position to do anything about it are the members of this House. On the principles set out in the Bill, <Col N="1426" /> what is suggested by the Government to be done in this matter appeals to me from a common-sense point of view.  The machinery that it is proposed to set up is the proper machinery for this House to set up to administer what is left of this fund.  I think that if Deputy McGilligan and his colleagues had their way, and if this matter were allowed to drag on for a further period of years, we would have no fund and nothing to discuss here. There would be no necessity for the introduction of this Bill because the Deputy and his colleagues would have collected whatever was in the fund by trying to continue the fight between the different sides endeavouring to collect it.</P>

      <P>There is only one point that I want to emphasise.  I did not belong to Sinn Féin and I am not interested in the disposal of this fund.  To my mind, however, there is an important fundamental point underlying the Bill, namely, interference with the courts.  To my mind that has been overlaid by a certain amount of local colour and local enthusiasm by people who think of the justice of their contentions and of the injustice of other people's contentions.  The point that I want to emphasise is that in this matter the functions of the courts are being set aside.  How many actions are proceeding in the courts at the present time in regard to which a lot of people might not with justification intervene and say: &ldquo;Look here, you two people are spending your money very foolishly and this matter ought to be decided in quite another way&rdquo;?  I would like to make this appeal to the Taoiseach, that this is a very small step but that a very big principle is involved.  Remember, every movement had its beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach is better acquainted with European history than I am. There were totalitarian States in Europe and they all started with the principle that the individual lost his right of appeal to the courts.  If I remember&mdash;the Taoiseach can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;Nazi Germany started by putting out of the universities the professors who were opposed to Government policy and took their means of earning a livelihood from them. <Col N="1427" /> That may have seemed a very small point.  They were talking against the Government or saying something that the Government did not like and their livelihood was interfered with.  Those people could not appeal to the courts. The right of appeal to the courts was taken from the ordinary people.  Starting in that way, the monstrous structure was reared which brought ruin to many countries.  I am sure the Taoiseach will say that is not contemplated under this Bill, but that was the start&mdash;interference with a fundamental right of the individual.  That is the point that we have to keep before us in connection with this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Moran, one had the interesting experience of seeing the political mind of the Fianna Fáil Party unveiled.  Everyone realises that there is a big principle involved in this section, a principle which nobody could defend.  Nobody in this House with any respect for the liberty of the people and the independence of the courts could defend such an attack as is contemplated in this section.  Deputy Moran knows that there are a certain number of ignorant people in this country.  He knows that such people have been the backbone of the Fianna Fáil Party.  He knows that the number is considerable, and he hopes it will increase.  Therefore he seeks to have this attack on the independence of our courts brushed aside in the minds of the people by making an attack upon the people who plead in the courts&mdash;the lawyers.  His line of argument is this: &ldquo;There is a big sum of money involved and we of the Fianna Fáil Party propose to divide it amongst the poor and the destitute relatives of those who suffered in the national cause.  We are going to do a big, public-spirited act on behalf of those poor weak people, but the greedy lawyers of the Opposition Party want to have this money divided amongst themselves.  They want to have this case going on in the courts for years so that they will swallow up the amount of money involved.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the kind of propaganda that has been used for years to gull simple-minded people, but I think that even <Col N="1428" /> the simplest of simple-minded people are beginning to grow up.  Events have happened, as Deputy Dockrell has pointed out, in Europe during the past five or six years which have revealed the danger of placing unlimited power in the hands of an Executive, even when that Executive is elected by the majority of the people. Events have shown the danger of taking away from independent courts the power which they should have to check an all-powerful Executive. There is no doubt whatever that if, whenever a question that affects the executive Government comes before the courts, you step in and deprive the courts of power to deal with it you are reducing the courts to complete futility and an absurdity.  The time will come, if this procedure is continued, when no lawyer or counsel with any sense of self-respect will allow himself to be made a member of the High Court or the Supreme Court if he finds that every time an action is brought into court which reflects in some way upon the ruling politicians of the country, his power is taken completely from him and legislation is passed suspending the action.</P>
    <P>That is a principle which no impartial and no free-minded member of this House could support.  Let the courts deal with this case and decide as they will.  If there is nothing left when this complicated action is finished, well the amount of money involved is not so big as to justify us in destroying the principle of the freedom of our judiciary to decide all questions of justice. That is the issue that is raised in this section.  It is an issue which cannot be brushed aside by appealing to the kind of loutish outlook which Deputy Moran has suggested.  In spite of the Fianna Fáil Party, in spite of Fianna Fáil's educational system and their intensive propaganda over a long period, the people are still capable of deciding important issues and this particular issue is too important for the people to allow themselves to be gulled in respect to it.</P>
    <P>If we calmly accept this section on the plausible plea that it will save a small amount of money for poor and destitute people, we may find, and the members of the Fianna Fáil Party may <Col N="1429" /> find, in time, that we have no protection in this country from an all-powerful Executive, that we can be treated as plain people in Russia are being treated to-day and as plain people in Germany were treated yesterday. We must defend resolutely the independence of our courts.  Therefore, no matter how our action may be misrepresented by the Fianna Fáil propaganda machine, we must resist this attempt to destroy the liberty of the plain people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Walsh of Drogheda has been 40 years a member of the Sinn Féin organisation.  There is no better authority in Ireland than he on the history of that organisation or on its present state.  He intervened in this debate on an earlier section to-day to tell the House that, of his personal knowledge, the remainder of the executive of Sinn Féin were in existence and he complained that, being in existence, they were trying improvidently to dissipate the remaining funds of the organisation.  His <i>bona fides</i> in making that statement cannot be called in question.  He believed he was contributing to the case the Taoiseach was making.  He was trying to help the Taoiseach.  His capacity to give testimony cannot be impugned for he has spent half a lifetime in the service of this particular organisation.  In the light of his testimony we are confronted with the position that a body, for whose continuity and existence the Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party is prepared to go bail, is striving in the courts to assert their right to their own property.  Now, that may be improvident. It may be, in our judgment, foolish.  It may be, in our judgment, inexpedient.  But surely no one can contend that it is criminal.  No one can contend that they are doing something which is against the law.  Far from it.  They are availing of the law to assert their right to what Deputy Walsh at least holds strongly is their own property, which they hold for the benefit of the Sinn Féin organisation &mdash;of which they are the surviving executive&mdash;and the national work for which that organisation was originally instituted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one will more readily agree than <Col N="1430" /> I that in the long history of political organisations or any other human organisations there will tend to be differences and partings on the way, and sometimes there will occur ambiguity as to who departed and who remained.  Such a situation appears to have arisen here.  The Taoiseach believes that when he departed nothing remained.  Mrs. Buckley insists that he was not the first one to abandon the ship and doubtless will not be the last, but she is cast in the rôle of Casabianca and maintains that so long as she is prepared to stand upon the burning deck no one will strip the ship of its sails.  We may all have our opinions of her prudence and perspicacity.  Most of us have read the case as put by Mr. J.J. O'Kelly and we may all have our opinions as to his prudence and discretion. But can there be any two opinions in this House as to their rights to be equal with their fellow-citizens before the law?  That is all I am concerned for.</P>
    <P>I have said before that I know nothing of the merits of this dispute. I was never a member of Sinn Féin.  I know nothing of the origin of these funds and have no opinion as to how they might properly be disposed of.  I am solely concerned to ensure that the rights of persons described by the Taoiseach as insignificant, unimportant, will not be trampled upon and doubtless I am not disinterested in that.  I am apprehensive on their behalf lest on to-morrow's morrow I might find myself in similar case.</P>
    <P>Bear in mind what it is proposed to do.  These people are not contemplating an action.  These people are not planning a foray.  These people have made their appeal to the court and the court has received them and is at this moment in the process of deliberating the issues joined between the parties.  It is quite true that these people, because they are poor people, because they are silly and insignificant people, have been unable to raise the funds to prosecute their cause with the industry and expedition that rich people and influential people could have employed.</P>
    <P>Does that disqualify them from the right to have their case tried?  Deputy Moran intervened this evening.  Deputy Moran is a solicitor and an officer of <Col N="1431" /> the courts.  He seemed to me to subscribe to the proposition that it is a very laudable thing that Oireachtas Éireann should take an adverse view of one litigant's case, that we should break into the courts, terminate the proceedings and give what he is prepared to describe&mdash;a &ldquo;common-sense decision&rdquo;.  Deputy Moran often provides for this House the oddest echoes of the past.  A few days ago he talked about the obligation of maintaining law and order and I saluted him as the pleasing echo of that admirable old gentleman, albeit he is dead, Buckshot Forster.  There was a time when oppressed citizens, fleeing from the vengeance and ferocity of the executive, used to take refuge in sanctuary &mdash;in those days the Church&mdash;and the most bloodthirsty and reckless oppressor used to stop short of the sanctuary threshold.  Then there came the time when respect to the Church began to dwindle and we got some bloodthirsty villains who, when moved with sufficient fury against their victims, would break into the sanctuary and murder their victims on the steps of the altar. Then when the sanctuary of the Church was turned down a similar protection grew up in free societies whereby men who were oppressed or who feared that their rights were going to be taken from them had recourse to the courts. The principle was that, no matter how powerful the antagonist, once you got into the courts you were safe.  Time and time again we see the interim injunction granted, the conditional order of habeas corpus, in which the court says: &ldquo;We have not had time yet to judge all the merits of this application.  Here is a humble individual who has applied to us for protection.  We will give it. Let no man touch him until such time as we have heard his case, and if his case is good we will give him an enduring protection; and if his plea is frivolous we will turn him out from his sanctuary where, for the time being, he must be safe.&rdquo;  That endured for a long time and the knowledge that that is part of our life is what makes us the free men that we are&mdash;the knowledge that if anyone tries to restrict our freedom the courts are there and we can have recourse to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> There is no power in the land powerful enough to set them at naught. That is what gives me courage to say in public what I think of the Taoiseach. Much as we detest the Government of the country at the present time, this is a free country and every man in it is free to speak his mind, to think his thoughts, to write and say whate'er he pleases within the law. No matter how bad the political Government may be, it is a happy thing for people when they can boast they live under free institutions and that if they have complaints to make all the majesty of the State will be martialled to protect their right.  All that is put in peril here.  It is the merest absurdity to pretend that we do not always know that the reason the Executive has gone into action with this Bill at this stage is because Mrs. Buckley and Sceilg have announced their intention of subpoenaing the Taoiseach and of getting a particular senior and junior counsel to crossexamine, whom I could name.  The Taoiseach is blooming well not going to be cross-examined.  That is the length and breadth of it.  He thinks that that chapter in history is best closed.  Observe what we are asked to sanction.  The Taoiseach is the leader of the largest Party in the State.  He is the Prime Minister of the country.  He is a very important person.  He has 70 odd obedient Deputies in this House who will tramp into any lobby he flogs them into for anything.  In the hands of an unscrupulous man such power might become the latchkey to dictatorship.  In that very different situation in which he has this obedient flock of sheep at his beck and call Mrs. Buckley and Sceilg whom he describes as &ldquo;insignificant people&rdquo; challenge him, throw down the gauntlet to the great man, and say: &ldquo;Trivial and insignificant as we may be, powerful as you have become since you deserted the ship to which we have remained faithful, before the law we are equal and we propose to avail of that advantage&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is the crisis.  There is the powerful pater and once the wicked one has had recourse to the sanctuary of the law he will refrain to use his power to break down the door and destroy <Col N="1433" /> him at the altar.  Is not that what he is trying to do?  Nominally, the defendants in this action are the trustees. They are merely persons whose names appear there and who consented to hold these funds purely for purposes of kindness.  The director of this operation is the Prime Minister, and it was his decision that these proceedings should be brought to an end by legislation of this character.</P>
    <P>If we do this for the Executive at the expense of Mrs. Buckley and J.J. O'Kelly, two insignificant members of the Executive of Sinn Féin, what guarantee have we, any one of us, that if the necessity for seeking sanctuary in the courts should arise to-morrow or the next day an exactly similar procedure would not be adopted?  What individual liberty remains with any of us if there is no power left in the land which can stand between the individual and an Executive stirred by vengeance? Remember, it is just on this slippery slope that every State in Europe has lost its freedom and started on the way down.  In every case it was represented that the first occasion for setting aside the courts was due to the wholly exceptional character of the individual case in which it was proposed to be done.  But, invariably, the consent of the Legislature to that course was used as a precedent to do it in a wider and wider category of cases, until eventually it became merely the creature of the tyrant.</P>
    <P>Think then what we put in jeopardy and the reward we reap.  £8,000 of this money has gone.  When this Bill passes, there is another £8,000 of litigation available to the parties in this case, because they can contest the constitutionality of this Bill themselves by going to the Supreme Court.  When the provisions of this Bill are used in the High Court to stay the action and to compel the court to do the things set out in Section 10, if the court proceeds to do that, what is to stop the plaintiffs appealing to the Supreme Court on the ground that the action was <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution and that the court was acting outside its jurisdiction?  Does anyone question that there is sufficient doubt about whether this piece of legislation is <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution that the Supreme Court would not at <Col N="1434" /> least hear argument upon it and say that the one who brought that issue before them for determination was justified in seeking a ruling from them?</P>
    <P>If £16,000 of this fund is spent, there is to be salvaged £10,000 for the excellent purposes the Taoiseach and others have in mind.  I will vote gladly for a Supplementary Estimate, if it is introduced to-morrow, to put into a fund from the public Exchequer, £28,000, the whole of this sum, if the Government will drop this Bill.  I would sympathise with certain of the old veterans of the Sinn Féin movement who feel that here is a sum of money which would provide an endowment with which old people who did their best in days gone by would be relieved.  I can sympathise with their chagrin at seeing it dwindle in the course of litigation.  We are a sovereign authority; we represent the people; we have power to act in their name and we have to answer to them for our actions.  I will vote for a Supplementary Estimate of £28,000 to-morrow and nobody need worry another hour about the potential beneficiaries of these funds suffering as a result of allowing the law to take its course.  Then all this controversy can stop, and all the scandal, all the doubt, all the apprehensions that have been raised will be put an end to and we can find common ground, but not to establish a new fund to be administered by the House as a whole.  I am breast high for the proposal to put £28,000 into a fund to be administered by such members of this House as were members of the old Sinn Féin organisation and let them choose whatever form of body they think right to administer this fund in the interest of their old colleagues, or any person who deserves help, or any suitable purpose that commends itself as a proper <i>cy pres</i> trust to a group of members of this House who at one time shared responsibility for the Sinn Féin movement.</P>
    <P>It is not the money that matters.  It is that most precious right of sanctuary without which written constitutions mean nothing; without which individual liberty is the merest chimera.  If I have no place where I can go in the certain knowledge that my liberty will be vindicated by someone who is stronger than the Government, I am <Col N="1435" /> no longer free.  It is not the disinterested solicitude of the rights of Mrs. Buckley and Sceilg that makes me fight this issue.  It is because I feel the hot breath of something that is worse than anarchy upon my neck that Sceilg and Mrs. Buckley should lose the rights without which I would rather die.</P>
    <P>It is because I am afraid Deputies may not realise the gravity of the decisions that are being taken to-day that I exhort the Taoiseach to sound all the Parties in this House as to whether the proposal I make would not be much more acceptable.  I dare to swear it will.  If that course is adopted, then all our apprehensions disappear and the fire and the controversy, which are only just beginning, will be averted. Surely £28,000 is a small price to pay for the deliverance, more especially when we are paying it to trustees whose function will be to relieve those who served the country according to their consciences.</P>

      <P>I intervene in this debate, without having had any intention of doing so, largely because of the speech of Deputy Moran.  Amongst the many difficult tasks that faced the first Government of this country after the establishment of this State, and perhaps not the least difficult of those tasks, was the problem of seeing that the Irish people realised and appreciated that the laws which were enacted by the Oireachtas and which were being interpreted by the courts were the laws of the Irish people, and that the judges who were interpreting those laws were judges taken from the Irish people and who understood the Irish people.  To bring home the realisation of what had been achieved and what was necessary if this State were to survive, Kevin O'Higgins gave his life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An effort was made in every possible way to see that our courts justified the confidence of the people and that the people had confidence in our judges.  I think it may be safely stated that, after years of effort, years of sacrifice, in the course of which some prominent people laid down their lives to see that <Col N="1436" /> achievement fulfilled, we reached the stage where our people did have confidence in our courts, and where our courts did justify the confidence the people reposed in them.  Anything which disturbs that confidence of the people is to be seriously deprecated. Anything which makes the people suspicious or uneasy that the Legislature is unduly interfering with the functions of the courts, anything which makes it apparent to the people that something is being done for a political motive by the interference of this House with the functions of the courts, is something which will undermine the confidence which has been established in the hearts and minds of our people in their judiciary.</P>
    <P>If this Bill does that, then we ought to drop it.  Having regard to what has taken place in the debate, it seems to me there is an uneasiness in the people about this Bill and, when it is stated here, as it appears to have been stated by the Prime Minister, the head of the Government, that some sort of what he called an unreal decision would be given by the courts on certain facts and that that would justify the Oireachtas in stepping in before the judge who had to deal with this particular action exercised his functions, I think that the fear that I have will be justified, that that confidence which was built up by effort and by sacrifice, the confidence of our people in their own laws and in their own courts, will receive a very serious blow.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there is a problem to be solved in connection with these funds; I appreciate that these funds should not be allowed to remain dormant for ever and that something should be done.  That that problem is one of some difficulty is fully appreciated, but what is not appreciated is that no effort has been made through the years to deal with that problem as it existed and while these funds were lodged in court, and why it should become so urgently essential, when the plaintiffs in a pending action in the High Court are pressing their claim for a hearing, that this Legislature should intervene to stop that action from being proceeded with to a judgment, I fail to understand.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1437" /> Deputy Moran stated that this was not the first time we had done something like this through this Chamber of the Legislature.  He is quite right in that assertion.  Every time any such action was initiated by the Government, we opposed it.  The very example that Deputy Moran gave, we opposed it for the same reasons of principle that we are now opposing this particular Bill.  The Legislature, in my submission, should never interfere with the action of the judiciary unless the public interest gravely demands it.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Taoiseach to the consideration of what I think was the first occasion when the Irish Legislature interfered in connection with a matter that had been the subject of a suit in the courts between private litigants, and that was in the case of Lynam and Butler.  It fell to me, as my first official act, in the year 1926 to see that the efforts of certain people to subject the decisions of our Supreme Court to the examination of an outside body were nullified.</P>
    <P>That task was entrusted to me by the late Kevin O'Higgins and it resulted in the passage of the Land Act of 1926, which was subsequently described by the Lord Chancellor of England as an amazing expedient in the circumstances. That prevented a private litigant, not from prosecuting his actions in these courts&mdash;it did not upset the decision of our courts&mdash;but from doing that which the people of this country did not want, namely, an appeal to the Privy Council, an outside body.  And it did more than that.  It declared the law to be, and always to have been, what our Supreme Court had laid it down as having been.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Moran thinks that is a precedent for this particular action, then he is vastly mistaken.  What was done in that case is what I suggest the Taoiseach could take as a headline&mdash; that if and when it becomes necessary to interfere with the decisions of our courts, it should be done only when the public interests gravely demand it, and it should be done so far as possible only in circumstances which recognise and establish the decisions of our courts, and if it is necessary to pass legislation in consequence of those <Col N="1438" /> decisions, those decisions must be regarded as sacred.</P>
    <P>Here we have a case involving what is comparatively a small amount of money which has lain dormant for many years.  I have already stated that I realise there is a problem to be dealt with, but this is not the time nor the place nor the means to deal with it. The time is at the moment when this action is being pressed for hearing, when counsel engaged for the plaintiffs are going to the court day after day asking for a hearing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moran suggested that the delay in bringing this case to a hearing was itself strong evidence, if not conclusive evidence, that the plaintiffs had no real case at all and that it was something in the nature of a blackmailing action.  I do not know anything whatever about the merits or even about the facts of the plaintiffs' case, and I care less, but the suggestion put forward by Deputy Moran in regard to the delay in bringing proceedings could not under any circumstances be regarded as a justification for departing from a principle which should be held sacred by this Legislature, the principle of not interfering with the constitutional right of citizens to go to the courts and have their cases adjudicated upon by the judges appointed for that purpose.  The procedure of our courts enables a litigant who has been harassed by an action, in which delaying tactics are adopted, to meet and defeat these tactics.  I understand that some steps were taken by some of the defendants or the parties to this action with a view to seeing that the action was disposed of.  The fact that a delay takes place is not due sometimes to any belief on the part of one of the contending parties that he has not a good case.  It frequently arises&mdash;it may possibly be the reason in this case; I know nothing about the case and, as I say, I care less&mdash;that the parties have not the necessary funds to enable the action to be prosecuted to the end.</P>
    <P>I do think that we ought to protest that, in a matter of such insignificance compared with many of the problems with which this Legislature has to deal, an attempt should be made to infringe <Col N="1439" /> on the fundamental right of citizens and to lay down a very bad precedent. I might approach this problem in an entirely different spirit if, after the plaintiffs in the present action had proceeded with their action and the court had determined that they had no case, something remained to be done with reference to the fund.  Then the question could be considered calmly and without any danger of infringing fundamental principles.  I do not think even in these circumstances, comparing the insignificant sum of £28,000 with the amount of money we normally have to administer, that this House should be involved in a consideration, occupying Parliamentary time, of what should be done with that particular money.</P>
    <P>Some other method could easily have been achieved by consultation or co-operation between whatever parties were interested in the old days in this old organisation.  Before the splits came and a spirit of bitterness entered into the matter some measures of agreement might have been achieved as to what should be done with the money. An agreed Bill could then have been passed without any bitterness or controversy, or the matter could have been left to the courts.</P>
    <P>It may be that there are individuals who gave subscriptions to this organisation who are interested in this matter.  I do not know, but as I understand the law, and I speak with great hesitation, in a matter of this kind, if it is established that an organisation has come to an end, whatever money is left belongs to the original subscribers.  There is a well-known case of an Oxford professor whose daughters were in very needy circumstances and in very poor health. A subscription was made up for them and when they died something was left.  The original subscribers then got back whatever was left, between them. It may be that there are some original subscribers who may want their money out of this £28,000.  They are entitled to make their case in court if they wish.  I do not know if there are any such individuals but we are not entitled to say that there are not such individuals until the court has determined the matter.  The courts could easily <Col N="1440" /> deal with these funds under the machinery which the courts have for dealing with charitable funds.  I would say, once any claim by private individuals to get any portion of the funds refunded to them, on the grounds that they were original subscribers, were dealt with, these funds could in the legal sense be referred to as charitable funds and be administered by the Commissioners for Charitable Donations and Bequests or a scheme could be drawn up for the administration of the funds <i>cy pres</i>, as it is called, without wasting the time of the court.</P>
    <P>Here is an action brought by a number of individuals, an action which is on the verge of hearing.  They would probably have their action heard by the courts if this Bill had not been introduced, in the next few weeks, certainly before the end of the long vacation.  In that state of affairs we are wasting the time of this House on this Bill and we are introducing a note of bitterness that should be absent.  Secondly, we are preventing the exercise of a very fundamental principle which should be sacred to every member of the House, no matter what side he belongs to.  It is for that reason, because we are infringing on the fundamental rights of the individual to go to court to have his case adjudicated and, because we are setting up a bad precedent, that I venture for the first time on this Bill to enter my protest.  I protest on the grounds of principle, on the ground that we are setting up a bad precedent and I cannot but have in my mind what was stated here within the last 12 months by a representative of the Government Party who now occupies a Ministerial position when he made observations which could only be, and were quickly interpreted, as being in derogation of our own courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Some statements have been made to which I should like to refer.  If I thought or felt that the principles which it is suggested by the Opposition are involved in this case were at issue, I would think £28,000 or even twice £28,000 a very small sum to sacrifice, but I have not been convinced by anything which I have heard that such a principle is involved.  I <Col N="1441" /> believe that we are doing justice here by this proposal.  It is the common knowledge of everybody in this country that these moneys were subscribed to a great national organisation representing practically the whole of the Irish people.  To point out the difference I asked how could it be said that people, who never had got these funds, never had any charge of them and who were so insignificant that I described them in the terms I did, could claim to be such an organisation.  That was the spirit in which I introduced the comparison, and not to suggest that because a person is poor or something of that sort, he has not equal rights before the law with his fellow-citizens. I made no such suggestion.</P>
      <P>It is because I know the facts of this case are so well known that I have not the slightest fear that anybody in the country will think we are going to establish a precedent by our action here.  This is a unique thing in so far as this State is concerned.  It is going to be unique and remain unique, because the great national organisation to which these moneys were subscribed, to the knowledge of everybody, was broken in two at the time of the Treaty, or subsequent to the Treaty, at the time of the attack on the Four Courts.  It may be suggested, and I do not say it would be beyond the power of proof, that a certain continuity from the old to the new has existed, but do you think that, because there was some formal continuity of that sort which might possibly be proved, that would in justice say that the moneys subscribed, and well known to have been subscribed, in these circumstances went over?  Is it not clear that that would be sacrificing the substance to a mere form?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The courts are not in a free position in dealing with these matters.  I said the other day&mdash;the actual word I used may not have been the best&mdash;that the courts might be compelled to come to an unreal decision.  What I meant by that is known to everybody&mdash;that our courts are fundamentally courts of law.  They are constrained to give their judgment, not in regard to what might be looked on as absolutely fundamental right but in accordance with the law as set down by the Legislature, with precedent or <Col N="1442" /> the common law, and it is because they were constrained to do that that, long ago, there was established side by side a system of equity until that system has become practically as formal as the law itself.  I say that we are here the court of equity in this matter, the fundamental court of equity, and that what I am striving for here is that substantial justice should be done as against formal justice.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that it could be proved before the courts that formal continuity existed, but if it did and if, constrained by either some precedent or some law, they came to a decision on those lines, I would say that so far as fundamental justice, fundamental right, was concerned, the decision would not be in accordance with all the facts.  One Deputy pretended that because I said the courts would not take all the facts into account, I was somehow casting aspersions on the courts.  The courts, we know, cannot go beyond the law and a judge is not at liberty to go beyond the law.</P>
    <P>There is a well-known case that comes to everybody's mind in this connection. Suppose A has lent a sum of money to B and the statutory period for repayment has elapsed.  No matter how just A's claim, and no matter how much the judge may regard the debt as properly due and no matter how much the person who got the money is known to be able to repay and the person who gave the money is known to be in need of it the law will be pleaded against him and redress cannot be given.  That is an obvious case.  A person who escapes his obligations legally in that sense, who may get legally free, is not in conscience free and he is bound, if able to and if the circumstances are as I have outlined, no matter what the court thinks, to give back the money to the person who lent it, or gave it to him, if he gave it in the form of a sum to be paid back.  That is a fact, and it could well happen in cases like this which are unique that the same sort of wrong could be done.</P>
    <P>I say, and I am prepared to go anywhere in the country and say, that everybody who knows the circumstances in which these moneys were contributed, in the first instance, <Col N="1443" /> knows perfectly well that those who are claiming these moneys at the present day because of a formal continuity or because of something they think they can establish, are not entitled to these moneys.  These moneys were a national fund.  The national organisation to which they belonged was, first of all, shattered by the division which followed the attack on the Four Courts.</P>
    <P>I did my best, following that, to try to keep the organisation in being, but there was nobody in the country who could deny that the organisation had been split in two.  At a later period, another division came.  It is quite true to say that, at the time of the division, those who left were in a minority, but we very soon proved before the people that we were very far from being a minority of that organisation, and the truth to-day is that, if we could do what has been suggested should be done, if possible, that is, to find the subscribers of that money, I feel certain that something like 90 per cent. of the people who subscribed that money would subscribe to the statement that the people who are claiming that money now did not represent them and did not represent the views they held. I would say also that, if there is any body in the country which did represent the national view at that time, it is the elected representatives of the Irish people, who are here.</P>
    <P>A queer topsy-turvydom seems to be operating in the minds of those who are making out principles here in regard to this matter.  This is a sovereign Legislature, sovereign under the Constitution. We can do nothing which is at variance with the Constitution. Anything we do can be declared null and void, if found to be contrary to the Constitution.</P>

      <P>The next thing brought up is that because we happen to be a majority of the elected representatives, we do not count at all, that the individuals who constitute the majority are not to count, but that the individuals who constitute the minority are.  But we have the spectacle of different groups in the minority trying to get themselves into a single Party in order that they might become a majority.  That is quite all right, but, so far as the reasoning is concerned, I say that the majority, whether as a single Party or as separate Parties, does represent by its vote here for the time being the will of the Irish people, and that there is no other way of getting it, except when election time comes along under the Constitution and the Irish people have to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we bring this matter here, we are bringing it to the sovereign court of justice, the court which can decide upon the substantial justice of what is proposed, and every act of ours here, every single measure and thing we do here, is to be judged by its fundamental justice, that is, its justice from the point of view of the well-being of the people as a whole, the common good. Bringing in this Bill, we have to stand or fall by it on the basis that it is for the common good.  The only decent arguments, as I should describe them, put up on the other side were as to whether our action in this instance makes for the common good or not.  As I said at the beginning, if I were to convince myself that the arguments put forward by the Deputies on the other side were correct and that the principle <Col N="1445" /> they referred to was involved, then I should say that it would be the duty of Parliament not to take this action, that the sum of money involved would be a mere bagatelle compared with the damage that would be done by violating that principle.  But I see no principle being violated.</P>
    <P>If there ever was a case in which it was clear to the minds of the people that we were doing the right and proper thing in preventing this money from being frittered away, this is the case. There is not the slightest doubt in the minds of the people that we are doing substantial justice in dealing with this money in this way.  There is no fear that the people will be scandalised or that they will feel that an attack is being made on the independence of the courts or anything of that sort.  The question of sanctuary, brought in here for the first time by Deputy Dillon, is a new principle, so far as I understand. I do not know exactly what it means. It is suggested by some people that we should wait until the courts would have decided and then take action.  Action has been taken in cases where the decisions of the courts have been known to be contrary to the intentions of the Legislature.  These cases are few, and I am quite willing to admit that it would be very wrong, indeed, lightly to enter into this case.  This is no light matter.</P>
    <P>These were moneys subscribed by the Irish people for a certain purpose.  I have been in close touch with the movement the whole time.  I was president when these moneys were subscribed and I have been in touch with political developments in one way or another since.  I have no hesitation in saying that it would be substantial injustice&mdash;no matter how formally it might appear to be true&mdash;if these people were to get the money.  What is happening?  Not having the power to get the money without going to the courts, they are striving to have, at any rate, the satisfaction of seeing that the moneys will be dissipated.  We waited, as I said before.  It was the legal representative of the treasurers who had lodged the money in court who took the initiative by coming to me.  He said that these funds had been lying there and that he was anxious <Col N="1446" /> that any obligation he had should be ended.  He suggested that legislation might be introduced to deal with the fund.</P>
    <P>When that was suggested, I said that some of those who were members of the executive of the organisation when these moneys were subscribed were still living.  He mentioned to me the plan he proposed.  It was substantially what is in this Bill.  I suggested that he should go out and see whether those I had mentioned would approve of that and, if they did, I said I should be prepared to recommend the Government to bring in a Bill and that I felt that the Government would do so.  He went out and got agreement, with one exception. There was some question of the exception being brought over to consider that this was the right and proper method and it was suggested that this proposition should be considered at a meeting.  This action was then brought into court for the first time.</P>
    <P>A statement of claim&mdash;I am not sure about the technical term&mdash;was put in and a defence was lodged by the Attorney-General.  Deputy McGilligan tries to pretend that I should find myself in extraordinary difficulties if I were to be called as a witness in this case because, in the statement of defence, the claim of the plaintiffs was denied.  Everybody knows that, if you do not deny the allegations in a statement of claim, they have not to be proven.  For the legal conduct of an action, it is absolutely necessary, if you want to have the averments of the plaintiffs tested in court, that they should be denied.  If not denied, they are taken as accepted and may never come before the court for trial at all. These matters were settled by the Attorney-General.  So far as I should be concerned as a witness in court, all I should have to do, if asked, would be to give evidence as to what happened at a particular time.  Giving that evidence would not embarrass me in the slightest.  I should not have to make the final decision.  If that decision were to go in a way with which I disagreed, I should be immediately relieved of any responsibility.  So far as that is concerned, there was no difficulty to be apprehended.  I am assuming that the court would see that the <Col N="1447" /> questions I would be asked would be relevant to the issue.  If that were done I should have no difficulty in answering the questions put.</P>
    <P>I might be asked: what was the position when these funds were subscribed and was I president.  I might be asked, too, was I trustee.  I was appointed trustee, I think, on the 9th December, 1921.  It was after the signature of the Treaty.  I was proposed and unanimously accepted as trustee of these funds in the belief that, if there was a division, as there was likely to be, I should act justly.  There was a sort of responsibility upon me.  I do not know how, ultimately, I should have to carry it out&mdash;whether I should have to do what the treasurers ultimately did and say: &ldquo;I am trustee but that does not mean that I have any right to dispose of those funds in a particular way; I shall have to leave that to the courts&rdquo;.  The moneys were lodged in court by the treasurers and, if I were asked such questions, I should simply have to state the facts as I knew them, so far as my recollection would serve me as regards matters which occurred over a quarter of a century ago.  My recollection might be weak but there would be documents which could substantiate the truth of the situation.  I might be asked what the position was when I tried to re-organise Sinn Féin.  I should say what I have no hesitation in saying here&mdash; that I tried to re-organise the old organisation because some of the members of the executive wanted to let the whole thing drop.  I tried to re-organise the organisation.  How far I succeeded would be a matter for the court to determine in accordance with the facts.  If I were asked relevant questions, I might be asked: when you put up those propositions in 1926 for the future policy of the organisation and when you were turned down, were you a majority or a minority? I should have to admit that I was a minority on the vote of the organisation at that time and that I left the organisation.  If I were asked: what is the position to-day, I should say that, in the period which had elapsed, the organisation had changed very much in character and that, no matter <Col N="1448" /> what form of continuity they could show, the substantial fact was that the organisation to which these moneys were originally subscribed represented the Irish people as a whole while the body that claims the moneys now, no matter what they may say about formal continuity, do not represent the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>If the money could be given back to the subscribers, it is suggested that would be the proper thing to do, but the circumstances were such, in the way in which the money was collected, that it would be quite impossible to do so.  An individual subscriber might be able to come forward and say: &ldquo;Here is my receipt; I gave this money to such a body; give me my share of the money.&rdquo;  It could be done in that case.  However, you could not deal with a question of this particular kind in that way.  My way of dealing with it, which I believe is substantial justice, is to say that the representatives of the Irish people here, in whose cause and for whose fundamental purpose these moneys were subscribed, comprise the most equitable body to decide how the funds should be used.</P>
    <P>When I came in with this Bill, I said that I was not wedded to it.  As a matter of fact, personally I do not care for the method of approach which is proposed for the disposal of these moneys, as I am afraid that, no matter how it is done, a considerable amount will be spent in administration.  That is a pity.  I would very much prefer what was done on a previous occasion, in the case of the anti-conscription funds about which we could not agree. It was decided to hand them over for an educational purpose and those moneys became the basis of the Mansion House scholarship.  I would prefer by far, if it were left to me, that these moneys should be used for some purpose which was closer to the common purpose of all the Parties who might exist to-day and who formed part of that organisation.  One of the primary things we had in common was the restoration of the language.</P>
    <P>I tried over a period of years to get the Sinn Féin organisation to agree with the other part of that organisation which had broken away at the <Col N="1449" /> time, that the moneys should be used for some such purpose; but I failed in that.  What I am interested in is to see that the fundamental purposes for which this money was subscribed and the purpose in the minds of the people who gave the subscriptions should be fulfilled.  I am also interested in preventing this money from being wasted on purely legal arguments over something which, in its nature, should not be decided on strictly legalistic lines. It should be decided on the fundamental merits of the case.  If there had been any disposition on the part of the Opposition to co-operate in any way in dealing with this matter, I would have been only too happy to do so.</P>

      <P>If the principle is the principle that has been suggested in the Opposition Benches as being involved, we would not get any further in that way.  I do not care in the slightest, as long as it is a national purpose agreeing with that for which the original subscriptions were given. I have no interest whatever in the way in which the money is dealt with.  This particular scheme was put up to me&mdash;I did not originate it&mdash;on the basis that the majority of the old executive would have agreed to it.  The death roll in the old executive has been pretty heavy, and only two members are alive of the officer board of nine which was decided upon&mdash;as far as my memory goes&mdash;as the body that would have control of the organisation after the February Árd Fheis of 1922. Those two are Dr. Kathleen Lynn and myself.  Of the other body, the standing committee, I think only seven are alive out of 15.  When Judge Wyse Power went to meet the existing members, there were more than there are to-day.  In the five or six years that have intervened, a further number has died off.  That body seemed to be willing to meet and try to decide the matter.  It could not be said we were all of one opinion, as we had gone different roads politically.  If those had met and had agreed upon a scheme of <Col N="1450" /> this sort, I would have been willing to adopt it.</P>
      <P>I know that a certain amount of good can be done by the money, if it is administered properly.  There are some cases which it would be desirable to relieve.  Some Deputies, in speaking about this Bill in the beginning, asked why we did not bring in legislation to deal with cases like that, instead of having them dealt with out of a fund of this sort.  It is impossible to deal with that by legislation, as the moment you bring in legislation you have to deal with a particular type of person and you have to be definite in terms of a general class and then the law takes its course.  In the case of a body like this, it is intended they would have a good deal of discretion.</P>
      <P>It was suggested to-day that we were going to hand-pick the board.  I would be very willing and happy to have co-operation, to have a panel of names from the Opposition, which would suggest some people they would like to have on the board.  However, somebody has to appoint the board, somebody has to be specified in the Bill.  The Chief Justice was brought into this question.  If I thought there would have been what I regard as scandalous attacks on the office and on the person of the Chief Justice through the introduction of this Bill, I certainly would have thought twice before bringing it in.  The Chief Justice was thought of by us in a very simple way, as a person in whom there would be public confidence as chairman of this board, so that these funds would be administered only in accordance with the general terms of reference set out in the Bill.  Someone has to decide on the appointments to the board and it is on the actual appointments that judgment should be passed.  Why anticipate that and say that the Government is going to appoint creatures of their own just to do what they want?  That is not the spirit in which it is proposed at all.  If we were anxious to do that sort of thing, we would not have waited for 15 years to take action of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the suggestion that we were taking away from the independence of the board, since a committee <Col N="1451" /> could be set up on the initiative of the Attorney - General to investigate whether a particular person should be removed or not, my view is that the idea of giving the board continuity would require something like that. We are leaving them independent from day to day, but there must be some provision by which, if a person is going to operate for life, one can know whether the person is capable of functioning or not.  We have to do that in the Constitution, even with such a high office as that of President.  We have to have some machinery.  If anyone suggested a different method, I would be willing to examine it, to see if we could not get agreement.  I am anxious to get co-operation from members of the Opposition in trying to get this done, but am refused that co-operation on the ground that some fundamental principle, which I cannot see, is being violated here.  This is a unique position with regard to these funds.  If the Opposition hold that position and if I cannot get co-operation from them any more than I could get co-operation on the resolution which was passed recently about the privileges of the House&mdash;that is from the principal Opposition, because I forget whether the other members of the Opposition refused to co-operate&mdash; then the only thing for us to do is to go on and do the thing ourselves.  I think I am explaining the position fully.  There is only one way of resolving differences on disputed questions here and that is by a vote of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech to which we have just listened compels me to intervene once again because it consists of a variety of muddled thought, false analogies and dangerous doctrines. The Taoiseach's speech is an example of the trite saying that a little learning is a dangerous thing. As I understand the position, he wishes to draw a distinction between law and what he calls a body of equity.  We learned in our student days that equity did not vary as the phrase went with the chancellor's foot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach's speech was to say that if the law does not suit him then <Col N="1452" /> equity is to be the length of the Taoiseach's foot.  It is to be measured by what he thinks is to be the justice and equity of the situation.  We are told here in plain language, so far as we can get any plain language from the Taoiseach, that this matter is decided now, irrespective of what a decision of the court might or might not be because, he says, either these people will be declared to be wrong by the courts, in which event everything is grand, or they will be declared to be right by the courts, in which event the Taoiseach says: &ldquo;I say they are wrong because I know, and, therefore, equity is to be measured by while my knowledge of what I say is correct.&rdquo; Because a decision may be given in that case by the court, not on the law but on the facts as proved in evidence in court before an independent tribunal, if that decision is against what the Taoiseach conceives to be the facts as he knows them, and as he thinks they ought to be, then that decision, although a decision of a court of law, is something contrary to what he says is equity.</P>
    <P>There is no such thing as a distinction between equity and law.  If the Taoiseach will ask any experienced judge that he knows he will be told that the only anchor to which justice can be attached is the full interpretation and application of the law as declared by the courts.  Otherwise, you will have each individual Deputy acting as a judge, as the Taoiseach wants to do now, giving what he conceives to be the merits of the case without hearing the full facts.  There is nothing that leads to greater injustice in the end than to find each judge giving what he thinks are the merits of a case and not giving the full application of the law which is the only yardstick by which to measure justice.  I think it is a very dangerous doctrine for the head of the Government to declare that there is a distinction between equity and law.  The Taoiseach brought in the false analogy between the conscience of a person who gets a decision from a court and the Statute of Limitations that he is bound to pay a debt. The law declares that he is not.  I am no theologian, but I assert that the Taoiseach's theology is absolutely incorrect, <Col N="1453" /> and that it is not binding upon the conscience of a person to pay a debt which is statute barred.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that he is bound theologically and legally, as well as in justice according to his own lights, as to what ought to be the situation.  I say that is a dangerous doctrine that ought to be put an end to at once&mdash; this doctrine that something like equity comes out of one man's mind in this country.  That is what I am protesting against, the suggestion that there is a difference between equity and law.  If the Taoiseach says that there is a matter of conscience in any way under the Statute of Limitations then why, during the last 15 years, did he not bring in a Bill to do away with the Statute of Limitations?  That is as false an analogy of the facts of the present case as could possibly be conceived. It is a false analogy, false theology and a dangerous doctrine to lay down in a country of this kind, and I think that the sooner it is repudiated by the Taoiseach the better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I know of no such case. If the law says that a person is not bound to pay a thing back there is no matter of conscience in that.  A man is entitled to act in accordance with the law of the country, passed in accordance with the principles of ethics.  I know of no law of conscience, of theology or ethics to force a man to pay back money in conscience.  I repudiate any such doctrine being put forward as an excuse for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that the Taoiseach has decided this&mdash;that is what it comes to&mdash;because he knows the facts.  I am a member of this House and I am supposed to vote and act according to my conscience on this Bill, and according to what I think is right.  I do say most solemnly that I know nothing whatever about the facts of this case beyond the fact that there is an action pending in the courts of justice of this country in which certain people claim that they have a right to these funds. I do not care whether that action succeeds <Col N="1454" /> or fails.  If the plaintiffs fail in that action then, as Deputy McGilligan has asserted, they will be condemned in the payment of costs for their failure.</P>

      <P>If it is a reasonable case you are taking it away from the court.  If those people have an unreasonable case they will be dealt with by an impartial judge.  If they have a reasonable case you are interfering with their rights under this Bill.  The Taoiseach says this House is a tribunal of fact, the best tribunal of fact to determine the facts of this case.  No tribunal of fact can determine a question of fact without knowing the facts. I suppose I am in as good a position as any member of the House to get to know something about the facts if I took the trouble to ask some colleagues in the Bar Library.  I certainly know very little about the facts.  I do not know enough of the facts to enable me to say that this is a Bill which ought, in justice to the plaintiffs or anybody else, to be passed.  I am told that the justification for the Bill is that this House is a tribunal of fact.  The representatives here are elected to consider and to pass measures for the security, safety and welfare of the State, but that this House is a proper tribunal of fact, I repudiate that suggestion altogether. No body can be a judge of fact unless they have the facts before them, and the facts have not been brought before this Assembly.  I am a member of this Assembly and I know very little, if anything, about the facts.  I am told by the Taoiseach that I must vote one way or the other on the facts.  I have no facts.  I am unable to determine the facts, and, consequently, the entire basis of the Taoiseach's argument falls completely.  He says these are the facts and because he says they are the facts, therefore, they are the facts, and he says if the courts decide contrary to <Col N="1455" /> that, if the courts decide that these plaintiffs are entitled to these funds, or any of them, they are deciding then contrary to equitable principles and in accordance with legalistic notions.  I do not know what he means.  I do not know what legalistic notions are or what are these matters that the Taoiseach brought into his speech about fundamental principles of equity as distinguished from legalistic concepts. I do not know what fundamental principles of equity are.</P>
      <P>The day has long since passed when there grew up in the courts of Britain a body of principles which were not, as the Taoiseach would have the people think, a body of principles that varied from time to time, but were as definite and ascertainable as the common law of Great Britain.  After a certain stage had elapsed, the principles of equity were as well settled and were as well known and the manner in which they were administered was as well known as the principles of common law.  They were brought in, not as a body of doctrines that varied from time to time or that varied, as was said in the phrase that I have repeated, with the chancellor's foot or with the chancellor's conscience.  They were certain principles that grew up over a long period of years to meet the exigencies of the situation in a particular state of civilisation in a particular country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, with his little learning, proceeds here to talk about fundamental principles of equity as distinguished from principles of common law.  I regard that as a dangerous doctrine.  I want to see the principle established here that the courts of this country are the proper body to interpret the laws passed by the Legislature of this country and that nobody is to come in here and say: &ldquo;I say that is contrary to equity and, therefore, because I say it, the Party that I belong to and that is for the moment the majority of this House must override the rights of the individuals as declared by our courts&rdquo;.  I say it is a false doctrine.  The speech which we have just listened to by the Prime Minister is even more dangerous as showing that there is a far more dangerous <Col N="1456" /> principle underlying the introduction and the forcing of the passage of this Bill than even I thought when I was compelled by the speech made by Deputy Moran to rise to make a protest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Costello has grounds for his complaint about the failure of the Taoiseach to use plain language.  Deputy Costello is an expert in these matters and if he reads sub-section (1) of Section 10 of this Bill he will find that the language is very plain to anybody who wants to understand it.  It is sufficiently clear to prove conclusively that this is a cool, deliberate and brazen attempt to interfere with the constitutional rights of individual citizens as well as the rights of organised bodies of citizens.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach speaks about fundamental principles and the purpose for which this money was originally subscribed. We are all either old enough or young enough to know that the money that was subscribed to the Sinn Féin funds by the patriotic citizens of the 32 Counties was subscribed at that time for the purpose of helping the Taoiseach and those who were identified with him&mdash;General Mulcahy and others&mdash;to secure the establishment of an Irish Republic.  We know that, whether the Sinn Féin movement still consists of the heirs and successors of the original body, or not, it is an active organisation, in active existence, still fighting for that particular aim.  Some of us may still subscribe to the aims but certainly I am one of those who do not subscribe to the tactics adopted by the body now in existence and the Taoiseach separated himself from the original body because he did not agree to pursue the tactics that were being pursued in or about 1926.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now he talks about co-operation.  I have some idea of the meaning of the word &ldquo;co-operation&rdquo; to the Taoiseach. I paid for my education in that respect and other Deputies on this side of the House also paid for the experience that taught them the Taoiseach's meaning of that word.  Co-operation is not a one-sided arrangement.  Co-operation is based on confidence between the Parties, faith in an objective and belief <Col N="1457" /> that the strong man&mdash;that is the Taoiseach in this case&mdash;is putting all his cards on the table.  I do not think the Taoiseach is in the habit of putting all his cards on the table.  He is always in the habit of keeping the joker or the ace of hearts up his sleeve when playing the political game of cards.  If the Taoiseach wants co-operation, let him put all his cards on the table all the time.  If he wants co-operation for the purpose of carrying out an arrangement of this kind he should seek it in a straightforward way before he brings in a brazenly worded measure of this kind, deliberately designed to interfere with the rights of the citizens of this State and to deprive them of the rights they have got under the Constitution, which the Taoiseach has christened his own baby.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello, Deputy Dillon and other lawyer Deputies have on previous occasions warned the Taoiseach about the doubtful constitutionality of certain sections in certain Bills.  I thank God that we have left in this State one who has the power, if he exercises it, to refer sections of a Bill to a body that will protect the constitutional rights of citizens.  That has been done on other occasions.  If this Bill passes, in its present form, containing in it the present Section 10&mdash;I have only a common-sense idea of the meaning of the section and I believe that this section, sub-section (1) particularly, is unconstitutional&mdash;I hope the first citizen of this State will refer the Bill to the body that still has the power to override the Taoiseach and to prevent the Taoiseach from having the last word in interpreting the common good.</P>

I could not possibly vote for a Bill containing what I understand to be contained in sub-section (1) of Section 10 of this Bill.  In no circumstances would I do so.

      <P>Unfortunately, Deputy Davin has overlooked the fact that the Taoiseach has informed the House that he consulted the Chief Justice and, under Section 4, the Chief Justice has consented to act as the chairman of the alternative tribunal, and that, therefore, if the Supreme Court finds this Bill to be unconstitutional they will be in the extremely awkward situation of finding that the Chief Justice himself took part in what they have deemed to be a serious trespass on the constitutional rights of the people.

He afraid to be put on oath! He afraid to be put in the witness box! He will go right in, in our presence.  In he steps.  On with the wig and gown, asks a question, rushes around to the witness box, answers it openly and frankly.  Back to the Bar. On with the wig and gown, asks a question, back to the witness box, answers it&mdash;as open as the day, simple <Col N="1459" /> as a child, clear as glass, anxious to answer any questions that anybody could think up to ask him.  But he is everybody and he is going to take mighty good care that he is not going to be cajoled or coerced or persuaded or prevailed upon to enter any witnessbox or court in which he will not be everyone&mdash;judge, witness, juryman, counsel for the defendant and counsel for the plaintiff as well.  I do not blame him.  That kind of codology is good enough for the Party he leads.  We can see them all with their mouths falling open.  The Opposition confound them.

      <P>The Taoiseach.  There he was in the box, eyes pressed, answering away like one o'clock. Every line, every question, every answer.  I have no doubt Radio Eireann is saying now that the Opposition slumped in their seats as the Taoiseach tore them to ribbons.  Oh, that codology has no more relevance to the real issue here involved than if he had stood up in his place and played <i>Phil the Fluter's Ball</i> on a penny whistle.  The issue was straightly put by Deputy Davin.  Is Section 10 (1) to become the law? What matters is that the Prime Minister of this country can say it would not be in accord with all the facts if the court returned a verdict that he believed would be wrong.  We, says the Taoiseach, are the court of equity. This is the language of madness when a man says in the same breath: &ldquo;If the courts find contrary to what I believe to be the facts then their verdict will not be in accord with all the facts,&rdquo; and in the next breath: &ldquo;We are the court of equity.&rdquo;  Who does that call to mind?  Who is the only other man in Europe who in this century allowed himself to be carried away to the point of claiming before the world: &ldquo;I am the national conscience&rdquo;? I will not answer that question.  Let every Deputy answer it for himself.  If he asks his neighbour he will tell him, and he will tell <Col N="1460" /> him how the man who persuaded himself that that was true ended up, and the nation which committed itself to his care.  The Taoiseach likes to refer when in this particular vein to this proposition.  This is a democracy, and in the last analysis the true test of a democracy is: shall the will of the majority prevail?  That is not the test for democracy.  The test of a democracy is, the measure of the majority's respect for the rights of the minority. When you find the majority recoiling from its power to impose its will on a minority who protests that a fundamental principle is here involved then you have a true democracy, and it is the measure in which that majority imposes that self-control that is the measure of a free democracy.  We will do this, we will do that, by the power of our majority&mdash;&ldquo;If need be,&rdquo; the Taoiseach will repeat.  That is the dangerous part of his mentality.  So long as everybody is prepared to co-operate <i>á la</i> de Valera democracy flourishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But when somebody claims that they stand upon a point of principle he feels constrained to remind all and sundry and, in the last analysis, that must prevail.  As Deputy Costello has said, if the situation in which we find ourselves, apprehends that the verdict of the courts on the law as it at present stands will produce a result which is other than we would wish it to be we have a perfect right to say that out of the national resources we will restore the position to what we think it ought to be and if the courts award this money to Mrs. Buckley or to Sceilg or to anybody else then we will find funds to put £28,000 or such other sum as may be fair and equitable in the hands of trustees representative of the old Sinn Féin organisation.  I have said once and I say again I will vote for that.  But that is a very different cup of tea from blundering into the courts and smashing up the judiciary.  The true test of democracy is this.  Does the Taoiseach doubt now, whatever his own views may be, that a great many of us on this side of the House feel <Col N="1461" /> that something very precious and very fundamental is at stake?  Perhaps we are wrong.  Maybe we are mistaken, but we feel that way just the same. We are not asking the Government to abandon any fundamental of their policy.  We are not asking them to jettison any part of the programme they claim as the mission of their Party.  We are saying just because we feel the way we do, just because you are the majority and we are the minority: &ldquo;Here is the opportunity to show that this country is a real democracy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>You feel that there is no principle at stake, merely a matter of expeditiously dealing with a tricky question. We feel a most precious and fundamental principle to be involved.  If you are democrats, how can you weigh your expediency against our profound conviction that something vital is here involved?  If there is democracy in this House, is it not the duty of democrats in a situation such as we find ourselves in to-night to say: &ldquo;If you say that a principle that really matters to you is here involved, we have nothing more substantial than convenience and we recognise at once that the scales are borne down upon your side, and because we are democrats, because we have the power to pass this Bill, or tear it up, we will say no more about it; we will let this case be tried to its judicial conclusion and we will write off any money it costs us for the very precious asset of one more case where this country has proved itself to be a true democracy&rdquo;? An undoubted majority, with power ready to its hand to impose its will should acknowledge that it has a duty to forgo that will and recognise that conviction in a matter of principle in a minority, no matter how small, provided it is honest, sincere and <i>bona fide</i>, is of infinitely more weight than any question of expediency, no matter how large the majority that entertained it.  Are these sound principles for all?  Is there not here an opportunity to give them unprecedented play?  I do not expect their application to be considered, but I do not like to admit to myself that an appeal to the spirit of democracy in this House has become utterly vain.</P>

The Deputy has the temerity to suggest that this matter could be dealt with quickly, while his colleague, Deputy McGilligan, who also spoke on this matter, spent two days in court during the past week arguing about two solitary words, the definition of what was &ldquo;ordinary residence&rdquo; in this country. <Col N="1464" /> If Deputy McGilligan was capable of arguing for two days about two solitary words, what would Deputy McGilligan and his colleague be capable of arguing on the implications of the matters involved in this particular case?</P>
