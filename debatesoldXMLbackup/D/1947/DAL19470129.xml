    <P>(b) Imported wheat is allocated to millers on a provisional basis designed to enable the milling industry to earn the agreed remuneration in each cereal year.  The position is not finalised for any year until the millers' financial accounts for that year are prepared and submitted for scrutiny in my Department.</P>
    <P>(c) There is no prescribed percentage of imported wheat in millers' grist. Frequent changes are made according to the type of flour, the imported wheat available at a particular time and the location of such wheat.  The over-all percentage of imported wheat in the grists in the period mentioned varied from as high as 60 per cent. down to 12½ per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that Michael Durning, 8 Kinsealy Lane, Malahide, County Dublin, who has nine children, has received no bread rations since he left his ration books in a shop in Malahide, to have <Col N="507" /> the essential pages removed; further, if he is aware that the local Gárdaí have informed him that he will have to complete ten application forms, with a shilling stamp on each form, before he may receive his rations; if, in view of this, he will take steps to have a supply of bread made available to this family; and if he is also aware that a similar position exists as regards some other families in the district.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the facts of this case were reported to me by him, and I arranged that supplies of bread would be made available to Mr. Durning.  If Mr. Durning makes application for the replacement of the missing registration pages, I am prepared to waive the usual fee in the special circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>Other persons in Malahide who have lost the pages of their ration books applicable to flour and bread should apply to my Department when the question of having supplies made available pending the replacement of the pages will be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that lightshipmen and sailors find it very difficult to obtain supplies of condensed milk; and if he will take steps to ensure that a sufficient quantity of this commodity will be made available for this particular class of worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that lightshipmen and sailors are finding it difficult to obtain normal supplies of condensed milk.  Supplies of this commodity substantially in excess of the pre-war home demand are available generally, and the owner or master of any ship not receiving normal supplies from the retail trader concerned should communicate particulars to the Condensed Milk Company of Ireland, Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister does not imagine that this question was put down just for fun?  Representations have been made to me and to several <Col N="508" /> other public representatives as to the shortage of condensed milk, in our area of Wexford, at least, and would the Minister promise to have the position investigated in that area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I should. The supplies of condensed milk available generally are considerably in excess of pre-war.  If there is a breakdown in local distribution arrangements, the matter can be rectified if the parties will bring the position to the notice of the main suppliers, the Condensed Milk Company of Ireland, Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that the Minister's reply is the most obvious quibble?  Supplies of condensed milk are on sale, but supplies of sweetened condensed milk are very much reduced, and people want sweetened condensed milk in order to save their sugar ration.  The Minister's reply is a quibble.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, pending a decision concerning the removal of the restrictions on the export of potatoes from the Cooley area, County Louth, he will arrange with the local industrial alcohol factory for payment of an increased price for the potatoes delivered to the factory, the increase to be sufficient to bring the new price up to the level of the present export price for potatoes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The export of potatoes is controlled by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The standard price paid for potatoes delivered at the Cooley factory is at present £4 10s. 0d. per ton and the <Col N="509" /> company is not prepared to increase that price.  The Deputy will appreciate that while, in existing circumstances, Cooley potatoes might command a higher price in the export markets, the Cooley potato growers have in the local alcohol factory a regular and assured market for their crop.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The official statistics compiled by my Department relate to representative prices for wool, irrespective of quality.  The representative prices paid to the producer for all grades of wool of the 1946-47 clip average 1/8¼ per lb.  The average price realised for exported wool was 1/9½ per lb.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the need for the provision of houses in County Dublin.  According to the last survey of the housing needs of County Dublin, Dún Laoghaire, and Balbriggan, it was estimated that 2,000 houses are required in County Dublin, 1,000 in Dún Laoghaire and 92 in Balbriggan.</P>
      <P>With regard to County Dublin, I have confirmed a Compulsory Purchase Order which authorises the acquisition of land for the building of 998 labourers' cottages.  Plans have been prepared for 11 groups comprising 498 cottages and the preparation of plans for the remainder is well advanced.  I anticipate that work on the development of the sites for these cottages will be commenced in the near future.  In addition, a scheme of 12 houses at Santry has been approved and will shortly be undertaken.  I have recently approved of the acceptance of a tender for the erection of 83 houses in Dún Laoghaire and building work is in progress.  Land has been acquired by the Dún Laoghaire Corporation for a further 218 houses and plans are in course of preparation.</P>
      <P>Provision has been made in the county council scheme already referred to for the erection of 82 houses in the Balbriggan area to meet the needs of the town.  In addition the preparation of a scheme of 20 houses is under consideration by the Balbriggan Town Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contributions to annual loan charges will be made to the local authorities at the appropriate rates set out in Section 6 of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, and a capital sum grant will be made from the transition fund.  A copy of a circular letter addressed to local <Col N="511" /> authorities with regard to the financing of housing schemes is being forwarded to the Deputy.

      <P>I have been informed by the Commissioner for Kerry County Council that last month he received a deputation from Annascaul in regard to a water supply and sewerage scheme for that village.  Schemes for Annascaul were not included among the ten schemes reported by the county medical officer of health last May as being those most urgently needed in Kerry.  In a comprehensive report made in 1944 on all water and sewerage schemes to be undertaken in the Kerry County Health District, Annascaul occupied eleventh place among water supplies.  While it has been intimated that the Annascaul water supply will be included in a list of works which it is hoped to carry out with the aid of grants from the Transitional Development Fund, no plans in connection with the scheme have been furnished to my Department. The provision of a sewerage scheme could not be considered until such time as a piped water supply is available.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state what progress, if any, has been made towards concluding reciprocal arrangements with Great Britain for the payment of unemployment insurance benefits to civilian workers, employed in Great Britain during the period of the war, who have British insurance stamps to their credit and are now residing in Éire or are contemplating returning to their homes in Éire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The British National Insurance Act, 1946, enables reciprocal arrangements to be made.  The provisions of that Act in relation to unemployment insurance are not expected to become operative until 1948.  It has been agreed that discussions with the British authorities in the matter of reciprocal arrangements for unemployment insurance covering civilian workers will be undertaken and these discussions will be started as soon as practicable.</P>

The flow of water in the Shannon is regulated in the dual interests of power and navigation in such a manner as to avoid as far as possible flooding of contiguous lands.

      <P>My information is that Mrs. Dyra and her deceased husband occupied this house as a perquisite to their employment as herds of the Land Commission and the former Congested Districts Board.  Over two years ago, Mrs. Dyra declined to act any longer as herd and the appointment of a new herd thus became necessary.  Since that time difficulties have been created for the Land Commission in the management of the adjoining grazing land and Mrs. Dyra has refused to give up possession of the herd's house notwithstanding the Land Commission's offer to make her an <i>ex gratia</i> payment to which she was not strictly entitled.  The Land Commission have accordingly been forced to take action along the lines mentioned in the question.</P>
      <P>It is very regrettable that such a course should have become necessary, but there is no alternative open to the Land Commission in view of Mrs. Dyra's attitude.</P>

The Minister will appreciate that, if the demand from the continent fall off now, it might have a bad reaction on winter feeding.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that there are large quantities of potatoes still in the hands of the farmers in the Cooley area, County Louth, whose only market is the local industrial alcohol factory; that the supplies taken by this factory to date are very small and that there is no likelihood of the full crop being disposed of within a reasonable time; and whether he will consider granting export licences and certificates to enable the surplus crop to be sold to countries which are anxious to purchase potatoes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. I understand that the quantity of potatoes taken so far this season by the alcohol factory is not large and that in the normal course it would be some months before the total surplus potatoes available in the area could be absorbed.  In the circumstances arrangements are being made to grant licences for the export of a limited quantity of potatoes from the area.</P>

      <P>When the adjournment was moved last night a case had been made to show how unfair the Government and the Minister for Defence have been to a certain number of officers and non-commissioned officers in the Army.  I will not labour that case, but there are a few points to which I wish to draw the special attention of the House.  Firstly, this is another of the Army Acts and it represents the 14th broken promise of the Government. For years the Government and Fianna Fáil Deputies demanded and insisted that there should be a permanent Army Act.  On the records of this House there is ample evidence to show that the Minister for Defence, or a Minister for Defence, several times <Col N="526" /> promised that a permanent Army Act would be introduced.  He went so far as to say on one particular occasion that the draftsmen had completed the measure.  Yet here we are still in the same position as we were in 1943 and 1945.</P>
      <P>Reference was made by some Deputies here yesterday to the fact that the annual Army Act is a continuation of the British system under which, of course, it was unlawful for His Majesty to maintain an army in any one year without the consent of Parliament.  Therefore, an annual Army Act must be introduced.  A Deputy also referred to the fact that we had adopted the monarchial system in relation to the control of the Army, but that it is exercised by the head of a republican form of government. When the Minister addressed the House I expected from him a clarification of the whole situation as far as the Army was concerned in this country, but again he simply pushed that question on one side and, mind you, went so far as to say that on certain matters, on the grounds that it was a purely administrative function, there was no obligation on him or the Government to consult the supreme authority in this country, to wit, Parliament. That means that the Minister, and the Government of which he is member, have no regard whatever for the wishes or the will of the supreme authority, namely, the Parliament of this country.  I shall be glad if the Minister will say what are the intentions of the Government in relation to the permanent Army Act, so that we may for all time settle this question and so that it will not have to be referred to every time the annual Act comes up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am struck by the fact that during the emergency every officer and non-commissioned officer was retained in the Army as efficient and that the Government and the Minister left them there to lead troops in the event of hostilities in this country.  The only ground that would justify that step by the Government and by the Minister was that these men were efficient.  It meant that they were efficient for war <Col N="527" /> and that they would be efficient in our hour of necessity.  Then, when the necessity has passed we are told, in effect, that they are inefficient for peace.  Of course that is the most inconsistent statement that has ever been made by any Government.  The Minister tells us that this development was inevitable and that, of course, these officers were in an invidious position. It would be much better if the Minister tackled the problem straightforwardly and said: &ldquo;Listen, boys, once the danger is over we do not want you and out you go.&rdquo;  Of course, that would not be diplomatic.  The promise is now made that further legislation will be introduced to add five years to their service. Of course that is a step that should have been taken long before this question arose so that when these officers were going out they would know the conditions under which they were being discharged.  It is true that there are some people who, I suppose, are not as efficient as they should be but the Government should not throw these men on the roadside as so much waste.  Some sense of responsibility and some sense of justice should be shown by the Government towards officers and non-commissioned officers who rendered faithful service during the emergency.</P>
    <P>The Minister also tells us that there were 142 non-commissioned officers not suitable for their rank.  Is it not an astonishing situation that it is when the emergency has passed and the danger is over that fact is ascertained? Surely that must have been clear to those who were commanding these men before now.  Why were they not found unsuitable during the emergency? No action was taken during that period and the decision was evidently come to to wait until the emergency had passed and these non-commissioned officers were no longer required, to make this statement.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the defence policy of the Army is the defence of the territorial integrity of the country. He went further and said that it was the sole responsibility of the Government. Of course that is only partially true.  The defence of this country, as was shown during the emergency, is not <Col N="528" /> the responsibility of any one section because, if a war takes place, it is not only the Government but practically all of the citizens who will have to fight.  It has been made clear for some years past, and it is clear now, that any future war will be a wholesale war, a total war.  Having regard to that fact, some such scheme as was adopted during the emergency should be instituted by the Government.  There should be a defence conference composed of representatives of all Parties in the State, so that no matter what happens, the defence of this country will be conducted according to a united policy, as it is in every other great country, so that, no matter what happens, that policy will be continued.  As we are, the Government here hedges and tells us that they have no responsibility to consult us or anybody else, although the people of the country have to pay and the young men have to fight for it.</P>
    <P>The way to get real solidarity behind the Government and the Army of this country is by taking the people well into your confidence.  I admit that the first important point as regards the defence policy of this country is that relating to the defence of the national territory.  I hope the day is approaching when the national territory will be the whole island.  On that I would like to ask the Minister and the Government, or perhaps the Minister for External Affairs, to tell us what were the arrangements during the recent emergency for the defence of our national territory.  Was there any liaison or any contact made with the forces that were occupying part of our national territory, and how far was the Taoiseach's phrase given effect to&mdash;to make the combined forces as effective as possible?  I should like to know if there was any step taken in that direction, because then we would be in a much better position to know how much money should be spent on our Defence Force and how efficient it could be made.</P>
    <P>I do not agree, of course, with everything that was said here by Deputies last evening.  It was asserted that a land army is a thing of the past.  It is a well-known fact, that no matter what mechanised form of weapons you may <Col N="529" /> have or what atomic energy you may have or what explosive power you may have, all that these can do is keep on blasting, but it will still take the foot slogger to go in and occupy a position. Therefore, the infantry man is still required, and he must be trained in all the arts and crafts of warfare as he is at present.  The number we are retaining is small.  I think it is small, although my colleagues think it is too big.  I should rather see that number well organised and contented, so that when an emergency arose it could immediately extend itself, as it did in the last emergency, and be in a position to put a fairly effective force in the field.  I believe that is possible. I should like to have heard the Minister tell us what are the plans for the higher training of the officers, non-commissioned officers and men in the next two years, five years or ten years.  I should also like to hear him tell us if any liaison, or even friendly arrangements, had been made with any other State or country.</P>
    <P>Now, the expenditure is heavy.  I feel that it is worth it if we get the service that we should get for it.  I am not at all disturbed over the weight of £4,000,000, £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 being spent on defence if we get efficient service for that money.  I say that because it is very important that it should be well established everywhere that we had a force capable of doing something and of extending itself in a very rapid way.</P>
    <P>As regards the demobilisation of these officers, I am sorry that the Minister and the Government have taken that step without consulting the former Defence Conference.  It could have done that, and it could have explained to that conference, even though it is no longer in being, the reasons why.  I agree with the Minister when he says that it would not, perhaps, be in the interests of these men to say why they were being dispensed with, but yet, on the other hand, he told us that they were efficient.  Now, there is something being concealed, so that the position is really worse by implication.  He has left these officers in a worse position <Col N="530" /> than if he had put all the facts before the House.  Therefore, I say that he is prejudicing them to a very great extent by saying something half-way and not saying it completely.</P>
    <P>It is strange that a number of these men are being pushed out this year, the 25th anniversary of the formation of the National Army.  I would like to be satisfied that there are no personal animosities between the Government and some of these officers who are going out because of things in the past. I do assert here, and I am glad to pay tribute to this fact, that there has never been politics in the Army during those 25 years.  It would be a pity if, at this time, anything that would give the semblance of politics would be introduced into the Army or alternatively in the conduct of the Government towards the Army.  They have served faithfully and well, and I am sure will serve faithfully and well in the future, but in order to have that for a certainty it is essential that the Government would show them that they have a real just Government to deal with, one that will treat them decently and generously, and that they will not be thrown overboard once the emergency has passed.  I say that because, if an emergency comes on us again, it would not be humanly possible to expect that we would get men to come in and trust, blindly, to a Government that had broken its promises in the way this present Government has done in the past.</P>
    <P>I do not want to cover the ground that has already been covered by other speakers.  I do, however, subscribe to the view that this step is a serious matter.  I agree with Deputy Dillon that the morale of the Army is the most important factor in the efficiency of an Army and I ask the Minister and the Government in the first place to establish or re-establish that confidence that there should be between an Army and its Government and its people and secondly, that if because of financial stringency or other reasons the reductions have to take place, these reductions or reversions or demobilisations will be done in the most generous way possible.  And there is only one way in which that can really be done, <Col N="531" /> and that is when the officers, non-commissioned officers, or men who go out of the service are left in a position of independence&mdash; financial independence&mdash;in a position to support themselves and their wives and families in a decent way and that they will not be left as mendicants of the State begging or looking for something. If the Government takes that step, then indeed the morale of the Army will be high.  It will have confidence in the people; it will have something to fight for and if necessary something to die for, but from the way that the Government has handled the situation I would not like to have the responsibility of going into action with a number of the men because the danger would be that at the crucial moment the case might be made that we had a country that was not worth serving or not worth fighting for.  I hope that is a day I will never see but by the conduct of the Government it is a day that could very easily arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In consequence of the Minister's statement we are now able to appraise at its real value the extent of the reversions and retirements which are to take place in the Army and we can see the extent of the retirements and reversions which will take place. I am rather sorry that it has been found necessary compulsorily to retire a number of officers and non-commissioned officers from the Army and, quite frankly, having regard to what we have passed through during the past seven years, and having regard to the fact that we escaped being brought into the holocaust of war during the past seven years, I would prefer to approach this matter of compulsory retirements in a rather different way and to recognise that inevitably during war years, and when you promote people without the close scrutiny in war that you would apply in peace, you inevitably get some misfits.  Bearing that in mind, I would have imagined the policy of the Minister and the Government would have been to close their eyes, as it were, to some inefficiency, knowing that at all events that inefficiency <Col N="532" /> was a diminishing quantity and that in due course those who were inefficient would leave the Army without the commotion that has now been aroused because of the nature of these retirements. Frankly, I am not too satisfied that a discussion on these compulsory retirements will be of benefit to those who are being compulsorily retired, because I am afraid the publicity the matter has already got, or which it will get as a result of this debate, is not calculated to enhance the reputations of those who will be retired, nor, indeed, do I think the form of the notice which was served on the officers concerned was in the best interests of the service.  A more complimentary phraseology could have been used for the purpose of conveying the decisions to them.</P>
      <P>O. Henry used to talk about people who left their country for their country's good and when he wrote in these terms he had in mind particular classes of people of whom the country was well rid.  This seems to be an attempt to plagiarise the phraseology of O. Henry when an officer is told he is going in the interests of the Army.  I do not think it is the happiest phraseology. It seems to me to be written with a bayonet because of the sharp and pungent character of the admonition which is conveyed to the officers concerned. I am sure the Minister would not consciously do an unjust or unfair thing to any of these people.  I do not want to put the Minister in the position of asking him to justify in each case the grounds for the retirement or reversion of each officer or non-commissioned officer.  I am sure there has been ample consideration and a full evaluation of the services of officers and non-commissioned officers and I am sure there was present in the minds of everybody concerned that no hardship or injustice should be caused.  To ask the Minister now to justify the retirements might only add to the difficulties in which they are at present engulfed and might unfortunately give to the whole question a still more undesirable publicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All I desire to say on the matter is that even now if these compulsory retirements <Col N="533" /> could be avoided and if these compulsory reversions could be avoided, knowing that after a while the persons concerned because of their long service will leave the Army within a reasonable period of time, I think it would be a highly desirable development. I think it would avoid all this commotion and I think it would have on the whole a beneficial and steadying effect on the morale of the Army.  I know an effort has been made to say that these compulsory retirements should be taken as indications that there is no security of tenure in the Army.  I think it would be fatal to the morale of the Army if that viewpoint were allowed to go unchecked.  I think one of the ways in which the Government could help to kill propaganda of that kind, because I think it is insidious propaganda, would be by saying: &ldquo;Well, on reviewing all the circumstances and having heard the views of all Parties in the House, we are prepared to agree not to proceed with these retirements and to take them as one of the inevitable legacies from the wartime period&rdquo;, in the knowledge that ultimately the whole problem will remedy itself by the retirement in due course of the persons concerned.  If the Minister and the Government could see their way to do that, I do not think the cost involved would be very considerable&mdash;certainly not 1 per cent. of what it would have cost us if we had been involved in the war for one hour. A good deal would be done to steady the morale of the Army and to kill what it is desirable to kill by positive proof to the contrary&mdash;a feeling that if one embarks on an Army career one may have to face the possibility of being told that he has to retire from the Army in the interests of the Army.</P>
    <P>I am concerned in this matter from the point of view of the morale of the Army and from the point of view of the well-being and the welfare of those who make the Army their career.  If persons go into the Army and select the Army as a career, they ought to have an assurance of a permanent tenure so far as their service in the Army is concerned.  It ought not be possible capriciously to terminate their services and every person <Col N="534" /> who joins the Army whether as a soldier, non-commissioned officer or officer&mdash;any person who desires to make the Army a career&mdash;ought to have from the State an assurance that subject to good conduct and efficiency he will be allowed to finish his service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That assurance is there already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of statements made to the contrary and because of my contacts with Army personnel in my own constituency I think a different point of view is being sedulously circulated.  I would like the Minister to give, as a result of this debate, a positive assurance to men entering the Army that on the understanding that their conduct is satisfactory they need not fear that their service in the Army will be prematurely terminated, and that the phase through which we are now passing is one inseparable from the circumstances of the time and does not imply continuance of that policy in respect of future service in the Army. I think it most desirable for the morale of the Army that an assurance of that character should be given and I hope the Minister will give it in the most positive terms.</P>
      <P>On a previous occasion, when discussing an Army Bill or the Defence Estimates, I raised the question of the relationship of all Parties to the defence policy of the State.  I then said what I want to repeat now, that, in my view, the defence policy of the State ought not to be the defence policy of the Party in power, that this State belongs to all the people and to all the Parties in the State, and that the planning and fashioning of a defence policy and intimate contact with that defence policy ought not to be the prerogative of whatever Party happens to be in power, but that, instead, there ought to be a wide appreciation by the Government of the day that, if it is ever necessary to utilise the services of the Army to ward off attack or possible invasion, it is necessary to have the goodwill of all elements within the State, including all political Parties in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="535" /> One of the best ways in which that goodwill can be got is by all Parties in the State being taken into consideration in framing a defence policy and in supervising the implementation of that defence policy, as far as Army personnel, Army training and Army equipment are concerned.  I suggested on a previous occasion that that idea can best be given effect to by establishing a permanent defence conference to be consulted from time to time as to the best method of moulding the Army, training the Army and equipping the Army and as to the best uses to which the Army can be put in preparation for the occasion when it may unfortunately be necessary to use it. At all events, I suggested that there ought to be a permanent defence conference, representative of all Parties, which would be consulted regularly in respect of defence matters, so that the Government of the day, no matter what its political complexion might be, could always feel assured that, though there might be differences of opinion as between the Government and other Parties on economic, social, fiscal and agricultural issues, there was no difference whatever so far as the formulation of a defence policy was concerned.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Minister discussing with the Cabinet the possibility of establishing a permanent defence conference with that object in view, so that we could evolve, not a Party defence policy but a national defence policy, a policy which commanded the confidence of every Party in the State, a policy which would not change merely because the Government happened to change.  I think the defence conference created during the war did some excellent work.  Because of the way in which that defence conference met, it is not possible to reveal the steadying effect which its existence had, but those who participated in that defence conference will, I think, acknowledge that it was a very valuable and inexpensive piece of machinery which worked excellently and gave to the nation the feeling that all Parties in the State were united in a desire to preserve the integrity of the nation and gave the Army the <Col N="536" /> feeling that whatever instructions were being issued to it represented not the thoughts of a single Minister but the pooling of the collective wisdom of all Parties.</P>
    <P>I still think there is valuable work to be done by a defence conference of that character.  Nobody on these benches, and, I suppose, nobody on the other benches, wants particularly to be inquisitive as to the Army's activities or its plans, but I think that just as the Defence Conference was a very effective instrument in the circumstances of the emergency, so also could a defence conference be a more useful medium of weaving a national defence policy which would command the respect of all the people and give to the Army the assurance that all Parties in the House supported the policy of which they were the physical exponents. Although my proposal on a previous occasion did not get the sympathetic consideration which, I think, from a national point of view, it deserved, I still urge the Minister to discuss the matter with the Cabinet, in the hope that, even yet, they can be converted to the usefulness of a national defence policy to plan a national defence scheme, and not to have that scheme planned on the basis of being the viewpoint of one Party and that the Government Party.  A defence policy based upon a defence conference representative of all Parties is one calculated to inspire confidence amongst the people and in the Army, and anything that does that, in the serious and critical matter of defence, is something which has a good deal to commend it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Some months ago, Army policy, the new Army policy which was to follow the emergency, was announced by the Minister for Defence in this House.  We were told then by the Minister that it was proposed to have an Army of 12,500, a young Army, virile, active, highly-trained and efficient, in which every man in every rank was to be trained to such a pitch that he could in an emergency or in a war take over a rank at least one grade higher than that which he then held.  In pursuance of that, the Army authorities apparently set out to overhaul their <Col N="537" /> personnel, and, as a result, certain changes had to be made in the officership and amongst the non-commissioned officers.</P>
      <P>We had great complaints here yesterday on the ground that 13 officers out of 1,100 are being retired, that is, roughly 1 per cent.  To carry out the policy of creating a new and highly efficient Army it has been found necessary to retire about 1 per cent. There have been allegations that it was done on political grounds and so forth but the fact that it was necessary during the emergency to extend the Army enormously and that it was obvious that a number of officers would be redundant at the conclusion of the emergency was scarcely mentioned. Nor was the fact adverted to that under the scheme over 350 acting officers are confirmed in their acting positions.  Any Chief of Staff setting out to deal in the most generous way with officers holding either substantive or acting rank could hardly do better than that in any circumstances.  The authorities have tried to ease the position for those men who have to return to civil life by giving them, in the case of officers holding acting rank, pension according to that acting rank rather than at the rate applicable to their lower substantive rank.  I am not clear, although it has been alleged, that all these men are men with long service but, if that is so, then I take it they are old I.R.A. men who entered the Army in 1922 and, if that is so, they will have the further advantage of getting military service pension on the basis of the rank on which they are retired.  In the case of those officers who are being reverted to lower rank, if they do not see fit to accept it, they will be treated fairly generously also in so far as they will get five added years for pension purposes and six months' leave with full pay and allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of these facts and figures there is hardly a case for members of the Dáil to assert that a large number of men are being treated unjustly.  I recall that when this scheme of reorganisation was put forward it was alleged that the Army would be altogether too large, in fact, two and <Col N="538" /> a half times too large.  That allegation was repeated here yesterday evening. If that point of view had prevailed, how many hundreds of officers would have had to be pensioned off and how many men would have had to be disbanded?  I know that a number of men who joined the Army during the emergency and attained to the rank of non-commissioned officer decided to leave the Army because they understood definitely that, with the inevitable reduction in the Army at the end of the emergency, they could not possibly expect to retain their ranks.  The same applied in the case of officers.  I consider that the Army authorities must have gone out of their way to try to meet the point of view of the officers and men as far as they could in order to achieve the results they have achieved.  For the sake of the country, I hope they have not gone too far in that direction.</P>
    <P>Yesterday a point of view was expressed by Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Dillon which revealed the most defeatist outlook.  If carried to its logical conclusion, it seems to me it would mean that we should not spend 1/- on the Army, that it is sheer waste of money to spend anything on it.  We were told that half the number would do, that half the number had done before and had worked effectively.  It is well known that before the emergency the men in the Army were on guard duty practically all the time and exclusively on guard duty and that no facilities could be given for training in the ordinary way.  When the emergency came about there was no provision for housing the volunteers who joined the Army.  We all know the conditions under which they existed for the first few months after being called up in Mullingar and other barracks.  If we are to have a scheme whereby, in the event of emergency, men of the second line and other lines of defence are to be called up, it is part of the ordinary organisation of the Army that proper provision should be made for their accommodation.</P>
    <P>If we are to learn from the experience of the emergency&mdash;as Deputy Mulcahy <Col N="539" /> asked us to&mdash;surely there is adequate reason for an extension of the numbers. We have also to consider the better conditions provided in the way of training and for home leave for the men in the Army now.  All Deputies agree that these facilities should be provided but it means more personnel and accounts to a large extent for the increased amount of money required.  Nobody complains about the cost being two and a half times the previous cost when the rates of pay of officers and men and of allowances to dependents in 1939 are compared with the present rates.  There is a vast difference, and properly so. Every Deputy will approve of that, but it has to be paid for.</P>
    <P>If we did not try, as far as our resources permit, to provide an Army to defend our territory, we would be false to our history, more particularly to our recent history, and to the men who died to achieve our freedom.  Are we to leave this little country in the position that, in the event of world happenings, if other nations feel it necessary to step in and take control of this country for their own defence, we shall be unable to prevent them? If we do not provide for our own defence to the best of our ability, that will happen.  I am wondering whether that is what we are expected to do&mdash; to leave it to other people to settle that question for us.  I am not prepared to do it.</P>
    <P>It was refreshing to hear Deputy MacEoin's views after what we heard yesterday on this subject.  I think any man who honestly studies the matter will agree that the number of men in the Army and the cost of the Army are not, in the present circumstances, by any means too high.  I am sure Deputies will also agree that everything possible has been done to reduce the cost of the Army, in the sense of not having a definite standing Army.</P>
    <P>Yesterday evening we heard references to atomic bombs and as to what this country was doing in regard to them.  Is not every country in the world facing that peril, and have other countries been able to do anything in the way of defence beyond trying to provide an air force, just as <Col N="540" /> we are trying in so far as our resources will allow?</P>
    <P>When Deputy Dillon was talking yesterday about our defenceless state, did he recall what Mr. Churchill said, after the fall of France, about the state of England?  Mr. Churchill did not think of giving in then.  I think our history proves that we have as great a sense of patriotism as Englishmen have, and we should be prepared to take the steps necessary to provide the best possible defence we can for this country.  Deputy Dillon told us that Messrs. Churchill and Roosevelt saved this country in the last war.  I wonder did they refrain from interfering with us for love of us?  Can any of us believe that that was Mr. Churchill's reason, or were there other reasons? Was not one of those reasons the fact that this country had taken certain definite steps, small as they were, compared to the enormous work done in that connection in other countries? Did not the fact that we had taken those steps have some effect on their minds when they came to consider the matter?</P>
    <P>If an army is useless to-day, why is it that in other countries, like America, where they have the use of the atomic bomb, they are extending their navies and armies?  If land armies are to be useless in the future, why is that happening? On the figures and facts given us by the Minister, I think that the situation in this country, following the emergency, has been met in a very just and fair way and with very little in the nature of upset to the Army personnel.</P>
    <P>If sufficient reasons came to those in authority why certain men should be retired, it was their duty to retire them.  The people are entitled to know that the Army to-day is as efficient and as highly trained as it can be made. The men in the Army are being satisfactorily trained under the most efficient and capable officers that can be obtained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with this matter I think we should consider not merely the necessity of having an Army which will be, in our view, sufficiently large to defend our territory, but we <Col N="541" /> should also have some regard for the resources of the country and the available man-power.  When we speak of an Army capable of defending our territory, we must realise that with the rapid changes in equipment, with the various scientific developments that have taken place and with the large resources available to other countries, particularly to larger countries, small countries are inevitably at a disadvantage and, consequently, those small countries, and particularly countries like this, placed in close proximity to a fairly strong military power and having ancient and continuing ties with another country capable of maintaining a large Army, may have their views of the proper strength of an Army and its capacity somewhat disturbed.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies seem to be under the impression that, even though ours is a small country, we should be capable of having an Army which could withstand any force, however great.  I subscribe to the view that we should have an Army capable of defending our territory in so far as it is possible for our own resources to provide such a defence machine.  I hold the view that not merely should we have an Army adequate for defence purposes, but we should have an Army capable of expansion and efficiently trained with modern equipment.  The Minister said our Army will have something over 12,000 officers and men and at the present time, due to the high cost of equipment and the rapid changes in various types of weapons, it is not possible to equip the Army effectively.  No one will suggest that we should endeavour to keep pace with other nations either in supplying ourselves with modern equipment or attempting, if that were possible, to produce such equipment here. I think the first essential is to have an Army with some relation to our population and some relation to our territory.  That Army should be capable of expansion and we should concentrate primarily on having the nucleus of an effective fighting force, should the necessity for such ever arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to the Minister, realising the burden that is placed on the country at the moment in the form of taxation and general Government <Col N="542" /> expenditure and the fact that during the years of the emergency some £19,000,000 was added to the existing public debt, and that the interest and repayment charges of this extra debt must total something in the region of £1,000,000 per annum, it is my view that the strength which the Minister at present aims at for our Army is much too high for this country.  I am further of opinion from the figures which the Minister has given us that the Army as at present constituted is sufficiently large for the needs of the country.  The Minister proposes, on the figures he has given us, to recruit 20 per cent. more officers and approximately 66 per cent. more men to bring the Army up to the strength at which he states it is the Government's policy to maintain the post-emergency Defence Force.  I think it was generally anticipated that there would be a reduction in our Defence Force and equipment when the emergency came to the end. The Minister has informed the House that he proposes to present an Estimate for the Defence Forces for 1947-48 of £4,600,000.  For a country in which the population has remained static for many years&mdash;in fact if there is any trend at all it has been downwards&mdash;I consider that such a heavy commitment for defence services is far beyond its capacity to bear.</P>
    <P>We must realise that in addition to having an effective Defence Force, other services must be maintained and that urgent works of a public, private and local character are awaiting not merely equipment but sufficient labour forces to carry them out.  At the present time, adequate labour forces are not available for these works while there is a vacuum across the water which is constantly absorbing all available labour from this country.  Despite increased supplies of certain raw materials since the end of hostilities, in housing, industry and various other branches there is not merely a shortage of material but a shortage of man-power. That is one of the greatest problems confronting industrialists and other employers.  Notwithstanding that shortage of man-power, permits were given last year to 29,000 persons to take up employment in England.  In our circumstances, we should concentrate <Col N="543" /> not merely on having a Defence Force adequate to meet our requirements, but we should give due consideration to the fact that that Defence Force must be maintained in relation to our other requirements and needs.</P>
    <P>I consider that a sufficiently large Army has been recruited already and that it would be a wiser and a better policy to concentrate on making that Army the nucleus of a force which could be expanded if necessary with better equipment, rather than attempting to have a large paper force, a large force of officers and men without sufficient equipment or with equipment which, in the present state of armament development in the world, is inadequate and obsolete.  I would suggest to the Minister that the present strength of the Army is absolutely adequate for this purpose and that he should concentrate on having a force capable of expansion.  Mention has been made of the fact that, during the emergency, large numbers of men came forward and that the Army expanded rapidly.  It is often forgotten, in paying tribute to the men who made the Army capable of that expansion, that these officers and men were capable of being assigned to higher ranks, that not merely were they capable of being assigned to higher rank but that they were capable of extending the Defence Force from battalions to brigades and from brigades to divisions, and that, with these constantly growing forces, they were capable of training recruits effectively.  When we consider how rapidly the Army expanded and how efficient the new recruits became, we must realise how essential it is to have an efficient permanent Army capable of rapid expansion.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to certain matters, particularly the retirement of certain officers.  A considerable portion of the debate has been devoted to the unfair treatment meted out to some of these officers.  The officers were told that their services were being terminated &ldquo;in the interests of the service&rdquo;.  I think it well for the House to know that many of the officers now being retired in the interests of the service <Col N="544" /> were promoted during the emergency and that in some instances they were promoted on a couple of occasions. The House should also know that it is usual, under the 1937 Act, to inform an officer on his retirement of the reasons for his retirement and that when an officer is being asked to retire, he is asked to sign a report prior to retirement which sets out the officer's career and the details of his service.  In these cases, I should like to know whether the officers affected have been asked, or will be asked before retirement, to sign the usual report and if it has yet been presented to them.  I think it is generally agreed, in this country and elsewhere, that the efficiency of an army depends not merely on its strength but on its morale.  I think everyone will realise that the statement that a number of officers are being retired &ldquo;in the interests of the service&rdquo; has influenced considerably the morale of the officers and men of the Army, that not merely has it influenced existing officers and men but that it must have an effect in future on recruitment.  The Minister may say that officers and men can have an assurance in that regard, but in the light of the circumstances of the retirements in these cases, no officer in future will have any guarantee that he is not going to have his services terminated abruptly &ldquo;in the interests of the service&rdquo; and terminated without informing that officer of the reasons why it is deemed necessary to retire him.</P>
    <P>It may be said that 13 officers are not a very large number out of the whole Army, but it is not so much the number as the principle that is involved.  It is the fact that here we have a departure from our recognised practice.  We have departure from the recognised practice after a period during which these officers had rendered loyal, devoted and faithful service.  Many of them, in fact all of them, had pre-Truce service and they now find themselves at the end of their career being retired &ldquo;in the interests of the service&rdquo; and without being given further reasons.  In addition to these officers, I should like to inform the House that for the past 12 months a <Col N="545" /> large number of officers have been retired and a different practice has obtained in certain cases.  A number of these officers were retired in acting ranks and, consequently, the higher pension which would be payable to these men if they were of substantive rank, is not payable.  That does not apply to the 13 I have already mentioned.  A number of these officers were given certain periods of leave prior to discharge.  In addition to the leave, they were given full pay.</P>
    <P>The practice that obtained was that if the officer was to retire on the 1st October, and did not reach the age limit until the 1st October, he could have six months' leave with pay.  In certain cases officers only reached the age limit in September or August. These officers got six weeks, two months or a month.  In some cases officers got only a few days pre-discharge leave with pay, whereas other officers, who would have reached the retiring age limit in April or before it, were given six months' pre-discharge leave with pay.</P>
    <P>Officers who have been retired and who had not reached the age limit until a month or six weeks before retirement, feel a deep sense of grievance that different treatment was accorded to some as compared to others: that, while some were given six months' leave with pay, others who had reached the age limit almost at the appointed time on the 1st October, were given a shorter period.  I think the Minister should have given all officers who were going to retire on the 1st October six months' leave with pay. However unfair that may be, I want to draw the attention of the House to the discrimination shown in the case of these officers, small in number, and officers known as area administrative officers.  They were commissioned in 1933.  Many of them, like the others, were promoted during the emergency. They had not the service which would bring them up to the maximum period for retirement.  The Minister added ten years.  In addition, from December last, he has given these officers six months' leave with pay.</P>
    <P>I want to say, when it is stated that the Army should be free from political <Col N="546" /> influences, that I subscribe entirely to that view.  When, however, I see the corrupting effect of political influence, I doubt the sincerity behind certain statements that political influences are not being used.  Surely, when officers give over 20 years of loyal service, when, as I said before, they have rendered faithful service not to one Government but to two Governments, and in addition have rendered faithful service during the emergency, they are entitled to the same treatment as officers who may be described as the Minister's pals who have had 10 years added to their service.  Many of them have got maximum retiring pensions. In addition, they have got what other officers in acting ranks did not get, except they happened to be lucky in the matter of the age limit, six months' pre-discharge leave with pay, irrespective of their age.  I think the House and the country are entitled to an explanation of the unfair preference given to some officers as compared to others.  I do not want to be taken as objecting to the added years which were granted to these men, or to the pre-discharge leave which is being granted to them.  What I object to is that some officers, who are friends of the Minister and friends of his Party, should get preferential treatment, while the vast bulk of the officers who have served the Minister and the country loyally and faithfully should not get the same treatment.  They should all have got the same treatment on retirement as well as discharge leave, and, if necessary, added years to make them eligible for the maximum pension.  Even though most of them have that, they should, I submit, also have been promoted to substantive rank before retirement.</P>
    <P>I want to refer for a moment to promotions. About October last, I think, a number of temporary officers were commissioned in the regular Army.  I think that about 17 of them were commissioned as commandants in the permanent force, and take rank accordingly. I want to ask the Minister if he thinks it is a wise and a sound policy to promote to senior commissioned rank officers who have had only comparatively short service and to do that, in many cases, over the heads of <Col N="547" /> officers who have had senior service, officers who had done protracted and lengthy courses, and who had served in the Army since its inception, and as well had been commissioned as a result of a cadet course which they did at the Curragh in 1936.  Many of the officers who were commissioned at that time had done special courses and had shown themselves to be efficient.  They were promoted as a result of their efficiency.  It may also be said that they had made the Army their career almost from the time that they had left school.  They went into the Army then, served on a number of special courses and were commissioned, as I have said, in 1936.  Now they find that they are superseded in many cases by temporary officers with comparatively short service who have not their experience and who did not do the courses they did either here or abroad.  I am sure Deputies will agree that all officers who are physically fit, who are competent and who gave service during the emergency and wished to engage in the permanent force should have been afforded an opportunity of becoming regular officers in that permanent force.  In many cases they had five, six or seven years' longer service than these temporary officers that I have referred to.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should examine the system of promotion which obtains elsewhere.  If he does I think he will find that, in the case of most other armies, and certainly in the case of the American Army which expanded rapidly during the war, officers who had served in a temporary capacity were, with a few negligible exceptions, reverted to the rank of lieutenant.  Some of those officers who were so reverted had extensive fighting experience during the war.  A number of them served in China, but when demobilisation took place, following the cessation of hostilities, they were reverted despite their fighting experience, and despite all the advantages which that must have for officers in an Army.  As I have said, almost all of them were reverted to the rank of lieutenant.  But here the tendency in the case of temporary officers would appear to be&mdash;certainly <Col N="548" /> in a number of cases&mdash;to promote them to higher ranks than they held during the emergency.  That is system that has not found favour elsewhere.  Were there some reasons, other than proficiency in the service, which warranted that course?  I suggest that the Minister should examine the methods whereby a number of these officers have been promoted.  I understand that the Minister's advisers are in favour of making substantive any senior officers who have been in acting rank and who have longer service than these officers, and I hope that when they are made substantive the substantive senior will rank from the time of his acting promotion. It is entirely unfair and definitely bad for the morale of the Army if officers who have acted in senior rank for a number of years now find themselves superseded by officers who were made permanent as recently as last October.  I hope in this case&mdash;and I think my information is correct that the Minister's civilian advisers are giving him sound advice&mdash;that that advice will prevail and that these officers who are acting in senior ranks will, when placed in substantive rank, rank as senior from the time they were promoted to the acting rank.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other matters. I notice in the Bill before the House that it is proposed to abolish the rank of major and substitute the rank of lieutenant-colonel.  I do not for the life of me see the necessity for abolishing the rank of major which is accepted in every army in the world.  Apparently we are going to go out of step with every army in the world over the rank of major.  It was suggested, first of all, that the rank of commandant should be abolished.  I think if any rank were to be abolished it is obviously that rank which should be abolished.  In no other country, with the exception of certain appointments in rank of the French army, is there the rank of commandant and that rank of commandant is going out of use.  In all other countries the rank of commandant does not exist. Certainly in all the better known armies&mdash;armies we may have contact with &mdash; the rank of commandant does not exist.  Whatever about leaving that rank, we are going to take the <Col N="549" /> retrograde step of abolishing the rank of major and substituting the rank of lieutenant-colonel.  I think we ought to show some realism in this.  If we want to hold, for sentimental reasons, the rank of commandant then we can hold it, but I do not see why we should hold such a rank.  I think sentiment should not enter into this thing.  I think we should adopt a uniform ranking which obtains elsewhere and that we should abolish the rank of commandant. If that is not done because of sentimental reasons and because of peculiar attachment to certain individuals then it may be retained but, at any rate, do not let us get out of step with all the other armies in the world by abolishing the rank of major.  Apparently now we are going to have no rank between the rank of commandant and lieutenant&mdash;colonel.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, another possible explanation for the proposed new titles&mdash;a white-washing attempt to convince some of those who are demoted that they are still in a higher rank. I think we ought to abandon the nonsensical activities which are evidenced in these changings of ranks and names.  During the emergency everybody knew what the Local Defence Force was, or what it was intended to be, though some of the members of the force were not very certain themselves. Now we have abandoned that title and have a new title of Fórsa Cosanta Aitiúil.  It may be desirable to have an Irish title, but I think in the initial stages these titles should be adopted and when adopted they should be left. We are changing the Marine Service to the Naval Service.  All these changes in nomenclature are merely superficial, and I would suggest that so far as lieutenant-colonel is concerned we ought not get out of step with every other army in the world by abolishing the rank of major.</P>
    <P>I hope when the Minister comes to reply he will consider carefully the criticisms which are rampant of the methods adopted in certain retirements. The criticism which has resulted, first of all, over these 13 officers who are being unfairly retired, but not merely over the 13 but over the many officers who will be retired without <Col N="550" /> being granted the full six months' pre-discharge leave with pay and the preferential treatment being afforded to certain pals of the Minister&mdash;all that criticism should be considered. If this Army is to remain what it has been in the service of the people, it should be possible to say in the future, as it has been said in the past, that the Army, its officers, its men and all those who are in it served the people faithfully and fully, irrespective of politics.  Then it is time to abandon and it is too soon to begin political, preferential treatment.</P>

      <P>The Archbishop of Manila when he came here after the terrible time through which the Philippines passed gave a Press interview and he said in that interview that the small group of islands had been overrun by one of the greatest military <Col N="551" /> powers of our time, the Japanese Empire.  They wiped them out, they cruelly effaced them.  They perpetrated atrocities: they left them without a habitation.  And did he say when he came here and referred to that that it was not worth while having a defence?  Did he get up and talk like Deputy Dillon in pantomime mimic of the defence of the Philippines and go on with that disgraceful kind of speech that the English papers rejoice in and give full headlines to when himself and Deputy O'Higgins make speeches in this House about anything national?  No, the Archbishop of Manila said: &ldquo;Fight for your freedom&mdash;and die for your freedom&mdash; by every possible weapon you have.&rdquo; What has been the attitude of Norway in the recent war and of Belgium and of Holland, of Albania, Greece, Yugoslavia and every small country in Europe?  No Deputy in these countries would have addressed the people in that manner and made little of their forces and terrified them about the atomic bomb.  We would not have a former Chief of Staff of the resistance movement in any of these countries getting up to-day on a defence Vote or Defence Bill or anything dealing with the national forces and telling the people of Albania, the people of Greece or the people of Norway that they must just be a maintenance party between the armies of two great powers.  But here we had the disgraceful display of the former Chief of Staff of the I.R.A. telling us the Army of this country must be a maintenance party between the Army of the United States and the Army of Britain and that we must consult them whether we do a right turn or a left turn.</P>
      <P>The Army taken over when Fianna Fáil became the Government of the country was a credit, and it served this Government well.  If all the men who served in the Army in a military sense or in a civil sense were asked fairly and squarely if there had been any interference with them as regards its administration, they would say that there had not been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the position in Europe, in <Col N="552" /> America, or in any country that was involved in the recent war, or even in countries like ours that maintained neutrality, in none of them will the reduction be as low as 1 per cent.  Yet we have had a discussion on national defence lasting for hours, on the motion of one of the principal spokesmen in the Opposition, in order to make the case that 13 men are being fired for political reasons.  If ever anything was calculated to introduce a spirit of politics into the national forces, statements like those which have been made in this debate would do so.</P>
    <P>The Army has served the people well and, for that reason, the Minister should go ahead with his plans for increasing the forces.  A colleague of mine dealt with the position of the force at the time the Army was being recruited in 1939, when men had to go into barracks that had been closed for years.  The State had to spend thousands of pounds reconstructing them, in order to make them fit for occupation.  I put it to Deputy Cosgrave that there is no economy in closing down these barracks again, or in reducing the strength of the Army below what the Minister proposes. These barracks should be kept open for any emergency that might come upon us.  Tens of thousands of pounds were spent on reconditioning barracks like that at Mullingar, and they should not now be closed down but maintained in proper order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephHallide" hpid="Mr. Halliden Mr. Halliden">

      <P>It is the considered opinion of Deputies on these benches that there is no justification whatever for the expenditure of £4,600,000 for the equipment and maintenance of an Army during peace time.  Our present population is less than 3,000,000, and the expenditure now proposed means a tax on every man, woman and child in the country of 30/-.  That is far beyond the capacity of our people to bear in present circumstances.  Side by side with this proposal we have been told recently that the excess corporation profits tax, amounting to £3,000,000 yearly, is to be abolished forthwith.  In other words, the profiteers and speculators of the past <Col N="553" /> six years are to pocket another £3,000,000 at the expense of the middle class as well as the poorer class in the community.</P>
      <P>Money can be provided for many spectacular schemes, but when it comes to providing it to improve the condition of our primary industry, to improve the condition of the old age pensioners or of widows, we are met with a howl of disapproval from the Government Benches.  I think this is a very serious matter, because the result will be to make rich people richer and poor people poorer.  There has been in recent years a great shortage of manpower on the land. Many farmers are embarrassed by the shortage of labour, and cannot get sufficient to produce all the food that they would like to provide.  The last harvest proved that clearly.  We are now asked to recruit men for the Army.  What effect will that recruitment have on men who are required to produce food for the country?  That is another reason why we strongly object to an increase in the strength of the Army, and to the expenditure of such an enormous sum as £4,600,000. The position requires most careful consideration by the Government.  Taking all the circumstances into account, as they affect our social and economic life, we believe that this expenditure is altogether unwarranted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with a few matters that may be of interest in this debate, because if there is one thing that the people of this country resent it is ingratitude.  A feeling has arisen through the country that many people have been treated ungratefully by the Army, men who gave good service in it, and who were invalided out of it. The treatment that was accorded to some of these men and their dependents in many instances, does not seem to square with what could be termed fair play.  Many such cases came under my observation, and I must be only one of 138 Deputies to whom the same remark would apply, because they must have heard of the grave hardship inflicted by the regulations.  I am perfectly well aware that the Minister must be governed in these matters by <Col N="554" /> the medical officers.  We all respect the members of that profession, but what are we to think when we find cases, as I have found them, of men who were recruited to the Army during the emergency, and who were carrying on their ordinary avocations in life before joining, being demobilised as unfit?  I know one case of a man who was working as a carter at the docks before he joined up.  He was accepted into the Army, so that he could not have been too bad.  He served two or three years in the Army.  Then he was demobilised.  Since then, he has been suffering from T.B. and hopping from one sanatorium to another.  The medical officer says that the disease did not arise from his military service and that the Army authorities have no responsibility for it.  That is a particularly sad case.  The man is a complete wreck.  At present, he is waiting for a bed in a sanatorium, having been in another sanatorium previously.  Yet, he is told that the disease was not aggravated or accelerated or promoted by his service in the Army.  We are only laymen but common sense would not support the attitude of the medical officer who says that a man who joined the Army and went through rigorous training for a couple of years and was then demobilised, suffering from tuberculosis to the extent that he is not able to earn a shilling, did not contract that disease in the Army and that it was not aggravated by his service in the Army.  His Army service must have had something to do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to another case&mdash;the case of a man who served in the Army during the emergency.  He had no tuberculosis.  He was an active soldier and a good boxer.  He won many medals as a boxer during his period in the Army.  He slept in an open truck during manoeuvres and was removed to the military hospital at Mallow.  After a month, he died from nephritis and kidney trouble.  The medical officer says that his Army service had nothing whatever to do with his death and his widow and child have been left without a penny of compensation.  I am selecting those two cases from many others. I think that a case can be made for re-examination of the method of dealing with these cases.  Have the medical <Col N="555" /> officers some sort of instruction to give the minimum of compensation in these claims and the maximum of relief to the Department?  I should not care to believe that any medical man would so far forget the duties of his profession as to act unfairly in such cases but a set rule is being established, so far as one can see.  I ask the Minister to look carefully into the matter.  If many of those cases are cropping up in different parts of the country, they will constitute a strong deterrent to recruiting and will not make for the popularity which the Army should enjoy. We want new men in the Army and we want to maintain the popularity of the Army.  I am speaking of one area alone and, if the same thing applies in other areas, the unpopularity which it will create can be readily imagined.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to advise young men to join the Army.  On behalf of this Party, I stood on platforms during the emergency and asked men to join the Army for the emergency.  Members of other Parties did the same.  We feel a certain responsibility, because we asked those men to join up and assured them that they would not be forgotten.  I am afraid they are not being remembered as they should be and that a harsh line is being drawn in the type of case to which I have referred.  Men leave the Army without any prospect of employment.  They have, of course, a certificate from their commanding officer and some hundreds of them are sent down to one industrial concern. That concern has no hope of absorbing them.  They have to fight for a place as best they can.  The man to whom I have referred, who died in a military hospital, had been a vigorous, healthy man when he joined the Army.  Even the cost of his funeral service was not defrayed by the Army and there is not a fraction for his widow or child. That is not going to make for the popularity of the Army.  It will be difficult to induce men to join the Army if, as Deputy Kennedy hopes, we are to have another crisis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think that the Minister would be the last man who would be guilty of tolerating hardships in the case of any of these men but, if he inquires into the cases I have mentioned, he will find that there is grave room for concern about what is taking place.  The foundation is being laid for widespread hostility to recruitment.  The men are not getting a fair deal and the medical board are either acting too strictly or too sternly or they are adopting the line of least resistance. I ask the Minister to give the matter his very serious consideration because I think it would be a pity if even one man were to be unfairly or unjustly treated.  I know of two cases in which that happened.  I know of seven or eight others which might not be so clearly established.  However, I am perfectly satisfied as to the two cases I have mentioned.  If there were only one of these cases, it should be investigated so that no cause would be afforded to citizens to complain about the treatment our soldiers receive when they have served their country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>My purpose in intervening in the debate is to endeavour to elicit from the Minister whether or not we have a defence policy and what that policy is.  On a previous occasion I tried to put my views to the Minister.  Since then I have not seen anywhere indicated what exactly our defence policy is.  I agree with those Deputies who have said that our defence policy should not be the plaything of Party politics.  I want to make my position very clear on that matter.  In dealing with matters of defence, we should not have regard to Party considerations of any kind.  At the same time, the people are perturbed, because they do not know what position the country intends to take up in relation, particularly, to international matters.  I agree with some of the speakers who think that the Army establishment here is too great for our resources.  This country is too <Col N="557" /> poor to afford a heavy Army establishment. At the same time, I realise that, as a country, we must contribute our fair share in endeavouring to protect ourselves and, if necessary, others, from whatever aggressors may be abroad in the world to-day.  We have got to try to reconcile the two positions. I should have preferred to see our defence policy based more on international considerations than on our national position.  We are a very small country, with very limited resources in men, material and money. If a major war is again to afflict the world and if we are to participate in it, we can do so only, as I said before, by marching beside, or in company with, the big battalions.  It is idle for us to indulge in the vanity of extravagant armies, navies or air forces which would be beyond our resources.  It is idle, either for historical or sentimental reasons, for us to lose our sense of the proportion of things and embark upon what might be described as a militarist policy.  If we are to do any of these things, we should do them in co-operation with other people, who intend to prevent aggression from whatever quarter it may come.  It is for that reason that I want to learn from the Minister whether, in relation to international development, we have any definite defence policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do we intend to march along, developing our policy in isolation in respect of what is happening either on our right or on our left?  Do we simply look upon this portion of this island as a practical problem for defence?  I do not claim to be a soldier or to have any knowledge of strategy or tactics, but I realise that we are only three-fourths of a country and that six of our counties are occupied by an alien force and have been occupied during six years of war by two alien forces. As long as that position obtains, we are in a difficulty from the military point of view.  Even if we had the 32 Counties under our jurisdiction tomorrow morning, we would still have the essential problem that our geographical position compels us to look to our defence in co-operation with other peoples, whether we like those peoples <Col N="558" /> or not.  We are placed there by God in propinquity to the British Islands and the British Islands, if they are in modern strategy defensible at all, are defensible as a unit and it is useless to have people talking mere tripe about defending ourselves in a position of isolation.  I do not think any soldier or any man who has studied the problem would agree for a moment that we could defend ourselves on our own.  We simply could not do it.</P>
    <P>We then have to consider what schemes for joint defence of other communities are being prepared, either in Western Europe as a whole or in the world as a whole.  What is our defence scheme in relation to the United Nations Organisation?  If and when we become members of the United Nations Organisation, we will, as every Deputy knows from the debate on the United Nations Organisation, have to contribute a fair and reasonable proportion to military security.  If we are to get anywhere in defence matters, we must consider our position as a possible member of the United Nations Organisation and the implications of that membership, particularly in regard to finance.  What military establishment will we be expected to keep under the charter?  What men and material will we have to provide from time to time for the purposes of the United Nations Organisation?  Approaching the problem on these lines, we might look a little ahead, to see what our position will be eventually and what amount we may have to raise to foot the bill.  In raising these moneys, we are acting not so much as militarists as policemen.  The job of the United Nations Organisation, if it ever gets under way, is to police the world in such a way that no aggressor can get away with it again.  I would prefer to see our defence problems approached from that angle, with its emphasis on peace, rather than from the war angle. The emphasis should be on our role in any future war being that of the custodian of international law and order and the custodian of peace, rather than that of joining with an aggressor, whoever he may be, in any military adventure which may take place in any part of the world.  That is a prospect which we must face in the very near future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="559" /> The other prospect is nearer home. Many nations, like Deputy Kennedy and other speakers, thought of building up a strong army to the limit of the available resources.  Those nations realise sadly that, no matter what they may do now or in the future, it will be infinitesimal to prevent an avalanche such as smothered them in 1939-40.  We all know what happened between 1939 and 1941, when many of these small Powers, which had gone to the limit of their resources in expenditure on defence, were simply brushed aside by military machines.  It looks as if all their military manoeuvres and training and their vast expenditure went for naught overnight.  Not one of them could stand up to the military aggressor, fully equipped and ruthless in pursuit of military objectives.  That was the position of all the military nations in Europe, including some of the greater Powers.</P>
    <P>We have to ask ourselves in all seriousness what the lessons of that war are for us.  Are we to embark on a policy of playing with soldiers, or can we do something practical that will redound to the benefit of the country if such an emergency should arise again?  I think that the defence of these countries, that the defence of Western Europe is one defence, or there is no defence.  There are many experts who will tell you to-day that, in view of the development of atomic energy and atomic strategy, the British Islands are indefensible in any future war, that any highly industrialised or urbanised country, such as Britain or Japan, with any concentration of populations that cannot be shifted into the vast open spaces, is, by virtue of recent atomic developments, indefensible. The only countries likely to have any defence against atomic strategy are those with vast open spaces, such as the United States, Canada, and, perhaps, Australia.</P>
    <P>These are considerations which are disturbing the minds of politicians, statesmen and military men everywhere. It is a realisation that the whole scheme of military science, the entire strategy of previous campaigns and of military knowledge, has gone by the board and that we are faced <Col N="560" /> with an entirely new problem.  Even the most expert soldiers to-day are merely poking their way to evolve some sort of system that can be regarded as a defence.  I do not say that we are not thinking on those lines in this country.  I am sure the Minister and his advisers, both civilian and military, are considering all these problems, but I raise them as I feel that they must be considered.  Small as we are here, by virtue of our geographical position we are the most western outpost in Europe and the pivotal air centre in the Atlantic air world, the pivot in Atlantic defence of the western hemisphere.  We cannot get over these facts, though brutal facts are hard to face.  We have to ask ourselves, therefore, taking the long view, what we can do in practice to defend ourselves, in the first place, and then to render assistance to people who may be attacked.</P>

      <P>I did not say abolish it altogether.  Let me come to that.  I want to raise other issues now.  A new navy is being established.  I do not know if it is to be classified as the nucleus of an Irish navy or whether these boats we are getting are simply to be fishery patrol boats, to keep the marauder away from our fishing grounds.  Are we serious as a people in taking up naval development on the lines on which we are taking it up, of having five or six small patrol vessels? Are we serious in saying to ourselves that we are, by incurring that expenditure, contributing one iota to the defence of the country?  Does any Deputy believe that by establishing a small naval force of that kind, we are getting anywhere?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy put me off it.  We are embarking on a navy which the Minister has told us is merely an administrative departure.  Provision was made in the Estimates for certain expenditure, but the House was not told what that expenditure was really intended for until the actual purchase of naval vessels had been made and until a naval scheme for training and the manning of these vessels had been drawn up.  I want to know from the Minister if we seriously contemplate setting up a naval establishment, what is the purpose of that naval establishment, and, above all, how does that naval establishment fit in with the British Navy, on the one side, and the American Navy, on the other, or is it just a stunt of our own?  Are we indulging in the mere vanity of saying we have a little navy?  I want to know exactly where we stand in that matter, because I feel it is a matter which is concerning a number of people in the country.  I feel that a number of people in the country regard a development of that kind as futile from either the national point of view or the security point of view, and, from the point of view of finance, it is an expensive plaything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if we have an air policy, on the other hand, and how far we propose to go to develop an air force.  I think the experience of everybody in the House tells him that the two go hand in hand and that the country attempting defence to-day which does not put the primary weight upon air defence is simply toying with the problem.  Have we an air defence policy and how much do we propose to spend on air defence?  I have seen a letter in which we get the extraordinary position that an officer of the Air Corps reserve knows nothing of the abolition of the Air Corps reserve until he receives a letter a few days ago informing him that the air reserve section to which he belongs has been abolished and that if he sends in his resignation within a certain period, certain things will follow.  That officer is a capable officer and it cost a good deal of public money to train him and put him into his job.  He is still an active pilot, and I should like to <Col N="562" /> know what we are doing in that respect.  Does the right hand know what the left hand is doing?  Here we have a position in which an experienced pilot, certified fit for service as recently as a few months ago, certified an A1 pilot and acting as a pilot to-day, is told that he is no longer wanted and that the section to which he belongs has been abolished.</P>
    <P>I do not profess to have any intimate knowledge of these matters, but I want to know what is our position.  What is our air policy?  What are we doing? Are we abandoning such little air force as we had, because, if we are it seems a most extraordinary development, when the rest of the countries of the world who are giving any consideration to defence problems are endeavouring to develop an air defence arm of some kind.  To my mind, if we seriously approached these matters, we would be considering air on the one hand and some form of sea defence, on the other. I do not know to what extent we are free in the matter of developing either air or naval defence and I want to know from the Minister if there are any restrictions on our capacity to expand to the limit of our resources, either in respect of an air arm or a sea arm.  Are we restricted to any particular types of aeroplanes or any particular types of naval vessels, because, if we are, it seems foolish that the Minister should come here and ask for money.</P>
    <P>I want, in other words, a realistic approach to these matters and I do not want people to blink the main issues. I am not advocating that we should abolish the Army, air force or even the navy, if the Minister can show me that these things are practicable propositions for us, which can, in the event of aggression against us, be worth a tinker's curse to us and that our Army, our air force and our navy will not disappear overnight as happened in the case of many armies, many air forces and many navies on the Continent six years ago.</P>
    <P>When I think on these matters, I am often reminded of the Danes who had an army of something like 100 men when the Germans marched through.  In order to preserve their national pride and <Col N="563" /> honour, the Danes put up a token resistance and then proceeded to let the Germans march through.  By doing so, they saved their country from abominable destruction and they preserved their economy.  They might have been bigger heroes in the eyes of some people in the House if they had allowed themselves and their cities and towns to be destroyed, but they took a very common-sense view of the matter and said: &ldquo;We cannot resist these hordes of Huns.  We have only one thing to do&mdash;make our protest&mdash;retire and leave them to it&rdquo;.  They did that, and, to my mind, took a very sensible viewpoint. I throw that out merely as one of the things we should consider in this matter of defence.</P>
    <P>I feel that there is a good deal in the argument put forward by Deputy Norton that there should be some form of committee or council&mdash;call it what you will&mdash;which would, once and for all, go into the whole matter of defence, with the information available to the Department of Defence and to the Minister in particular, thresh out the whole thing in a commonsense way and arrive at our eventual policy.  We must have a policy.  Everybody knows that in these dangerous times we are living in and the more dangerous times which have just passed over, any country would be foolish not to give serious consideration to these problems, but all I appeal for is that our approach to these problems will be realistic.  I see no way of achieving a realistic approach to them unless we are prepared to hammer the problem out in a non-Party atmosphere.  I do not think there is any political advantage to be gained one way or another from whatever attitude a Deputy may adopt in relation to these matters. We are all sufficiently nationallyminded and sufficiently interested in the security of our country and the safety of our people to realise that we have to approach these problems in a practical way, see what we can do and decide what is the limit to which we can go and then stop there, once and for all.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to dwell on the other aspects of the Bill which have <Col N="564" /> been mentioned.  They have been dealt with by many other Deputies and I do not want to cover the ground covered by previous speakers, except to appeal to the Minister to examine, even at this late hour, every one of these cases which have been complained of.  If an injustice has been done I am sure he can even yet find a way of rectifying any injustice that unwittingly may have been perpetrated on a particular officer.  I do not know any of the facts.  I do not know any of the officers.  I do not know anything, good bad or indifferent, about the matter, but from listening to previous speakers I gather that there is a good deal of dissatisfaction and that certain injustices, unwittingly, may have been perpetrated. I would appeal to the Minister, therefore, to re-examine any doubtful case and to give the benefit of the doubt, as any court of law would do, to the officer concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Halliden is incorrect when he says that the amount is £4,600,000 this year.  The Minister is introducing a Supplementary Estimate for £630,000, so that our defence expenditure this year will be £5,206,310.  I do not know if that sum would meet the bill that may be presented to us by the United Nations Organisation, but I would venture a safe guess that in regard to our population and our wealth it is probably considerably above what any United Nations Organisation would ask of us as a contribution by way of men, money or materials, to a world organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know because these things are entirely in the air.  I do not believe anybody knows.  These matters have to be considered.  That is why I say we should not commit ourselves to any figure of expenditure until we know what is likely to be demanded of us by these people.  I take it that when we take up our membership of the organisation, if we are let in, if Joe Stalin has the good grace to withdraw his objection, that we will be committed to certain expendi- <Col N="565" /> ture as a member nation, that we will be asked definitely to guarantee a certain establishment, to be available for services anywhere in the world, at any time, perhaps on notice from the United Nations Chief of Staff's Committee, or some body of that kind. Some military committee will take over and we, as a member nation, will have to take our fair share of the job of policing the world and of fighting any aggression that may arise.  It is for that very reason that I do not want that we should commit ourselves now to an expenditure that we cannot foresee.  I want to see if our people here, particularly the Minister, can get some idea of what is expected from us in that direction and then, having ascertained our position as a member nation, we can do whatever extra is required of us.  I feel that, from a purely defence point of view, it is futile for us to attempt any scheme of defence except in collaboration with some form of alliance of Western Europe or else with the United Nations Organisation, or with both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is open to us to be a member of a Western European or general European alliance and at the same time to be a member of the United Nations Organisation.  There is nothing in the charter to prevent regional defence alliances and it may be that we may find ourselves having to consider joining two forms of defence alliance, one regional and the other a world security system and, whichever it is going to be, or if it is going to be both, we will definitely have to find the money.  We are not going in there merely as club members, to slip down in an armchair and fall asleep.  We will have to put up the men, money and equipment.  It is for that reason that I want from the Minister some indication of where we are drifting in this matter of defence, if we are drifting, or what exactly we are leading up to.  It is only fair to the country and to the House that we should have that information.  I am not looking for State secrets, for defence secrets, or anything like that. I only want the broad outlines of the policy which I feel the Minister and his colleagues should be pursuing in these matters.  The defence of the greater <Col N="566" /> part of the world to-day is an international matter.  The security of nations has become so interdependent that you cannot divorce one from the other.  You cannot think in terms of national defence here without at the same time considering your whole international position.  The two are tied up together. I wish we could see the day when we would have no defence Estimate in any national Budget and I am sure many other people would wish the same. While we have the present position obtaining in the world we have to face up to it but I ask that it would be faced up to in a realistic fashion, that we should not indulge in any vain-glorious schemes here and should not become jingoistic or chauvinistic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are very few Deputies in the House sufficiently well informed to be able to make up their minds as to the size our peace-time Army should be but the references to that matter have promoted me to inquire of the Minister as to the reason for not introducing conscription at the beginning of the emergency.  Was it not because we had not a military machine capable of handling a conscripted Army, and that that was in fact the main consideration which decided that particular matter?  In the event of any emergency comparable with what we have had, the question of conscription will become a very vital one.  When the war broke out in 1939 the volunteer force which was then fairly well trained was called up and I know that in my constituency the vast majority of the volunteer force were men who had agricultural knowledge and who were required on the land and that it was impossible to get them exempted from military service, at all events for a very long period.  The territorial force took the form of a voluntary organisation.  There was one very serious anomaly arising out of that position, that you had workers of very important productive capacity retained in the Forces and at the same time men who had not been engaged in productive work allowed to do their military duty in the voluntary local force.  In my opinion, conscription, if you like on a selective basis, would have eliminated that anomaly and the economy of the <Col N="567" /> country, in the production of food and fuel, would have benefited enormously. There are a great many people who believe that the reason why you did not have that system was because there was not a military machine capable of handling it.  If that is so, it is obvious that such a machine should be the basis of the new military peace establishment. The Minister ought to consider the peace establishment from that point of view.  However, the military authorities are the best judges in that matter.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Cosgrave refer to discrimination on political grounds in the Army, because I have heard a similar statement made from the opposite point of view.  I have been told that men who were supporters of the Government did not have a chance of preferment in the Army in the officers' corps.  It was not merely on the basis of whether a man had been pro-Treaty or anti-Treaty. If he had been pro-Treaty, and was now a supporter of the Government, his chances were poor. He might have been anti-Treaty at the time of the civil war and would now be a supporter of Fine Gael, and his chances were quite good.  That is the way the case was put to me.  I am inclined to look on that type of criticism through the spectacles with which Deputy Cosgrave has presented us.  It seems to me the two criticisms cancel each other out.  I was glad to hear the Deputy making that criticism; it gave me an angle on what I had heard.</P>
      <P>The officers have been frequently spoken about in this debate.  I should like to put in a word with the Minister for the rank and file who are married. There is great need for an extension of the quarters for married soldiers and non-commissioned officers.  Perhaps this is not the time to advocate an extension of building for Army purposes, but, when the position eases, I hope the Minister will do what he can to provide adequate married quarters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main reason why I rose to speak was to inquire as to the intentions of the Army authorities with regard to the first Irish-speaking battalion. <Col N="568" /> Recently I transmitted to the Minister a complaint in connection with the training of this battalion.  The complaint is that men who joined the battalion are sent to the Curragh for training and they cannot get their training through their own language. The reply I got from the Minister was that the words of command are all in the Irish language, but I think the point of the complaint which I received was not just that; it was that the atmosphere and the life of the soldier generally in the Curragh is not what it should be for a man who wishes to serve in the first Irish-speaking battalion. I believe there is a good deal of substance in the complaint and I will ask the Minister, if it is at all possible, to see that the training is carried out at Renmore, Galway.</P>
    <P>I have been told, on authority that I think is reliable, that the present arrangements for training are preventting men from the Western Gaeltacht from joining the battalion and some men who presented themselves at Renmore, when they found they would have to go to the Curragh, went home again. It is a pity that this battalion should be hampered by a regulation of this sort.  I should like the Minister to examine the complaint and, if it is possible to remedy it, I hope he will do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not very conversant with the dismissal of certain officers from the Army within the past few weeks, but I claim to be conversant with the position of some soldiers who were discharged since the end of the emergency.  To some extent, these men have been treated rather unfairly by the Department.  I would like to advert to a few examples in which I consider, and the men themselves consider, they have been treated unfairly. It is a fact&mdash;at least, it has been given publicity&mdash;that for certain positions under the Local Appointments Commission, and elsewhere in different Government Departments, ex-soldiers were told they would be given credit for some of their years of service in the Army.  How did the Minister decide on the 11th May, 1945, as the date up to which men should have served in the Army before getting <Col N="569" /> credit for years of service?  I think the 11th May was the date of the cessation of the war in Europe.  Important as that date may be, I do not think it is so important as to deprive a man, who had been discharged from the Army a week or two previous to that, of being eligible to apply for a job under the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
      <P>There are many cases in which this rule by the Department of Defence applies.  If a man served a certain period in the Army, irrespective of whether or not he was discharged after 11th May, 1945, he should be given some credit for his service.  He did a certain job and the people are grateful to him for making himself available. I think the Minister should consider wiping out that date and giving credit for actual service in the Army, irrespective of the date of discharge.</P>
      <P>I believe this applies also to the giving of hackney plates to ex-members of the Defence Forces.  It is generally accepted by the public that facilities are given to discharged soldiers to get hackney plates so as to engage in the hackney business but, under the Local Appointments Commission, where these men were discharged before 11th May, 1945, they are debarred from getting this facility.  The Department have treated these men unfairly in many cases.  It has been proved that the applicants have never been given the benefit of the doubt.</P>
      <P>I must complain strongly of the failure of the Department of Defence to have a decent check-up on men when they join the Army.  There is a lot of contention, when pensions are applied for, as to whether disability or disease was contracted while the man was in the Army.  A lot of the trouble could be obviated if there was a proper medical examination on entry.  True it is that some diseases and disabilities cannot be ascertained and it cannot be established whether the disease or disability was contracted while in the Army, but in a lot of eases, if there was a more careful check-up on admission, there might not be such trouble subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel reluctant to talk about the strength of the Army or to take the <Col N="570" /> line taken by some Deputies; I do not feel competent to engage in such debate but, nevertheless, I would like to make a few personal observations. The size of the Army was referred to at length in the course of this debate. My idea is that the Army should be in proportion to our population, and this could be regulated to some extent by the example of some big powers. Deputy Coogan instanced the case of Denmark and he said an army of 100 men made a token resistance to the Germans when their country was invaded. We are entitled to ask the Minister for Defence if it would be desirable in this country to make such a token resistance if we were attacked. Is a token resistance worth while?  We can be all very Irish and very national and glad to shed our blood for our country, but practical people will ask if this shedding of blood would be justified if we knew beforehand that there would be only a token resistance and that ultimately we would be defeated. We are entitled to ask the Minister what would the position be if we were attacked.</P>
    <P>The question was widely discussed in the first few years of the war and people asked what would be our position if Britain attacked us or if the Germans tried to invade this country.  If Britain invaded this country, would we form an alliance with Germany or, if Germany attacked us, would we form an alliance with Great Britain?  We are entitled to hear from the Minister what force the Government would have in this small country if such an attack should take place. We must admit that even the present time is not a time of peace, and that seeing the antics of some of the largest powers in the world to-day the world is liable to be disrupted again.  If trouble started, would we be treated much in the same way as small countries like Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania?  These three countries have to all intents and purposes disappeared from the map of the world and nobody has raised a question.  Is this to be the fate of Ireland in case of a future war?</P>
    <P>There has been some talk as to the necessity of a navy and an air force.  Is our Navy going to be a navy just in name, a navy which will have very few <Col N="571" /> ships?  Is our Air Force going to be an air force in which we shall have very few aeroplanes and for what purpose will these be used?  Every person in the country knows that, unaided, we are not capable of defending this country if the necessity arose.  If every single man, woman and child were armed and trained in military tactics, it would be impossible for the Irish people to make even a show of defending this country. Possibly people may think that this is a question which should not be discussed at this time now that the war is over, and most people expect that another war will not break out for some considerable time.  Again I say, when we see the antics of a country such as Russia&mdash;and the Russians were ruthless in downing countries like Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania&mdash;such a thing could happen to us if another war started. From that point of view we should have a pooling of the ability and intelligence of all Parties in this House to define a policy of defence, a policy which will ensure that we will always live as a nation and that we shall not be swallowed up by any major power, a danger which would become imminent in case of a future world war.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, this seems to be one of the most discursive debates we had this year.  I think the Minister is to blame because he has put nothing tangible before the House on which a proper debate could take place. We cannot discuss policy properly unless suitable material is put before the House.  It is very unfair to have such a vague measure as this Bill brought before us year after year.  Army grievances are nothing new.  It is nearly 20 years since I left the Army.  At that time the Army had a grievance and there was almost a mutiny.  From that day to this, we have heard of many Army grievances.  I agree that when you are changing from a war footing to a peace footing there is always a certain amount of trouble and great caution has to be used.  We should be very slow in retiring a large number of men and throwing them on to the labour market.  At the present moment there is far more danger than existed in my time because of the manner in which <Col N="572" /> the youth of Ireland have been trained in the use of arms, for the last five or six years.  If you create any trouble in these circumstances you do not know where it will end.</P>
      <P>One thing certain is that we must be proud of the loyalty and the spirit in which the old Irish Army was formed and of the manner in which the control of this Army passed from one Government to another.  There was never the slightest hitch and there was an entire absence of cliques.  The personnel of that Army was perfectly loyal to the country, and to-day we can pay a glowing tribute to them from the highest to the lowest.  They have served their country well, and we are all proud of them.  We are told now that some of the old veterans are to be thrown on the scrap heap.  I think that is a shame and a disgrace. As an old serving officer&mdash;in fact, the only officer in this House who came straight from the first Army into public life&mdash;I am, of course, excluding officers like General Mulcahy and General MacEoin who were at the head of the Army; I am the only one of what might be called serving officers who came into political life&mdash;I am glad to be able to defend here the rights of my old colleagues who at the present time find themselves in dire stress. Twenty-four men with long service are now to be thrown on to the labour market with half a pension, without any prospect of employment for them. In my own county I recruited a vast number of young men, from the rank of private up to the rank of captain, and I am proud to say a good many of them are still in the Army giving loyal service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to see the men who are now being thrown out of the Army given a fair chance to maintain themselves in civil life, decently and honourably.  some of these men are being retired &mdash;and I do not care why they are being retired&mdash;before they have completed the term which would entitle them to a full pension, it is the duty of the Government to allow them the full service which would entitle them to draw the maximum pension.  If it is necessary for them to give two or three years more service before they would be entitled to full pension <Col N="573" /> rights, it is the bounden duty of the Minister to allow them for that service.</P>
    <P>I should be glad to see these old veterans getting fair treatment and coming out of the Army.  I want to see them coming into Irish public life.  I want to see them going on public platforms and taking an active part in the political life of the country so that we can restore the old spirit of selfsacrifice, decency and honour which was the foundation of the old Republican Army.  This House lacks strong manly men who are not afraid to speak the truth, irrespective of the Party to which they belong.  After all, a man is a man and he should be singleminded enough to express his own opinions on the many questions which are discussed in this House.  He owns his soul and we hope he owns his body. He should be able to speak his own mind on the many important matters that come before an Assembly such as this.  That is why I should be glad to see the old soldiers who are now retiring from the Army, and who have the requisite ability, coming out to serve the Irish people and taking their due share in political activities on an Irish platform.  They are not the type of men who would come in here to form cliques or to seek jobs for themselves and their friends.  They are men who will give the same unselfish type of service in this House as they have given in the Army.</P>
    <P>So far as the Army itself is concerned, I am satisfied that it would lead to a great loss of public money and to the imposition of a big burden on the taxpayers to have a big standing Army in this country.  I believe that all that is needed in present circumstances is a small foundation Army and that, having regard to our financial capacity, the most that we should spend on the Army is £2,000,000 or £2,500,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>For the last 15 or 20 years young men have grown up in the country with a different outlook and a different spirit from those I knew 25 or 30 years ago.  They are far more soft-hearted than the people of a former generation.  They <Col N="574" /> want to get things easy and to make money quickly.  They do not want to plod along or work as the old generation did.  For that reason, I would like to see compulsory training for every young man.  I do not mean that in the military but rather in the social sense. I would like to see character formation undertaken in the case of the young generation.  They could be brought together at proper centres and put under instruction whether in the military, the social or economic field.  I would like to see our young people at about the ages of 14 or 15 getting a two years' course in social life among properly conducted people.  In that way they could be given character training and a proper national outlook.  They should be taught how to conduct themselves in life, how to act honourably, to refuse to tell a lie at all times and how to handle a gun if needs be.  They should also be taught how to do an honest day's work for an honest day's pay.</P>

      <P>I am to a certain extent dealing with the type of Army that I would like to see formed here.  I do not believe in having a big Army standing idle.  Since 1924 we have had a fairly big Army which has been a definite burden on the country and it had nothing to do.  I dare say it had to be there, but it had nothing to do, so that the money spent on it has been more or less dead money.  At the end of every five or ten years there had to be a cheap sale of Army equipment. Most of that equipment is bought by Jews and people from the back streets of Dublin.  It is sold as scrap and those who buy it make fortunes overnight.</P>

It was just a lot of &ldquo;tommy rot.&rdquo;  We had outbursts of patriotism from men who displayed very little of that 25 years ago when it was needed. I am one of the very few who took an honest, manly part in the fight for independence that was carried on in the Midlands.  I took part in the capture of police barracks.  Very few of those who spoke did that.  I was one of those who captured the barracks in <Col N="575" /> Trim in which there were 26 fully-armed men.  We had to fire one shot to effect that capture.  We had men here attacking Deputy Dillon and Deputy O'Higgins for speaking out their minds.  Some of those attacks were made by cowardly crawlers who never did anything except perhaps that they served a few months in jail because a policeman did not like the look on their faces.  They were not in jail because they had fired a shot or carried a gun.</P>

      <P>I am referring to the disgraceful attack that was made by certain men in this House on two Deputies for speaking out their minds. I know what I am speaking about, and I know the facts of the situation.  We had not 200 men in the Midlands&mdash;in Meath and Westmeath&mdash;that were worth a damn, but when the Truce came I suppose there were 5,000 applications from men there clamouring for pensions.  That is the glorious Ireland that they lived for and died for.  But at that time the devil a one of them wanted to die for Ireland.  Between 1922 and 1924 we could not get one of them in the Midlands to fire a shot. They would not come within ten miles of a barracks.  Yet these are the people who would get up here and attack a man like Deputy Mulcahy who lived through fire and sword for five or six years.  Nobody in the country lived a life such as he except Michael Collins, God rest his soul.  If any man would get up and dare raise a finger to Deputy Mulcahy, then I say it is a disgrace and a shame.</P>

We have very little genuine patriotism in any of the small countries. We heard a lot about what some little countries had suffered in the last war. What are they suffering to-day and why are they suffering?  They are suffering <Col N="576" /> for the same reason that we suffered in the past.  Why had we a civil war here?

      <P>I ask the Minister to be honest and manly with the men who formed the Army now that they are being retired.  They should be retired on full pension.  If necessary let years be added so that that may be done.  The men who served in the L.S.F. and the L.D.F. and who were disbanded also have many grievances.  They gave decent, loyal service.  At the end they were hardly thanked for their service. They asked when going out that they should be allowed to take with them their pair of boots and their great coat. It took six months before that concession was given.  In my opinion these men should have been given a gratuity of at least £10.  They were surely entitled to a little gift like that from the nation which they had served so loyally. Instead, they got what the soldier always gets&mdash;the jack-boot.  The Minister owes a duty to those men who stood loyally by him and by Ireland, and now when they are retiring he should give them an honest, decent return for their long service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has centred itself around two or three main items. There has been a general demand for an explanation from the Government or from the Minister, as to whether the Government have in fact a defence policy.  In addition, there is a request for a detailed laying before the House of the methods as to how a defence policy would be carried out.  My view of the situation is that this nation, through the people, has shown without doubt that it has a policy.  Consequently, the policy of the Government is that the nation's independence, so far as it has been achieved, is to be defended, whatever the occasion may be and no matter where the attack comes from.  I believe it is generally understood that the policy of the Government is in accordance with the wishes of the people of the present day <Col N="577" /> and with the traditions of the people as a whole throughout the centuries that have gone on.  That policy is that this nation will be defended in relation to its survival as a nation and as an entity in the world.  But, as regards details&mdash;as to how many soldiers we should have, what types of war machinery the Army should have at its disposal, where we are going to have our defence posts and so on&mdash;it is beyond my comprehension that Deputies should ask to have these details disclosed here.  After all, if we have an Army, we have a headquarters staff which is charged with the responsibility of keeping the country protected from a defence point of view.  It must necessarily change its views from time to time and may change situations as it sees them.  We must rely upon experts in the Army, who have the responsibility of taking care of this nation's rights, if they are challenged, to do their job properly.  It is not for us across the floor of the House to say whether one person happens to be a better general than another.  That should be left to the experts.  That is my view as far as defence policy goes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to make the Deputy, who stands before this House as an intelligent Deputy, realise that he is asking me to explain what I have said.  I think it is as simple as A.B.C.  I stated that this nation has proved by its actions during the last 750 years that its policy of defence is one of defending freedom.  Any Government, and particularly this Government, should bear in mind that it is charged by the people who elected it to see that the nation's independence is defended.  To that extent I say that the policy of the Government is one of defence.  The details as to how this country should be defended are a matter for experts, who are professional soldiers.  They must decide that.  In this House we cannot possibly decide how many machine-guns, how many rifles or what defence positions should be needed.  These are matters that should be left outside the House to be <Col N="578" /> decided under the Minister who is responsible for the Army and to this House for its activities.  I hope that is quite clear.</P>

      <P>Then the Deputy is not as intelligent as he asks the House to believe.  I think everybody else understands what I mean.  Deputy Dillon is neither competent nor has he the right to suggest what our soldiers should do in the event of this country being attacked by an outside power.  There have been references to the position in the world at large.  Deputy Coogan, in a most extraordinary contribution, expected to have our defence policy defined in relation to world affairs.  He suggested that our defence policy should be fixed now, although nobody can say what is going to happen.  All I can say is that this small nation has asserted itself in the past and will so in the future in its defence.  It will have to make the best decision it can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies suggested that it might be better to have no Army, because, with the development of science and the advent of the atomic bomb, some powerful nation might come along and squelch us.  Because of that danger it was suggested that we should not have the responsibility of defending ourselves.  The position of this country has been unique.  People in another country are in the same position.  While we may be conquered we will, if we resist and defend ourselves, survive as an independent people.  Even if we were under foreign domination, no matter how long resistance would be necessary, that resistance could rise&mdash;I say rise advisedly&mdash;to a point at which volunteers would resort to guerilla tactics. They might be termed assassins by their opponents&mdash;a word which was used shortly before the Truce&mdash;rather than have to submit to domination by outside people and in order to survive as a separate nation.  People should examine all aspects and should recognise that we are in control of our own affairs in this part of our country. We can only show the world that we are prepared to defend ourselves if attacked.  If we had no defence possibilities when the recent world war was <Col N="579" /> raging, the position here might have been vastly different.  The manhood and womanhood of this country were prepared to throw themselves into the breach if the necessity arose.  I believe that spirit made those who were thinking of and advocating invasion or occupation of this country think twice, because capture is one thing, subjection is another thing, and is sometimes a very costly operation.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to do me the honour, if I may put it in that way, of reading a speech that I made on this Bill last year.  At that time I asked him to remember that men in the Army, whether privates or officers, who served this nation in peace-time or in the time of danger should get somewhat better consideration than they received in the past.  I drew his attention to the difference that there is between the clothing provided for the private soldier and the officer.  I understood then that there was in contemplation a design for a better uniform which would be made of somewhat better material.  I should like the Minister to remember that the private in our Army is just as much a man as the officer.  He may not have the same education but he certainly has the same human feelings.  Sometimes it may be considered degrading for an officer, who may have a brother a private, to be seen associating, so marked is the difference in uniform.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider also the possibility of providing better accommodation for soldiers than has been available.  My view of the situation is that the present accommodation was inherited from another Government that has long since departed, and that had to employ soldiery and levies to live in barracks amongst a people to whom they were not welcome. I think if the Minister would instruct some of his staff to make a special examination of that situation, it would be found that many small things could be done which would improve both the lot of the soldier and the officer.  I say that because I know the feelings of the men in my constituency. They find themselves when moved from their homes under present conditions not quite happy in the Army. Whatever Government we have I believe <Col N="580" /> that within our resources an Army must always be kept up because it will always be the nucleus of a defence force when needed, or if you like, in the event of danger.  I ask the Minister to get some of the officials to read the remarks I made last year with a view to examining and doing what I suggest.</P>
    <P>A great deal of talk has gone on about these officers being badly treated.  I met one of the officers affected and he told me that he was annoyed with the Press for referring to this matter in a manner which would give the public grounds to believe that disciplinary action was being taken against the officers for some offence.  He told me that he had served for, I think, 25 years and he felt that he was being fairly and generously treated.</P>

      <P>These matters are done on the advice of lawyers.  The Deputy has a habit of coming in here and referring to all kinds of people in the most extravagant language.  Then, on the next occasion, he holds himself up as one of the most charitable Christians in the House.  Those who read the reports of the debates of the House will be able to judge whether the terms &ldquo;liar&rdquo; and &ldquo;blackguard&rdquo; are applicable to people outside the House; on some occasions they could be applied to people in the House.  It is a rule of the House that, if a Deputy asserts that what he states is true, that assertion is accepted.  If the Minister wants the name, I shall give it to him.

I think that this motion exaggerates the position.  I only hope the Minister will continue to carry out the policy he has pursued since he was charged with the responsibility of office and that the country will continue to provide the best types of Irish manhood to fill the posts in our Army so that, if the occasion arises, we shall be in a position to defend ourselves.  I do not want to be misinterpreted when I say that.  I heard Deputy Kennedy speak of the possibility of another war and Deputy Keyes later suggested that he was hoping for another war.  Deputy Kennedy feared that that would happen. I say that if the event, which all of us must fear, comes to pass, we must be ready to defend ourselves as we did in the past and as we were prepared to do during the past six or seven years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The speeches from the Government side of the House have revealed an extraordinary mentality. Dean Swift said that it is better to be in our graves than to live in slavery to slaves.  Members of the Government Party, having subjected themselves to slavery, are now anxious to impose that slavery on all sections of the House. We must, says Deputy Briscoe, leave all matters of defence to the Minister and his expert advisers.  The House has no right to inquire as to the number of rifles or machine guns which are required by the Army or which are being used by the Army.  I think that this House has the right to inquire as to the number of machine guns or rifles required by the Army and to decide how many million pounds should be devoted to the use of the Army and how many thousand men should be retained in the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a widespread and definite opinion in the country that the demands being made for defence at present are excessive and unjustifiable in the uncertain conditions which prevail. <Col N="582" /> No man can say on what lines or in what way the next war will be fought. It is the invariable custom of middle-aged military experts to fight the next war upon the experience of the last war or to plan the next war upon the experience of the last war.  That habit of mind has been disastrous in many condemns and it is very expensive for our nation at present.  That habit of mind is revealed in the policy which condemns poor people, and people with small incomes, to shiver in their homes for lack of fuel because the military experts have decreed that no trees adjoining or near a roadway or public thoroughfare should be felled.</P>
    <P>It is time there was a realistic approach to the problems of defence in peace-time.  We should be free from the attempt by the Government and their supporters to impose silence upon all criticism in this House.  Deputy Kennedy wrapped the national colours around him and said it was unpatriotic to criticise defence policy, that criticism of defence policy voiced in this House would be splashed across the English Press.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>No Deputy should allow himself to be intimidated by the suggestion that his criticism of the Government or of Government policy would bring discredit upon this country.  That is a shield which the Government and their supporters have sought to erect to protect themselves from criticism. More discredit has been brought upon us and more general lowering of our prestige has resulted from things members of the Government Party have said and done than from anything said or done by Independent or Opposition members of this House.  Deputy Briscoe's fierce defence and glorification of terrorists will not raise our prestige in Great Britain or elsewhere.  We should recognise the fact that this is a free Assembly, that we have the right to criticise Government policy, particularly in a matter which involves the expenditure of enormous and everincreasing sums of money.  An Army of over 12,000 men, to be properly equipped over a long period, is a grave <Col N="583" /> undertaking, which must cause very great concern to every member of the community.  The tying up of 12,000 of the best of our manhood in the Army, keeping them from civilian occupations where they might be able to add to the national wealth, is a matter of very great concern.  In justice to the people, in justice to the taxpayer and in order to safeguard the economic position, we should think twice before committing ourselves to such enormous expenditure.</P>
      <P>A matter was raised here in the course of this debate which deserves consideration&mdash;the matter of injustice to certain members of the Defence Forces.  Deputy Kennedy said that the present Government took over an Army which was a credit to the country.  He might have gone further and admitted that the Government took over an Army which was a credit to its own rank-and-file and to its officers.  It is a grave and serious injustice and a danger from the national point of view if men of that Army are wronged or allowed to labour under a feeling that they have been wronged.  Deputy Giles made a general appeal on behalf of those men and I would like to support it.  The number of men involved is not great and it should be the duty of the Government to see that they are not allowed to labour under a sense of injustice. We should get away from the type of hysterics which we have heard from the Government Benches and should approach this problem in a reasonable way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister a question.  Is he aware that soldiers who, after 21 to 25 years' service have left the Army on a pension of £54 a year, have been denied relief work through a municipality because they are not sent by the Labour Exchange and the Labour Exchange will not send these ex-soldiers out on Government-subsidised relief work as they have 21/- or 22/- a week in pension and they are not drawing £1 a week from unemployment benefit?  If a man draws £1 or 22/- from the Army, which is a Government Department, surely he is just as much entitled to get relief work as the man who is drawing £1 a week from some other Department?  Would <Col N="584" /> the Minister get in touch with the Department concerned and ask them why they debar soldiers leaving the Army on such a small pension from getting work?  I mention specially the Sheridan case, of which he has some knowledge and about which I wrote to him some weeks ago.  This man has a wife and family.  He came out of the Army on £54 a year.  If he had come out with only £52, he would be eligible for work, but because he has a shilling or two more than £1 a week in that way, he is debarred from work on relief schemes.</P>

      <P>Were it not such a serious matter, it would be amusing to listen to the contradictions of different speakers in regard to this Bill and the proposed expenditure on the Army of £4,600,000.  This House unanimously accepted the proposal of the Government to enter the United Nations Organisation.  As Deputy Coogan observed, when we passed that resolution we accepted the commitment that whatever the demands of the United Nations Organisation may be we would accede to them.  Yet we have Deputies occupying the attention and the business time of the House for hours, criticising the expenditure of £4,600,000, while at the same time they are prepared to accept a proposal that, if the United Nations Organisation ever functions and asks us to contribute £12,000,000 a year, we will do so.  Let us be consistent.  If it is too much to spend £4,600,000 on our Army, it is far more indefensible to commit ourselves to an unknown expenditure of possibly gigantic dimensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ask ourselves whether the independence of our country is worth preserving.  Was it ever worth fighting for?  Is the amount of independence we have got worth fighting for now?  If it is not, let us say so and let us unanimously agree on that point just as we have agreed to enter the United Nations Organisation.  Let us not try <Col N="585" /> to pretend to be in favour of the defence of the independence of this country&mdash;or of that portion of it which we control&mdash;and at the same time pretend to be against the provision of the means of defending it.</P>
    <P>Regarding the criticism of the new naval service, I have been long enough in this House to remember when members of the Opposition condemned in no unmeasured language the raids made by foreign fishing fleets on our fishing grounds, when we had absolutely no means of resisting such raids except one vessel which, from what we know of it, was not remarkable for its speed.  If there is another war and we are neutral, as we were in the recent one, we must have some means of preserving the neutrality of our waters. We must at least provide observers to see that that neutrality is observed, that is, the men who will be able to find out if our neutrality is being broken by any of the Powers engaged in such a war.  One could become very hysterical, as Deputy Cogan has said, but it is not my intention to become hysterical.  All I will say, in conclusion, is that, if we are to accept the statements from the Opposition Front Bench, any man who died for this country and any man who died anything for the country in the way of working for its independence or its freedom was a damn fool.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to say very much with regard to the Army because I think that the least said about the Army in this House or outside the better.  The work of the Army should be left to those in command of the Army, but, as a Deputy representing the country and knowing the country's resources, I feel that, much as we would like to have a big Army, we should only have an Army which can be provided from the resources at our disposal and at the moment we are not in a position to spend £4,500,000 on an Army of 12,000 men.  I often feel that sometimes the strength of a nation, and even the strength of an individual, lies in utter helplessness.  That could be put forward as a sound argument, that the more defenceless a country is, the stronger it is so far as safeguarding its independence is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="586" /> I remind Deputies on the opposite side, especially Deputy Kennedy who spoke about what was said on this side, that these words were used by the Taoiseach as far back as 1927.  When the Defence Forces Bill was introduced in that year, he said he saw no reason for a large standing Army, that it could not be effective in preventing an invasion, for instance, of our coasts by Great Britain. &ldquo;Our defence will lie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in having a territorial volunteer force which will make it impossible for that power&rdquo;&mdash;meaning England-&ldquo; to establish its rule here amongst us.&rdquo;  The present Minister for Industry and Commerce made a similar statement&mdash;that it was a farce to have a standing Army here of the size they had then.  The size of the Army was then 5,000 men.  It is sometimes a good thing to have a long memory when one hears some of the speeches made here, especially the speech made by Deputy Kennedy.</P>
    <P>I feel to-day that an Army of 5,000 men would be quite sufficient because I honestly feel, without meaning any disrespect to the Army, to its powers or its efficiency, that we could not effectively defend this country if we were invaded.  Let us make no mistake about that.  The statement that we could is just about as honest as the statement that we were able to support ourselves during the war and provide 100 per cent. for the maintenance of our people. That is a fallacious theory from which we have suffered for a number of years past.  We could not so support ourselves and our people would have starved, were it not for the goods we got in from outside.</P>

It was Great Britain and America who <Col N="587" /> saved us, and well we know it.  There is no use in trying to hide that fact. Consequently, if we are to spend money on an Army, we should see to it that our defence plan has some relation to the defence plans drawn up by the Governments of Great Britain and America. The Minister hinted at that in his statement when he said that it was the intention to send officers across to England. For what?  To learn the latest about military science of every description. Why not be honest and say here that we are in agreement with England so far as the defence of this country is concerned?</P>

We are to spend £4,500,000 on the Army which we cannot afford to spend, and I think we should at least have an honest statement from the Minister, with none of this camouflage about sending a few officers across to Great Britain for training.  We know what would have been said if that had happened during the régime of the Cosgrave Government, when the Army was styled the Army that was to keep this country in subjection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be much better if the Minister said that any measures we take are taken after consultation with the British and American Governments.  That is the only return we can get for the expenditure of our £4,500,000.  The statement that we could defend ourselves against invasion after the experience of the last war and of the weapons used in it is one that should not be made by any sensible man.  We are not in a position to defend ourselves, and the sooner we recognise the fact the better, any more than we are in a position to maintain ourselves in <Col N="588" /> similar circumstances.  It has been proved that we are not.</P>
    <P>I feel that we should have a statement from the Minister as to what really will be the defence plan for this country and as to what he proposes to do in connection with the defence plans of Great Britain and America.  We cannot get away from the fact that the people of Great Britain and America are the people who have most in common with the people of this country, and we cannot get away from the fact that Russia has taken away the independence of any country in which she has secured a footing, such as Latvia, Lithuania and all the other little countries in the north, and that the only forces which stand between us and Powers of that description are the combined forces of Great Britain and America.</P>

Considering the plight of our people, especially of the old age pensioner, ploughing his lonely furrow on 10/-, which was the amount given 13 years ago, although the cost of living is now about six times what it was then, considering all the people on poor relief, considering the lack of fuel and other disabilities from which our people are suffering, we should not spend £4,500,000 on an Army.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil do now adjourn until Tuesday, 11th February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="590" /> I am sure that many Deputies and many members of the general public have had difficulty in getting a clear picture of the world grain situation, in view of the undoubted scarcity in many European countries, which has necessitated the rationing of flour and bread, and the occasional Press reports of large export surpluses in most exporting countries.  In the circumstances, I welcome the opportunity of making a statement but I must say that I do not hope to be able to clarify the position completely because there are aspects of it which are somewhat obscure.  I will, of course, be able to give precise information concerning existing supplies but, as to the future, I can deal only with the position as revealed by official statements of national and international authorities and as communicated to us by those authorities.</P>
    <P>During the past 12 months the getting of sufficient wheat to maintain bread and flour distribution, even on a reduced scale, has been, for all countries with insufficient internal production, a problem of first importance.  We may count ourselves as being exceptionally fortunate in that it has been possible for us to defer until now the formal rationing of flour and bread, which all other European countries were compelled to adopt very much earlier.  Our present position must be considered against the background of developments over that period if it is to be fully understood and regarded in its proper perspective.</P>
    <P>During the war years the principal difficulty in getting wheat supplies was the shortage of shipping.  The wheat was available abroad for purchase in the quantities in which it was possible for us to transport it.  With the end of the war, in the summer of 1945, and the immediate improvement in the shipping position which resulted, it was expected that there would be no further difficulties and, in fact, in the following months imports were so satisfactory that it was decided to reduce the extraction rate of flour from wheat to 80 per cent.</P>
    <P>Later, there were shipping problems of another kind, and some difficulty in getting satisfactory results through an organisation called the United Maritime Authority, which had been set up <Col N="591" /> to control shipping and, because of this, imports fell off towards the end of 1945 but, it was not then considered likely that shipping difficulties would prevent the importation of the quantity of wheat necessary to maintain full deliveries of flour and bread and the reduced extraction rate.  Then, early in 1946, came the first warning of a new problem, a shortage of total supplies in relation to the world's minimum needs, but the full seriousness of this problem did not become apparent until shortly before the European Cereals Conference, which was called in April, 1946.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary, I think, to detail here the circumstances which led to the unexpected development of a world grain crisis.  The main factors were: first, the under estimation of the requirements of the liberated countries, secondly, the failure of the rice crop in the Far East, and thirdly, some over-estimation of the available world supply.</P>
    <P>This news of an impending world wheat shortage was a cause of special perturbation here, first, because the previously assumed favourable world supply position, coupled with the curtailment of shipments towards the end of 1945, for the reason which I have stated, had reduced our landed stocks; and secondly, because bread has a relatively greater importance in the diet of our people than in the diets of many countries of comparable living standards in normal times.</P>
    <P>That its importance for us has increased in recent years is evidenced by the considerable expansion in the demand for flour.  In the pre-war years the flour millers' distribution of flour averaged about 53,000 sacks per week and, while that figure was reduced during the periods of acute shortage in 1941-42 to less than 50,000 sacks, from the end of 1942, when the 1940 level of distribution was restored, the quantity gradually increased, first to 60,000 sacks, then to 62,000 sacks and, from the summer of 1944, to an authorised figure of about 65,000 sacks per week, which was maintained up to the recent introduction of rationing.  The increased demand for flour is to be attributed to <Col N="592" /> the scarcity and rising prices of alternative foodstuffs, flour and bread prices having been held down by subsidy, and to the difficulties of cooking in town and country due to gas and electricity restrictions and the shortage of fuel generally.  As evidence of the effect of fuel difficulties, flour for commercial baking, which pre-war was about 40 per cent.  of total sales, advanced in recent years to more than 50 per cent. of the increased supply of flour recently being distributed.</P>
    <P>By March of 1946 the full seriousness of the world cereal supply position was disclosed and the Emergency Economic Committee of Europe decided to call a conference of European countries in London to consider the position.  This country was represented at that conference by a delegation which included two Ministers.  The estimated European deficit in bread grains for the year 1945-46 was then put at from 3,000,000 tons to 4,000,000 tons.  Various resolutions were adopted by that London Conference in an effort to find means to bridge the gap, and this country complied faithfully with all the recommendations agreed to.</P>
    <P>The Combined Food Board, which which was then the United Nations Organisation, dealing with the allocation of essential commodities in short supply, was represented at that London Conference and the view put forward on its behalf was that all grains, bread grains and coarse grains, should be reserved for human consumption.  That view was not, however, accepted by the conference and the resolution upon live stock feeding policy which was adopted went no further than a statement that there was no justification for feeding bread grains to live stock and advising efforts to reduce grain consumption by animals by propaganda directed to producers.</P>
    <P>On behalf of this country an offer was made at the meeting of that conference in London to postpone, until the following July, any claim which we might have to a share of the current export surplus of wheat and, by raising the flour extraction rate to 90 per cent., to reduce our demand in July by 25 per cent., the reduced requirement being stated at 30,000 tons of wheat.  Shortly afterwards, in implementation <Col N="593" /> of that undertaking, we again raised our extraction rate to 90 per cent. and took steps to regulate total flour deliveries.</P>
    <P>Mention of the use of coarse grain for animal feeding brings me to our purchases of maize in the Argentine. In the later months of 1945 and early in 1946 our central importing company, Grain Importers, Limited, bought in the open market over 120,000 tons of Plate maize, part of it being of the 1944-45 crop.  That was welcome news to our live-stock industry, which had so keenly felt the loss of that important animal feeding-stuff during the war years.  However, owing to shipping and other difficulties, the arrival of the grain was delayed and a substantial part of our purchases had still to be lifted at the time that the question of the use of coarse grain for direct human food was first raised.</P>
    <P>In view of the suggestion made by the Combined Food Board representatives at the London Conference, we made it clear that the maize we had purchased would be made available by us to the countries needing it for human consumption, and our willingness to do so has been restated more than once since then.  In fact, in August, 1946, when our wheat difficulties were especially pressing, the suggestion was made by United States officials that part of the outstanding balance of the maize should be released to other countries for human consumption and the United States undertook to make available a compensating quantity of wheat from allocations made to such countries.  We were quite willing to act upon that suggestion, but the only country which took up the suggestion changed its mind before arrangements for the switch were completed.</P>
    <P>Following the London Cereals Conference, we made an application, supported by a full statement of our wheat position, to the Combined Food Board for our reduced and postponed requirement of 30,000 tons of wheat for the balance of the 1945-46 cereal year; that is the period between July of 1946 and the arrival at the mills of the produce of our own harvest.</P>
    <P>The Combined Food Board was composed <Col N="594" /> of representatives of Canada Great Britain and the United States and dealt, as I have said, with the allocation of all essential materials in short supply throughout the world.  Our application did not fall to be met until July and in the meantime the position was altered as a result of a Food and Agriculture Organisation Conference held in Washington towards the end of May.  That conference was called by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations and it was summoned to deal with the cereals position for the following cereal year; that is to say, the 1946-47 cereal year.</P>
    <P>We were not then members of the Food and Agriculture Organisation but, through our association with the Food and Agriculture sub-Committee of the Emergency Economic Committee for Europe which, as I have mentioned, called the London Cereals Conference, it was possible for us to be represented in the capacity of advisers to the Emergency Economic Committee for Europe, a delegation of which attended the Food and Agriculture Organisation meeting.  That Food and Agriculture Organisation Conference at Washington followed much the same lines as-the London Cereals Conference, which had dealt with the position up to the end of the 1945-46 cereal year and adopted a number of resolutions for the conservation of grain on similar lines to those adopted by the London conference.</P>
    <P>At the time of the Food and Agriculture Organisation Conference in Washington in May, it was anticipated there would be a deficiency in bread grain in relation to world supplies during the 1946-47 cereal year of about 10,000,000 tons.  The principal resolutions adopted at the Food and Agriculture Organisation Conference were a recommendation for a minimum extraction rate of 85 per cent. for the 1946-47 cereal year; the maintenance of the use of grain for industrial purposes at the existing low levels, or less, if possible; that wheat flour should be diluted to the extent of 5 per cent. by the use of other grains, potatoes, etc.; that bread grains should not be fed to live-stock; that the maximum use should be made of pasture, hay and straw; that dairy cows and draught animals <Col N="595" /> should receive priority for coarse grains; that second priority should be given to the maintenance of a nucleus of breeding stock; that the feeding of grain to other stock, especially pigs and poultry, should be reduced to a minimum and that producers should be encouraged by publicity to follow out these recommendations of the conference.</P>
    <P>Owing to the dissatisfaction of many countries with the decisions of the Combined Food Board and the reluctance of the three countries forming the board to carry on their difficult task, it was decided at that meeting to set up in its place a new organisation called the International Emergency Food Council, now known, like all these international organisations, by its initials, I.E.F.C., which, through subcommittees dealing with the principal commodities requiring regulation, would aim at securing the equitable distribution of the available surpluses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When was that set up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At the Washington Conference last year.  By Resolution of the Conference, membership of the International Emergency Food Council was automatically conferred on those countries which already were members of the Commodity Committees which acted in an advisory capacity to the Combined Food Board but provision was made to enable all countries which had a substantial interest in the trade in any particular commodity to apply for membership.  In the course of time, most members of Food and Agriculture Organisation became members of International Emergency Food Council or one or other of its Commodity Committees.  As this country was not a member of the Food and Agriculture Organisation, we did not at that time apply for membership of the International Food Council.  In fact, to the extent that it was possible for us to have our views impressed on the conference, we were opposed to the setting up of such a body, feeling that the work of allocation could be more effectively and expeditiously dealt with by a smaller organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="596" /> The procedure followed by International Emergency Food Council was subsequently outlined in August in an official letter received by us from the secretary of that body.  The commodities regulated by that council are divided into two lists.  The items on List I, including for example, oils and fats, are directly allocated by the council. The council does not allocate the commodities on List II and grain (other than rice) and flour, are on the second list.  I shall quote an extract from the communication dealing with the commodities placed on the second list.  The following is the extract:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Those commodities under close observation by the council but for which the International Emergency Food Council does not at present recommend international allocations are set forth in List II.  Claimants are expected to notify the council of their proposed requirements and purchase programmes for these commodities but, in so far as the council is concerned, may proceed with procurement arrangements unless notified by the council within ten days following receipt of such programmes, that an allocation recommendation is to be considered by the council.  The absence of notification should not be interpreted as an indication that supplies are available or that other conditions are such that the proposed purchases could be made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Combined Food Board, shortly before it went out of existence, notified all countries to submit a detailed statement of cereal requirements for 1946-47. We submitted our statement in July, by which time the work of the Combined Food Board was being dealt with by this new body, the International Emergency Food Council.  Our wheat import requirements, which were based on an optimistic view of acreage and production from the home crop, were put at 235,000 tons.  Our requirements of maize were given at 255,000 tons for the cereal year.  No formal objection was raised by the International Emergency Food Council to the proposals outlined in the statement either within the ten days stipulated by the prescribed procedure or since. By this time the question of obtaining <Col N="597" /> 30,000 tons applied for to the Combined Food Board in respect of the 1945-46 cereal year, the wheat which was necessary to supplement our supply for the period July to September of last year, was becoming urgent.  We made strong representations to the International Emergency Food Council, to the Government of the United States and to the Government of Canada, and the upshot of these representations was that the United States allocated 8,000 tons of wheat in July of last year and 8,000 tons of flour in August.  Canada could supply nothing owing to the fact that her wheat stocks had been almost completely exhausted and her principal customer for wheat, Great Britain, had, even though bread rationing had, by then, been introduced in that country, a pressing need for such shipments as could be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if we got delivery of the 8,000 tons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to deal with that now.  The International Emergency Food Council, with whom our representatives in Washington had been in constant contact in efforts to get the 30,000 tons of wheat, had raised many difficulties.  They drew a comparison of our over-all availability of food with that of other importing countries and referred to the absence of bread rationing here.  They pointed to the critical stock position of supplying countries and the very urgent needs of a number of importing countries which had to be provided for as a matter of urgency. In any event, all efforts to secure more than the 8,000 tons of wheat and the 8,000 tons of flour allocated by the Government of the United States, to which I have referred, proved unsuccessful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An approach was also made to the Argentine Government with the approval of the International Emergency Food Council but, owing to existing Argentine commitments, it was not possible to secure supplies.  Efforts to lift the United States flour allocation were frustrated by shipping difficulties and, in fact, it was not until the month of November that the bulk of the allocation arrived here.  With the onset of the <Col N="598" /> very wet weather, the native harvest looked like being abnormally delayed and a complete break-down in flour and bread distribution during last September became very nearly a reality.  Urgent representations were made to the Canadian Government for the release of a cargo of wheat but they were unable to provide it because of the difficulties with which I have already dealt. Subsequently a cargo of something less than 3,000 tons of wheat and 500 tons of flour arrived from Canada which covered, but only barely, our needs for the critical days of September last before the inflow of the new crop of native wheat became adequate to meet current needs.  These supplies were obtained on loan from the British Ministry of Food.  We were very grateful to them for their willingness to help us over a period of temporary, but very acute, difficulty.</P>
    <P>Early in September a further conference of the Food and Agriculture Organisation was held in Copenhagen. This country was admitted to membership of the organisation.  The world supply position for 1946-47 was again reviewed and an estimated bread grains deficit of 6,000,000 to 8,000,000 tons was disclosed.  The International Emergency Food Council representatives present suggested as a means of closing the gap that the surplus of new crop coarse grains, expected to be about 6,000,000 tons, should be reserved for direct human consumption.  That suggestion did not find acceptance at the conference.</P>
    <P>There was no disposition there to go further than to reaffirm the resolutions passed at the Washington Conference and a resolution was in fact adopted along those lines.  It was admitted by the representatives of some exporting countries that through force of circumstances it had not been possible to discontinue the feeding of wheat to animals in those countries.  The near disaster to our own harvest, due to weather conditions during the harvesting season, increased our dependence on foreign wheat, and made the speedy importation of supplies a matter of greater urgency.  The bad harvest also completely upset our estimate of the total yield and increased the quantity that we needed to import.  There were <Col N="599" /> no reserve stocks available as in previous years.  It had been hoped that Canada, our principal supplier of strong wheat, would provide this year the bulk of such wheat which is necessary for a mixture with our own grain in the production of flour of good baking quality.  At first the Canadian authorities did not consider that there would be any difficulty in meeting our requirements, but owing to the exhaustion of the Canadian carry-over stocks and the slow movement of new crop wheat and the need to meet to some extent the urgent calls from many countries, our allotments of wheat from Canada were limited to 17,000 tons in each of the months of September and October.</P>
    <P>The next most serious development in Canada was the discovery that earlier crop estimates had proved over optimistic, and that the yield would be less than had been assumed by more than 500,000 tons.  To add a further complication, transport difficulties, to which I will refer again later, reduced the supplies available at the shipping points.  In these circumstances the Canadian authorities felt obliged to concentrate their efforts upon meeting their commitments to Great Britain, and they were unable to promise further supplies of wheat to this country before July of this year unless deliveries by Canadian growers improved in the months of April and May next. During the last quarter of 1946 our representatives in Washington and at Ottawa kept the International Emergency Food Council, and the United States Government and the Canadian Government fully informed of our position.  They were unremitting in their efforts to secure the wheat we need, and I would repudiate any suggestion that our present position is due to any inadequacy of their efforts.  In November a revised statement of our grain import proposals, based upon the anticipated reduced production from the native crop, was submitted to the International Emergency Food Council. The estimate of our requirements of imported wheat was raised to 300,000 tons for the cereal year ending on the 31st August next, and in addition to some 20,000 tons of oats for oatmeal <Col N="600" /> production it was indicated that it was proposed to import 253,000 tons of maize and quantities of other grain for animal feeding.  No objection was raised by the International Emergency Food Council within the stipulated 10 days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>270,000 tons.  Every effort was made to get further supplies of wheat or flour from the United States, particularly in view of Canadian difficulties and the fact that the United States is the only other source of supply for the strong wheat needed for bakers' flour.  A combination of unforeseeable circumstances and difficulties prevented our meeting with any success.  The United States had, it is true, a bumper harvest and had available for export enormous quantities of grain.  Even so, the demand on the United States far outstrips the supply, and so many countries are working on precarious stock levels that any interruption of the flow of wheat involves the risk of a complete breakdown in distribution.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the prolonged maritime strike tied up United States shipping for over two months with the result that wheat piled up at the shipping points and the countries to which it had been allocated had no means of lifting it.  Following the strike came the soft coal strike which affected railway transport already inadequate to meet the demands on it for the movement of grain for export.  In fact, from the long-term point of view the inadequacy of the United States inland transport or more specifically box-cars for the transport of grain is the most serious shortcoming from the standpoint of the grain-importing countries looking to the United States for supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for this is that the production of suitable railway equipment has lagged very far behind what would <Col N="601" /> be needed to move expeditiously the enormously expanding grain surplus. By a recent Presidential decree priority on the railways has been given to food and particularly to grain for export. It has been stated that, as a result, grain exports from the United States will reach a total of 550,000,000 bushels, or about 14,500,000 tons for the year ending 30th June next.  The United States transport difficulties reacted on Canada's position also.  Considerable quantities of Canadian wheat are shipped through the United States and when the St. Lawrence is closed by ice these east coast United States ports are the only outlets for Canadian wheat apart from Halifax and St. John's. Normally Canadian transport brings the grain to assembly points at Buffalo and United States rail transport moves it from there to the ports.  With the unavoidable withdrawal of United States freight trains from this task, Canadian transport had to be substituted with consequent slowing down of the movements of Canadian wheat to the ports.  I mention these facts so that Deputies can understand the background against which we made our representations to the authorities there and to the international authorities located there.  The United States reply to our representations to secure wheat or flour was that it would not be possible to make provision for us before the heavy arrears in the shipment of existing allocations had been cleared off and that this would take until the new year to accomplish.  In fact there have been no imports of wheat into this country since the end of November.  As had been expected the new crop of native wheat was of exceptionally high moisture content necessitating double drying and was of very poor quality generally.</P>
    <P>A more serious feature, however, was the very extensive sprouting which occurred while the crop was awaiting harvesting, and subsequently due to heating caused by the high moisture content.  This led to the partial break-down of the starch into sugars, with very serious effects on the baking quality of the flour produced from the wheat.  The loaves have been soggy and the bakers are unable to do anything to offset the effects of this high <Col N="602" /> maltose condition.  There was a heavy increase in wastage as a result, and a general outcry amongst the public against the bad quality of the flour. Certificates were obtained in November from two prominent British cereal chemists, Dr. D.W. Kent Jones and Mr. Horace Ward, who regularly examine samples sent to them by the Irish mills.  These reports indicated clearly that it would be impossible to produce satisfactory flour from the native wheat available, unless a high proportion of good quality wheat, and particularly strong wheat, were mixed with it.  Copies of these reports were sent to the International Emergency Food Council, the Governments of the United States, Canada and Australia. It was not possible to use anything like the quantity of good quality wheat recommended by the chemists in admixture with the native wheat, because of the shortage of supplies, and there was a further complication in November, that owing to the hold up in the shipment of the allocations given by Canada in September and October supplies of foreign wheat in that month reached near the point of complete exhaustion.</P>
    <P>Once again, the British Ministry of Food helped us over a difficulty by a loan of 2,000 tons of hard wheat.  From that point on the importance of getting supplies of strong wheat to enable us to make economical use of the native wheat was stressed in all representations to the United States and Canada, as well as to the International Emergency Food Council.  The United States and Canada, for the reasons I have already given, were, however, unable to make any supplies of wheat available to us, but it was indicated that we could, with the assent of the Canadian authorities, obtain supplies of flour in Canada if the Canadian flour mills were prepared to offer it.  So far, however, despite all efforts, only 650 tons of Canadian flour have been purchased.</P>
    <P>I come now to the most recent developments in the situation.  Shortly before Christmas, officials of the International Emergency Food Council discussed our cereals position with our representative in Washington.  They referred specifically to our shipments of <Col N="603" /> maize&mdash;the outstanding balance of our year-old purchases was still in process of shipment&mdash;and suggested that we should make this maize available to countries which would use it for human consumption.  They were informed that recent arrivals of maize had been discoloured, heated and smelly, and unfit for human consumption, and they were reminded of previous offers made in connection with this grain, which had failed to produce any result.  They indicated that if satisfactory evidence could be produced as to the quality of the maize it could be released for animal feeding without prejudice to our claims for wheat.  The difficulty of getting evidence, particularly about maize already consumed many months previously, will be appreciated, but such information as it has been possible to obtain is being submitted to the International Emergency Food Council.</P>
    <P>The officials of the International Emergency Food Council went on to analyse our bread grain requirements and said that, having regard to the supplies likely to be available up to the 30th June, the International Emergency Food Council was suggesting to all countries modifications of their import proposals, with the object of bringing demands more closely into line with available supplies.  After outlining the suggested adjustment of our import programme, which has fallen very far short of realisation so far this year, they went on to say that in the International Emergency Food Council's view all grain, including coarse grain, such as maize imported since 1st July, 1946, should be counted against the total grain allocation to this country, unless it could be shown that the maize was unfit for human consumption, or that an acceptable case could be made to the Feeds Sub-Committee of the International Emergency Food Council for the use of this maize for animal feeding, having regard to our live stock numbers, supplies of indigenous grain, feeding practices and so on.</P>
    <P>Reports I got show that all the maize was unfit for human consumption, with the possible exception of a cargo now being unloaded.  Evidence to this effect is being submitted to the council.  And, as regards the present cargo, the International <Col N="604" /> Emergency Food Council are being told that it is available for any country needing it for human consumption and prepared to accept it.</P>
    <P>On the general proposition, I must say that I am puzzled as to how a proposal of the kind, carrying the possibility of serious consequences for us, through its retrospective effect, could reasonably be justified.  At the same time, it was indicated on behalf of the United States that in view of the pressing demands being made upon them by many countries, whose position was very serious, they were at present unable to allocate wheat or flour to any country importing coarse grain for animal feed.  This objection, it was pointed out, would not hold if the grain was unfit for human consumption.</P>
    <P>Turning from import difficulties to the consideration of the present supply position, the situation is one which, with the operation of the rationing scheme, need cause no exceptional alarm.  Our existing stocks of native wheat, if we could assume that it could be used without admixture of imported wheat, are sufficient for our needs on the present ration up to the beginning of June.  It is, of course, impracticable to plan on the basis of working down to bare boards and our requirements up to the date of arrival at our flour mills of the new season's native wheat, towards the end of September next, should be met by the importation in the interval of about 150,000 tons of foreign wheat.  These estimates, of course, are subject to some modification when we have had more experience of the results of rationing.</P>
    <P>A point of difficulty about the position and one reason why it is impossible to estimate our probable imports subsequent to the 30th June, and before our next harvest becomes available, is that the North American countries and the International Emergency Food Council work on the basis of a crop year ending June 30th, and can make no provision at this stage for any subsequent period.  Due to our later harvest we must budget for a year ending at a much later date, somewhere between the middle and the end of September.  This conflict of cereal years is a source of complica- <Col N="605" /> tion.  In view of this it is understandable that we cannot be informed what quantities we may expect to obtain from July 1st, but it may safely be assumed that some supplies will be forthcoming.  I cannot say, however, that definite arrangements have yet been made to meet, quantitatively, our needs on the basis of the present ration for the month of June.  Our most immediate problem is one of quality rather than of quantity.  Of imported wheat, we have to-day in the country only about 6,000 tons.  We have that imported wheat because we have been spreading out the small stocks which arrived to the utmost.  The percentage now used&mdash;it is all used in bakers' flour&mdash;is far below the minimum which gives the best results, by which I mean satisfactory bread, with a minimum of wastage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We have not confined our efforts to get wheat or flour from Canada or the United States.  In November last, our Minister in Canberra approached the Australian Government for an allocation of wheat or flour from the new crop, then approaching the harvesting stage.  Unfortunately, however, the outlook for the crop looked none too promising owing to the serious effects of drought.  Nevertheless, the Australian Government have recently informed our Minister that they are prepared to make available to us for March-April-May shipment 30,000 tons of flour, subject to the approval of the International Emergency Food Council.  The approval of the International Emergency Food Council has been sought but has been withheld pending the submission of information about our maize shipments. That information is being submitted.  I should like to express our thanks to <Col N="606" /> Australia for their generous offer, made notwithstanding the lower yield from their wheat crop in this year.  The Government of Argentina, too, has also shown its sympathy with our wheat difficulties by promising priority consideration in our case for the supply of new-crop wheat.  I may add that, arrangements are being made for an official commission, headed by Mr. L. H. Kerney, until recently Irish Minister in Spain, to visit Argentina.  Representatives of Grain Importers, Ltd., are at present on the way to Canada to discuss the present position and future prospects with millers and shippers in those countries and secure, if possible, increased shipments of flour from the Canadian mills.</P>

      <P>We were put upon the export list for flour from Canada only last month.  There would not have been much point in starting before then. While I know that Deputies would like definite information as to the total supplies available or in sight, I cannot give it to them.  It will be clear from what I have said that the grain situation is a fluid one, subject to a constant succession of unpredictable developments. It is not impossible that the situation may improve before the summer.  The indications at present are that, later in the year, there should be some general easement in the position, granted reasonably good harvests in North America and Europe in the coming summer and autumn, and I hope that, before the end of the year, it may be possible for us to dispense with rationing.  However, it would be rash to prophesy and dangerous to plan even upon what may seem to be reasonable expectations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Elementary prudence dictates that we make the fullest use of our resources and grow this season the maximum proportion of our wheat requirements.  It was with great reluctance the Government faced the necessity to introduce a scheme for the rationing of flour and bread.  It took that decision only when it was clear, beyond all doubt, that, in order to conserve supplies of available wheat, it was absolutely necessary to restrict deliveries of flour from the mills.  It will be appreciated that rationing of a commodity such as flour or bread in an agricultural country such as ours presents many practical difficulties&mdash;difficulties which were accentuated by administrative problems arising in the adaptation of our rationing system for the purpose.  It was decided to endeavour to devise the simplest possible method of rationing and to get it working smoothly before introducing complications. Accordingly, it was decided to base the scheme on an all-round, flat ration.  The allowance of 6 lb. of bread per week under the rationing scheme may, in some cases, prove too little and in other cases somewhat more than might be regarded as essential.  Speaking generally, however, the ration which has been fixed should prove reasonably adequate and many people who at first feared it would be insufficient will have found from experience that it can be made do. There are exceptions, of course, which will have to be considered&mdash;particularly in the case of those workers engaged in heavy manual work who are forced by the nature of their employment to take a midday meal away from their homes.  The claim of those workers for special allowances over and above the existing ration is admitted and it has been decided to meet them. It will take a little time before the printing of the necessary documents will be completed and the final arrangements made but an announcement of the details of the scheme and of the <Col N="608" /> classes to which it will apply will be made shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is not possible yet to give precise information as to the saving of wheat which will be actually effected under the rationing scheme but all the evidence points to a fairly substantial saving, which is all to the good.  The maintenance of the existing ration will depend on the extent of supplies of imported wheat coming forward during the remainder of the season.  We can expect very little more from the native crop and any additional supplies needed to keep us going until next harvest will have to be imported. In general, the rationing scheme can be said to be working very smoothly. That is in no small measure due to the co-operation which has been forthcoming from the trade and the public. Officials of my Department are constantly in touch with the various trade interests&mdash; millers, bakers and traders &mdash;and minor difficulties in the working of the scheme which have cropped up during the past week have been ironed out, where practicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are also in close touch with the confectionery trade which have special difficulties of their own.  I think it is true that the confectionery trade has been hit by the scheme somewhat harder than I anticipated and I am giving consideration to various suggestions which have been put forward for a modification of the scheme to meet the special circumstances of that trade, other than the exclusion of flour confectionery from rationing.  A difficulty also arose in the case of persons obliged to be absent a few days from <Col N="609" /> their homes on business and who ordinarily would not be catered for by hotels and restaurants.  A special arrangement has been made to provide those persons with vouchers to enable them to buy bread during their absences from their headquarters.  It may take a little time also before all the problems raised by the catering trades will have been solved.  I have endeavoured to make this statement as complete as possible but I have no doubt that many points will arise on which Deputies will require information.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That wheat was allocated against our requirements in the period July to September, 1946.  We needed it urgently then.  Even if the whole of the 30,000 tons we were seeking at that time had been obtained, we would not have had a carry-over stock at the end of the cereal year of as large as international conferences had decided to be necessary in the case of every country.  In that period, 8,000 tons of wheat were imported and consumed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can express our appreciation of the vast amount of information given to the House by the Minister.  We have heard a long and detailed history of this whole problem, not only for this country but for all the European countries.  He told us that the problem was comparatively simple up to the beginning of last year, that it was not a problem of supplies&mdash;which were available, particularly in the new world&mdash;but of shipping.  He said that a critical situation was reached in the spring of 1946 and a conference was convened in London&mdash;the Emergency Conference on European Cereal Supplies&mdash;to which we were invited and at which we were represented by the Minister and by the Minister for Agriculture.  Various resolutions were passed there in an effort to bridge the gap in regard to supplies of bread grains for Europe.  There was a deficiency of between 3,000,000 and 4,000,000 tons.  He told us there was an under-estimation at that time of the needs of the liberated countries, of the <Col N="611" /> failure of the rice crop in the East and an over-estimation of supplies of wheat.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a contribution to the discussion at that conference and the Report of its deliberations, with the resolutions passed and the speech made by the Minister, was circulated to members of the House.  I cannot rid my mind of the feeling that the Minister's attitude there had a profound effect on the future import of supplies.  He informed the conference that we were an exporting country.  He detailed the contribution we had made to the alleviation of hunger in Europe, giving the figures for the various commodities we sent through the International Red Cross.  Those figures are set out in the Report circulated to Deputies.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce went on to say, in his speech at that conference, that we imported pre-war 700,000 tons of grain and that, because of the policy of the Government, there was a substantial increase by compulsory measures in the amount of land under wheat here and that our annual requirements at the present time would be 200,000 tons.  He said that, so far as the year 1946 was concerned, we had considerably increased the home production of wheat by compulsory measures and a further increase in the acreage was anticipated.</P>
      <P>Now, the Minister's anticipation was wrong.  The acreage fell from 662,498 acres in 1945 to 642, 595 in 1946, a drop of 20,000 acres.  There was also a substantial drop in yield and, furthermore, a drop in the quality of the grain produced. The Minister, speaking as a city man, although Minister for Industry and Commerce, did not appreciate the uncertainty of an Irish harvest and the danger that our climate might cause a very substantial drop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a question addressed to him by me on Thursday, 23rd January last, I was informed that the amount of native wheat delivered for milling up to the 11th January, 1947, was the equivalent of 260,000 tons of dried wheat and the corresponding figure for last year was 322,000 tons.  I take it from the answer the Minister gave to a question put to him a few minutes ago <Col N="612" /> that the estimate for this year is another 10,000 tons on to the 260,000, making 270,000 for this year.  One may take it that the amount of wheat delivered to the store at the present time is the aggregate amount that is going to be available for milling purposes.  There may be some reserves for farmers' use that will be milled by country mills. The discrepancy there in our home production is 200,000 tons.  That considerably accentuates the problem.  Therefore, in the picture represented to the emergency conference in London in April last, the Minister anticipated an improvement on last year, whereas experience has shown us that the position has disimproved by approximately 62,000 tons.</P>
    <P>I feel that the information available to the United Nations Organisation, to the Combined Food Board and the body now dealing with this problem of allocating supplies to the various countries, the International Emergency Food Council, must be influenced by the statements made by the Minister at that conference in London.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question addressed by me to the Minister to-day, I got the monthly arrivals of wheat since August, 1945.  They presented the picture, which the Minister has filled in in detail in his speech, that we had substantial imports of wheat up to last April.  Last August 12 months, we imported 30,000 tons; in September, 26,000 tons; in October, 33,000 tons; in November, 6,700 tons; in December, 6,600 tons; in January, 1946, 4,960 tons; in February, 1,496 tons; and in March, 13,000 tons.  The position then deteriorated for the next four or five months. The conference in London took place in April, and in that month we imported 1,156 tons.  In May, we imported none and in June none.  In July, we im-imported the 8,000 tons to which the Minister referred.  In August, we imported none and in September, 12,053 tons.  The Minister has described to the House that the position was very acute in September and that when native wheat came on the market, it was a matter of more or less working from day to day on the supplies arriving at the mills.  I suppose the House must be satisfied with the work <Col N="613" /> done and the representations made by our representatives abroad, but it does seem an extraordinary situation that, so far, we have been unable to secure anything which would make us feel comfortable as to our supplies between now and the next harvest.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government, speaking at Mullingar on Sunday last, said it was true to say that the enemies of Ireland were tired of the Taoiseach in 1916, 1922 and 1932 and the same could be said of them at the beginning of the war and at the end of the war. I suppose the Taoiseach would claim the United States as a friend and not an enemy.  It seems extraordinary that a member of the Government should measure the success of the Government here by counting the number of enemies we have and not the number of friends.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>If the foreign policy of the Taoiseach amounts to this, that we are to be told by the United States that our people are to exist on yellow meal, and that it is good enough for us, from now until next harvest, we certainly cannot compliment the Taoiseach on his foreign policy, and neither can we compliment the Minister for Local Government on his approach to this problem of securing these essential supplies between now and the next harvest.  I offer this advice to the Minister for Local Government, that our policy ought to be to cultivate friendship rather than to count the number of countries who are our enemies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the native wheat crop is concerned, the Minister has referred to the difficulties which existed&mdash;the very bad harvest, the amount of sprouting which occurred and its effect on the glutin content and how that sprouting had the effect of turning the starch content into sugar and producing baking difficulties.  This Party made representations to the Minister for Agriculture in September last, appreciating the difficulty which was inevitable due to weather conditions.  At that time, we saw resolutions being passed all over the country suggesting that the moisture content of wheat should be <Col N="614" /> ignored and that the guaranteed price should be paid, regardless of moisture content.  We felt that, if that were done, wheat would be delivered in a shocking condition and that our drying capacity would not be ample to deal with wheat arriving in that condition. We felt that not only should the scale with regard to moisture content and bushel weight be adhered to, but, in a season such as the last harvest, we should encourage the farmer, above all, to do as much natural drying as possible, and we recommended that the price should be increased by 5/-, particularly for best quality wheat, and suggested that it would pay the country very well to do that.</P>
    <P>We also recommended that it might be wise to consider the question of rationing and of reducing the extraction from 90 to 80 per cent.  because we knew that a very considerable amount of wastage was taking place.  The Minister listened very carefully but our recommendations were not accepted, with the result that a good many people were disappointed.  I do not think the difficulties the agricultural community had to face and tackle in trying to produce and to deliver wheat in any reasonable condition were appreciated.  Much of the wheat arrived in very shocking condition, in sprouting condition, and, in some cases, it was so bad that it was not able to travel through the artificial driers, and some of it was lost.  We feel that, in that respect, the best course was not followed and that, in the very bad conditions which existed, the home wheat crop could have been better handled.</P>
    <P>So far as the wheat scheme generally is concerned, I do not think the Minister or the Government can be complimented on what has been achieved. They have boasted about their wheat policy for a number of years and one would expect that a Party which believed so much in native production would have achieved better results.  It appears to me that when, after encouraging native production for a long number of years, we were only able, in the year 1946, to produce less than 50 per cent. of our requirements, the Government could not be complimented, even by their own supporters, on the results <Col N="615" /> secured by that policy.  It is true they had a policy but, so far as expanding production during the emergency was concerned, there was no national effort and no organised plan of production. It was left to the individual effort of farmers.  We applied a compulsory Order.  We sent inspectors around and merely insisted that the farmer should do his job regardless of what equipment or manures were available.  As a matter of fact, only very small quantities of artificial manures were available.</P>
    <P>We have got no potash for years and it seems a very strange situation that, even in this present year, the sugar company, by their initiative, could secure ample supplies of potash for this year's crop of sugar beet, and yet the Department has been unable to secure a supply of potash for any other purpose. I cannot understand how it is that a company like the sugar company, on their own initiative, by sending their manager or whoever they sent abroad, can secure a very substantial supply of potash.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>It must have been an almost negligible supply we got.  The sugar company sent their representative to Spain and secured a substantial supply of potash for their particular purposes and the Minister's Department has not succeeded in getting any supplies at any time since the emergency started and the supplies of potash for any purpose other than the production <Col N="616" /> of sugar beet here are negligible. I feel that sufficient efforts were not made by the Minister's Department during the emergency to secure essential supplies of artificial manure.  The result of failure to get them is, not only lower acreage, but lower yields.  Lower yield has resulted in lower acreage.  It became uneconomic for the farmers to produce and they reduced the acreage under wheat to the minimum that they were bound by compulsory Order to cultivate.</P>
      <P>The Minister ought to appreciate that so far as statistics here are concerned, they are almost useless, that they are certainly not reliable and that on an important matter such as we are considering here, we cannot anticipate what is available or what we are going to get.  I am satisfied that in every year the estimate of yields is too high and that it is never accurate.  The Minister has always found, of course, where deliveries are substantially below the estimate, that the difference can be accounted for by the amount retained for consumption on the farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister suggested to the House that he was pursuing a wise course in delaying rationing up to a week ago. I do not think he can be complimented in that respect.  In view of the very dangerous and difficult situation that existed last September and October, in view of the diminishing imports for some months prior to that, the Minister at that time should have considered seriously the introduction of rationing because, undoubtedly, wastage occurred, not merely because of the bad quality of the loaf, but because bread was being used for animal feeding, and for animals of a particular type.  Rationing was bound to obviate that wastage.  The Minister showed us clearly what the position is so far as native supplies are concerned, that we had enough up to June but that there was a difficulty about the end of the cereal year, which ended much earlier in most other countries than here, but that we may assume that some further supplies will be forthcoming and that we will require about 150,000 tons of foreign wheat to bridge the gap.  That is a very substantial margin, which we are just hoping may arrive.  The Minister may have more confidence in the <Col N="617" /> future than many of us.  He is in a better position to judge than we are but, if the situation is in any way dangerous, I wonder whether the question of reserving some supplies of barley and maize for admixture purposes has been considered. It will be too late to consider that aspect of the matter in another month or two.  There must be substantial supplies of barley in the country at the moment and possibly, although the oat crop was bad and of poor quality, there may be some oats that might be used for admixture purposes. Certainly there must be some barley, which is useful for that purpose and which is preferable to maize, in my opinion.</P>
    <P>The House will be pleased to hear from the Minister that he intends to review the rationing scheme and to make provision for an increased allocation for certain types of workers, especially for men who have to bring their rations with them when they go to work and have to rely to a great extent on a sandwich meal away from home.  The Minister might also consider workers generally who have to expend a great deal of energy and who are working in the open air and thus develop very keen appetites.  He might also consider the case of large families, with small incomes, that exist to a very large extent on bread.  The Minister should not overlook these categories.</P>
    <P>In giving details of arrivals of wheat for the various months, the Minister told us that none arrived since November. I could not understand that because, in a reply to a question of mine to-day, he gave a figure of 5,900 tons that arrived in the month of December but during the course of his speech he informed us that no wheat arrived since November.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>1946&mdash;5,900 tons.  I believe that if the recommendations that we made to the Minister for Agriculture had been carried out, our home crop could have arrived in better condition in the mills.  There was no inducement to the farmers to make use of whatever natural drying was available. There was no short-cut so far as <Col N="618" /> the saving of the crop was concerned. We pointed out that the harvesting would be long and tedious and it would require an infinite amount of care, attention and patience.  We suggested that the Government should pursue a policy which would encourage the agricultural community to expend that care and patience on the crop and that it would pay good dividends in the long run.  We were not listened to.  Much of the crop was put together and threshed under shocking conditions. Millers were instructed not to be so strict on bushel weights and moisture contents.  We felt it was a year when you would need to ensure that the quality, above all, was paid for, and that the producer would be satisfied, if he did his job well, that he would be well paid for it.</P>
      <P>All that was neglected and a very substantial part of the crop was allowed to deteriorate and sprout and become almost unfit for human consumption. It would have been unfit for human consumption but for the fact that the situation was so serious.  I feel the Government are not free from blame there.  I feel, too, that the Minister was unfortunate in being so optimistic last April at the London conference.  I believe the statement made by the Minister at the London conference has influenced the Combined Food Board or the International Emergency Food Council conference as to our allocations.  They were given the impression that we were almost self-sufficient, that we were in a position to export substantial quantities of food to the Continent and to Britain, and that our problem was not a serious one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I offer this bit of advice to the Minister, that unless he is satisfied there is a definite hope that adequate supplies will arrive to bridge the gap of three months&mdash;and three months is a long period&mdash;until the native wheat arrives at the mill, now is the time to consider the need of earmarking whatever supplies of good barley are in store, and possibly some supplies of oats for admixture purposes.  It will be disastrous if we find later in the year that allocations are made that cannot be readjusted, that countries having got allocations and building on supplies <Col N="619" /> arriving cannot allow their allocations to be reduced.  The Minister said that Canada is not prepared to make an allocation beyond June, and we have July, August and half the month of September to provide for before we can bank on native supplies.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is prepared to reconsider the question of rationing. He has told us that, so far, it has been successful, but we must recognise this fact, that we must wait for at least three or four weeks before we are down to the real rationing, because there may be a surplus of flour on the bakers' hands that is helping the situation for the first three weeks and it must be down to bedrock by the end of that time.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made in the daily papers to the possibility of increasing the price of bread and it is suggested there may be an increase of 2d. on the 4lb. loaf.  If it is necessary to increase the price of bread&mdash;and it may be, with the reduction in extraction, that the cost may increase to some extent&mdash;I suggest that under the conditions here and the high cost of living&mdash;and these matters have been discussed very exhaustively within the past couple of days&mdash;the Minister ought not allow the price of bread to be raised on the consumer.  If an increase has to be made, it must be met by subsidy. I think all sides of the House will agree that if there is to be an increase in price it must be met in the present circumstances by subsidy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement is not the kind of statement that calls for any extensive comment.  He has reviewed the position very fully, and I think the House is grateful to him for having given so much information on this very important subject. He laid bare all the difficulties that confront us in securing wheat and flour supplies.  I think it is quite clear to anybody, listening to the Minister dwelling on the factors which enter into the distribution of wheat and the interplay of forces engaged in its distribution, that there is very little that this small country can do to guarantee itself supplies of wheat in a world <Col N="620" /> circumstanced as this world is just now.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister and his Department are to be congratulated on the sustained efforts which they have made to augment the native wheat supply, and I think it is to the credit of the Department that during the past six years we have been able to avoid bread rationing, that we have been able to get the quantities of bread required by our people, and that our greatest difficulty was the unpalatable experience of having to eat bread which was not of as good quality as in pre-emergency years.  It is only now that the real bread difficulty is upon us.</P>
      <P>From the Minister's statement I am not without hope that even the worst aspects of what threatens to be a serious problem may yet be avoided by a partial rehabilitation in Europe, by an easement of the crop difficulties of the Far East and by a general intensification of wheat production in the wheat-producing countries.  The Minister's statement indicated that native wheat supplies are sufficient to provide our bread requirements up to the end of June and that from then until this year's harvest is available a problem has to be faced; but against that problem there is a promise of 30,000 tons of flour from Australia, some assurance from the Argentine that we will be placed in a high priority on their exporting list if the world committee controlling the distribution of wheat and flour will permit them to export, and still some hope that we may get supplies from Canada and the U.S.</P>
      <P>If these prospects materialise, even to a fairly substantial extent, then, with the rationing which has been imposed, it may be possible for us to go through this cereal year without any great difficulties.  If the world is ever to get back to a reasonable stability, we ought to be able, and the world ought to be able, in a large measure, to bid good-bye to cereal difficulties in the year 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question as to the wisdom of growing wheat in this country has often been the subject of debate in this <Col N="621" /> House, at times the subject of acrimonious debate.  I do not want to draw that issue into the arena now or to make it a subject of lively contention this evening, but I think, reflecting on the position during the last six or seven years and on the statement which we have heard from the Minister, it has been a good job for this country that we did endeavour to grow wheat and that, were it not for native supplies, this country might have had to face a much bleaker period than that which we have gone through or which confronts us now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  We should like to see that policy implemented more fully but we have got to realise that it is impossible, even with the best policy in the world, to carry it out if you have not the necessary tools and implements.  Where you try to get wheat grown in areas in which there is no tillage tradition, where there is not sufficient agricultural machinery or where you try to grow wheat on land that is not best suited for that purpose, without fertilisers, you invariably experience difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to pass from that to the bread situation.  I am very glad to learn that the Minister proposes to make additional supplies of bread available for workers engaged in heavy industries and for those who find it necessary to have their main mid-day meal away from home.  While it can be contended <Col N="622" /> that our bread supply under the present rationing system for all classes of citizens is equivalent to what the British give their workers in heavy industries, one could quite easily get a misleading impression by reference to these facts.  The British people do not eat bread as extensively per head of the population as we do.  In Irish homes, particularly in rural areas, and particularly in the houses of poor people, bread in the morning is a substitute for bacon and eggs Bread is a substitute at lunch time for meat and at tea time for what, in other houses, can be a variable tea.  There is, at bed time, the traditional cup of tea and slice of bread in the kitchens of country homes.  The result is that our people, particularly people in the strata which I have indicated, consume inordinately more bread than the British people.</P>
    <P>Bread, therefore, enters into the diet of our people much more extensively than into the diet of British working-class people.  It is because of that fact that it is necessary to make some special provision for workers who have to take their midday meal away from home, particularly in cases where workers have not large families and cannot eat into the surplus which might be available by reason of the fact that young children may not consume the present ration, which in their case is very generous.  I hope that the Minister will see his way, in particular, to see that workers who are engaged in turf production, especially those who will be engaged in turf camps, performing very arduous work on bogs and under conditions that inevitably develop a most voracious appetite, will not be stinted as far as bread supplies are concerned.  Already I have had complaints from turf workers that the present allowance of bread is not sufficient for them, and having regard to the fact that it is desirable to do everything possible to stimulate production of turf and that enthusiasm for its production should not be stunted by any complaints in respect to the availability of bread, I hope the Minister will be able to see his way to make special allowances for that class of worker.</P>
    <P>There is one matter in this connection <Col N="623" /> that I should like to mention to the Minister.  I am not sure whether he is aware of it but his colleague the Minister for Agriculture should be.  My experience travelling through the country is that, so far, there has been less winter wheat sown this year than for the last six or seven years.  The impression borne in on me looking at the fields is that there has been a slowing down in the cultivation of winter wheat.  That is probably explainable by the appallingly bad weather we had since last September and because of the difficulty of ploughing rain-sodden lands.  If the sowing of winter wheat has been neglected, it only emphasises the necessity for making sure that the leeway is made up by the sowing of spring wheat.  Here again, a continuance of the present weather is not calculated to induce people to sow spring wheat, certainly not in the proportions necessary to make up for the deficit in the sowing of winter wheat.  I suggest, therefore, to the Minister that if we are going to get the best possible crop of wheat this year, it is essential to ensure that the maximum area of spring wheat is sown. If that is to be done, I think the Government, assisted by all Parties, must lose no time in pointing out to potential sowers of spring wheat, the urgent necessity of taking in hand at the earliest possible moment, as soon as the weather becomes propitious, the sowing of the maximum amount of spring wheat.  Unless that situation is tackled early and vigorously, I am afraid that when we come to calculate the yield of our wheat crop next harvest, we shall find it will not be up to expectations, certainly not up to the levels reached in other years.</P>
    <P>I have noticed in the Press that the Minister for Agriculture proposes holding food conferences.  It seems to me that something more than deadand-alive conferences of representatives of county committees of agriculture, will be necessary to get our full requirements in spring wheat sown and that the task must be tackled in a much more vigorous way than by a repetition of these conferences, some of which I have attended in the past, and which, I am afraid, did not produce <Col N="624" /> any great enthusiasm for the growing of wheat.  The situation this year is far more serious by reason of the fact that we shall have no wheat to carry over to next harvest.  We can ensure adequate supplies next year, not merely by searching the world's markets for wheat, but by doing what is an easier job, one that is within our competence, namely, urging in every possible way our own people to utilise their land for the purpose of growing wheat here to meet our requirements.</P>

      <P>I would like to say at the outset that I think it is not possible to exaggerate the importance of the statement which the Minister has made.  Personally, I welcome it because it is a statement giving the House and the country the facts of a serious situation.  It was a statement which disclosed, notwithstanding the Minister's hopes&mdash;and they were only hopes which he expressed&mdash;for the remainder of this year a far more serious situation than we have found ourselves faced with at any period during the six or seven years of war. This discussion is not a Party discussion, and there is no desire, I am sure, on any side of the House to make Party capital out of it.  I think it is no harm that some of the nonsense that has been punched into the heads of the people over a long number of years is now being de-bunked.</P>

That is the Minister's statement, and I am emphasising it not for the purpose of scoring any points but merely to ensure that that fact should be registered home in the minds of our people.  My second point is this, and it, perhaps, may hurt the Deputy a little.  For years and years the people of this country have been filled up with the <Col N="625" /> nonsense that we could not only overfeed ourselves in every capacity but that we were in the happy position of being able to starve John Bull whenever we liked.  That was said, and I have not a shadow of doubt that the Deputy said it.  It is the sort of statement that he would make.  I do not want to go on with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>All that I want to say on that particular matter is not that <Col N="626" /> the Government went too far in connection with the growing of native wheat but that the Government did not go far enough; that their efforts were completely one-sided.  We are now for about 14 years trying to grow, if possible, our full requirements of wheat here at home.  All our efforts have been towards producing that wheat, but no effort was made to see that, when the wheat was produced, it could be saved.  No effort worth talking about was made to see that when the wheat was produced, and particularly when it was produced in a bad harvest, that there would be anything like adequate or suitable drying facilities available. What is the use in our talking about aiming to produce 500,000, 600,000 or 800,000 acres of wheat in this country when our drying facilities are not equal to dealing with a quarter of that amount, not in a really bad harvest year like last year, but in a fairly bad year which is a sort of normal thing with us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are Deputies aware that this year wheat was so wet that the artificial dryers were unable to deal with it? Surely, in our 14 years' experience of wet and fine harvests in producing wheat we ought to have learned that the only really satisfactory way of drying wheat is on flat kilns.  The artificial dryers are effective only in years when the wheat is produced in a fairly good condition&mdash;in a fairly dry condition. Are Deputies aware that even in some of the best wheat-producing counties there is not one farmer in every 25 who can store his threshed grain even for a week?  He has not the storage suitable for it&mdash;not one in 25 as I have said.  Are Deputies aware that it is a common thing in most of the wheat-growing counties that when the wheat is threshed into sacks in the yard, the haggard or the field a few forkfuls of straw are spread around and the sacks of wheat are left there?  The wheat may be left in that condition for any period of time from two days to two weeks until the lorry arrives to remove it.  That is not hearsay with me.  I have personal knowledge of it.  I have seen that happen on dozens and dozens of farms.  I have raised the matter here on more than one occasion, and I have <Col N="627" /> made representations on it on more than one occasion to the Department of Agriculture.  Even in our mills in this country there are not adequate storage facilities.</P>
    <P>I think the biggest mistake that was made in the late harvest was that the Department of Agriculture did not take the advice that was given to it, namely, to encourage farmers to go to extra expense and extra labour in getting as much natural drying as possible for the wheat.  We warned the Department that if they did not do that the wheat would be sent into the mills in such a condition that it could not possibly be saved in the mills.  I know that some thousands of barrels of wheat were completely lost this year: that it was unfit for human or animal consumption, and that there were tens of thousands of barrels of home-grown wheat that could not be dried because it would not go through the artificial dryers.  When the Government are measuring the cost of what it might have taken to give the farmers that additional sum that would compensate them for the extra labour and extra cost of drying the wheat, I think they ought to put the losses which the nation has suffered against it.</P>
    <P>A number of associations throughout the country and a number of public bodies, some of which ought to have known better, have passed resolutions to the effect that the Government, or the Department of Agriculture, should fix a flat rate for wheat, irrespective of quality.  I am glad the Department did not do that.  If you fix a flat rate, irrespective of quality, then you are going to get one quality, and that will not be the best.  Our idea was that there should be a decent basic price, and that the man who would go to the trouble of producing and delivering his wheat in the best possible condition would be rewarded proportionately above that basic price.</P>
    <P>That was not listened to, either.  I want to make that point because quite a number of people throughout the country, some of whom should have known better, have questioned me as to why some of us opposed a flat price for wheat, irrespective of quality.  The answer is fairly obvious.  If this policy <Col N="628" /> of wheat growing is to be pursued&mdash; and it will, probably, have to be for a number of years&mdash;I suggest that the Government's attention should not be devoted to one side of the problem only.  There is very little use in producing wheat if you do not at the same time make sure that it will find its way into the mills in the best possible condition. We know that there are problems&mdash;very grave problems&mdash;in connection with wheat other than the production of it.  The Minister himself referred to problems which arose in North America and other countries. They produced large quantities of wheat and other things intervened to prevent that wheat getting from where it was produced to where it was required.</P>
    <P>I should like to learn from the Minister what our average annual consumption of flour is.  It seems to vary very often and very radically, so that it is difficult to follow.  I am told that our consumption of flour amounts to 3,000,000 sacks.  The number of sacks or tons of wheat that would require would depend on the extraction.  I understood that our consumption of wheat, as distinct from flour, was between 500,000 and 550,000 tons&mdash;if it was as high as that.  I learned from the Minister's revised figures this afternoon that he estimates that our requirements for this year in wheat will be 575,000 tons.  I should like if he would explain that.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter, affecting these estimates, to which I should like to refer&mdash;the statistics. Some time or another I hope we shall have a discussion which may be useful on the general question of agricultural statistics and how they are collected and calculated.  For the moment I have to confine myself to statistics which deal with wheat.  We were told, certainly on one occasion, and I think on more than one occasion, that we had 700,000 statute acres under wheat.  We were told that the average yield per statute acre in the same year was a ton.  Therefore, if the statistics were right, we should have 700,000 tons of wheat.  In the same year we were told that only 300,000 tons of that crop reached the mills.  There is no necessity <Col N="629" /> for anybody to tell me that a certain amount of the total production is kept by the farmer for his own use and that a certain amount&mdash;diminishing every year, I am glad to say&mdash;is kept by certain farmers for their own seed. Those farmers think they are wise, but they are really foolish.  I know that the amount kept by the farmer for his own use and the use of his household and the amount kept by the farmer for seed does not reach 60 per cent. of the crop.  The position is obvious.  The millers got only 300,000 tons, because we never had 700,000 acres or 700,000 tons.  Anybody who has any knowledge whatever of how agricultural statistics are collected, particularly wheat statistics&mdash;because there is a penalty where wheat is concerned&mdash;knows quite well that it is sheer waste of time.  Not only is it a waste of time but it is highly misleading.  Until such time as the Minister and the Government change the whole method of collecting and tabulating statistics in relation to agriculture, particularly in relation to wheat, we shall never know where we stand.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up much more of the time of the House.  The time is limited and other Deputies desire to speak but I felt impelled to make these few points.  We are not giving the wheat we produce a fair chance so long as we fail to make provision for having it saved in the best possible way and sent to the mills in the best condition. I should like to pay a tribute to the magnificent response made last year to the call for volunteers in this city and in the country.  Making full allowance for the rapidity with which the whole thing had to be done, without preexisting machinery for making the best use of volunteers, I must say that, unintentionally, the Government and they were responsible for certain panic measures which led to wheat being cut, stooked and threshed in a completely unfit condition.  A lorry of volunteers was sent out and dumped at the gate of the first farmer who put up his finger.  Farmers being human, like the rest of us, do not like to see ten or 20 hefty volunteers passing their gate. Many farmers, perhaps against their better judgment, were tempted to <Col N="630" /> tackle the wheat with these volunteers when, in other circumstances, they might have left it for a few days more. That is a comparatively small point in this big problem and is not intended to take in any way from the really magnificent service given by a large number of citizens.  On the question of the increase of 2d. in the price of the leaf, my colleague, Deputy Hughes, seemed to accept that as inevitable and to think that there were good reasons for it.  I have still to be convinced of that, apart from the question whether the increase is to be paid by the consummer or met by subsidy.  It will take some argument to convince me that there are reasonable grounds for such an increase even in existing conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This happened when our people went to get these allocations of wheat from this body.  We were told: &ldquo;Have you not been blathering about self-sufficiency for the past five years?  Have you not got all the wheat you want?  Have you not been employing the <i>March of Time</i> to show the vast acres of wheat you are growing?  Have you not ensured that your publicity is designed to prove that you are independent of external sources of <Col N="631" /> supply?  Go home and eat your wheat now.&rdquo;  It was only then, when our people were constrained to eat the stuff that has been called wheat, that it suddenly began to dawn on them that what I said over ten years ago is true. I said it was all cod, that we never had Irish wheat, that we never had to eat it and that a revolution would occur if we were compelled to eat it for very long.  That is the plain fact.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton says the remedy for our present ills is to grow more wheat. Grow my foot! If we grew it, the people would not eat it, but we cannot grow it because the law of diminishing returns is already beginning to operate.  As Deputy Morrissey points out, if the acreage we are producing is what it is alleged to produce, 20 cwt. to the acre, we would have an immense exportable surplus.  It never did produce that and it is now going steadily down every year.  It is common knowledge that every acre of arable land is deficient in potash and phosphates&mdash; potash, particularly.  Is there any intelligent agriculturist on this side of the House or on the other side who will pretend that, when the land is virtually denuded of potash and profoundly deficient in phosphates, we could continue to grow wheat for very long?  We were told to grow more wheat in order to protect ourselves from exploitation by designing Powers. Feed our own people! Here is the problem in a nutshell.  In the years that lie ahead, we can get wheat from two sources: we can get good eatable wheat from Canada, the United States of America and Australia; and we can get dough, uneatable black dough which is called wheat, from this country.  We are invited to eat that stuff to insure ourselves against the danger of being unable to get supplies in time of war.  Now, the empty benches of Fianna Fáil have discovered that throughout the whole of the world war we were bringing in nearly half the entire quantity of wheat we consumed in each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking into the future, we have the experience that, when we get a wet year in this country, we cannot eat the stuff that is called wheat grown in our own land.  We want to protect our <Col N="632" /> bread supply for the future.  Which is the greater danger&mdash;wet weather in this country or a world war?  Did you ever know a year in which we had not wet weather?  We get one good harvest in about every five and surely even the Fianna Fáil Deputies do not expect a world war in four years out of five? Why is Mr. Halliden being sent out now to look for flour?  Do you mean to tell me that, if the flour millers of this country did not get their profits guaranteed for wheat out of the public purse, when they were informed there was going to be no wheat for them to grind in a month's time&mdash;and they knew it about Christmas that they would be sitting on their sashes here at home until the 1st of February, before they went out to look for it?  If their profits were dependent upon getting wheat, they would have been out in New York on Christmas Eve, rallying all their relatives and acquaintances from the 48 States of the Union, to pull every wire, to make every contact, to approach everybody to get a bit of wheat, so that the poor miller would not have to cut his dividend at the end of the financial year. And they would have got it.</P>
    <P>As sure as we are on this floor, I would undertake to go out to-morrow to the United States of America, with one technician with me, and I would get sufficient wheat in a fortnight to supply this country with at least two-thirds of its requirements from now to the 31st July.  And I have no hesitation in making that statement, because I know the circumstances that obtain. We have plenty of friends in America, powerful friends, who would resent the suggestion that our people should ever be told from the U.S. that they could eat yellow meal.  It is something new, something different from what we are accustomed to, to hear that kind of rejoinder from the U.S. Government. The sort of diplomacy that has created a situation in which our people can be told by the U.S. Government to go and eat yellow meal, while the British Government is sending us flour and wheat, is the kind of diplomacy that has made our country a byword in the world and has left us so that we can grow eloquent about the enemies of <Col N="633" /> Ireland who are tired of Mr. de Valera, but we have to be silent about our friends, because we have not got any.</P>
    <P>The plain truth is that there is a surplus of wheat in the world at the present moment.  It is perfectly true that if you gave every child in India and every Hindu a full diet, the total world supply could not be provided. But even if we wanted to do that, we would not be able, as the transport is not there to carry it to them.  But I assert, and it is demonstrably provable, that at this moment there is an absolute surplus of wheat in the world.  We are just after two of the greatest wheat harvests that North America has ever known in all her history.  Yet we are informed that it is impossible to get wheat, and one of the reasons, we are told, why we failed to bring in such wheat and flour as was available was that we had not the transport.  But we had transport to bring in treacle from Cuba to manufacture into industrial alcohol in Ballycroy. Therefore, I am surprised when I hear some of my decent colleagues in this House saying how grateful they are to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for the noble allocution given to them and the industrial zeal he has displayed.  He made a hames of it, and he has come in now to give us all the particulars and say that it is everybody's fault but his.  Who is supposed to get us wheat?  If he said six months ago he could not get it, some of the rest of us could have got it.  I know of a man&mdash;and I hope we will hear more of him&mdash;who asked leave to go and get it and was told by the Minister's Department that he would not be let, that the only people entitled to get flour in the United States of America were Cereals, Limited, or the importing firm.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that there is any necessity to get hot under the collar about the present situation at all. There is plenty wheat in the world&mdash; lashings and leavings of it&mdash;and as soon as the St. Lawrence River breaks up and the ice goes, there will be all the wheat we want, if we have the common sense to go out and look for it in the right way.  But if some of the tulips we have are going to wrap themselves <Col N="634" /> in the green, white and yellow and go out and cock snooks at the President of the United States of America and the Governor-General of Canada and tell them that we are going to get wheat, whether they like it or not, they will get what they are getting now&mdash; yellow meal&mdash;and they might as well make up their minds to that.  If they go about their search in the right way, however, see the right people and make their claim upon the United States of America and Canada as a request to friends, there will be all the wheat we want after the month of April.</P>
    <P>Make up your mind to this: you will either get wheat from Canada and the United States of America, or you will eat potatoes, and all the expeditions, with Mr. Kerney going out to the Argentine and Mr. Somebody-else going to Australia, are all my eye and Betty Martin.  It is just blather, to pull the wool over the eyes of the poor innocents sitting on the Fianna Fáil benches, so that they can go down the country and say: &ldquo;We are going to put the United States and Canada sitting on their sash now.  We are going to bring in wheat from the Argentine and Australia and then we will soon see.&rdquo;  That is cod, pure, sheer cod, and if that &ldquo;codology&rdquo; is gone on with, our people will pay for it, because remember that there are certain categories of persons in this country, other than labourers doing heavy work, whose health is being put in jeopardy by the scarcity of bread and the quality of bread with which we have contend at present.</P>
    <P>There are hundreds of adolescent boys and girls in residential colleges throughout this country, and, if the present ration of bread on which they have to subsist is long maintained, there will be a rise of 40 per cent. in the incidence of tuberculosis in these schools.  They are not getting enough. I know it.  I am a baker and I was supplying a boys' college.  The average daily takings were 100 loaves.  The ration permits them to draw 60 and you cannot cut down growing boys' rations by 40 per cent. of the staple food they use and expect them to withstand the rigours of our climate and the standing menace of tuberculosis amongst adolescent persons in this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="635" /> To me, the idea of having got ourselves into this disgusting mess through the contemptible incompetence of this crew who masquerade as a Government is exasperating, but to us who are middle-aged, it means but little more than an inconvenience&mdash;we can get along&mdash;but when I think of young creatures in school perhaps having their whole lives wrecked because these incompetents have preferred their dishonest, fraudulent flagwagging publicity to honestly doing the duty they are paid to do, it is extremely difficult for me to keep my temper.  I make no apology for speaking as frankly and bluntly as I do now.  I have not the least hope that calm argument or reasoning with these men would have the slightest effect.  They will flounder on just as they have been going.</P>
    <P>But this matter is one of urgency. There is no doubt that the agricultural community will be constrained by law to sow another crop of the stuff we are eating now&mdash;I will dignify it with the name of wheat.  That cannot be done if there is no seed.  The result of the crop will be inferior, no matter what sort of seed they get, but at least the poor creatures who sow it will be paid for it, but if we inflict upon them seed that will not germinate, as is happening over wide areas of the country, where land is ploughed, harrowed and sown, and no crop comes up at all, the position will be much worse.  In addition to our other difficulties, we must watch closely the situation with regard to seed wheat, and this is peculiarly relevant for this reason, that if the imbecile policy of pretending that we can get on without imported wheat is persisted in, these men may, for stage effect, endeavour to maintain a reserve out of our existing stocks against the contingency of no wheat or flour reaching us before next September.  In that event, there will be so small a quantity of wheat available for utilisation as food and seed between now and 1st April that those buying seed wheat will get dirt, and, once that seed is sown, the man's sweat, labour and investment is committed. It does not matter how much wheat comes into us then in May, June, <Col N="636" /> July, August and September&mdash;the money and time of the poor devil who sowed the rubbish is gone.</P>
    <P>At least have the competence at this eleventh hour to think of that.  I hope and pray that these men who have gone out now may know how to get what our people require in time to avert serious damage.  I have not the slightest doubt that it is possible to get it and I venture to say this, that if Deputy Cogan is afforded an opportunity of speaking here to-night, he will make revelations that will stagger this House and throw a very lurid light upon what some of the Deputies have chosen to describe as the diligence, brilliance and exhaustive ability displayed by our Tánaiste, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Every statement we have heard recently from the Government Benches has painted a more and more gloomy and pessimistic picture for the country.  Everyone recognises from past experience of other wars that the aftermath for millions of people is often worse that the actual war years, and, so far as I can see, the situation here is that the aftermath of war is going to be far more severe and will inflict far more hardship on the people than the years we have just passed through.  For that reason, I should like to impress on the Minister and the Government that the duty of getting whatever wheat may be allocated to this country by the International Emergency Food Council devolves on the Government, and that the Minister or some other responsible Minister should himself go and endeavour to secure supplies.  Without casting any reflection on the diplomatic officials or other people who have gone abroad in an effort to secure supplies of wheat for this country, I say the responsibility of securing supplies and of making provision for the country is on the Government and that the Minister should take immediate steps to make the position fully known to the Governments of the United States and Canada and any other wheat-producing countries that are prepared to supply us or that we consider might be in a position to supply us with some <Col N="637" /> quantities in order to bridge the gap between now and the next harvest.</P>
      <P>Whether through propaganda or through over-estimation of our own supplies or by a combination of these two causes, the impression abroad has been that there would be available here sufficient home-produced wheat and that we would be free from the necessity of seeking foreign wheat to supplement our home-grown wheat. The House will agree that responsibility devolves on the Government, and the House and the country would be glad to feel that a determined effort was being made to obtain supplies.  No matter how authoritative or how representative a commission or an individual representing a large grain concern such as Grain Importers may be, nobody can represent a country abroad with the same authority as a Minister.  From that point of view, the effect of a Minister going abroad to seek supplies, between now and next harvest, would be that sufficient supplies would be made available by other countries.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Government will have to realise that, serious as has been the last harvest, the present bad weather, which has resulted in negligible quantities of winter wheat being sown and the prospect, if the bad weather continues, of no winter wheat being sown, will mean inevitably a considerable reduction in the quantity of home-produced wheat this year. Furthermore, many farmers have found considerable difficulty in securing adequate supplies of seed and adequate supplies of proper germination-tested seed.  Unless supplies of tested seed are made available, the situation may become worse.  Other Deputies have dwelt on that aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that many farmers in my constituency have found difficulty, and a number are still finding difficulty, in securing machinery.  Owing to intensive cultivation during the war, machinery has become worn out and supplies have not been adequate.  The Government should make urgent representations to whatever countries it is possible, in order to secure supplies of fertilisers.  When Deputies refer to more intensive wheat growing, they fail to realise that, with few exceptions, every farm in the country is showing a <Col N="638" /> diminishing return from wheat or any other crop.  The Government must face up to the realities of the situation and to the fact of world conditions.  While there was a bumper harvest last year in America and Canada and while supplies of wheat there were in excess of normal annual supplies, because of the intervention of strikes and other factors, there may be a shortage during the coming spring and early summer. Therefore, we must endeavour to supplement supplies by maintaining and as far as possible increasing, production on each farm.  At the same time, the Government must face the responsibility of seeking supplies of wheat abroad by direct Ministerial intervention.  If that is not done, the country will feel that the Government has failed them in a most serious situation and, unless these steps are taken immediately, the position in the immediate future will be worse than the period through which we have passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in a lengthy and comprehensive statement outlined the position which developed in regard to our wheat and bread supplies. He has shown us how the situation began to deteriorate at the end of 1945 and continued to grow worse during 1946, becoming grave in March and steadily deteriorating until, by September, we were in the position of being absolutely dependent upon Great Britain for a loan of a small supply to tide us over a few weeks.  While that position prevailed in regard to imported wheat, there was an alarming situation developing in regard to home production in 1946.  We were faced in September with a harvest which threatened to be disastrous and which was only partially saved by the continued efforts of farmers and of all sections of the people who were willing to co-operate with them.  While that situation was developing and had reached a very critical stage, early in September of last year, a constituent of mine, through personal contacts in the United States, received an offer of any quantity of wheaten flour which he would be able to dispose of.  This man was engaged in a wholesale and importing business and he immediately took steps to ascertain how much of this flour he would be able to distribute. <Col N="639" /> He found that he would be able to dispose quickly of 50,000 tons and he immediately forwarded his offer for that amount to the American firm and was informed of the price.  Incidentally, I think the price was about 7½ dollars per 100 lb.  He brought the matter to my notice and I got in touch with the Department of Industry and Commerce to ascertain if they would be interested in the importation of this flour and if they could provide facilities for its importation. As a result of a letter which I wrote to the Minister, I was advised to call at the Department, where I would be interviewed by one of the higher officials.  I was no interviewed, in company with Mr. Byrne, who was the importer concerned, and another. I was informed that the Department of Industry and Commerce was not interested in this offer of 50,000 tons of flour, of 72 per cent. extraction.</P>
      <P>We were told that the Department of Industry and Commerce preferred to import grain, and not flour, that they preferred to import grain from Canada, and not from the United States.  We were told that the situation was in no way serious.  We called the attention of the official to the speech which had been made by the Taoiseach a few days before, revealing a very dangerous situation.  We were reassured, however, and told that we could safely leave the whole matter in the hands of the Department and that if at any time later they required this flour they could obtain it simply by cabling to the United States.  The deputation, knowing the conditions in the country at that time, and knowing the danger of a poor harvest, asked the officials of the Department would they not endeavour to import this flour as an insurance against a possible shortage at a later date.  We were just told to leave the matter with the Department; we were not even asked the name of the firm that offered to supply the wheat and flour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department, apparently, was in no way worried at that time about the situation, and it was surprising to hear the Minister stating to-day how worried he was all during the summer months with regard to flour and wheat. <Col N="640" /> It was difficult to find any trace of that worry or anxiety percolating down to his Department.  I think that situation requires some explanation.  If the Department's officials were out merely to hoodwink a Deputy, or the deputation that waited on them, I should like to know what useful purpose is served by seeking to deceive people in that way.  If the situation was really serious, it was the duty of the officials to impress on everyone with whom they came in contact that the situation was so grave.</P>
    <P>In connection with our home production, there is an aspect which strikes one very forcibly, and that is that the total production from the 642,000 acres of wheat sown last year was estimated at 270,000 tons.  I would like some more details as to whether that means the quantity already delivered to the mills, or whether it means the amount which it is estimated will be delivered to the millers, and also whether it includes wheat reserved for seed.  At any rate, it indicates that the output of such a very large acreage of wheat is exceedingly low, less than four barrels per acre.  Four barrels at 55/- per barrel represents £11 per acre, which means a dead loss, or a very substantial loss, for every grower in the past year.</P>
    <P>It is futile to make frantic appeals to farmers to increase their acreage over what is made compulsory by law when you impose upon them such a substantial financial loss.  The farmer should be given at least a price which would cover the cost of production.  It is all right to say that the farmer should make a sacrifice.  If the farmer produces commodities and gets barely the cost of production, he is making a sufficient sacrifice in the national interest.  There is evidence of that if farmers are growing a crop to the extent of 642,000 acres and are reaping no profit from doing so.</P>
    <P>The Minister should definitely review the price of wheat for the coming year and, if necessary, provide money from the Exchequer to make good the cost without raising the price to the consumer. Within the last couple of days we have been voting millions for various questionable purposes and I suggest it would be wise to vote some <Col N="641" /> money so as to ensure that the maximum amount of wheat may be grown.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of consideration given in this debate to the effects of wheat-growing in this country.  I believe there have been serious mistakes with regard to the growing of wheat here.  There has not been sufficient attention paid to the growing of the varieties best suited to particular types of land.  There is no country in the world that has so many varieties of soil as this country of ours, and there is no country which requires so many varieties of wheat and oats. In these circumstances it is desirable that the right variety should be sown in each area.  Every effort should be made to secure the maximum amount of artificials, because without them no satisfactory crop can be grown.</P>
    <P>I wish to support the appeal to provide a supplementary allowance for some very deserving cases.  I refer to workers who have to provide a meal for themselves when working a long way from home.  They are one outstanding example, but another case in which there is very grave need is the case of residential schools and colleges. That aspect has been stressed by Deputy Dillon and it has been brought to my notice by the principal of a large residential college.  I believe there is an urgent need to increase the allowance for such institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise merely to ask the Minister if he could, in his reconsideration of exceptional cases, give some consideration to caterers in towns and villages who supply meals to farmers and traders attending monthly fairs.  I have had several applications in that regard from people in the constituency I represent, and I think it very desirable that some concession should be made to them.  Confectioners also are very worried by the new regulations, and I was very glad to hear the Minister state that he would reconsider the position in their regard.  It has been represented to me that if they got 80 per cent of the former quota&mdash;I understand that they are allocated flour on the basis of their sugar allowance&mdash;they could manage to keep their workers in employment and supply the needs of the community.  I <Col N="642" /> think it is a matter for congratulation that we have got along so well with the policy that has been pursued during the emergency years and I think that everybody should be grateful to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Many appeals have been made to the Minister for additional allowances for various types of workers, but while sitting here I did not hear anybody suggest an additional supply for dockers, who are out day and night, waiting and watching for boats.  When leaving their homes they cut up half a loaf or a quarter of a loaf, and remain away from home for the best part of the night or the early portion of the day, with a few sandwiches to sustain them.  I hold that if there is to be any priority for any section of the community, our dockers, who are working very hard to land food supplies, should not be neglected.  I was glad to hear Deputy Dillon call attention to the case of schools and colleges, where there are so many boarders.  Schools and colleges would include orphanages in which there are a number of growing boys and girls.  I hope that the needs of these institutions will not be forgotten and that the Minister will bear in mind the statement of a very famous medical man that malnutrition is one of the greatest causes of disease. Shortage of bread supplies may lead to the spread of diseases which we are spending millions of money trying to eradicate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand the attitude of the Government when anybody makes a suggestion to them because they generally show no inclination to adopt these suggestions.  That has been the experience of Deputy Cogan.  He complains that he went in there with a very fine offer of flour from another authority and he found that the atmosphere in the Department was not very helpful.  The atmosphere to the ordinary T.D. who is doing his best to help in this difficult situation is: &ldquo;Hands off, you fellows.  Do not be bothering us.  Do you not know that we are doing our work?  We do not want any interference from Deputy Cogan or Deputy Alfie Byrne in the way of questions or suggestions in regard <Col N="643" /> to imports of flour and wheat or what we are doing about them.&rdquo; Deputy Cogan went in with a very valuable suggestion, a very commendable action for a member of the Dáil, and to bring to the notice of the Minister and his officials the fact that there was flour available elsewhere whilst our people were eating a very poor quality of bread.  I am not going to blame anybody for the inferior quality of the bread.  The wheat was wet and because of its moisture content the bread could not be baked properly.  One result of that was that many people suffered from ill-health here in Dublin.  Yet when Deputy Cogan or other Deputies go into the Department to point out that flour is available in other countries, his suggestion is turned down simply because it was not made by the Minister or some of the members of his Party.</P>
    <P>I have met with the same atmosphere myself in this House.  I have asked questions week after week as a result of paragraphs which I have seen published in some trade papers.  I have read paragraphs to the effect that flour and wheat were being allocated in the grain-growing countries to various other countries and I have put reminders to the Government that we should be up and doing.  It has been suggested that members of the Front Bench should take their courage in their hands and that the Minister himself, with his undoubted ability, should go to some of these wheat-producing countries as Minister with the full authority of the Government behind him and not leave the matter to officials.  The Minister should meet the heads of other States and tell them what he wanted.  By personal contact of that kind, he would probably succeed in getting us the flour and wheat which we so badly need.</P>
    <P>Some suggestions have been made that because of inflation and of the increased cost of living and this trouble about the scarcity of flour, bread may be more costly.  I hope it will not become more costly, because any increase in price will cause the greatest indignation amongst people who are forced to live on small wages. <Col N="644" /> I go further and say that the Taoiseach himself, if necessary, should take a trip to these wheat-producing countries, meet the heads of these countries and explain to them the difficulties of our people here.  I should like to remind the Minister that this is 1947, and that 100 years ago, in 1847, our people were afflicted by famine.  In a building not far from here there are records relating to 1847, showing the contributions, not alone in cash but in food supplies, from various nations which came to the rescue of our people 100 years ago.  We are now in the position that we need not beg anything from them.  All we ask is that they should treat us fairly and give us the supplies that we would give them if it were in our power to do so.  In our desire to help the distressed countries of Europe, we have left ourselves, I shall not say short, but with a rather inadequate supply of commodities such as butter and sugar.  We have sent butter, sugar and eggs to the Continent.  I think it was very proper action on the part of the Government to help nations in distress.  Happily we are not yet in real distress, but when the Minister saw what was coming three months ago, that was the time to inform the House of the seriousness of the situation and not when the crisis is actually upon us.</P>
    <P>I earnestly hope that it is not now too late to consult Deputies and that the Minister will accept the suggestions and the advice offered him from all parts of the House.  In particular he should pay more attention to offers of help such as that made by Deputy Cogan by which it would have been possible to get 50,000 tons of flour. Only to-day I put down a question asking the Minister the quantity of flour which had arrived since the 21st November.  He told me that 14,000 tons had arrived.  I do not know what proportion of our normal requirements 14,000 tons in two months would represent but judging by what the Minister states, it is very far short of our total requirements.  I hope he will accept the suggestion of members of this House that he himself should visit some wheat-growing countries, if he cannot induce the Taoiseach to do so, <Col N="645" /> so as to ensure that our people will have ample supplies of flour and bread.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to detain the House further than to express my appreciation of the Minister's decision to provide an additional ration for certain classes of workers.  I recognise that the Minister did not like to provide this ration.  He did not think it necessary, but then he had not the supplies.  I think I can congratulate him on having given what we can call a generous ration, but then I would say there are many exceptions to that general ration and that a case can be made for additional supplies for certain classes of workers.  A number of them have been mentioned by Deputies. You have men on the lightships, night workers and the class that I am particularly interested in, railwaymen. These men are away from their homes for a long period.  It is impossible for them to get an ordinary meal at home or to have at their meal any vegetables. They have, so to speak, to live on the basket, and are obliged to eat bread at every meal.  I think that, in the case of these workers, a good case can be made for an additional ration of bread for them.  I suppose one would have to agree with the Minister that if the needs of the various classes were to be fully met that there would not be much left to justify the ration at all.  I believe that the Minister did not make his ration lightly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told by Deputy Cogan that the Minister or his officials declined an offer of 50,000 tons of flour.  If that be true, I think the Minister and his officials ought to have known better than Deputy Cogan how things were jumping.  If Deputy Cogan was in a position to go to the Department of Industry and Commerce and was not permitted to go the distance of meeting the Minister, then there must be something wrong&mdash;that is if somebody could come along and say that he had an offer of 50,000 tons of flour which could be delivered in this country.  I think that the Minister and his officials should be able to look sufficiently far ahead if an offer of that kind was made six months ago.  I relate that offer to the classes of people for whom I am asking an extension of the rationing system.  I am interested principally <Col N="646" /> in the railway men, and in the dockers like Deputy Byrne.  I hope the Minister will tell us why he turned down that offer of 50,000 tons of flour. Naturally, if we will get wheat we will mill it, but if we cannot get it we should be glad to get flour.  I am not so sure about the answer that was given to Deputy Byrne that no flour arrived in Ireland since November.  We had a strike in Limerick in connection with the discharge of 2,000 tons of flour.  I am not going to enter into the merits of that, but I feel that we would not worry very much whether it was flour or wheat we were offered if we could get it, and not have it tied up for a period.</P>
    <P>I think all Deputies agree that a wonderful response was made to the appeals for the growing of wheat and that our agriculturists are to be congratulated on their achievement.  I am aware, of course, that our various classes of soil require a different type of seed wheat.  They must get the most suitable varieties for maximum production. During the emergency the farmers did, I think, the best they could.  The last harvest season was a particularly bad one.  Nobody is to blame for that but it made the position very difficult.  I think that one is entitled to ask whether the Department was sufficiently alive as to what was happening and whether they refused this offer of 50,000 tons of flour. I think that if we had it I would be justified in asking the Minister for an increased ration of bread for the deserving sections of the community to which I have referred.  If Deputy Cogan's story is a fairy tale we ought to be told so.  If not, the Minister ought to get after that offer so that he may be enabled to increase the ration now provided.</P>

      <P>I take it that the reference to the offer of 50,000 tons of flour mentioned by a constituent to Deputy Cogan was the story which Deputy Dillon assured us would shake the Dáil. I have no doubt that such an offer was made, but, having heard Deputy Cogan and Deputy Dillon on it, as well as Deputy Byrne and Deputy Keyes, I have come to the conclusion that the speech I made here this evening from 7 to 8 o'clock explaining the international <Col N="647" /> grain and flour situation was so much waste of breath.  I told the Dáil about the international authorities which have been established to control the international trade in flour and wheat.  I told Deputies about the attitude of the Government of the United States concerning the exportation of flour and wheat to this country.  There are hundreds of people in this country who can get offers of flour from firms in the United States, but what good are these offers unless the United States Government is prepared to allow the wheat or flour to be exported?  The simplicity and naiveté with which Deputies interpreted Deputy Cogan's story convince me that it is almost impossible to get them to understand the problem that we are dealing with. There is wheat in the United States and 14,500,000 tons of wheat are going to be exported from the United States before the end of June.  One hundred thousand tons would do us.  There is plenty of flour in the United States. There is wheat in Canada and flour in Canada, but there is the other circumstance which I set out in detail that the international authorities, on whose recommendations the Governments of these countries are acting, have not yet allocated wheat or flour to be exported to us in that period, and the Governments of these countries have not agreed to allow the exportation of wheat or flour to us in that period.  Is that clear?  If the Government of the United States agrees to allow the export of wheat or flour to us from the United States there will be no difficulty in buying it.  It will be bought through the non-profit making organisation which we have set up for that purpose and not by private traders buying it to resell for their own profit.  To the extent that flour or wheat is allocated to us, Grain Importers Limited will bring it to us, and it will be sold by them at the price directed by us, a price which enables flour and bread to be sold here below its economic cost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">

      <P>Then this offer of 50,000 tons of flour was a bogus offer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say it was a bogus offer.  I say that there are firms in the United States which are prepared <Col N="648" /> to offer flour and wheat and are doing so regularly, but these offers are of no importance unless they are accompanied by an export licence from the United States Government.  There are hundreds of these offers knocking around, not merely for flour and wheat, but for other commodities.  It will be a good thing if the ventilation of this story in the Dáil will prevent people wasting their time, and the time of Government officers, concerning offers of that kind in relation to commodities that are subject to export control.  These offers are of no importance whatsoever unless governmental authority for the shipment of the goods is forthcoming.</P>
      <P>So much for that.  I may perhaps have misled the Dáil in one respect. The Government of Canada has agreed to permit the export of flour to this country.  We are on the list of countries to which flour can be shipped, provided we can get an offer from a Canadian mill, and if Deputy Cogan's constituent, or anybody else, can get an offer of flour from a Canadian mill we will be particularly interested.  As I told the Dáil, the efforts made so far to get such an offer have realised only 540 tons of flour. Perhaps the representatives of Grain Importers, Limited, who are on their way there now, may be able to improve on that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we need spend any time debating the origins of the wheatgrowing policy or trying to decide to whom the credit for the policy should be given.  It is a good thing we are all agreed, with one unimportant exception, that it is desirable we should grow here all the wheat we can.  Have no doubt about it, we can grow good wheat here&mdash;wheat that will produce flour of as good quality as flour produced anywhere else, with one qualification. Wheat for the production of flour for use in commercial bakeries must contain a proportion of strong wheats.  More than 50 per cent. of our total consumption of flour is shop flour. Irish wheat, provided we have enough of it to enable a proper rate of extraction to be maintained, will produce flour as good as the shop flour sold anywhere.  The flour used in Irish bakeries is improved by the addition of <Col N="649" /> strong wheats, which cannot be grown in our climate.  We should not stop growing wheat on that account.  Such wheat cannot be grown in the Argentine or in Australia and those countries not only grow wheat but are great exporters of wheat, although they suffer the same handicap as we do. Of course, they never heard of Deputy Dillon.  Further, we may suffer from a bad harvest once in a while.  We may suffer from excessive rain but I do not think that we should abandon wheat-growing on that account.  I mentioned this evening that the Australian harvest had been seriously affected by lack of rain.  I am sure that the Australians will not stop growing wheat on that account.  We can grow wheat here of good quality.  We can grow far more wheat than we have grown in any year up to the present and use it to provide our own people with good flour.</P>
    <P>No matter what the circumstances in the rest of the world may prove to be during the coming summer and autumn, the only wise policy for us to follow this year is to grow the maximum quantity of wheat.  There are, of course, difficulties in doing that. It is true that the acreage of winter wheat sown was, probably, small on account of the protracted bad weather since last October.  That situation does not necessarily mean that the total acreage this year need be down on that of last year, if we can get into the minds of the farmers the understanding that it is desirable in the national interest, as we think it is in their own interest, to grow the maximum quantity of wheat.  As the House knows, all that is grown will be purchased at the guaranteed price, already announced.  If there is a bumper wheat crop around the world, and if the international restrictions upon trade in wheat are withdrawn, so that we can buy freely, we still have to make good the normal reserves which would be carried by the wheat importers, wheat millers and others traders in grain in this country.</P>
    <P>We came into the 1945-46 cereal year with 90,000 tons of wheat in stock. Although that was the year in which the war ended, we, nevertheless, came <Col N="650" /> from one season into the other with a carry-over of 90,000 tons of wheat.  If we had those 90,000 tons at the beginning of this cereal year, our problem would be greatly minimised.  For reasons which I have explained and, particularly, because of the anxiety of the Government here not to appear to be endeavouring to procure wheat in excess of our national needs when there was starvation in other countries, we began this cereal year with no stock whatever.  Not merely was there no stock but, by reason of the non-delivery of the last quantity of flour allocated to us by the Government of the United States of America and the unexpected delay in harvesting our own crop, there was a period in which we had insufficient supplies to meet the immediate requirements of our people &mdash;a deficiency which was made good by the loan of a small quantity of wheat and flour by the British Government. So that, it will be clear that we could increase the acreage of wheat grown last year, import a substantial quantity and still not have too much, because, even on the basis of 85 per cent. extraction, we shall need a very substantial quantity of wheat to meet the requirements of our people while, over and above that, we should have reserve stocks representing not less than ten weeks' supply.  Even the international conferences which have been trying to reduce the purchases of wheat by the importing countries will not deny that there are, in present circumstances, good grounds for calculating upon the basis of a normal ten weeks' reserve stock in every country.</P>
    <P>I do not think that Deputy Hughes is justified in his assertion that anything I might have said at the London Cereals Conference could have affected the supply of imported cereals here.  Certainly, he did not quote anything I said to justify his statement.  In so far as he purported to quote from the report of my speech, he quoted only half a sentence.  It is true that I said: &ldquo;Ireland is a food exporting country.&rdquo; The Deputy did not quote the remainder of the sentence: &ldquo;but at present the only foodstuffs exported commercially in substantial quantities are live cattle and eggs, which go entirely to Great Britain&rdquo;.  I explained, in <Col N="651" /> addition, that we were a grain-importing country, that our grain imports averaged 700,000 tons a year, that although we have increased our acreage under wheat&mdash;we have, in fact, increased our acreage under wheat proportionately more than any other country in the world&mdash;we were still far short of our needs and that our capacity to produce more wheat was affected by the impoverishment of the land through scarcity of fertilisers.  On that occasion and on other occasions, we have urged on the international commodity-controlling authorities that not merely have we need for grain&mdash; wheat for human food and maize for animal feeding&mdash;but we have also a very special need for an increased allocation of fertilisers.  In the last week, phosphate rock was released from international control but potash and sulphate of ammonia still cannot be procured freely, no matter how great our need is.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes asked why we did not ration wheat earlier.  It is true that we foresaw the development of this situation long before Christmas, and I expected that that question would be asked.  I thought, however, that Deputy Hughes would know the answer.  We are depending upon the yield of the native wheat crop for the bulk of our supplies&mdash;at any rate, for the period until the end of June. That crop is produced by a very large number of individual farmers, and the experience of other countries suggested that the introduction of rationing, or the announcement of the intention to ration, might impede the inflow of grain to the mills or cause in the minds of farmers apprehensions in regard to their individual supplies which would discourage them from marketing their crop fully and expeditiously.  Deliberately, we decided to postpone the introduction of rationing until the bulk of the crop had reached the mills.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is true.  I do not think that we can meet our <Col N="652" /> situation here to any extent by the admixture of barley or oats with wheat.  The admixture of barley with wheat is practicable: we did it at one stage during the war.  Our supplies of barley, as the Dáil knows, are less than usual and the total quantity that would be available would make no very appreciable difference in our flour supply.  Oats cannot be admixed with wheat in the manufacture of flour unless it is pre-cooked, because the baking time for oaten flour is much longer than the baking time for wheaten flour and, unless the oaten flour in the mixture is pre-cooked, a most unpalatable and unattractive loaf will result.  At any rate, there is a scarcity of oats.  We are trying to get sanction from the international authorities to import oats from America, as it is quite clear that there will be a deficiency to the extent of 20,000 tons of oats in our requirements for the manufacture of oatmeal.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Seed is considered and dealt with separately.  I could not say what the prospects are there, but I think there is likely to be less difficulty in the importation of our requirements of seed, either of wheat or oats, than there would be in the case of grain for immediate consumption.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is true to say that our statistics are inaccurate.  It is far more true to say that our statistics are much more accurate than those of other countries.  In fact, I am not at all convinced that we have not lost in our international dealings by reason of the greater accuracy of our statistics. Nor do I agree with Deputy Morrissey that our statistics show that we grew in any year 700,000 acres of wheat, or that the average yield was one ton per acre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It was stated in this House from the bench opposite, by the Minister himself amongst others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That was years before the war and not during the war years. The average yield per acre during the war, as shown by the published statistics, was about 17 cwt. to the acre, and <Col N="653" /> not all of it could be regarded as millable wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's source of information is the book.  The consumption of flour in this country is not static.  I have explained already that the production of flour has gone up rapidly and considerably during the war.  That may be one of the reasons why Deputy Morrissey had difficulty in reconciling the statistics of one period with those given in another.  Our pre-war consumption of flour was roughly 53,000 sacks per week.  The consumption for the two years before the commencement of rationing averaged about 65,000 sacks per week.  That increase was understandable.  First of all, bread is a subsidised food and, secondly, it is a pre-cooked food and, in a period of fuel scarcity, it is almost certain to have preference over many other foods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>And, of course, the increase in the cost of living had a substantial influence in the purchase of alternative foods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that other foods increased in price, while bread prices were maintained by subsidy, was also clearly an influence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are getting accustomed to speeches from Deputy Dillon such as we had to-night and most Deputies have got out of the habit of paying any attention to them.  However, in case they may have been misled by one of his remarks, to think that the Government of the United States has suggested that our people should eat maize meal, I want to remind the House of what I said as to the attitude of the United States Government, in my earlier speech.  The United States Government are, I think, quite entitled to take the point of view that a country such as this should decide at the beginning of a cereal year the total quantity of grain that it requires and make up its mind that, if it imports maize in respect of any part of that quantity, it should be prepared to accept a reduction in its wheat deliveries. <Col N="654" /> It is understandable that we might decide, in various circumstances, that our situation was such as to make it more desirable for us to import maize for animal food than wheat for human food.  I think it is unreasonable for the United States Government or the International Emergency Food Council to decide to count our maize imports against our wheat needs, retrospectively. There was no intimation given to us or to anyone else that maize would count against our wheat requirements until a few weeks ago, and at that stage it was intimated that maize already imported and already consumed by animals last year would still be taken into account in determining our wheat allocation for this year.  That, I think, was an unreasonable suggestion, as if we had known that the maize would count against wheat it would not have been imported. In any event, there was no possibility of diverting that maize for human consumption anywhere.  In fact, most of the maize that we imported was definitely in a condition unfit for human use.  As I mentioned already, the bulk of the imports was maize of the 1944-45 crop, which had become stale and weevily by the time it reached here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained to the House that while the maize was purchased at that time, difficulties arose which prevented its shipment, and, in fact, it could not be shipped until long after we had intended to bring it in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want the position to be misrepresented in any way.  I take it that when the maize was purchased it was in good condition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>And it was only <Col N="655" /> owing to difficulties which arose after its purchase that the delay took place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the delay in shipment which was the cause of its condition.  It is quite clear that the American Government's intimation was that we or other countries would have to choose between maize for animal food and wheat for human food.  They were not giving us the option of maize for human food or nothing, as Deputy Dillon appeared to convey.  I have no doubt that, when the circumstances are fully explained to the authorities concerned&mdash;both the authorities of the United States Government and of the International Emergency Food Council &mdash;and the documents showing the condition of the maize on arrival here reach them, their decision will be based on those facts.</P>
      <P>It was natural enough to expect that Deputies would suggest that I or some other Minister should go to Canada and the United States.  I can say that we have been in constant touch, almost daily touch, with our representatives in Washington and at Ottawa and if at any time it appeared possible that the presence of a member of the Government in either country would improve our prospect of getting additional supplies, our representatives on the spot would have so advised. In fact, they have advised that such is not the case, and we know that precise statements affecting our position and showing our needs have been delivered to all the authorities concerned. We know from contacts with the people who have the decision on these matters that our circumstances are well understood and there is no reason to believe that the presence of a Minister in these countries would alter the position in the least.</P>
