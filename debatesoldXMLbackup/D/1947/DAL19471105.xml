      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state, in respect of each of the months from <Col N="1322" /> January to October, 1947, the number of persons, distinguishing between men and women, who emigrated to Great Britain and Northern Ireland, for the purpose of taking up employment.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, a tabular statement of the figures will be circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out frequently before, the figures merely show the number of passports or travel permits issued to persons travelling to take up employment, temporarily or otherwise, and are, therefore, not a guide as to the number of people emigrating in the ordinary sense.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>STATEMENT showing the numbers of Passports or Travel Permits issued to Males and Females proceeding to Great Britain or the Six North-Eastern Counties for the apparent purpose of taking up employment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the names and addresses of the persons or firms to whom advances were made under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts in respect of whom it was necessary to write off the whole or portion of the amount advanced, and the amount so written off in each case.</P>

      <P>No persons or firms received advances under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts.  I presume, however, that the Deputy seeks information as to the sums issued out of the Central Fund in respect of guaranteed loans and the total sums which have been paid into the Exchequer in repayment of sums so issued.  This information is furnished to the House during the month of April in each year in accordance with Section 6 of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, 1924, and Section 11 (2) of the Act of 1939.  The latest account which is up to the 31st March, 1947, was laid on the Table of the Dáil on the 23rd April, 1947, and is available in the Official Library.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he has received, from the Association of Milk Producers, returns relating to the cost of production of milk; whether he has examined or accepted such returns; whether he has caused an independent inquiry to be made into the cost of producing milk; and if so, if he will state the nature of such inquiry.</P>

The present costs of milk production were also reviewed by these officers and on consideration of the information placed before me I authorised the increases in producers' prices which were announced in the daily papers last Saturday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say what experience these technical officers have in producing milk?  What is their actual experience in a matter of milk costings?  Is the Minister going to rely absolutely on the information that he gets from his technical staff as to production costs?  Is that what he is going to rely on so far as fixing an adequate price for the producers is concerned? Is he prepared to go outside his Department to look for information that will help him to fix an adequate price which will leave a fair margin to the producers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state, with reference to milk supplied to the City of Dublin: (a) the present price per gallon of milk delivered Dublin; (b) the average deduction per gallon made by distributors for transporting milk from the production area to their own depot; (c) the retail price charged to consumers; <Col N="1334" /> and if he will state what are the comparable guaranteed prices paid to producers in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards (a) and (c) of the Deputy's question these particulars were published in the daily papers on last Saturday.  As regards (b) the deductions made by distributors vary from a penny to twopence a gallon according to distances.</P>
      <P>As regards (d) strictly comparable figures cannot be supplied.  The average price payable to producers in Great Britain is approximately 2/10½d. a gallon for November and December and approximately 2/8½d. for January to March.  In addition quality premiums are paid, while deductions are made for transport.  In Northern Ireland the corresponding prices are approximately 3/3½d. a gallon for November and December and approximately 3/2 for January to March.  Quality premiums are also payable.</P>
      <P>I want to add that the price schedule in Northern Ireland is very complicated and that this does not in fact give a complete picture.  It is not as favourable on a complete analysis as these amounts would seem to indicate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister appreciate that there is a very wide discrepancy in price between here and Northern Ireland and, in fact, between here and Great Britain?  Does he not appreciate that the producer in Great Britain and Northern Ireland has a supply of food for the winter period which is very helpful to produce an economic quantity, that our people have not?  Has he completely overlooked that aspect of the case-the difficulty of securing adequate food supplies for the production of milk; that our producers are handicapped both ways: (1) by a lack of essential supplies of protein foods, and (2) a price that is not adequate? Does the Minister appreciate that the fall in production is due to these two important factors-the low price and an inadequate supply of essential foods?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into the following definite matters of urgent public importance, that is to say, the allegations affecting members of either House of the Oireachtas made in Dáil Éireann on the 22nd, 29th and the 30th October, 1947, in reference to the disposal or proposed disposal, since the 1st January, 1946, of the distillery of John Locke and Company, Limited, at Kilbeggan, County Westmeath, and of the stocks of the said distillery or any part thereof; the nature and extent of the connection which any member of either House of the Oireachtas had with any transactions relating to such disposal or proposed disposal.</P>
      <P>I indicated when we were discussing this question of Locke's Distillery on the last occasion that we were prepared to establish a judicial tribunal to inquire into the matter and the allegations which have been made during the course of the debate on that matter. What concerns this House is the allegations against members of the Oireachtas, whether they are Ministers or private members.  The terms of reference proposed in my motion were intended to cover that.  Since we put it down, I have seen the proposed amendments. It seems to me, with regard to Deputy Mulcahy's amendment&mdash;&ldquo;all the facts and circumstances connected with and surrounding any proposal&rdquo; and so on-that it would not be possible for any tribunal, if it were to spend some years on it, to find all the facts and circumstances.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>How many private discussions may there have been with reference to it?  How are we to find out what private individuals or groups of private individuals had to do with it?  In any case, that is not our business. In so far as individuals, groups of individuals or others who seek to buy or sell property are concerned so long as they keep within the law, they are entitled to transact their business <Col N="1339" /> without having a tribunal to examine it.  If they break the law, or if circumstances seem to suggest that the law is inadequate, that can be dealt with, but is it suggested that if an objection is raised by one party or another to some private transaction, we are to inquire into it?  Our business, as I take it, is to see that members of the Oireachtas do not behave improperly in their capacity as such and that Ministers in the exercise of their functions also do not behave improperly.  Our interest in the allegations made here in the House is solely directed towards these particular allegations in so far as they affect Deputies or Senators in their conduct as public representatives, and Ministers in regard to their Ministerial functions.  However, in a desire to make the terms of reference of the tribunal as wide as we possibly could, without going against that principle, we are prepared to add to my motion as it stands the amendment which has been circulated in the name of the Tánaiste.  It is in the name of the Tánaiste because, apparently, I could not move the amended motion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of reference, therefore, are to inquire into the allegations made here during the debates on three indicated days, to find out what are the facts with regard to all these allegations and to find out to what extent, if any, Ministers have had any connection <Col N="1340" /> with the matter or, as in the amendment in the name of the Tánaiste, there has been any failure of duty or improper use of their powers by Ministers, or, in so far as members of the Dáil or Seanad are concerned, anything has occurred that would be improper action by such a member.  I do not think it is necessary for me to go over the ground again, and, in fact, I think it would be improper to do so. We have discussed this matter.  Allegations have been made, and, quite irrespective of the fact that, as I have already pointed out, we do not admit that any case had been made for the suggestions put forward, we are prepared to have this tribunal.</P>

At any rate, the debate would cover the motion and the two amendments on the Order Paper, and if the House does not wish to have the suggested words added to the motion, they can be put as an amendment when amendments Nos. 1 and 2 have been disposed of.  The whole matter, however, is open for discussion, and I appeal to the House to deal strictly with the motion as to whether or not this tribunal should be set up and not to widen it into a debate of the nature&mdash;which I deeply regret and which perhaps some Deputies regret&mdash; of the debate we had on the last occasion.

      <P>I beg to move the amendment standing in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;say&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;all the facts and circumstances connected with and surrounding any proposal made or attempted to be made at any time since the 1st January, 1946, either to buy or to sell Locke's Distillery, Kilbeggan, or any part of the property or business thereof.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The motion as it is drawn is so restrictive as to stifle inquiry.  It asks that a tribunal be set up to inquire into definite matters of urgent public importance, that is to say the allegations affecting members of either House of the Oireachtas made in Dáil Éireann on certain dates.  The inquiry then is intended to be restricted to an examination into allegations made here on certain dates and enshrined in the debates of Dáil Éireann.  As it stands, the motion contemplates that a number of judges can be got willingly to agree to sit on a tribunal, to take the Dáil debates of the 22nd, 29th and 30th October, find therein allegations against members of either House of the Oireachtas and to carry out an investigation into all the facts concerning these allegations.  That is the motion in the form in which the Taoiseach has put it down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see what extension of that inquiry is implied in the amendment which the Taoiseach has put down in the name of the Tánaiste.  When he was speaking just now, the Taoiseach said that: &ldquo;We are to see&rdquo;&mdash;whoever &ldquo;we&rdquo; are&mdash;&ldquo;that members of the Oireachtas do not behave improperly in their actions as such and that Ministers in the exercise of their functions also do not behave improperly&rdquo;.  This House is asked to pass a resolution that three judges shall be found&mdash;there being no power on the part of the Government to require a judge to sit on that inquiry&mdash;who will voluntarily sit on the tribunal to inquire whether members of the Oireachtas as such have behaved improperly in the exercise of <Col N="1344" /> their power or whether Ministers in the exercise of their functions have behaved improperly either.  We had here last week a motion to set up a select committee to inquire into all the facts and circumstances related to the sale of Locke's Distillery.  I pointed out in connection with that motion that it was fully provided for under Standing Order No. 67 which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Dáil may, on motion made after notice, appoint a select committee to consider, and if so permitted, to take evidence upon any Bill or matter, and to report its opinion for the information and assistance of the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That motion was opposed and defeated by the Government on a certain number of grounds, the first being that it objected to a select committee consisting of members of the Dáil inquiring into all the circumstances surrounding the proposed sale of Locke's Distillery, circumstances which were connected with such facts as the Minister for Justice detailed when he made his statement on the 22nd October.  The Government indicated that the Dáil was not a suitable place, particularly after the discussion that had taken place last week, to go into any matter like that, especially when Ministers or Departments or members of the Oireachtas had been involved in them.  Why was the Dáil dealt this blow, as regards its functions, its decisions and its privileges, when we are asked to-day to look for three judges who will voluntarily sit on a tribunal to carry out a task which members of the Oireachtas should be asked to perform&mdash;to find out if there are any Deputies who behaved improperly and also if there are any Ministers who, in the exercise of their functions, did not behave properly? Surely an inquiry consisting of members of the Oireachtas is the only, or is certainly the outstanding, body that should be appointed to try this matter? That may be an aspect of the matter that may be declared to be outside this discussion, but what I want to develop is that, even if it were part of the normal functions of judges or that they could be required by statute to perform the duty of sitting on such an <Col N="1345" /> inquiry, it is a scandalous treatment of Parliament to suggest that a group of judges should be set up in this way to inquire whether members of the Oireachtas had behaved improperly or whether Ministers in the discharge of their duties also had behaved improperly. A Joint Committee of both Houses is the proper body to examine to what extent and in what circumstances &ldquo;members of the Oireachtas as such have behaved improperly or Ministers have behaved improperly in the discharge of their functions as Ministers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Taoiseach to discuss that aspect of the matter.  I give him his own very words.  He uses these words in relation to a motion to set up the tribunal which he proposes now. I think I could nearly leave the matter there but in view of the way in which the Taoiseach has traversed the allegations in the discussion here on the 29th and 30th October, it is worth while challenging the Taoiseach as to what he meant when he discussed these allegations here.  The Taoiseach himself traversed the allegations that were supposed to have been made here when he pointed out that the first person attacked was the President.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know what the three judges will be invited to discuss.  Are we in the position that we have to blindfold ourselves in relation to the discussions that already have taken place here lest common intelligence might tell us that the passage of this motion is a thing that ought not to take place?  I want <Col N="1346" /> to know from the Taoiseach what he wants the tribunal to discuss, or what he has in mind that the tribunal will discuss, because he has wiped all the allegations out here.  He says the first person attacked was the President, and he wiped out that, although everybody here pointed out to him that there was no allegation made against the President. Then he came to an allegation made against himself.  I am not aware of any allegation made against himself. Then he came to the allegation made against the Minister for Justice. That allegation was that the Minister was mixed up with somebody in connection with the export of cloth.  I think everybody wiped that out.  The fourth allegation, according to the Taoiseach, was against the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>According to the Taoiseach, there was a statement published in the Press by a person prominently associated with the commercial life of Dublin and the organised manufacturers of the country, saying that when he was interested in the purchase of this business, there were certain facilities available for the export of whiskey but, until the discussion took place here last week, he was not aware of any increased facilities for the export of whiskey that might have been available. The fifth allegation that the Taoiseach finds is an allegation against Senator Quirke.</P>
      <P>These were the five areas of allegation or charge that the Taoiseach found in the discussions that took place. Assuming there are these areas to be examined&mdash;and I think the Taoiseach developed some of these areas himself, rather than anybody else in the House &mdash;does the Taoiseach mean that there are no areas outside them to be examined, and that, whereas it appears to the public mind that a certain number of people who are most mixed up in the development of this purchase as a shady business have been cleared out of the country by a Government Order, that aspect is not to be open for examination at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move my amendment in order to make sure that every fact concerning <Col N="1347" /> the recent happenings in connection with the proposed sale of Locke's Distillery should be examined.  These, from the description of the Minister for Justice, are highly colourful, and are colourful in a most unsavoury way. That is the first reason why I press my amendment.  Secondly, I press it in direct resistance to the Taoiseach's understanding of his motion, that this is to be an inquiry into whether members of the Oireachtas have behaved improperly, or whether Ministers in the discharge of their functions have behaved improperly.</P>
    <P>The circumstance in which we find ourselves, both in this Parliament and in the country, should make us realise that there are very serious problems that will require the unity and the support of the people, with full confidence in their institutions.  All the circumstances that surround the sale of Locke's Distillery must be investigated. It is of the utmost public importance, in the present circumstances, that there should be the fullest possible inquiry into the whole business.</P>
    <P>The proposal to have an inquiry was put forward in a clear and temperate way on Wednesday last, but the Government thought fit to muddy the waters of thought and discussion, with the result that the debate that they themselves believed would be finished in 2½ hours, and subsequently agreed might take 3½ hours, ran into a considerably longer period, and that debate is being extended to-day as a matter of urgent public importance.</P>
    <P>Surely the Taoiseach realises that, whatever might have been said or felt with regard to this matter, the fullest possible inquiry into every aspect of it is now necessary.  If he is moving the inquiry from the hands of people whom he thought on Wednesday last were just a slander factory, if he is succeeding, by the defeat of the motion last week, in taking this inquiry out of the hands of the slander factory, if he is succeeding, by his majority here and by his influence with the judiciary, in getting three or four judges to discuss this matter in a fact-finding spirit, he ought, in the public interest, in the interest of the Ministry and Parliament <Col N="1348" /> generally, open the task of these judges in the widest possible way so that when the inquiry is finished, whatever we may think of the manner in which the matter has been dealt with by the Government in taking it out of the hands of the Oireachtas, and whatever people may be left who will suggest that something has been hidden and that facts have been left undisclosed, there will at least be a number who will be able to say: &ldquo;Three judges have looked into this particular matter; there was nothing surrounding the case that they had not power to inquire into&rdquo;.  Give some section of the people the chance of saying that, even if they are only supporters of the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton indicated&mdash;and so did Deputy Costello&mdash;that from tradition and from experience of the general functions that type of machine would have, a judicial inquiry was not a body that could find out even the facts, because it would have no training or general function in acting as the aggressor, if not the prosecutor, in finding out facts, and they suggested that the judges would be put into a position that they did not normally occupy and, in fact, that they would be powerless to occupy.  The Taoiseach went over a number of inquiries that were held and he read extracts from the findings and endeavoured to paint all these reports as complete exculpations. The exculpation of the people who have been involved in an unsavoury way in this attempt to get possession of Locke's Distillery, an exculpation brought out by unsatisfactory machinery and after a restricted inquiry, is going to have a very disastrous effect on public opinion and on public confidence in our institutions here.  I submit very earnestly to members of the Dáil that to support the Taoiseach's motion, even amended as the Taoiseach would have it amended, would be a very great disaster to public opinion and to the public life of this country at the present time.</P>

      <P>I regard the amendment standing in my name as being substantially the same as that in the name of the Leader of the Opposition.  The case for this motion by the Taoiseach is that, inasmuch as the conduct of persons other than persons who are members of the Oireachtas may be impugned, a Parliamentary committee would be unsuitable and three judges should be provided.  That was his case when opposing the motion of the Leader of the Opposition last week. Now he proceeds to justify his own motion and he says: &ldquo;The terms of my new motion are so drawn as to guarantee that this commission of three judges will not inquire into the activities of anybody who is not a member of Oireachtas Éireann.&rdquo;  Is not that so.</P>

      <P>Well, two and two make three and 31/32nds, of course, to the Taoiseach, but to the simple it makes four.  That was the argument last week. Now the argument is different.  Of course, the boys beyond&mdash;they all turn when Pop turns.  I have no objection to a tribunal with three judges.  Any tribunal which will clean up this mess is acceptable to me and three High Court judges, given the proper facilities and terms of reference, will probably clean it up just as well as a Parliamentary committee.  I want to remind the House that, though we here in Dáil Éireann are bound by no precedents, whether they be drawn from the Congress of the United States or the House of Commons in Great Britain or the Chamber of Deputies in France, we would be fools not to look to these more experienced legislatures for advice by their procedure&mdash;and, of course, we habitually do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only last week, the British House of <Col N="1350" /> Commons had to question the conduct of two of their members and of a number of outside persons and the whole matter was dealt with by the Committee of Procedure and Privileges, before whom the members themselves were summoned and before whom the outside persons were summoned.  When the findings were made and reported to the Parliament, the British House of Commons first dealt with its own members by expelling one and publicly reprimanding the other, and then called to the Bar of their House the outside persons and heard from those outside persons what retribution they were prepared to make, and until they had made ample retribution, the House reserved its decision as to whether they would impose a punishment or not. But, of course, that procedure does not commend itself to the Taoiseach of this House, the implication being that he does not believe that Deputies of this House would do their duty conscientiously. Though the Leader of a Socialist Party in Great Britain cheerfully accepts the verdict of the Committee of Procedure and Privileges of the House of Commons and of the House itself, freely given, without the Whips being on, our Taoiseach, the Leader of our House, publishes to the world that he would not trust the elected representatives of our people to do justice.  The Leader of a Socialist Party in Great Britain is prepared to admit that the most unreconstructed Tory, where it is a matter of the honour of the House of Commons or of his own Legislature that is in question, may be depended upon to act fairly, no matter from what source the defendant may be arraigned.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's motion to-day proposes to &ldquo;refer certain matters&rdquo;&mdash;and I ask the House to note these words&mdash;&ldquo;to a tribunal of three judges&rdquo;; and the Taoiseach's motion, as it first appeared, manifestly restricts the terms of reference in such a way as to make absolutely sure that the three judges will not be allowed to examine the real evils in connection with this transaction at all.  The Leader of the Opposition puts down an amendment to give the judges terms of reference which would permit them to inquire into the real evils and I put down an amendment to <Col N="1351" /> the same end.  The Taoiseach, being a skilful old campaigner, recognises that his first bluff has been called and accordingly he applies his subtle mind to the drafting of an amendment, which is to be moved by the Tánaiste, and that amendment reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To add at the end of the motion the words `and any other facts or circumstances connected with such disposal or proposed disposal...'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, it was confidently anticipated that the majority of people picking up that amendment&mdash;which was handed to us after the House had sat&mdash;on getting thus far would say to themselves: &ldquo;Oh, the Government have accepted the Leader of the Opposition's amendment and Deputy Dillon's and there need be no discussion about it.&rdquo;  I certainly have not been sitting for the past 15 years in front of the Taoiseach in order to fall into that trap.  Two and two never make four for the Taoiseach. Always look for the nigger in the woodpile, because his amendment does not stop where I stopped; it goes further:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and any other facts or circumstances connected with such disposal or proposed disposal which, by reason of the exercise or non-exercise, in relation to them, of any Governmental or Ministerial function, are, in the opinion of the tribunal, of public importance.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach's motion, coupled with the Tánaiste's amendment, forbids the judges ever to allow the name of Sachael to be uttered in their court.  At no stage did Sachael make contact with the Minister or with a Governmental Department.  Nothing he did, nothing he failed to do, can be examined within these terms of reference.  I have no knowledge that Sweeney ever contacted the Minister or a Department of State.  If he did not, nothing he ever did or said or failed to do or say can ever be mentioned in the court of these judges. I have no knowledge that Mrs. Chappell ever met the Minister or visited a Department of State.  If she did not, nothing Mrs. Chappell said or did or failed to say or do can ever be mentioned in this court.  I have no knowledge that Miss Donnico ever met a Minister or visited a Department of State.  If she did not, nothing she ever did or said or failed to do or say can ever be mentioned in this court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What shocks me is this: when this House assembled on this day week to discuss the motion put down by the Leader of the Opposition, I assumed&mdash; it never occurred to me to doubt&mdash;that the head of the Government and his colleagues would be just as dismayed and disgusted by the established and admitted facts as we were.  I found it very hard to persuade myself as the discussion went on that our own Government was trying to cover things up.  This is what to me is perhaps the most unpleasant aspect of this and it was absolutely absent from my mind on this day week.  I had mentioned or discussed the instances which were published in the Press with no member of this House, no matter from what side he came, who did not express consternation, not at the allegations made here, but at the facts as they knew them from their own perusal of the public Press.  I cannot understand what is in the Taoiseach's mind.  I do not believe, and nothing would ever make me believe, that the Taoiseach does not deplore just as much as I do the series of events which permitted the President to be exploited in the way he was unconsciously exploited into suffering outsiders to use the <Col N="1353" /> prestige of his office and of his house for their own ulterior motives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the terms of reference of this commission shown by the Government are to be restricted within a narrow ambit in order to prevent the commission from inquiring into the facts of the matter, surely a ruling will not come from the Chair that Deputies cannot protest against it and explain why they put down an amendment to widen the terms of reference.  That is the case that I am making.  I stand over every word I said and apologise to nobody for what I said last Wednesday. Had I to do it again, I would use the same words, the same occasion and the same medium for exposing what appeared to me to be a disgusting scandal.  I am now asking this House to ensure that whatever body they set up to inquire into the facts will have the power to inquire.  I say that, without the amendment put down by the Leader of the Opposition or myself, it will not have that power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want something more, however, than that the judges should have sufficient power to inquire.  I want a representative, not of one Party or of <Col N="1354" /> one section of this House, but of Dáil Éireann, to be present in the court to elicit the facts.  It is an old device, when grave matters are brought before this House, for the Government to set up a tribunal and say: &ldquo;There it is now, let the facts be proved.&rdquo;  But there is nobody present before that tribunal to elicit by examination from those brought before it what the truth is.</P>
    <P>I want such a person.  If this inquiry were conducted by a Committee of this House, it would be open to each member of that Committee to address to the witness before it whatever queries he personally thought were pertinent, within the terms of reference, which would be controlled and directed by the chairman of the Committee.  Within the terms of reference, each Deputy on the Committee could pursue his inquiries with the witness before him so far as he thought necessary.  But, before a tribunal of judges, a completely different situation obtains.  The judges are there to hear what evidence is brought before them.  They are judges, not advocates, and their judicial task is to listen to whatever evidence is laid before the court and, on that evidence, to make a finding.  They may believe, from the general tenor of the proceedings which have taken place in their court, that such and such a thing is the real truth but, when they come to examine the corpus of evidence which has been adduced before them, they will say: &ldquo;We cannot found a finding, to be reported to Dáil Éireann, on our suspicions; when we write down our finding, it must be firmly founded on the sworn testimony which was given before us&rdquo;.  Who is to be present in court to ensure not only that the truth will be told, not only that nothing but the truth will be told but that all the truth will be told by everybody?</P>
    <P>This tribunal will be a fraud, if it has not available to it the machinery to get all the truth.  I have seen a photostat copy of an offer made to sell the whiskey out of this distillery on the black market in Great Britain.  That can be produced.  I believe it is one fraudulent offer amidst many fraudulent offers, but the people who sought <Col N="1355" /> it, and the people who came to this country to seek it, and their kind ought to be fixed with notice by an effective tribunal that people who, by our leave, are admitted as visitors will not treat this country as though it were a banana republic where everything goes if you are prepared to pay for it.  I want to make the insolent crooks who came in here from abroad realise that, if they have left any of their brethren behind them, we have the machinery and the will to lock them up for their own and their country's good, so long as we think right and that there will be no influence used and no protection provided.  It makes me sick to think that crawling things out of the international underworld would ever dare to imagine that they can make their slimy way into this country and here conduct themselves as they might in a banana republic where the rule of law is but a word.  It is time we fixed them with notice by an effective tribunal that they, and all those who consort with them, will be unmasked and made bitterly regret the day they suffered the idea to enter their mind that that kind of conduct would be tolerated for a single moment by the Government of this country.</P>
    <P>That problem will find me in opposition to very few but our reputation before the crooks of the world is a matter of trivial importance.  The independence of this Parliament, however, is the difference between freedom and slavery for the humblest creature in the land.  There will be cynics who sneer, the kind of vermin that infest the body politic of every country, the cheap skates who enjoy all the privileges of democratic freedom but sneer at them and hold themselves out as being persons too superior to care, who look upon parliaments as talking shops and politicians as an inferior race.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot prevent the Chair making me sit down.  I am dealing with the proposal of the Tánaiste on the Order Paper&mdash;that and nothing else.  I am alleging against it that he seeks to destroy the Parliamentary immunity of a Deputy of this House who did what he conceived to be his duty.  I am saying, and I submit to you, Sir, that I am entitled in defence of Parliament to say, that when the Taoiseach's motion reads that this inquiry is to inquire &ldquo;into the following definite matters of urgent public importance, that is to say, the allegations affecting...&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;allegations&rdquo;&mdash; this commission is not to inquire into the fact that criminals sat in the President's drawingroom.  It is to inquire as to why a Deputy of this House dared to say so.  Will the Chair now let me make my answer to that?  I will answer to no tribunal set up in this country or outside it for anything I say in Parliament. I know there are cheap traitors to the principle of democracy who would misrepresent that statement as suggesting that I would recoil from repeating before a tribunal on oath every syllable I have uttered here. They need not worry.  I will repeat here or anywhere, where proper inquiry falls to be made on oath, every syllable I have uttered here but I will do it because I choose to do it.  But there is no court, there is no tribunal, and there is no power in this land that can compel me to answer for any act or word of mine uttered in Dáil Éireann in the discharge of my public duty.  If any tribunal or anybody seeks to enforce such a claim against me I will reject it in the confident knowledge that I will have no more resourceful protector in defence of that fundamental right than the Ceann Comhairle of this House, and I will protect it in so far as within me lies in the person of Deputy Flanagan or the person of any other Deputy of this House where those who hate that privilege, where those who resent that independence, would seek to destroy it.  There will be no judicial murder of reputations done in this country, and do not let anybody try.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1359" /> When the matters relating to this business of Locke's Distillery came before this House at first the gravest, to my way of thinking, was the reflection that had been cast upon the President's household.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had that twice already and the Deputy should not refer to it any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to refer to it any more, Sir.  When the debate proceeded, to my horror and consternation, other facts emerged, mainly in the speech of the Tánaiste, which will call for examination.  I exhort the House, without regard to Party or to anything else, to combine one with another in a declaration that they want this tribunal to have the widest possible powers of reference and that we confidently leave it in the hands of the three judicial commissioners whom we appoint to limit the scope of the inquiry to what they think necessary in order to clear up the evil that has been done and now exists.  I want our people to have an assurance that we are prepared to do that.  I do not care what anyone outside this country thinks of us or does not think of us so long as we ourselves know that we are right.  But I want our own people to know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want our own people to have an assurance to-morrow morning that Deputies on both sides of this House are united in an effort to institute an inquiry designed to ensure that no wrongdoing will go unmasked and that no innocent person will remain unjustly aspersed.  So far as I am concerned, give me a commission of three High Court judges, or any three judges in this country, charged with that task but left with the virtual right to fix their own terms of reference in order to attain that end and I will accept it, whether it comes from the Taoiseach or the Leader of the Opposition or anyone else.  I for my part now volunteer to give that commission all the help I can and all the knowledge I possess.  To date every syllable is in the hands of the Minister for Justice.  I insisted on his receiving it.  This silly little man, the Minister for Local Government, in violation of the most elementary decencies <Col N="1360" /> of personal honour, betraying the confidence of his own colleague, burst into the room of the Minister for Justice on last Thursday or last Wednesday when, in the discharge of my public duty, I had occasion to interview him on business.  This silly meanminded little man jumped to the conclusion that I had gone there to unburden my soul about the Locke Distillery case on the eve of the debate. Had he been right he would have gloried in that base betrayal of a colleague's confidence and of a decent man's honour.  But, having prostituted his personal honour, he did not even get his price for his presumption was wrong, and he not only disgraced himself in the eyes of honourable men but made a fool of himself in the eyes of the meanest member of his own Party. If that be the standard of decency that obtains in the Executive Council, God grant that that Executive Council may not long endure.</P>
    <P>I want nothing but the vindication of those entitled to vindication and the exposure of those who have betrayed their colleagues or who, coming here from abroad, dare to imagine that they can carry their dirty, crooked practices with them.  I want these proceedings to be a standing notice to the international crooks of the world that they come here at their peril.  I want these proceedings to be a reassurance to our own people, no matter what opinions may divide them, that the honour of our own people and the honour of our country are equally dear to all.  I hope and pray that the Government will see its way to taking whatever steps they deem expedient&mdash;even a new motion if they cannot accept mine or the Leader of the Opposition's amendment &mdash;which would give to the tribunal the discretion I want it to have so that our people can once again lift up their heads and look at their own representatives, unworthy as they are, and say: &ldquo;At least, they are honest men.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>All the sound and fury we have just heard from Deputy Dillon and Deputy Mulcahy's simulated interest in the prestige of our public institutions <Col N="1361" /> are designed to conceal the fact that these Deputies are now running away from the allegations which were made here last week.  Allegations were made. The Government now proposes to establish a judicial tribunal to investigate these allegations.  Why do Deputies Mulcahy and Dillon not want these allegations investigated?  They are moving now to delete from the motion all references to the allegations. Why?</P>
      <P>I described Deputy Mulcahy's motion last week as political blackmail.  Everybody knows the weakness of a Government when allegations are made against the personal honour and integrity of its members.  Allegations can be made by Deputies who are notoriously reckless in their utterances and by Deputies who are inspired by malice.  A Government faced with such allegations is in normal circumstances unable to refuse a public inquiry into them because such a refusal would be misrepresented by political opponents as evidence of the fact that there is something to conceal.  In this particular case allegations were made by a Deputy who is notoriously reckless and Deputy Mulcahy made clear to-day the fact that he is not standing behind these allegations; but he still wants an inquiry.</P>

I said that Deputy Mulcahy's motion was political blackmail and it is quite obvious that the process of blackmailing has not <Col N="1363" /> stopped.

      <P>Allegations were made which affect a member of the Oireachtas and which appeared to <Col N="1364" /> imply, or appeared to suggest that in the conduct of public affairs the Government was remiss, if not actually corrupt.  We are told now that these allegations do not matter; they are of so little importance that the tribunal need not be asked to inquire into them; but that there is some other evil, some other thing, to be investigated, the nature of which will not be disclosed to us.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can, of course, continue this blackmailing process indefinitely.  Every man is sensitive about his honour.  Every Government would be sensitive about its reputation and when Deputies, by insinuation, imply that their reputations have been besmirched or that their characters have been impugned, they will be concerned naturally to afford every possible opportunity to themselves to vindicate their reputation and their characters.  But we cannot keep up with Deputy Dillon's capacity to slander.  We will have to stop some time.  In this particular case allegations were made.  Every Deputy in this House knows now that there was no foundation for these allegations. Deputy Dillon tells us the name Sachael will not be mentioned at this tribunal if these terms of reference are mentioned. Was it not alleged here that this Sachael was a friend of the Minister for Justice and because he was a friend of the Minister for Justice got a licence to export 25,000 yards of cloth?  Was not that alleged?  Every Deputy knows there was no truth in either allegation but it was alleged here and is the Minister for Justice to be given no opportunity to prove that that was a slander, that the Deputy who made the allegation had no foundation for making it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other foreigners were mentioned here, some of whom I never heard of. Was it not alleged here by Deputy O'Higgins that these foreigners arrived in this country and within 24 hours after their arrival were able to get access to a Government Department and were given facilities there?  Was not that alleged?  Cannot that allegation be investigated?  If the investigation shows that these foreigners were <Col N="1365" /> never in a Government Department, is not it just as well to bring that out. But the allegation was made here and the suggestion that some attempt has been made in drawing these terms of reference to prevent any of these facts being inquired into by the tribunal is without any foundation of any kind.</P>
    <P>We have been deluged with a lot of insinuations and allegations against the Government in the course of the last week.  Deputy Dillon appears to think it strange that we resent it.  We do resent it.  No words in the English language could express the fullness of my contempt for Deputy Dillon.  We are asked to consider here, not a tribunal of judges to investigate these allegations, but a committee comprising of Deputy Dillon, and Deputy McGilligan and Deputy O'Higgins, and all the other men who hope to sweep into office in this country on a wave of slander.  Does anybody in this House believe, does anybody in this country believe, that a committee comprising of these men would give an impartial verdict on anything affecting the reputation of their political opponents?  Deputy Dillon referred us to what happened in the English House of Commons.  There is not a man in this Dáil who would believe that any of these three men I have mentioned or many other people on the benches opposite would give a fair and impartial verdict based upon the facts, if they thought that there was some political advantage to be got by besmirching their opponents.</P>

      <P>Although in that particular case there was a unanimous verdict throwing out completely the allegations that were made here and in relation to which the inquiry was held. There is no desire to limit the scope of this investigation but we must not allow the capacity of Deputies opposite to make allegations, or the resentment which the Government naturally feels because of them, to do something which is not in the public interest.</P>
      <P>I said here last week that this Dáil is entitled to inquire, or entitled to demand an inquiry, into any matter affecting a member of the Oireachtas, any public officer, any official, any person holding official position.  We are not entitled to inquire into the ordinary private business affairs of private citizens where no public interest arises. In this particular case certain property was offered for sale.  We are not concerned with the motives of the people who offered the property for sale or the possible interest which many people had in the purchase of that property. We are entitled to inquire only into the suggestion that in connection with the sale of that property, or the attempted purchase of that property there was on the part of public men or public officials something which represented abuse. If that suggestion is made, the inquiry can cover it.  I submit that we are not entitled to go beyond that.  As Deputies opposite, however, are anxious to extend the scope of their muck&mdash;raking beyond the actual allegations made here, the Government is prepared to oblige them and therefore I am moving this amendment to the original motion which refers to the allegations made here and which asks the tribunal to go further than these allegations&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to add at the end of the motion the words `and any other facts or circumstances connected with such disposal or proposed disposal which, by reason of the exercise or non-exercise, in relation to them, of any Governmental or Ministerial function, are in the opinion of the tribunal, of public importance'.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is not that wide enough?  The tribunal can inquire fully into the allegations <Col N="1367" /> which were made.  We know that you are running away from these allegations now but may I say that you cannot dispose of them merely by running away from them?  They have been made.  They are on the record of the Dáil and they will be inquired into. Any Deputy can refuse to go to the inquiry.  Any Deputy can refuse to give evidence at the inquiry.  Let there be no doubt about your legal rights. Deputy Flanagan or Deputy O'Higgins or Deputy Dillon and all the rest of them can, if they will, refuse to help the tribunal, can refuse to give evidence there, can refuse to answer any questions that are asked of them there.  Their Constitutional privileges will be protected.  But the tribunal will be investigating these allegations and presumably its reports will be based, not merely upon the information that will be made available to them by the Government, but also on the basis of what evidence is produced by these Deputies or others to show that there was any foundation whatever for their allegations.  There is, of course, another consideration which, perhaps, is not absent from the mind of Deputy Mulcahy or Deputy Dillon.  An investigation by a committee of the Dáil will be a slow business.  It will take a long time.  The last time we had one it took a year before the report was presented.  A judicial committee can report in the course of a few weeks. Have these Deputies any particular interest to serve by delaying the result of this investigation?  Nobody will seriously believe their contention that a committee consisting of Deputies Dillon, O'Higgins, Mulcahy, McGilligan and others would be a more impartial tribunal than one consisting of three High Court judges, but it will be a slower body and perhaps their main interest in having such a body as that is that it will not be able to report for a long while.</P>
    <P>Of course, Deputy Dillon's speech may have another motive.  We know that when allegations were made here before and investigated by judicial tribunals, and were shown by these judicial tribunals to have been completely <Col N="1368" /> baseless, that did not stop them.  Deputy Dillon made allegations here before and there was a tribunal to inquire into his allegations.  He did not refuse to go before that tribunal. He just went to the tribunal and told it that he had no basis whatever for the allegations that he had made here. His allegations were shown to be completely groundless by the evidence produced and by the verdict and report of the tribunal, but that has not stopped it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon's speech to-day had the tactical purpose of putting himself in the position of being able to question the verdict of this tribunal. If the Deputies understood the extent to which they have nauseated their own supporters in the country by their tactics here they would realise that a change of method might be more advantageous to them. However, allegations have been made here of a vague and general kind. These allegations are going to be inquired into.  We propose, however, in order to meet whatever point is in Deputy Mulcahy's amendment, and because a blackmailing process compels us to do so, to extend the scope of that inquiry to cover not merely these allegations: not merely the suggestion that members of the Oireachtas have had transactions in connection with the disposal of this <Col N="1369" /> distillery, but also any other facts and circumstances connected with the disposal of the distillery which, by reason of the exercise or non-exercise of any Governmental or Ministerial functions, are of public importance.  Nobody can suggest that a tribunal of that character is not being given ample scope to investigate fully what is of public importance and to report on it.  We suggest that it should not go beyond that: that if we are going to have private individuals and private citizens brought into the glare of publicity merely because the reputations of public men have been besmirched by their opponents you would be creating a precedent which would be thoroughly undesirable, and one which would have reactions upon the conduct of business here which would be very widespread.</P>
      <P>I submit that Deputy Mulcahy is asking for too much when he proposes an inquiry which would cover facts and circumstances which have no relation to public men, which have no relation to the performance of public duties and which have no relation to the exercise of any Governmental or Ministerial function.  These things we can inquire into and these things are going to be inquired into, and the inquiry under the motion and the amendment is more than ample to bring out anything that requires investigation.  It certainly will enable the tribunal to deal fully with all the allegations made in connection with this transaction.  It will enable it to investigate fully everything that is implied in Deputy Dillon's suggestion&mdash; that there is some other evil which has not yet appeared, and which is related to these allegations.  It is giving to the tribunal the opportunity of excluding from its inquiry anything which appears to the tribunal to have no public importance. I submit that that is a reasonable limit on the power to give the tribunal.  If they think that any of the other matters that I referred to &mdash;the circumstances which led to the sale of the distillery or the possible interest of other people in purchasing it&mdash;have any public importance they can deal with them, but if they are not of public importance then there is that limit on the inquiry.  We think that is a reasonable limit to put on the scope of the inquiry.</P>

      <P>With regard to the subject matter before us, the Tánaiste in a previous speech here made certain statements.

      <P>It is not my intention to deal with them.  I am just pointing out to the House the great change of face that has occurred this evening when the Tanaiste informed the House that any Deputy need not go before the tribunal, while a few days ago he was challenging anybody who dared to speak or, at least, pointing out the unpleasant consequences that might arise if they were not in a position to prove some of their statements.</P>
      <P>I want to make my position perfectly clear.  If I choose to make a statement in this House, I will answer to no tribunal other than a committee of this House for that statement; I will answer only to my electors, the people of my constituency who elected me.  I advise every Deputy to maintain and preserve that right, just as I am determined to maintain and preserve it.  If there is a select committee of this House set up to examine into the statements or the action of members of this House, I will certainly go before them.  But I certainly will not go before, or I will not feel myself bound to go before, an outside tribunal. I will go just as I please.  For any statement I make here the people who elected me are to be my judges and nobody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion by the Taoiseach at first glance seems to be, not a motion to inquire <Col N="1372" /> into the circumstances surrounding the sale of this distillery in Kilbeggan, but a motion, in my opinion, to try a certain member of this House, or at least to intimidate him from making charges.  I should like to say that I am sorry the motion for a select committee of the House was defeated because I favoured that.  Next to that, I certainly favour the motion as it stands with Deputy Mulcahy's amendment, because I hold that the whole question should be inquired into.  I am perfectly at sea with regard to a lot of it.  A good many things were stated. There was mention of a watch.  It was admitted by every speaker that nobody believed a word of that.  In my opinion, a great many other things want clearing up.  It is a good thing that some tribunal should inquire into the matter.  As I said, I favour a committee of the House.  As that has gone overboard, I favour the motion in the name of the Taoiseach with the amendment in the name of Deputy Mulcahy.</P>

The more he thunders and blunders and pounds the desk, the more certain you can be that he has a very bad case. Let us forget all that thunder and misrepresentation and the cheap jibes we had from the Minister.  I want to put this question to the Taoiseach and to the Tánaiste: why are they afraid to give three judges power to inquire into all the facts surrounding this matter? The net issue for the House and for the country is whether this tribunal is to be given power to inquire into all the facts or into part of the facts only. The difference between Deputy Mulcahy's amendment and the Taoiseach's motion, even with the Tánaiste's amendment added to it, is this: if Deputy Mulcahy's amendment is carried, the tribunal appointed by this House will be permitted to examine all the facts.  If Deputy Mulcahy's amendment and Deputy Dillon's amendment are both rejected by this House, the judges appointed on this tribunal will be allowed to examine into some of the facts only.  Why?  I <Col N="1373" /> want to say bluntly that if this House turns down the amendment, which seeks only to give the judges the power, if they so desire, to inquire into the full facts in regard to Locke's Distillery, in favour of the straitjacket&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Taoiseach can only function in a very large station where there are a great many side lines that he can go up and down now and again when it suits him to get off the main <Col N="1374" /> track.  The Taoiseach is trying to put the House off the main track now.  The issue is a simple one, and all the talk of the Taoiseach and all the bluster of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to which we have listened, and all the bluster to which I am afraid we will have to listen when the Minister for Local Government gets on his feet, do not wipe out this simple issue that anybody can understand.  Is there any reason why a tribunal being set up and three judges taken away from their ordinary duties, we should refuse to give them the machinery to examine into all the facts?  I say that under this motion of the Taoiseach this can be only a white-washing tribunal.  I say that they cannot find the facts.  I say, further, that this motion is framed deliberately to prevent them from examining into all the issues and from finding all the facts.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce tried to make great play with his cheap jibes about the allegations.  Will the Taoiseach accept, or will the Minister for Industry and Commerce accept Deputy Mulcahy's amendment if the allegations are included?</P>

      <P>I know that, but I want to call his bluff.  If we put it down in black and white, will he accept it?  Of course he will not.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce still believes that he can fool this House with his little petty playacting here as he fooled the country for so long.  In passing, I should like to know if the Taoiseach is in a position to tell us whether he has secured the services of three judges, and, if so, who they are?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce started his speech by talking about a campaign of slander and he uttered against members of this House, and very distinguished members of this House, as dirty a slander as I ever heard uttered in this House.  He made a statement which not only was not true, but which he knew when he was making it was not true, which he does not believe himself.  He tried to convey to the House and to the country <Col N="1375" /> that the committee of the House which was talked about would be a committee composed entirely of people in opposition. That is not so.  On any committee set up by this House the Government has a majority.  I would be just as entitled to say that we could not get a straight verdict or an impartial verdict from, say, Deputy MacEntee, Minister for Local Government, if he were a member of the committee. Most people in this House, and indeed a few people outside, know what I think about the Minister for Local Government; but I believe that if that Minister were a member of a committee dealing with an important matter like this, in which people's personal honour and reputations are at stake, he would be as impartial as any man could be, and I would say that there is no person whose name has been dragged into this matter who would not get an absolutely fair and impartial hearing from any member of the House sitting on any side of the House.  It is not doing any service to the Tánaiste's case and certainly not doing service to the House to state here emphatically, and to repeat for the purpose of giving emphasis to it, that some of the leading men in this Parliament are entirely bereft of any sense of honour, decency or fair play.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was concerned, and rightly concerned, about filthy slanders. The amazing thing about the Taoiseach is that he is never concerned about slanders which issue from his own side of the House.  I do not want to go over all, or indeed any, of the ground which was covered last week, nor do I want to prolong the debate one minute longer, but I do want to say emphatically that, whatever the Taoiseach or his colleagues in the Ministry may think, if he insists on putting this motion of his through, without either of the amendments, if he insists upon hamstringing the judicial commission before it sits, unfortunately it will not matter in the eyes of the public what verdict they bring in.  If they bring in a verdict completely exonerating all the people whose names have been mentioned, it will not be believed in this country and that is not fair to the parties whose <Col N="1376" /> names have been mentioned, whether they are members of the Oireachtas or people outside.  Let me finish by saying this again: The issue to be decided by this House is quite simple.  There need be no confusion between the motion and the amendments.  The only issue to be decided is whether this judicial tribunal is to be given the power and the authority to inquire into all the facts, or only into some of the facts.</P>

      <P>One thing which emerges from the discussions of last week and to-day is that whoever purchases Locke's Distillery should be very grateful to this House for the advertisement it has received over the past few days.  With regard to the motion by the Taoiseach, there is not such a very wide difference between it and the amendment tabled by the Opposition, and I think that, in order to bring the discussion to an end so that we may get down to business of perhaps more importance to the nation, it would be possible to meet both the Government and the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach is of the opinion that the Opposition Deputies who referred to the sale of Locke's Distillery and the circumstances surrounding it are not desirous of having their allegations inquired into.  I feel that that is not the position.  What seems to be troubling the mind of the Opposition&mdash; and the Taoiseach must be aware of it from the case they have made&mdash;is their anxiety that not only the Deputies who made the allegations in this House should be brought before the tribunal, but everybody else who is supposed to be connected with the sale or the circumstances leading up to the sale of this distillery.  I cannot understand why the Government should be opposed to the people who have been mentioned here by Deputies, such as Mr. Sweeney and others, coming before the tribunal. If these people are in the country and if it is possible to have them brought before this tribunal to give evidence and to be questioned, I cannot see what would be wrong with it.  It would, in fact, help to satisfy not merely the House but the people outside.  It is the people outside who are anxious to <Col N="1377" /> know whether the things alleged to have happened have happened or not.</P>
    <P>One month ago yesterday, I entered Tipperary for the first time.  I was told the most astounding stories by very prominent citizens there.  These men were careful to ask me to treat the information as confidential and not to mention their names or refer to the matters in the House.  I did not refer to these matters here, although I was in possession of the information before Deputy Flanagan tabled his question which gave rise to all this discussion. For that reason alone, that citizens of that type who mentioned the sale and the circumstances of the sale of this distillery were of the opinion that there was something in it, it would be well that, in order to convince me and others to whom these gentlemen have spoken, we should have the broadest possible judicial tribunal.</P>
    <P>No doubt a lot has been said and many rumours have been spread which are not true, but there is the old saying: &ldquo;Where there is smoke, there is fire&rdquo;, and one can hardly understand why all this talk and all these rumours started, unless there is something at the back of them.  If the Taoiseach and his Government refuse to accept the amendment tabled by Deputy Mulcahy or Deputy Dillon, I will feel&mdash;and, as I say, I am one of the Deputies who did not take part in the debate, first, because I was asked to treat the information I received as confidential, and, secondly, because the gentleman who told me was not sure whether the information was genuine or not&mdash;that he is sheltering somebody, protecting somebody or some group of persons.  The Tánaiste says that the Opposition seek to cut out the whole of the motion from the word &ldquo;say&rdquo; and to substitute&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;all the facts and circumstances connected with and surrounding any proposal made or attempted to be made at any time since 1st January, 1946,&rdquo; etc.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach feels that that amendment will not cover Deputies in relation to their allegations here, let him follow it up with everything after the word &ldquo;say&rdquo; in his motion.  He then will have it in a nutshell and will please <Col N="1378" /> everybody.  It will not lead to the wasting of the time of the House and the judicial tribunal will be in a position to call on everybody and anybody whom they think should be called on, and who they believe will be of assistance in finding out anything connected with the improper disposal or sale of this concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I read, before coming into this House, the debates which took place here last week in relation to the other motion dealing with this subject.  I regret that a more fundamental and wider view was not taken by this House of the issues involved. I do not think that this inquiry, or a dozen inquiries of the kind, will serve as a remedy.  We have had inquiries before.  I think that this House should search for the fundamental cause for inquiries of this character and if we find the fundamental cause, I think the House should seek to limit the occasion of such inquiries.  I might suggest two alternatives or possibly cumulative causes for inquiries of this kind.  In times of war or stress in any country in the world Governments quite naturally have to take wide powers, powers which have to be administered by the Executive, by a Minister or by an appointee of his.  That is inevitable; it is bound to happen in the course of every war.  These powers are in themselves dangerous and destructive of democracy.  They are dangerous because they inevitably involve the granting or the withholding of licences and permits of one kind and another. These licences and permits very often involve vast financial interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have gone to the trouble of setting up a system of courts, a very fair and impartial system, to administer justice as between one citizen and another.  A citizen if he thinks he is wronged to the extent of 5/- or £5 by a fellow citizen can have his case decided by the courts, but when it comes to the question of the granting or the withholding of a licence by a Department of State, there is no safeguard. It is done behind closed doors. It is done by the bureaucrat behind his <Col N="1379" /> closed doors, his iron curtain.  As I have said, that is more or less inevitable in time of war, but when war or a period of emergency ends, there is always a difficulty in trying to wrest that power back from the bureaucrat.</P>
    <P>Coupled with the system of bureaucracy which we adopted during the course of the war, the practice has developed whereby members of the Oireachtas have, as part of their normal functions, mind you, power to get the ear of a Minister of State.  That lends itself to great abuse.  If a Department of State has the power to grant or withhold a licence, very often involving vast sums of money, the granting or the withholding of that licence comes to be at the mercy of a member of the Oireachtas, who has the ear of the Department or of the Minister.  It seems to me that that is the fundamental fault and the House should see whether there is any remedy for that situation.</P>
    <P>I say in all sincerity to all Parties in the House that you can have inquiries week after week, but you will not kill the suspicion which exists in the public mind.  So long as you allow the granting or withholding of rights, the granting or the withholding of licences to be carried on behind closed doors, either by Ministers or their appointees, there is bound to be suspicion, bound to be abuse.  A Minister may not be a party to the abuse of these powers, but those who have the ear of the Minister may well be a party to the abuse of the powers.  It is a most unfair position in which to place a Minister.  It is a most unfair position in which to place any member of the House that it should be possible for him, by the use of his influence, to obtain rights involving vast sums of money, just because he happens to have the ear of a particular civil servant or a particular Minister.  I would appeal to the House and the Government to consider that position seriously.  That, in my view, is the fundamental cause of this particular piece of scandal or trouble and of those others which have occurred from time to time.</P>
    <P>I do not think any useful purpose can <Col N="1380" /> be served by discussing the details of these matters in this House.  I think the function of the House should be more to seek the fundamental remedy, perhaps by setting up a committee of the House to deal with it.  I think a practice has grown up whereby legislators have misconceived their functions. I am not saying that in derogation of any particular Party in the House, but I do think legislators have come to look upon their function as being one to try to obtain favours or rights for their constituents or particular friends, rights or favours which have been withheld from them and which they believe they are entitled to&mdash;even sometimes to obtain favours for their constituents and friends to which they are not entitled at all.  The function of a member of Parliament is to legislate, not to go behind closed doors to obtain favours for constituents or friends.  Deputies' duties should be confined to the purpose for which they are elected to this House&mdash;to legislate in public.  If you once allow the practice to develop&mdash;and I am afraid it has developed&mdash;whereby members of the Oireachtas are entitled to interfere with civil servants, to go and use influence with Ministers or civil servants, you are bound to have corruption. You are bound to have inquiries of this kind.  That is inevitable when you are holding out temptation to civil servants, temptation to Ministers, temptation to members of the Oireachtas.  Therefore, the proper thing to do is to limit the duties of members of this House to their functions as legislators.  I think if you do that, you will have a better type of legislator in this House.  You will have people who are interested in legislating rather than in looking for favours of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>As to the actual amendment before the House, I had a rather open mind before I came in here, having read the various motions, but I do think that Deputy Dillon made a very good case for his amendment.  I would make this appeal to the Taoiseach.  This inquiry is being set up because of accusations made in this House last week.  These accusations may or may not be well founded.  I know nothing about them <Col N="1381" /> except that they have been made.  The Taoiseach has decided that this matter should be investigated by a tribunal but there is some disagreement as to the form of the tribunal.  There again the Taoiseach was inclined to take the view that it should be inquired into by a judicial tribunal but, the Taoiseach having so decided, I would appeal to him not to limit the functions of that tribunal especially in view of the attitude taken up by the Opposition and in view of the statements made by Deputy Mulcahy, Deputy Dillon and other Deputies.  If he limits the scope of the inquiry, he will then add fuel to the flames of suspicion in the country. Apart from that, it did occur to me that the tribunal would be set a difficult task under the terms of the motion. They would have to take the Dáil debates for three days and go through every single allegation made in the course of those debates.  I read those debates last night in bed.  There were a great many allegations made, many of which had no real bearing on the issue.  I should say that the tribunal would have to make a list of at least 40 different allegations and investigate each and every one.  I do not think that would be very satisfactory.  If the Taoiseach would accept the amendment submitted by either Deputy Dillon or Deputy Mulcahy, he could then rely upon the good sense of whatever tribunal was set up to decide what the really important issues are.</P>
    <P>As to the amendment put forward by the Tánaiste, I think that limits the scope of the inquiry; it certainly does not widen it.  It makes it subject to two separate limitations.  I would urge the Taoiseach to accept either Deputy Mulcahy's or Deputy Dillon's amendment&mdash;I think Deputy Dillon's amendment is better worded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like again to make a very sincere appeal to the Taoiseach&mdash;as I did last Wednesday and last Wednesday week&mdash;to have a thorough inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the proposal to sell Locke's Distillery at Kilbeggan.  When I rose in this House on 29th October and made an appeal to the Government to hold an inquiry, I did so in the hope that, <Col N="1382" /> if the Government were anxious to establish a tribunal to investigate the proposed sale of the distillery, they would be prepared to have all the circumstances examined.  To my amazement I find that the Taoiseach has decided to place the terms of reference before the tribunal to be appointed, which will deal only with the accusations made against members of the Oireachtas or the Ministers concerned.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that the charges made here are very tiny compared with what is playing in the wind outside the House? I believe if the Government tie the hands of those judges, no matter what the result of the investigations may be, it will not have the confidence of the people or the confidence of this Parliament.  I believe that if the Taoiseach does not accept either Deputy Mulcahy's or Deputy Dillon's amendment, being the clever, shrewd man that he is, he has some definite reason for doing so.  Perhaps the reason why he refuses to allow a full investigation is because he is anxious to save certain people who would be involved in this great scandal should the judges have full scope to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the proposed sale.  The allegations I made here cannot be fully investigated without bringing outside people into this.</P>
      <P>There was an allegation made here by me-in fact, there were several allegations made by me.  I am prepared to make those allegations again and I owe no apology to the Government for anything I have said in this House.  I speak here on the understanding that I have Article 15 of the Constitution to protect me&mdash;it gives me the right of free speech&mdash;and while I am in this Parliament, let the time be long or short, I shall endeavour to bring forward any matters to which my attention has been drawn by my constituents and which will probably lead to the exposure of any racket or scandal that I may think well of referring to.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach will not have it to say of Deputy Flanagan that a gun was put at his head to appear at the tribunal. No matter what sort of tribunal he may establish, I will be at it.  I will not have to be invited or compelled to go. I will go voluntarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1383" /> Certain documents were referred to here to-day by Deputy Dillon in connection with an alleged offer of whiskey in the black market.  I will produce them at the inquiry.  There were references in these documents that the people engaged in the racket enjoyed certain Government facilities. That will take some explaining, and how can all these things be explained before the tribunal that has been suggested? How can the judges investigate such allegations if they deal only with matters that affect Ministers or members of the Oireachtas?  If there is any attempt to curtail this investigation by the judges, whoever they may be, or to tighten the terms of reference, then it will be a deliberate attempt by the Government to hide men like Sachael, Sweeney and the other racketeers associated in the distillery scandal.</P>

One of the allegations made in this House concerned a watch which, it was alleged, was bought for the Taoiseach's son.

If there is anybody who knows what slander is, it is the men sitting opposite in this House to-day, men who were engaged in nothing else throughout any election campaign they ever fought, men who were engaged in one of the greatest slander campaigns of history in my constituency at the last general election. If the Taoiseach wants to hear something about the slander that his Party participated in at the last general election, which involved a Catholic priest, I will tell him all about it.  It does not arise here, but the men on the opposite side of the House should be the last to talk about slander.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring, if I may, to draw the Taoiseach's attention to the fact that he made reference to slanderous statements made inside and outside this House.  If he condemns people who, he believes, are making slanderous statements, he has the slanderers in his own Party. Deputy Maguire accused the Taoiseach himself of being a slanderer in this House; and that is reported in the official records of the debate on last Thursday night.  If any attempt is made to curtail the investigation, it will do more harm than good.  I am anxious to help the Government and want to assist them to see this unfortunate racket cleared up and if I am to be permitted to assist the Government as I would wish, I should like to have at my disposal the widest possible means of assisting the Government to have all the information at my disposal for the tribunal.  If the motion is passed as amended on the Tánaiste's proposal, such a tribunal will do more harm than good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1386" /> I again appeal, as Deputy Seán MacBride appealed, to the Taoiseach, in the name of goodness and decency, and as a sincere effort to show that he is anxious to clear up this unfortunate mess, to have this unfortunate scandal investigated, to enable people to come forward with evidence which will assist the judges, and let him not stand as a barrier against people coming forward who may be in a position to throw light on the whole situation.  It would be far better for the three judges to be appointed and left to make the terms of reference for themselves, to let them go very fully into the matters surrounding the proposed sale of the distillery and find for themselves the whole outcome of it, as to whether there were irregularities or not.</P>
    <P>We certainly know that there were irregularities and the House was informed last week of this one irregularity&mdash;that the moment a member of the Oireachtas, from a particular side, visited the Department, an export licence for 4,000 gallons of whiskey was granted on the spot, despite the fact that, prior to that, when a number of other people called about the sale of the distillery, there was no question of granting a licence.  That did not arise until they were accompanied by the right and proper political escort. Surely this is something which may involve the attendance of civil servants at the inquiry and may involve the attendance of the Minister himself, with the Senator and the responsible citizen who accompanied the Senator? Therefore, I join in a very strong appeal to the Government, with a final warning that they will be doing a very wrong thing if they restrict the terms of reference of this tribunal.</P>
    <P>I again appeal to the Government to accept either Deputy Mulcahy's or Deputy Dillon's amendment, so that it cannot be said but that this House was in full agreement and had full confidence in the tribunal about to be appointed. If he does not do it, the general public will see that this House has not confidence in the tribunal that the Taoiseach is anxious to appoint to investigate the activities of certain citizens.  Furthermore, we shall believe, and have reason to believe, that the <Col N="1387" /> reason why the Taoiseach will not accept Deputy Mulcahy's amendment is that he is anxious to hide and shade certain people who would come out in one of the greatest scandals this country has ever seen.</P>

      <P>The members of this group consciously and deliberately voted last week for the reference of this whole matter to a judicial body and I have not heard anything to-day that would make me feel that my vote on that occasion was wrong.  However, in view of the speech made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce this evening, I would like the Taoiseach, if he speaks before the conclusion of the discussion, to make certain points quite clear.  Certain things arising out of his speech make me feel that private citizens will not be allowed or should not be allowed to come before this tribunal to confirm, if needed, charges that it is stated will be made by Deputies or others.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce made it quite clear to me by his speech that it would not be correct for the members of the tribunal to send for the owners or representatives of the owners of Locke's Distillery or other citizens in particular who may be associated with the proposal for the purchase of that distillery.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Flanagan has in his possession contract documents, as he says quite definitely here this evening he has, he has to prove that it was proposed by so-and-so to purchase such-and-such a quantity of whiskey, to be sold in the black market at such-and-such a price and it would be necessary in an ordinary court in a case of that kind, provided that Deputy Flanagan was the person who produced the document, to have confirmation that such a document was the property of the proposed purchaser and that it was conveyed to the proposed seller&mdash;in other words, the proposed purchaser and representatives of Locke's Distillery would have to be brought before the tribunal to confirm an allegation of that kind.  I want to know from the Taoiseach if that will be permissible under the terms of reference.</P>

      <P>Three fundamental matters, it appears to me, arise out of this motion which has been sponsored by the Government.  I propose to confine my remarks very shortly to these points.  I adverted to two of them in the discussion last week on the motion to set up a select committee of the Oireachtas.  The first point is a question of Deputies' privileges. The second regards the immunity of the Parliament to investigation of its affairs by an outside body.  The third question is: does the motion proposed by the Government, even with the amendment suggested, allow of such full investigation on all the facts and circumstances connected with the sale of this distillery as the public interest requires and as the public demands.</P>
      <P>In regard to the first question, I do not propose to repeat what I said last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second is of utmost importance: that Deputies' privileges be safeguarded so that the independence of Deputies in a discussion in the House may not be impaired or vitiated in any way.  It is the constitutional right, I, submit, of Deputies, and it is the Parliamentary duty of Deputies, where it is in the public interest, to raise in the House matters given to them, whether in confidence or otherwise, which require ventilation in public, without the possibility of their being brought before any outside body to answer for anything they said or to disclose their sources of information. If that is allowed, it will put an end to the independence of Deputies.  I want to know if the Taoiseach proposes to refer to that very fundamental point which I referred to last week.  While I was speaking, the Minister for Industry and Commerce interpolated, by way of interruption, the comment that no person would be forced to go to this tribunal except by his own consent. I take the liberty to doubt the soundness of that suggestion and I want to know the Taoiseach's comment on it.  It is a matter of such fundamental importance that I spoke as I did not intend to speak.  It is not a matter that affects this Parliament or any Minister or Deputy, but it affects <Col N="1389" /> all Deputies and all Ministers in all future Irish Parliaments, this question of whether they are to be independent in debate.</P>
    <P>The second point is somewhat related to the first, as to whether the proceedings and speeches of the House are to be canvassed, inquired into, discussed or debated by an outside body. It is essential for the independence of Parliamentary procedure that nobody outside the House should be able to inquire into the procedure of the House.  This is safeguarded from abuse by the power which the House has of dealing with any offender against morality or against Standing Orders. It is a matter of great national importance that that position should be strongly safeguarded in any procedure of the tribunal which it is proposed to set up, by way of amendment if necessary.</P>
    <P>The third point is the one to which most of the speakers have referred. It is the question of whether or not there has been any cloaking of facts.  There is no doubt whatever that the motion of the Taoiseach, even with the amendment, undoubtedly will restrict an investigation of all the facts in connection with this sale.  I have no intention of going into any of these facts.  I can envisage and I can state facts, but I will not do so because I have a firm resolution not to go into any of these facts.  There are numbers of points and circumstances that can be ruled out on these terms of reference. Are we to set up a tribunal with judges whose training most inevitably will bring them to the point where this, that or the other which a person wants to ventilate will be ruled outside their terms of reference?  Once any fact, matter or thing is ruled as being outside the cognisance of the tribunal, once any fact, matter or thing which the public think relevant is ruled out as being outside the terms of reference, then immediately public confidence in the tribunal falls.  I want to make that point conscientiously and in as strong language as the necessity of the case requires.  Public interest has been roused to such a point that every decent person in this country wants to know the facts.  It is only one <Col N="1390" /> aspect of the affair whether any members of this Assembly or of the other House of the Oireachtas had any improper part in the transaction, but inevitably the result of these terms of reference will be to confine the inquiry to that aspect.  It is an aspect that nobody in this House wants to keep out, but we must see that no private individual would be precluded from making any case he wants to make or from giving any evidence he wants to give because the body of judges rule it out of order as not coming within their terms of reference.  Once their power is exercised to declare any matter as being outside the terms of reference then public confidence at once falls.</P>
    <P>We heard the Taoiseach last week giving list after list of all the various tribunals and commissions that have been held.  He gave the findings of some of them&mdash;not of all of them&mdash;but of those that suited him.  He said they exonerated the Government or members of the Oireachtas from any charge of corruption&mdash;and then mentioned plaintively that in spite of that nobody believed them.  If that is a fact, and if there is a strong body of opinion on all sides, with the exception of the Government side, that the terms of reference are such as to restrict the investigation, what possible confidence will the public have in the tribunal?  The question of whether the terms of reference should be wide or restricted is of such fundamental importance that it should be impressed on the Government until they see reason.</P>
    <P>A subsidiary matter that arises in the terms of reference is that we are to tell these three judges&mdash;we assume that it is going to be a judicial tribunal though nothing to that effect is stated in the terms of reference&mdash;that they are to go and browse among the leaves of three or four volumes of the Official Reports of this Assembly with a view to finding out what may or may not be charges or allegations.  Such a task ought not to be put on a judicial, or on any tribunal.  It is wrong in the Parliamentary sense that the judges should be given these copies of the Dáil Reports and be told to find out for themselves what the charges are: &ldquo;We <Col N="1391" /> do not know what the charges are, but look through them and see for yourselves.&rdquo; These judicial gentlemen with their technical training and knowledge of criminal law-and who are perhaps completely divorced from public affairs through their long isolation on the judicial bench-may say that they see nothing which they can frame into a charge, or they might see some charge which no one else sees.</P>
    <P>In the first place, an investigation into the proceedings of the House is unsound, and it is a wrong thing to tell them to go through the volumes of the reports to find out the charges for themselves, to say: &ldquo;We of the Government cannot find them for you.&rdquo; That is wrong.</P>
    <P>I raised on the last occasion the question of the procedure before this tribunal.  I pointed out that there is not in this case, as there may have been in the case of some of the other tribunals which we set up, somebody who could be regarded as plaintiff and somebody who could be regarded as defendant, somebody who could be regarded as prosecutor and somebody who could be regarded as accused.  I stated that it was fundamentally wrong and quite unsound to set up a tribunal in which the judges will be merely investigators of facts, in which they themselves will have to put the questions, as members of foreign tribunals are in the habit of doing in investigating criminal charges.  That is not the function, nor is it in accord with the training, of our judges.  There should be before this tribunal some trained lawyers&mdash;solicitor or barrister or both&mdash;independent of the Government and of everybody interested in this controversy, whose duty it would be to put before this tribunal every relevant fact and as many documents as he can possibly get&mdash;irrespective of any plea of privilege by the Government&mdash;to enable the judges to investigate the facts.  He should produce all the relevant documents and witnesses for both sides, whether for the people who are making these allegations or for those people who may think they have to answer allegations.  Every fact, matter and thing connected with this entire transaction from its inception-the <Col N="1392" /> arrival of those foreign gentlemen who tried to purchase this distillery, the occurrences during their stay and subsequent to their departure, and the incidents that occurred in connection with the power of attorney&mdash;should be forthcoming so that the public may be satisfied with whatever finding or verdict is given by this tribunal.</P>
    <P>That is the real matter to which we, as Deputies, should direct our attention&mdash;the setting up of such a tribunal as will command public respect and whose findings will be regarded, not as the findings of a technical trio of judicial gentlemen, acting within limited and narrow terms of reference, but the findings of independent judges who have been given all the facts. Such a finding will commend itself to the people.  If we do not do that, we shall be doing a bad day's work for decency in public life.  I think that it is a very wrong thing on the part of the Government to be having a long debate, on a matter which is to be inquired into judicially, merely for the purpose of having restricted terms of reference.  That is the issue.  Are we to have restricted terms of reference or the fullest inquiry into all the facts? There are facts which the public want to be informed upon in connection with the inception, initiation, progress and final determination of this Locke Distillery purchase which are not connected with any charge or which are only incidentally connected with any charge.  Those should be inquired into.  Decent people want to know the facts.  If the Government insists on restricting the terms of reference, the public will believe that they have something to hide.  They will have no confidence in this tribunal and the findings will have the same fate as those to which the Taoiseach referred in the case of other tribunals.  Notwithstanding that people were charged before these tribunals and that, the facts having been inquired into, they were found to be guiltless, the public did not, and does not yet, believe in the findings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree that the terms of reference in the motion by <Col N="1393" /> the Taoiseach are not sufficiently wide, I think, notwithstanding what other Deputies said, that they are fairly wide.  They cover quite a large field of Governmental and Departmental activities.  The subject to be investigated is, however, of such importance that there should be no restriction whatever on the powers or terms of reference of this tribunal.  I am not enthusiastic about an inquiry by a judicial tribunal into statements made in this House.  The attitude taken up by the Tánaiste does not impress me. As a matter of fact, it would put me and, I think, other Deputies against a judicial tribunal inasmuch as the Tánaiste threatened Deputies with the drastic and extensive powers of such a tribunal to such an extent as to restrain Deputies from exercising their rights as representatives of the people to express their views here.  Since we are to have a judicial tribunal, I think that it is fundamentally wrong to tie the hands of that tribunal in the way indicated in the motion by the Taoiseach or the amendment by the Tánaiste.  It is wrong to confine the investigations of this tribunal to one aspect of the case&mdash;allegations made in this House and the failure of Government Departments to exercise their proper functions.  Neither the motion nor the amendment in the name of the Tánaiste, would give to the tribunal powers which it ought to have to find out not only if Deputies made statements which were not justified, or if Government Departments were not exercising their functions properly, but also whether, in this country at the moment, we have sufficient protection for lawful Irish industry.  That is an aspect of the question which must be investigated.  Is it possible for foreigners to come in here, buy an established industry, sabotage it and dissipate its stocks?  Is it possible for the means of livelihood of Irish citizens in an Irish industry to be torn from them by international speculators? Is our legislation sufficiently comprehensive to protect an industry such as John Locke's?  These are aspects of the case which require investigation. They can be investigated only if the judicial tribunal is given wide powers to ascertain the activities <Col N="1394" /> of the various people who sought to purchase this industry, why they sought to purchase it, and whether they intended to work the industry or merely dispose of its stocks on the black market.  All these things require investigation.</P>
      <P>I think that the Taoiseach's motion is not sufficiently wide to provide for that investigation.  I was impressed by the maiden speech of Deputy MacBride, particularly his reference to certain abuses that have grown up in this country over a long period&mdash;the abuse which was inherent in the emergency situation of having too wide powers vested in bureaucracy; too wide powers in making decisions in regard to licences for import and export and for the running of industries. He also referred to what is, I think, generally recognised as an abuse, that is, to the tendency of Deputies to regard as their main function the importuning of Government Departments on behalf of their constituents and various interests that approach them.  The main function of Deputies should be legislation, and the main work of Deputies should be done in this House.  Unfortunately there has been a growing tendency to depart from that position.  There is also room for investigation, and I think it is covered to a certain extent by the Taoiseach's motion, into the close connection of permanent members of the Government with various commercial concerns.  I am one of those who frequently agitate that Parliamentary Secretaries should not have any direct connection with business concerns.  It is equally important that the Leader of the Government Party-certainly in this House he is not permitted; I am referring to the other House&mdash;should not be permitted to have commercial&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out how necessary it is that this tribunal, once it is established, should go over a fairly wide field with particular emphasis on <Col N="1395" /> the sale or proposed sale of this distillery. Perhaps the sale of one industrial concern is a comparatively small matter in the life of a nation, yet there are so many factors in connection with this whole transaction that require investigation, that the matter is one of supreme national importance.  The matters I have raised are, in your opinion, Sir, fairly wide, but they definitely arise out of the sale or proposed sale of this distillery.  The tribunal must not only have terms of reference but it must be guided in certain directions in finding out what is wrong and in exposing what is wrong.  That is why I say it is necessary to refer to various abuses which have grown up in this country and which are directly or indirectly associated with this commercial transaction.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon made a good reference in his speech which, I think, stirs the feelings of every patriotic person in this country, when he referred to &ldquo;banana republics&rdquo;, namely, self-governing nations which allow themselves to be influenced to too great an extent by foreign money.  We are a small and a comparatively weak nation, situated quite close to huge commercial and industrial nations such as the United States and Great Britain.  We have to be very careful in the management of our internal economic affairs to prevent foreigners with vast financial resources behind them coming in and kicking our Government and people about whatever way they like by the sheer weight of their financial resources.  The insolence and the arrogance of the international speculator are unlimited.  That type of individual usually believes that he can buy everything and anything for money. He believes that he can buy Governments, buy Ministers and even the highest citizen in the State.  I think it is time we in this country indicated quite clearly that we will not tolerate any flirtation between high politics in this country and big business either inside or outside this country, and that we will insist upon the most thorough and complete investigation of every circumstance surrounding the proposed purchase or sale of John Locke's Distillery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes, when matters of high technical importance are before this <Col N="1396" /> House, samples of the product under discussion are handed down.  In a discussion on the subject of turf, samples of turf, wet and dry, were handed to Deputies.  In a discussion on industrial development some industrial products were handed round&mdash;I think a spade was introduced into this House.  I am not suggesting that a sample of the product under discussion should be handed round but I think it might, if it would have had the effect of softening the course of discussion up to the present.  If we are to maintain the dignity and the decency of public life we ought to avoid undue bitterness of the type introduced into this debate by the Tánaiste.  We ought to approach these matters with a view to finding out if anything is seriously wrong and, if there is, to apply the remedy. Remedies are possible, but if our legislation does not provide our Government with the necessary powers to protect Irish industry they should seek those powers.  If, on the other hand, abuses have slowly but surely crept into our administration or Parliamentary system we ought to have those abuses exposed and uprooted.  We ought to do that in a decent and business-like way, with a full sense of our responsibility and without indulging in any personal abuse or making charges and counter-charges across the House.  The Tánaiste referred to a campaign of slander against the members of the Government.  I think he should be very slow to mention such a thing. I think he should be very slow to make the statement he made in regard to the proposed committee of inquiry of this House to inquire into this whole subject when he most emphatically declared that certain members of the Opposition were incapable of giving a just and a fair decision.  I think that is the most outrageous slander that can be offered to any member of this House.</P>

      <P>Before dealing with the motion and the amendment before the House, I take this opportunity of stating most emphatically that the Tánaiste (Minister for Industry and Commerce) paid me the compliment of attacking me in my absence.

The vituperation, the abuse and the slander in the particular charges hurled against me I would resent if they came from a responsible person with a sense of honour and a sense of truth; but coming from the particular individual from whom they did come I take them as a very high compliment.</P>
      <P>Now, we are entitled to ask why that particular gentleman has shown such hysterical heat on every occasion when a tribunal is asked for to inquire into the activities and circumstances surrounding the sale, or proposed sale, of Locke's Distillery.

      <P>In his lengthy point of order the Minister pointed out that the only matters before the House for discussion and consideration were the allegations made by Deputies with regard to this affair.  That is exactly what the motion is trying to pin this House down to and what the motion is trying to pin any judicial inquiry down to; but the Minister, in his desire to interrupt, completely overlooked the fact that there is also an amendment before the House for consideration. That amendment asks the House that a tribunal, judicial or otherwise, <Col N="1400" /> should be set up to inquire into all the circumstances associated with the proposed sale.  Last week we had a motion asking for a Parliamentary tribunal to inquire into all and every circumstance associated with the proposed sale.  We had that motion on paper because of allegations made in this House by Deputies on information received.  There was on that occasion a case made by the head of the Government that a Parliamentary tribunal would not be the right type of tribunal and that it should be a judicial tribunal.  On that case, be it a genuine, sincere and honest case, or otherwise, the proposal to have a Parliamentary tribunal was defeated on the ground that it would be more proper to have the matter dealt with by a judicial tribunal.  But there was no question whatsoever as to whether one type of tribunal or another should not inquire into all the circumstances associated with the proposed sale.</P>
      <P>We have been given now by the head of the Government his idea of a judicial tribunal.  Is it to inquire into all the circumstances associated with that sale?  By no manner of means.  It is limited to inquiring into allegations made by members of the Oireachtas affecting other members of the Oireachtas. That is number one.  Number two, to inquire into the activities of members of the Oireachtas with regard to this particular sale or proposed sale. Nothing else.  Nothing else can be inquired into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The activities of these notorious foreigners, their associations in this country, how they utilised the highest establishment in the State&mdash;all that is completely ruled out under the motion proposed here.  At the same time there is an amendment before the House to-day to the effect that, if there is to be a judicial inquiry, all the circumstances associated with this sale should come up for examination.  We have not heard from any Government spokesman why they object so heatedly and determinedly to allowing the judicial tribunal to inquire into all the circumstances associated with the proposed sale of Locke's Distillery.  They would not have all the circumstances inquired into by a Parliamentary tribunal.  On the wording of the Taoiseach's motion, <Col N="1401" /> they refuse to allow all the relevant circumstances to be inquired into. Why?  All the white hysterical heat of the Tánaiste and all the lengthy interruptions of the Minister for Local Government will not disguise the fact that the Government, by their very terms of reference, are running away from a full and adequate investigation of the circumstances associated with that particular transaction.  The stamp of guilt is written boldly across the face of the Taoiseach's motion.</P>
    <P>The smallest part of the rumoured scandal is the activities of members of the Oireachtas but, on the terms of this motion, all that the judicial tribunal can inquire into are allegations made by members of the Oireachtas with regard to the activity of members of the Oireachtas and the part played by members of the Oireachtas in the sale. The activities, the associations, of Maximoe are not to be touched on except in so far as Maximoe engaged in any activities arm in arm with a member of the Oireachtas.  The activities or proposals or plans or contracts of Mr. Eindiguer with regard to the disposal, legitimately or illegitimately, of the stocks of Locke's Distillery are not to be inquired into except in so far as he was directly associated with a member of either House of this Parliament.</P>
    <P>Why is the lid put on?  Why is the snuffer put on the candle to put out the light?  Why this deliberate attempt to throttle down and limit the subjects to be inquired into?  What is the Government afraid of?  What are they running away from?  What big scandal is there that might be unearthed if all the activities associated with the proposed sale were inquired into and, if there is nothing to hide, why the determined objection last week and to-day to having a full inquiry into all relevant circumstances associated with the proposed deal and a court of competent judges to determine what is and what is not relevant?</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin raised the point that if Deputy Flanagan had in his possession documentary evidence that there was a contract entered into for the sale of the stocks of Locke's Distillery outside this country, and had that document <Col N="1402" /> in handwriting, and signed, but not in the handwriting of or signed by a member of the Oireachtas, and not being sold to a member of the Oireachtas, the terms of that motion there definitely rule out an inquiry into that particular phase of the activities.  That phase with regard to the price for the export stocks affected directly the price and affected very directly the interests that were involved in this particular dispute.</P>
    <P>I demand that, before this debate is closed, a reason should be given to us by some Ministerial speaker as to why this motion limits the judicial tribunal to inquiring into (a) the allegations affecting members of either House made in the Dáil and (b) the nature and extent of the connection which any member of either House had with the transactions.  That is burking the whole issue.  That is inquiring into the fringe of the whole matter.  It is prohibiting discussion on the full substance in which the people of this country are interested.  That is being done in violation of the feelings and views expressed by every Party and independent Deputy in the House other than the regimented troops opposite, very many of whom, probably, share the views of Opposition Deputies in this matter and want the whole thing cleaned up and want the fullest possible inquiry but, because they are regimented and disciplined, dare not say so and dare not vote according to those views.</P>
    <P>All the heat of the Tánaiste and all the interruptions of the Minister for Local Government must not be allowed to obscure the fact that there is a deliberate attempt in this motion of the Taoiseach's not to invite investigation and inquiry, but to suppress investigation and inquiry.  Not only members of this House, but the public, are entitled to know what is the Government running away from, what are they attempting to suppress, what are the associated factors or agents that were concerned in this proposed deal that it is necessary to exclude from investigation by an impartial judicial tribunal.  These are questions that have got to be answered.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach establishes a judicial tribunal.  As has been pointed out, <Col N="1403" /> and has been experienced previously by this Parliament, he establishes a court of judges.  The duty, responsibility, training and experience of judges are in the direction of weighing up the evidence before them&mdash;the pros and the cons&mdash;and conscientiously and legally giving a decision on the case made for and the case made against the particular matter being inquired into.</P>
    <P>It is not any part of the responsibility of judges in any court to act as prosecutors, or as investigators or as cross-examiners.  Whose responsibility is it?  The Government does not send anyone in to act as prosecutor.  We had the experience of the Railway Tribunal.  Learned counsel were there representing different people whose names or interests might be involved, but there was nobody there as prosecutor, there was nobody there as crossexaminer and there was nobody there to bring direct evidence against anybody. It may be asked, why?  Because individuals who act here in good faith on information supplied which they believed to be reliable, are not always gifted with a banking account of the type that can stand representation by leading counsel in a case covering a couple of months.</P>

      <P>The Minister might be negligible if he was brief and if he would clear his own mind before wagging his tongue.  I am making a statement of fact that there was not a prosecutor. We had then the Ward case which arose out of a letter read by the Taoiseach in this House.  The person who wrote the letter was not a member of the House.  There was any amount of litigation depending on that.  There might have been one of the biggest libel actions in the history of this country. A judicial tribunal was appointed. The writer of the letter was represented. His duty, and the limit of his duty was to justify the writing of that letter.  It was not to bring charges or to press charges.  If any information <Col N="1404" /> came to him with regard to the Monaghan bacon factory that had not been written down in that letter, it was no part of his duty, or function, to bring it under the notice of the court and have it inquired into.</P>
      <P>That tribunal was a step better than the abortive tribunal held with regard to the railway shares in so far that there was a person so interested that solicitor and counsel had to be briefed to justify the charges made in that letter.  The expense of doing that was so immense that the Taoiseach thought it advisable to tax the taxpayers of this country with a portion of the expenses borne by Deputy Dr. Ward and with a portion of the expenses of Dr. McCarvill.</P>
      <P>Now, we have another judicial tribunal, but we have no arrangements made with regard to the prosecution of the case.  We have every arrangement made in the motion for limiting the scope of the examination.  That is put forward as a suggestion by the Government, if we are to believe their speeches, that they want the full light of day on every phase of the activities in connection with this.  The light of day that we are going to get is what you could get through a mouse hole into a cellar.  That is the kind of light of day they want, and, if they saw the mouse hole, that would be blocked, so that even that much light could not get in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inquiry is to be limited to the activities of members of the Oireachtas. The Dáil was asked to establish a tribunal to inquire into the sale of Locke's Distillery.  A week ago the Taoiseach said that he would have the very fullest inquiry.  A week ago the Taoiseach was wagging his head and shaking his fist that we were going to have the very fullest inquiry&mdash;the heaviest type of inquiry that the country ever saw&mdash;and that we were all going to be put in the jitters before this pompous and this very full inquiry. Now where are the jitters? Opposite.  But seeing that they were committed to some inquiry, in order to spike the motion before the Dáil last week, the Government now come in with what they call a judicial inquiry and make certain that it will inquire <Col N="1405" /> into a fraction only of the activities associated with this particular thing. The black-market operations, the export operations and the use of Arus an Uachtárain, so as to strengthen one hand against another hand&mdash;every one of these operations is to be definitely ruled out except in so far as a member of the Oireachtas was a party to them.</P>
    <P>Political influence was the allegation made last week.  Political influence is not limited to members of the Oireachtas.  There were indications and references made to very great political influence by people who are not members of the Oireachtas, but that type of political influence, or that type of political activity, is not to be inquired into.  The Taoiseach is going to see to that by the terms of his motion. The Tánaiste is going to see to it by his bad temper, and the Minister for Local Government is going to see to it by calculated interruptions&mdash;every interruption calculated to obscure the one net issue: why not allow all the circumstances to be inquired into, and why are only a fraction of the operations to go before the court, and all the rest to be withheld from the court and the public?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that rather than wanting to cloak the matters in these two motions it is quite obvious that the reverse is the case.  Amongst the allegations made last week was one whereby the Minister for Justice was charged with having given a permit to a man to sell £25,000 worth of tweed in Switzerland.  From my reading of the Opposition amendments it would not be possible to inquire into that allegation. It does seem to me just possible that it might be inquired into under the Taoiseach's motion.  I think that is a very important allegation.  I heard more talk about it in the west of Ireland than I did about the distillery.  I would be very anxious that it should get the very fullest possible investigation, particularly as it seems to affect a commodity which is of first rate importance to the welfare of the Gaeltacht. I am sorry to say that supporters of the Government seem to think, well, that, possibly, there might have been something to it.  Therefore I think it would be a great pity if, as I suspect, under either of the two Opposition <Col N="1406" /> amendments an investigation into this charge or allegation were to be ruled out.  I do not think that the effect of this tribunal will be any more lasting than that of the other tribunals.</P>
      <P>Outside the County Monaghan, there are very few who remember what the findings in that case were&mdash;the Monaghan bacon case.  The thing was revived by the recent elections and a great deal of damage was done.  A man who is not a supporter of the Government, though a very decent man, expressed the view that this mud-raking is reducing the reputation of the Dáil to a very low ebb indeed.  If there is any apathy shown by the electors to any serious degree in future, I think myself that it can be brought home to this campaign which has very little foundation in fact.  With regard to the proposal to have an investigation into the private dealings in connection with this distillery, it may be possible under the Tánaiste's amendment to bring that in.  Personally I am, and I know a good many Government Deputies and nearly all the Government supporters I have met will be very interested to find out all the facts in regard to the dealings in whiskey of this distillery during the last six years.  Under the Tánaiste's addendum I believe that the tribunal, if they take a reasonable view, will be able to bring in these transactions.  To that extent, if that is done, this tribunal will be different from the ones dealing with the Wicklow gold, the Great Southern Railway shares, and the Monaghan Bacon Factory. As the Taoiseach said, I think it is a very undesirable thing to bring the private transactions of a commercial company under the public gaze in this way.  But, in view of the emergency, the conditions created by the emergency, and the power which we have given the Government by the united vote of this Dáil, very possibly that could be justified in this case.  I hope that the tribunal will interpret the Tánaiste's addendum in such a way as to enable these private transactions to be examined.  They cannot be examined over more than the last two years, but, if we get an examination over the last two years, I believe it will be a good thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that anybody who listened to this debate and to the previous debates on this matter must be perfectly clear in his mind as to what is being aimed at by those who are opposing the present motion, particularly the motion as amended.  It is a very easy thing for a Deputy to come into this Parliament and, acting under its privileges, to make any allegations he chooses, no matter how ill-founded they are.  When such charges are made, there is only one way to meet them, and that is to set up an inquiry to examine into them and let the public judge how far these allegations were justified and how far they were made out of sheer recklessness or malice. Some of the Deputies on the other benches spoke, very rightly, of the privileges of Parliament; the need that representatives of the people here should be free to ventilate anything which, in their opinion, it is in the public interest to ventilate.  That is a precious privilege.  But I hold that that privilege ought not to be turned into licence: that if there is a precious privilege which, in the national interest, ought to be maintained, it imposes upon every public representative the duty of being careful before he makes charges.</P>
      <P>As I said on a previous occasion, the moment charges are made, there is only one way to meet them, and that is by setting up an impartial inquiry so that the public mind may be set at rest and it may be found out how far there was truth and how far there was not truth in the allegations.  A public inquiry is not a thing that should be lightly set up.  It means considerable public expense.  It means taking away those who would be engaged in it from their own peculiar, proper business.  But, as I have said, the moment charges are made of the type which have been made here with reference to this matter, no matter what the Government may think about them, no matter how baseless they may appear, they have to be investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the type of tribunal that should be set up for such an investigation? Is there any man or woman who is listening to this debate this evening who would say that a committee of <Col N="1408" /> this Dáil, composed of members of the different Parties, as it would be, would be a tribunal whose judgment would be respected?  It is all very well to talk in high terms and to say that we should be all fine and splendid; but, every day, practically, some Deputies make confidence in their impartiality impossible by their attitude and by their public statements.  Nobody could be more interested than I am in the good repute of this institution, and I would deplore anything that in any way would detract from its prestige.  Is there anybody who will tell me that, in a case like this, with allegations made, as they were made&mdash;not merely allegations, not merely questions to be inquired into, but assertions that such-and-such was true and that there was evidence that it was true&mdash;a committee chosen from the different Parties in this House would give an impartial judgment? It could not be done; it is not likely to be done.  We would have the same manoeuvring within the committee examining into the matter that we see here-manoeuvring to put the other people in the wrong.</P>
    <P>For that reason, whenever a question of this sort comes to be examined I have always felt that the examination should be by an independent tribunal, a tribunal of people who are removed from the political arena and who will have no purpose whatsoever to serve by their judgment except the purpose of arriving at the truth.  I believe that the people of the country will hold with me that, if this is to be examined into, it should not be examined into by people who have already taken sides in the dispute and in the arguments about it, but by people who are impartial.  It is for that reason that a judicial inquiry is proposed.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Opposition&mdash;and when I say the Opposition I mean all those who have opposed the proposal&mdash;want to discredit in advance whatever the findings may be.  First of all, the allegations are made here in public and they cannot be pursued anywhere outside.  When the allegations are made here, they cannot be pursued outside, because of the privileges of the House.  Then, when you try to get them examined outside, the next move is to try to discredit in advance whatever <Col N="1409" /> the findings may be.  Deputy Morrissey led off the other evening, making it quite clear what he was aiming at.  We are told: &ldquo;The terms of reference are wrong.&rdquo;  I will let the people of Ireland judge whether or not the terms of reference are wrong.</P>
    <P>The charges made here were not charges against the character of A, B or C who were engaged as a group in trying to buy or dispose of Locke's Distillery.  The charges made here were charges against members of the Government, against the Government, in connection with the matter.  Is anybody going to suggest here that the terms of reference are not wide enough to deal with that and to deal with every witness whom the tribunal may wish to bring forward either to substantiate such a charge or to find out what its basis is?  Of course, they are wide enough.  They enable every charge which has been made against the Government or suggested against the Government, members of the Government, or members of the House, during this long debate of two or three days, to be investigated home.  What do the Opposition want?  They want to send the tribunal on a wild-goose chase.  They want nothing definite. Anything which anybody at any time said or anything which arises in connection with the sale of Locke's Distillery, whether it has been the subject of allegation here or not-they want all these examined into. Under our motion they can be examined into, in so far as they have any reference to public administration, if the tribunal so decides.</P>
    <P>It was deplored that the terms of reference were so wide that the members of the tribunal had to read over the debates here for three or four days past.  Of course, if we picked out the allegations and dealt with them, as I did the other day when replying to the debate, we would be told that we had left something out.  We have left every allegation of every kind, which would suggest anything improper on the part of the Executive or any member of this House, wide open.  There is no restriction.  All that the tribunal has to satisfy itself about&mdash;and it is to be the judge of it&mdash;is whether a <Col N="1410" /> matter has any relation to public administration and whether it is a matter of public importance.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that what the people of Ireland want to know is the character of the gentlemen who came from Switzerland or some of these other gentlemen.  In so far as their characters have anything to do with public activities, whether by the fact that some action has been taken by us as members of the Executive&mdash;the Executive as a whole, or any individual member of it&mdash;or that there has been failure to take proper action, they are all open for investigation.  I take it that that is what the public are interested in and not the question of what manoeuvring there may have been between parties in the buying and selling of Locke's Distillery.  If any of this manoeuvring has anything whatever to do with public administration, it can be examined into.  We have deals taking place in this country from day to day, and we know that frequently there has been a type of cheating, over-reaching by one party in his dealings with another. Is it suggested that it is a function of this House to examine into these?  Is it not quite clear that the functions of this House are to make laws which will deal with matters of that sort, if they are of such a nature as require to be dealt with, but that, if they are within the law, they are outside the functions of this House, except in so far as they indicate evils which it is our duty to correct by bringing in new laws?</P>

      <P>I do not know what the Deputy is referring to.  I am standing over common sense, the fact being that this House, in matters of this sort, has to deal with matters of public administration and that it is to such matters that the charges refer.  Immediately the charges are made and their evil effects created&mdash;people very often are partisan and are only too anxious to believe them&mdash;when there is an attempt to get at the truth, it is suggested that we do not want the truth. It is suggested that we are trying to clip the wings of the tribunal so that it <Col N="1411" /> cannot inquire into a matter which should be inquired into, but let us remember that it is these matters of public importance that we are concerned with.  Do Deputies think that if somebody made charges against these three, four or five men as private individuals, it would be a matter for a public debate?  The only way in which it could be a matter for public debate would be in circumstances in which there was a motion calling for some law or regulation to restrict such people coming into the country, or something of that kind.</P>
      <P>Is it suggested that the Government is to be held responsible, as a Government, for every misdealing there may be in business throughout the country? If we have contributed, as a Government, in any way to any of these things, by all means hold us responsible, but we cannot be held responsible for, and we cannot entirely prevent, wrong things from taking place in business. We cannot even prevent murder from taking place in our community.  Not-withstanding the law, murders have been committed and probably will be committed in our society and other societies because of human characteristics.</P>

If it were suggested here that there was something of that sort taking place, it would have been given a different introduction from the introduction we got, because the whole of that introduction was an attack upon members of the Administration, not merely by way of allegation, as I have said already, but by way of positive assertion-Deputies coming in here and saying: &ldquo;I can prove this.&rdquo;  If Deputies want to prove anything, they will have a full open court in which to prove it, and if <Col N="1412" /> any other member of the community says he has something which he wishes to bring before the tribunal, I am perfectly certain that the tribunal will listen to him.</P>

Deputy Costello tells us these trained legal men will have a very legalistic approach.

Probably if they were to sit until Tibb's Eve they would not get all the facts and all the circumstances.  How do they, or anybody else, know what groups may have met in private without anybody hearing of it, to consider this matter? The members of the tribunal are told to investigate every single transaction in connection with this matter that has any reference to public administration and there is no barrier whatever. What the judges will have to ask themselves is: &ldquo;Is this a matter which affects public administration or that affects the public interest?&rdquo; We could not have made the terms of reference wider without stultifying ourselves, without putting to the tribunal the task of a wild-goose chase.

      <P>The Minister for Local Government is prepared to stand over his own speeches.  We are here to examine into certain charges.  We were told by Deputy Dillon that we would require to watch to ensure that we do not bring in here some of the methods used in other parts of the world.  I suggest that one of the methods that have been found very valuable in other parts of the world is to defame people who have been in prominent public positions.  That is one of the methods pursued here and outside.  I believe the Irish people will be able to discover the truth or falsity of these charges and that this sort of campaign will not be as successful as those who are pursuing it would wish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to give way.  It was suggested here by one Deputy that we had not gone to the root in dealing with the allegations made.  I pointed out when I was speaking on this already that every Executive, under the conditions under which we operate, is always open to attack. A Minister in dealing with any particular case that comes before him has to act judicially to ascertain what is the best thing to do in the national interest.  That is left to his discretion and, of course, those who do not agree with him can suggest that he has acted <Col N="1416" /> from some improper motives.  We are quite well aware of the situation in that respect.  That is the situation that is being exploited at the moment, but it is one thing to realise that there is a fundamental position, which gives an opportunity to people who want to exploit it and it is another thing to remedy that fundamental position.  We are told that these things of necessity obtain in times of war but there is another type of crisis as well as war in which these things obtain.  They obtain in times of crisis like the present.</P>
      <P>In the present world shortage of commodities there is no way in which you can avoid that.  I deplore as much as anybody that it should be so.  It is unfortunate that it does place members who are in an Executive position, in a situation in which they can be attacked on the ground that they have been partial or corrupt but, in the situation as it is, there is no avoiding that.  If the suggestion is that we should try to get out of that with all possible speed, I am at one with the speaker.  I should like to see this thing ended, from the point of view of the Executive and from the point of view of the public. I am not in favour of restrictions, but in a position of shortage when you have to have rationing, licences, and so on, what can you do except to see that the people you put into a responsible position are worthy of being put there and that, if charges are made against them, these charges will be examined home?  You can do nothing else.</P>
      <P>It is suggested further that members of the Oireachtas should not have the liberty of going to speak to Ministers or civil servants about particular cases.  That is another matter on which I am in agreement with the speaker. I mentioned it here before and I wished to have the thing examined not as an <i>ad hoc</i> question but to have it examined in general.  I brought in a resolution here to have these things fundamentally examined&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To have the whole matter examined, to try to get some procedure, some rules in regard to the conduct of members.  I wished to have <Col N="1417" /> all these things examined by a Committee of the House or by a joint Committee. How was I met by the Opposition? They would not co-operate in the resolution, which would have provided for this and for any other case that might arise, the resolution which would have caused that particular question of approach to Departments by public representatives to be examined.  If, when it is examined, it appears that there is no way out of it and that on the whole it serves the public interest that it should be so, well and good; but I had hoped that there would be some examination of it which would limit this practice, or provide safeguards for it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon amused me on a particular occasion when he said: &ldquo;Whenever I go to a Department I take care to tell the person, `Now, this is Mr. Dillon, the trader from Ballaghaderreen, who is talking to you, not Deputy Dillon.' &rdquo; I do not think anybody will believe that a Deputy can separate himself into two parts like that, and that when he goes to a Department, even though he may give due warning that he is going in a private capacity, the fact that he is also entitled to write T.D. after his name will be forgotten.  It is a practice which I have always regretted.</P>
      <P>When I was in opposition I mentioned it, I think, and I have regretted it since I came into office.  But, apparently, other members of the Dáil, a large number of them, think it serves a good public purpose, that it helps to bring before the notice of administrators who are inclined naturally to administer according to a strict, rigid code, exceptional circumstances which may require exceptional treatment if the spirit and not the letter of the code is to be observed.  I would like it to be examined by the Dáil.  The resolution which I brought in before was proposed with that as one of its purposes &mdash;that that practice might be examined, its value appraised and the evils which attach to it prevented, or that some effort might be made to prevent them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This series of allegations has been made deliberately.  As time went on, some of those who made them persisted even more.  Is there anything in the <Col N="1418" /> terms of reference which will prevent any of the allegations, or anything arising out of the allegations, in so far as they affect public administration, from being examined by this judicial committee?  Not one.  I may be foolish in believing that people will examine the matter and see who is right and where there is political manoeuvring; I may be wrong in thinking they will, but if they do, I ask every fair-minded citizen to bear in mind the charges made here, to look at the terms of reference and ask themselves if there is anything in these allegations that cannot be fully exposed before the tribunal. That is what the tribunal is set up for.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies on the opposite side did their best to try to dissuade judges from undertaking this task.  It is a thankless task at best.  It is not a task they are obliged to perform.  It is a task which they can be asked to perform only on one basis, and that is, to render a public service, in the particular matter, as citizens above reproach. It is distasteful enough in itself without having Deputies in the House making statements which are calculated to make it more difficult to find a tribunal.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding what has been said, I have hopes that we will find amongst the judiciary three men who will be willing to undertake this task as a public duty of the first importance.  We have had to appeal to them in the same way before.  There were certain refusals, but there were, on each occasion, three men who were prepared to undertake the task, and they did their work in such a way that nobody has been able to point the finger at them for what they did.</P>
    <P>According to Deputy Costello I made a remark that nobody believed the findings.  I meant that some people acted, at any rate, as if they did not believe the findings.  When the findings came, many of the accusations had been forgotten.  When the findings did come, those who did not want to see the thing in its entirety took very good care that only one aspect of it should be considered.  I am taking the case of Dr. Ward again.  Dr. Ward was not found guilty.</P>

      <P>As Deputies know, the purpose of a Finance Bill is to confirm and give continuing effect to the Budget Resolutions which would otherwise lapse after a period of four months in accordance with the terms of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927.  Occasion is also taken in a Finance Bill to embody any other outstanding matters connected with the financing of the year or incidental to or consequential on the Resolutions.  So far as the present Bill is concerned there is very little in it that was not contained in the Resolutions or foreshadowed in my Budget speech, as will appear when I go through the Bill section by section, which I now propose to do.</P>
      <P Just="Center">PART I.&mdash;INCOME-TAX AND SURTAX.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1, which corresponds to Financial Resolution No. 1, provides that income-tax deductions in respect of the period from 6th April, 1948, to the date of the 1948 Budget will be made at the rate of 7s. 0d. in the £.  The section does not fix the rate of income-tax for the next financial year but simply indicates <Col N="1424" /> in advance that the rate of 7s. 0d. will be imposed by the 1948 Finance Act.</P>
    <P>Section 2, which corresponds to Financial Resolution No. 2, provides for a new scale of rates of surtax for the year 1946-47, that is, in respect of the surtax payable on 1st January, 1948.</P>
    <P>The existing margin of £1,500 has not been altered, but the tax payable on the excess over that amount is increased in each range of income.  In the highest range of income (i.e., over £20,000) the combined rate of income-tax and surtax amounts to 15s. in the £ for the current year and 15s. 6d. in the £ for next year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PART II.&mdash;CUSTOMS AND EXCISE.</P>
    <P>Section 3, which corresponds to Financial Resolution No. 3, provides for an increase in the customs duty on toilet preparations to double the former rates.  Duty is now chargeable at whichever of the following rates produces the greater amount of duty: 100 per cent. ad valorem or 10s. the pound or £5 the gallon (as the case may be).  Cosmetics are chargeable under this heading.</P>
    <P>Section 4 corresponds to Financial Resolution No. 4 and provides for doubling the customs duty on fur clothing.  The full rate is now 75 per cent. ad valorem and the preferential rate 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>Section 5, which corresponds to Financial Resolution No. 5, provides for an increase in the full rates of customs duty on wines to double the former rates. The preferential rates are also doubled.  The ratio of the preferential rates to the full rates varies from 50 per cent. to 70 per cent.</P>
    <P>Section 6, which corresponds to Financial Resolution No. 6, provides for an increase in the rates of customs and excise duties on spirits.  The duty on home-made spirits is now £6 17s. per proof gallon, an increase of £2 2s. on the duty imposed in 1946.  The customs duties are similarly increased.</P>
    <P>Section 7, which corresponds to Financial Resolution No. 7, provides for increases in the rates of customs <Col N="1425" /> and excise duties on tobacco, the basic increase being 6/8 per lb.</P>
    <P>Section 8, which corresponds to Financial Resolution No. 8, raises the entertainments duty at present in force on cinematographic and other forms of entertainments by approximately 100 per cent.  The new scales do not come into force until 16th January next owing to the necessity for printing new stamps and tickets.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10, which correspond to Financial Resolutions Nos. 9 and 10, provide for increases in the customs and excise duties on beer.  The increase in home manufactured beer and the effective increase in ordinary imported beers is £4 19s. 0d. per standard barrel of 36 gallons.  The sections also provide for a corresponding change in the drawback rate.</P>
    <P>Section 11: This section, in addition to confirming the new rates of motor vehicle duties mentioned in Resolution No. 12, provides that the increased rates shall not apply to small public service vehicles and certain other types of vehicle, e.g., travelling creamery, mobile crane, etc.</P>
    <P>Section 12: This section extends to mechanically-propelled vehicles used solely for transporting equipment of any kind for saving life at sea the exemption from road tax already enjoyed by vehicles used solely for hauling lifeboats and their gear.  As a corollary it is provided that a vehicle not used <i>solely</i> for these purposes will not become liable to a higher rate of duty merely by reason of such user.  Thus, an agricultural tractor taxed at £6 per annum will not become liable to a tax of £21 per annum merely because it is used at times to haul life-saving equipment of the coast life-saving service.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PART III&mdash;STAMP DUTIES.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides for an increase in the stamp duty chargeable on conveyances and transfers of lands, tenements and hereditaments where the conveyance is executed on or after 1st December, 1947.  The existing rate of £1 per cent. is increased gradually to £5 per cent. according as the consideration rises from £500 to £950.  The <Col N="1426" /> rate of £5 per cent. applies where the consideration exceeds £950.</P>
    <P>The special rate of duty&mdash;10/- per cent. applicable to conveyances where the consideration does not exceed £500 is being maintained.  The increased duty will not apply to conveyances from local authorities to tenant purchasers or to conveyances from public utility societies to their members.  Neither will it apply to voluntary dispositions in favour of lineal descendants nor to certain cases where the contract for sale was completed before the 29th October, 1947.</P>
    <P>If the person becoming entitled to the property is not an Irish citizen or does not come within certain other categories set out in sub-section (4) the rate of duty will be £25 per cent. and, in order to discourage evasion, such a person will be liable to payment of a sum equivalent to twice the amount of the duty chargeable on the conveyance if he fails to have it stamped at this higher rate.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PART IV&mdash;GENERAL.</P>
    <P>Section 14.  This section provides that the increase in the moneys accruing in the current financial year from motor vehicle duties as a result of the increase in rate (and estimated at £200,000) shall be diverted from the Road Fund to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Section 15 is the usual care and management section and Section 16 the usual section relating to the Short Title and construction of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing this Finance Bill, which embodies the Budget, and we are opposing it, frankly, because it is a sham and a humbug.  It is pretended that this Budget was brought in for the purpose of reducing the cost of living.  As is known to every person, this Budget increases the actual cost of living.  It is specifically designed to reduce the cost-of-living index figure.  I had expected that the Minister, instead of moving the Second Stage of the Finance Bill, would, in view of the events which have taken place since the Budget Resolutions <Col N="1427" /> were before us, have announced to the House that he was withdrawing this Budget.  It has been repudiated in the most emphatic way by the people outside.  If the Minister had any doubt in his mind when he framed and when he introduced his Budget Resolutions early last week as to what the general public thought, he, certainly, cannot be in any doubt now.  I want to assert that, if the Government, with their present majority, persist, against the expressed wishes of every Party in this House, in going ahead with these heavy additional taxes, they will not only be flouting a big section of the Dáil but flouting what they are so fond of prating about at other times &mdash;the will of the people, as ascertained last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat that this Budget is a humbug. It is pretended that it will reduce the cost of living.  Every sane person knows that it will increase the cost of living and of no section of the community more heavily than those least able to bear that increase.  On two items only, there is provision for additional taxation amounting almost to £3,000,000. I refer to tobacco and beer.  I am not thinking about champagne or other wines or whiskey.  In respect of tobacco and beer, additional taxation to the amount of £3,000,000 will be levied. We have now reached such a position with taxation that the most inferior tobacco on sale costs no less than 2/- per ounce.  The Minister has not even attempted to make a case for this tax. When the Budget was introduced, he did not attempt to make such a case. When the Budget Resolutions came up on Report, he refused to make such a case.  To-day, he contents himself with reading out short extracts to explain what each section of the Bill means. This Budget is a humbug in many ways but the greatest piece of humbug in it is, probably, the stamp duty.  The Minister, in the most muddled explanation I ever listened to from anybody, on the Report Stage of these Resolutions, tried to tell the House that the effect of increasing the stamp duty on our own nationals from 1 per cent. to 5 per cent. would be to reduce the price of houses.  He has no doubt whatever in his mind, he says, that that <Col N="1428" /> stamp duty will not affect the purchaser but will, in every case, be paid by the vendor.  I am talking for the moment about the 5 per cent. It is the greatest nonsense I ever heard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister disclaim his belief that it will reduce the price of houses.  Therefore, it is a revenue tax pure and simple.  When we want to collect more revenue on what do we choose to put the additional tax?  On the commodity which is in shortest supply&mdash; the most essential, perhaps, commodity in this country to-day&mdash;houses.  Mark you this.  The person that this is going to hit hardest is the person who has to buy the cheapest house on the market to-day because whatever chance there is of the vendor of the very expensive type of house or property having to pay a portion or a proportion of the additional stamp duty, there is such a shortage and such a tremendous demand for the cheaper type of house to-day that in every case, I assert, it means the purchaser will be paying anything from an additional £100 upwards.  The Minister talks about a gradual increase from 1 per cent. to 5 per cent.  Where is it raised&mdash; between £500 and £1,000?  What can you buy in the shape of property or houses in this country to-day for £500 or £1,000?  What it means is that the purchaser of a three or four-bedroomed house, which is the cheapest type of house on the market at the moment and on which, prior to the imposition of this Budget, he paid stamp duty of £20&mdash;if this House passes this Finance Bill and this particular section&mdash;will now pay £100. Apparently, I am sure it was my own fault, I was unable to make this particular point sufficiently clear to the Minister on the last occasion.  Let <Col N="1429" /> me take quite a common case.  A man is anxious to get a home.  He is pinching and scraping to get together the few hundred pounds to form the deposit for the purchase of the house and to borrow from the building society the maximum amount that he can get from it.</P>
      <P>In that man's case, every £5 note counts.  He finds himself in the position that he can buy a house to-day for £2,000 with £20 stamp duty while if he buys it to-morrow and if the sale is not closed before the 1st December he will pay £100 stamp duty. What does that mean?  It will mean that in order to pay that additional £80 many of those men will have to go on saving for six or maybe 12 months to put that additional £80 together and it will also mean that for those additional six or 12 months they will be without a home.  Let the House be under no illusion whatever.  I assert as definitely as I can that, particularly in regard to the cheaper type of house if you can use the word to-day in relation to any type of house, in every case this additional duty will be paid by the person who is purchasing the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say just one or two things about this invasion and this 25 per cent. tax.  I am not opposing it although I think it is stupid.  It is the wrong way of going about the matter.  It will not achieve its object.  There is another and effective way in which it could be done.  I would say, first, that this question of the invasion has been grossly exaggerated&mdash;grossly&mdash;and I say that with knowledge.  I am not saying it did not take place.  What I want to say, first, is that it has been grossly exaggerated&mdash;grossly exaggerated by some people for business reasons, by some people because they think it is news to put a streamer headline on a newspaper if they think some Indian Prince will buy it, and by other people for political reasons.  However, what is going to be the effect of this duty? I should say this, which should not be overlooked, and I say it with a certain amount of knowledge, that quite a considerable number of the so-called invaders, of those who came across from the other side and bought either house <Col N="1430" /> property or land in this country in the last two years were Irish people coming back from England and various parts of Britain.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that that is one of those meaningless, cheap gibes that means nothing.  I am telling Deputy Davin and he knows it, that a considerable number of the people who came over here, and were classed with the Duke of Westminster, were our own Irish people who had spent the last 10, 20, 30 or 40 years in England and elsewhere.  I know what I am talking about.  I do not say that that is the end of the story.  I do not say that there is not a necessity for putting some check on it, but if there is to be a check, let us have an effective one.  The only effect this will have is that it is going to get property in this country for foreigners at the same rate as they got it before this imposition, and that the stamp duty in the case of larger sums of money, say, £20,000 to £40,000, will be paid not by the invader but by the Irish owner of that property. Do not forget that.  As I say, this is not going to have the effect the Minister pretends he wants it to have.  I do not want to cover or go over all the ground again we covered on the Resolutions, but all this additional taxation of £5,000,000 is being put on, we are told, for the purpose of reducing the cost of living.  That has been worked out and the so-called relief will amount to about 1d. per head per day.  I venture to say that there is not an average person or an average family in this country that will not lose heavily on this Budget.  The Minister tells us that we should smoke less, that we should drink less and that we should go to the pictures less often or not go at all.  As I said on a former occasion we are a normal, average, plain people and we like to have an occasional drink and we like to have a smoke and we like occasionally to go to the pictures.  Is there any reason on this earth why we should not enjoy these things?  Is that just another of the fruits of Fianna Fáil's 15 years' administration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one way in which to reduce the cost of living&mdash;one effective <Col N="1431" /> way&mdash;and that is to reduce the crushing burden of taxation which is being piled on locally and nationally by the present Fianna Fáil Government. Again I assert to this House that it is costing between £80,000,000 and £85,000,000 in national and local taxation to run this country of less than 3,000,000 people.  No Minister will convince me that there is no room inside these immense figures for a very substantial saving.  This year we had a few fancy items in the Budget.  Might I remind the House that in the principal Budget this year we had one item of £2,000,000.  For what?  To reconstruct Dublin Castle so that we would be able to accommodate there 4,000 civil servants instead of the 1,000 e have there at the present time.  Have we nothing better to do with that £2,000,000 worth of material and labour both of which are in short supply?  Could it not be more usefully spent on building houses for the people?  We are going to spend £30,000 on the house in the Park to make it more luxurious.  I do not want to go through all these items but if we have to make a choice in this country of putting 2/- an ounce on tobacco for the old age pensioner and the blind pensioner and spending £2,000,000 on Dublin Castle and £30,000 on Arus an Uachtaráin I think we can all pretty well realise just where we stand.</P>

      <P>I know, but they are only going to spend part of it this year. There may be some people in this House who believe that this Budget is going to reduce the cost of living.  I am satisfied that it is going to represent a substantial increase in the cost of running the average home in this country.  I am quite satisfied on that. I have spoken to all classes of people throughout the country since this Budget was introduced, including people who neither smoke nor drink, and I have not heard one word said in favour of this Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any Minister who hopes to convince anybody in this House that you can reduce the cost of living by increasing taxation to the extent of an additional <Col N="1432" /> £5,000,000 is living in a fool's paradise. The Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Agriculture and some of our higher civil servants have spent quite a deal of time over the last two months in London discussing trade agreements and the exchange of goods between England and this country.  The only hope of any favourable exchange is by having increased production here and a greater output.  The Taoiseach has told us that himself.  He has said unequivocally that all we want is greater production and an increased output.  Can anybody with one grain of common sense suggest that it is possible to increase production by increasing the already existing crushing burden of taxation laid upon the entire country? The greatest incentive that can be given to production in agriculture or in industry is to reduce taxation.  Every time taxation is increased production machinery slows down.  The colossal sum collected in customs duties is a direct taxation on the people and has a more deterrent effect on production in this country than any other single item.  In the last analysis, is it not a fact that the biggest single factor and the most significant one is that this country, both nationally and locally, is grossly overtaxed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Morrissey, I am surprised that the Minister for Finance and the Government should proceed in pushing this Supplementary Budget through the House in view of the recent decision of the people.  The Minister knows better than anybody else that the people's vote in the recent three by-elections were cast on the basis of this wholly bad Budget.  Some people may suggest that the Locke Distillery case may have influenced the people in making their decision.  It had nothing whatever to do with it.  It was due solely to the Budget.  The Minister, if he is as candid on this occasion as he has been on so many occasions in the past, will tell the House what he heard from the people during his own tour of the country and will admit that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance introduced this Supplementary <Col N="1433" /> Budget.  The Taoiseach, in his opening speech, gave the impression that immediately he sat down the cost of living would automatically go back by 13 points to the figure at which it was supposedly to have stood in mid-May last.  Everybody knows that the cost of certain essential materials has increased since the introduction of this Supplementary Budget, quite apart from the increased prices charged for certain essential commodities arising out of the introduction of this Budget.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister if he is not aware and if his advisers have not informed him that following on the increased duty on tobacco and beer there is likely to be a considerable reduction in consumption, irrespective of whether they are essential commodities or otherwise. Those people engaged in the selling of tobacco or beer will tell you that consumption has gone down considerably. If that is even partially true the Minister is not going to get the estimated revenue under this Supplementary Budget.  The Taoiseach told the House&mdash;and it was not merely the House but also the workers of this country&mdash;that this Budget was really introduced for the purpose of preventing further inflationary tendencies.  He told them that if this policy of allowing wages to race after prices were allowed to go on we were running headlong towards a crisis.  He gave the people the impression that the real cause of inflation is the attempt on the part of the wage earners to get some compensation for the increased cost of living. But that is not the whole story with regard to inflation.  There are other and much more dangerous inflationary factors which are not dealt with under this Budget at all.  Perhaps they are dealt with to some slight extent.</P>
    <P>We had a statement in the House of Commons yesterday from the British Chancellor of the Exchequer&mdash;the new-found friend of the Minister for Finance&mdash;that during the last 12 months there has been a transfer of £10,000,000 to this country by the people who left the country in 1922, in 1932 and in 1939 because they disagreed with the policy of the particular Government of the time for one, two or three different reasons.  Some of them, even though Irish-born, went to <Col N="1434" /> their spiritual home when we got some limited measure of freedom in 1922. Another batch left our shores in 1932 because they disagreed with the newlyelected Government&mdash;the Government which is still in office and which is responsible for this Supplementary Budget.  In 1939 a still bigger number left the country because they disagreed with the policy of the people on the question of neutrality.  Deputy Morrissey says that this thing is exaggerated. I am reliably informed when I say that during the first nine months of this year, apart altogether from last year, almost 600 furniture vans and containers were brought into this country at the North Wall by one cross-channel shipping company.  It is not the contents of the furniture vans but the contents of the pockets of the people who own them that is one of the principal causes of inflation here.  Contrary to the expressed land division policy of the Government, these people have been allowed to come in here and to purchase land, houses, food and every other commodity against our own people who have no money or very little money.  They have been allowed thus to increase the cost of living and the cost of houses and land and every commodity that money can buy.  I have been challenging the attitude and policy of the Government for the last three or four years in the matter of the suspension of land division.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is associated very definitely, if you will allow me, with the tax of 25 per cent. contained in this Supplementary Budget.  If you will allow me to develop the point, I will not detain you very long.  The Minister for Lands has told us that the Government&mdash;and it is the Government that is responsible for this Budget&mdash; could not see their way to resume land division activities unless and until the price of land was pushed back, as far as it possibly could be pushed back, to its pre-war value.  How can it be pushed back to its pre-war value if non-nationals are allowed to come in here in large numbers with millions in <Col N="1435" /> their pockets and to compete for land against nationals and thus put up the price of land&mdash;which is supposed to be quite contrary to the Land Commission policy in relation to the acquisition and division of land?</P>
      <P>This case cannot be exaggerated.  The 25 per cent. tax provided in the Supplementary Budget may go some way to curb the activities of these people but I do not think it goes far enough. If the Government desire to resume the acquisition and division of land for the benefit of nationals, further and more effective steps will have to be taken. It is a very serious matter and has a great deal to do with the inflationary tendencies that prevail.  It has much more to do with it than has the matter of increased wages.</P>
      <P>As far as I can see, what is wanted in this country is that money should be rationed amongst the poorer sections of the community.  Half a million people are forced to live on low State incomes: old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, national health insurance benefit, unemployment assistance, and unemployment insurance benefit.  Nearly 500,000 people are obliged to exist on the amount of food these low incomes can purchase.  As to the position in Great Britain, while there is a shortage of essential commodies there, everybody has a minimum ration.  Everybody has not got that here.  I do not say that we should copy everything that is being done across the Channel but the surest way to implement the rights of the citizens under the Constitution, namely, the right to food, clothing and shelter is, if you cannot give them food at a price which they can afford to pay, to ration money in order to enable them to get the wherewithal to keep body and soul together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had, and will have for some time, people paid by the Government to operate a means test, to prevent people in receipt of low State incomes from getting this miserable maximum allowance laid down by regulation.  I have come across some scandalous cases of that kind in recent times. From what I know of the Minister, personally, I would not like to say that <Col N="1436" /> he would stand for it.  Take the case where a 5/- pension of a widow in a rural area was reduced to 3/- because charitable neighbours are prepared to give here a couple of shillings per week for doing a simple job.  I have come across a case recently where the 5/- was reduced to 3/- and where the person concerned has to pay a rent of 3/- per week.  Yet we are called Christians and this is supposed to be a Christian country and it is a workers' Government that is responsible for this kind of thing.  The Government will answer for a lot of this in the coming months or whenever they face the people again and, unless this Supplementary Budget is withdrawn or altered to suit the requirements of a nation with a peasant population, this is the writing on the wall.  I hope that the Minister and his Government do not imagine that this 25 per cent. tax on non-nationals who purchase land, houses and everything else in this country will stop that form of inflation.</P>
    <P>We have wages chasing prices.  Wages is always the trouble and when the workers, as a last resort&mdash;and it is always a last resort as far as my experience goes&mdash;strike in order to enforce their rights they get new names from some of the people who sit on the Government Front Bench.</P>
    <P>Housing also is a very serious matter at the moment, and I am inclined to think that the Government have been doing very little to enable local authorities to commence housing operations where local authorities have schemes ready to put into operation.  I am talking about housing for the poorer classes.</P>

I want to know from the Minister for Finance, when he is replying, what his own experience is or whether he asserts&mdash;if so, let him produce evidence to prove it&mdash;that the cost of living has actually dropped 13 points since the introduction of this Budget, or what is the new wages policy of the Government if they have any policy in connection with wages and prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said before&mdash;I do not think I said it here&mdash;that the majority of the workers of the country, even those who were forced to live on low wages in preemergency days, would far prefer to go back to the pre-war standard of living and wages rather than tolerate the present impossible state of affairs.  The purchasing power of the £ to-day for the wife of the average wage earner is far less than is indicated by the index number which is supposed to expose the real cost of living.  That is only a paper figure.  When the wife of the wage earner goes to the local shop for essential commodities she finds the <Col N="1438" /> price of those commodities far removed from the figure taken in estimating this miraculous cost of living number that is prepared and published by the Government.</P>
    <P>Can we have any assurance from the Minister that something effective will be done in the immediate future to bring the cost of clothing down to a reasonable figure and to cut out the excessive profits that undoubtedly were received during the whole of the emergency by those engaged on the retail side of the drapery trade?  I have seen evidence myself where such retailers have been allowed to get away with a 100 per cent. profit.  If the Minister is really anxious to get proof of that he should instruct his inspectors, and get more inspectors if necessary, to check up on the prices charged by the clothing manufacturers and the prices charged to the ordinary members of the community by retail drapers.  Where did the money come from that the Government collected in excess profits?  No one knows that better than the Minister for Finance.  I throw out a friendly challenge to him to give detailed particulars as to the sections of the community from whom he collected nearly £50,000,000 during the six year period of the emergency.  The Government dropped the excess profits tax, and now they come along with this Supplementary Budget putting up the price of beer and tobacco on the poorer sections of the community.</P>
    <P>I have worked nearly all my life at the Port of Dublin where about 12,000 dockers of every kind are employed. The Minister would not parade along the North Wall and receive any cheers from the dockers of Dublin after he had introduced this Budget.  The pint of beer or the pint of stout is an essential food for the average worker in the country, whether he is employed at the Port of Dublin or at any other port or in rural areas.</P>
    <P>In Dublin the average wage earner lives a distance of five or six miles from the port.  He is away from his home from 7 o'clock in the morning until 7 o'clock at night.  In the case of the majority of them the only food they have during that period is a sandwich and a bottle of stout or a pint of <Col N="1439" /> beer.  They did not say any prayers for the Minister when they read his speech introducing this Supplementary Budget.</P>
    <P>I think that this money could have been found in some other way, for example from the gentlemen, and they must be gentlemen, who have more than doubled our bank deposits since the commencement of the emergency over six years ago.  Bank deposits to-day are two and a half times higher than the figure at which they stood in September, 1939.  Why does not the Minister collect some part of the £5,000,000 that he is seeking under this Finance Bill from the working class people from those other people who have increased our bank deposits by two and a half times as compared to the pre-war figure?  The Minister must not have reliable information in connection with the position of our banks because otherwise he would not have supported the bank directors in the recent dispute against the bank officials.</P>

      <P>It is a fair representation of the attitude of the Government towards the average wage-earner of the country.  That attitude is fairly well represented in this Budget because about three-quarters of the £5,000,000 which is to be raised under this Supplementary Budget is to come out of the pockets of the average wageearners and workers of the country. They are going to have their wages pegged down to the figure at which they stood on the 15th October, according to the Taoiseach's speech.</P>
      <P>I have a fairly good knowledge of what is going on in my own area.  It was not necessary for me to make any detailed inquiries about it, and I can say this that there are workers in my constituency who did not receive as much as one penny of an increase in their wages from their employers since the commencement of the emergency. That applies to certain people who try to cover themselves up by giving a subscription to the St. Vincent de Paul Society and to other charitable organisations and getting their names published.</P>

      <P>It would be far better if they would pay their workers a decent living wage instead of advertising themselves by giving subscriptions to these charitable organisations.  I know workers who received an increase of only 5/- on their pre-war wage of £2 10s.  But while that is so, the Minister and his Government saw fit to increase Ministerial salaries and the salaries of highly-paid State officials by not less than 25 per cent. and by 30 per cent. in some cases.  This Budget was not born in the mind of any man who can prove that he is a member of a workers' Government.  I am amazed that, after the three to one vote that was given against the Government in the recent by-elections, the Minister should persist in pushing this Supplementary Budget through the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>We are familiar with the statement that you cannot fool all the people all the time.  The Minister, in this Budget, has been attempting to fool the great bulk of the people, down at least to the time of the recent by-elections. The result of those struck back like a boomerang.  I do not think that the bulk of the people minded so much being made fools of as being ridiculed.  Did the Government think that the people would be fooled by the camouflage the Minister tried to put over on them in this Budget? The ordinary citizen resents ridicule of that kind.  I think every citizen realises that, instead of affording any relief whatever to the ordinary family, this Budget will mean an imposition on it.  With Deputy Davin, I do not believe that this Budget is going to mean a 10 per cent. or indeed any other percentage reduction in the actual cost of living for the average family in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer in particular to the increases in the tax on tobacco and beer.  Deputy Morrissey said that the average person in this State was opposed to this Bill.  Even non-drinkers are opposed to it.  I speak as a non-drinker and, I think, for the majority of non-drinkers or temperance people.  I think that a good many temperance people are not at all temperate <Col N="1441" /> in the opinions which they express. Speaking for non-drinkers, I am of the opinion that we can describe the increased tax on beer as an iniquitous tax.</P>
    <P>Some days ago I challenged the Minister to define the difference between a luxury and a necessity.  He did not do so.  A pint of beer or a pint of stout is a necessity for the ordinary working man whether he is employed at any of our ports or engaged on hard work elsewhere.  The meagre ounce of common tobacco is a necessity for the majority of our workers.  Most of them have been smoking for the last 40 or 50 years. They commenced to smoke when tobacco was very cheap, so that now a smoke is a necessity for the great bulk of our people.  Of course, the Minister has said that if a man does not smoke or drink he will not have to pay any of this tax and need not feel the effects of it.  He might have gone further and said that if they live on bread and water they can easily manage on their present income, and that the cost of living will not matter much to them.</P>
    <P>There are a good many families at the bread-and-water point now.  There are a good many poor people in Dublin, Limerick and Cork who are really at the bread-and-water point.  Milk in Dublin is in many cases unobtainable. The same applies to Limerick and Cork.  Butter is rationed to two or three ounces and, if they are lucky, they will get it.  The poor people in some parts of Dublin that I know of who used to live on bread and tea coloured with milk are now practically existing on a bread-and-water ration, because they have very little butter and practically no milk.  The Minister said that if people gave up drinking and smoking they could exist.  He might have gone further and said that the people could do without the ordinary amenities of life and live on bread and water and they would be all well off. It is an extraordinary statement for a responsible Minister to make, that if people could give up what have become necessities for the majority of the people, they would be better off.</P>
    <P>If there was nothing else in this Budget <Col N="1442" /> but these taxes on beer and tobacco I would vote against it.  I think it is an imposition on the majority of the people.  I can only describe it as an iniquitous camouflage; an attempt to bamboozle a certain section of the people into believing that these taxes will benefit them by reducing the cost of living.  During the election I quoted an incident that happened to myself and I think it describes the situation fairly well.  I happened to visit a certain house some months ago where there were three children ranging from two to four years of age.  As many a man does when he visits a house, I gave the eldest child a shilling.  But the daddy took the shilling from him and gave each of the children three pennies. The children forgot all about me and were all over the daddy, they were so delighted at the economic revolution which gave them big money for little money.  That is the sort of thing that the Minister is trying to put over on the people of the country.  The Government have been trying to do it for 15 years, but the boomerang has come back with a bound.</P>
    <P>Bad as are the taxes on beer and tobacco, the last section, Section 13, caps all.  Some people have to do without their bottle of stout and their smoke, but what about the young people who are hoping to get married? The tax on the sale of a house is not alone a tax on savings, but to a certain extent a tax on borrowing.  Many a young couple have been saving up for years to buy a house; the girl tries to save as well as the man.  Very few houses can be bought at present under £2,000.  The Minister said that this tax will not be payable on a £500 house. As I interjected when Deputy Morrissey was speaking, you could not buy any house for £500 except a doll's house or dog's house.  Any kind of a decent house will run into £2,000.  The tax on the sale of a £2,000 house will be £100. The Minister suggested the last day&mdash; he tried to run away from it to-day&mdash; that a person buying a house who had to pay £80 extra in tax would pay £80 less for the house.  The Minister is trying to insult the intelligence of Deputies when he makes a statement like that.  The Minister cannot go back on it because I took it down when he <Col N="1443" /> was speaking.  He said that the man who was buying a £2,000 house and who had to pay 5 per cent. stamp duty instead of 1 per cent., or £80 more, would pay £80 less for the house.  The Minister forgets that there is such a thing as competition, that if there is a house for sale at the moment there are probably 20 people trying to buy it, and most of them are not perturbed about the extra £80.  On the other hand, many people trying to buy a £2,000 house have not got the money.  They have to go to a bank or to some building society to borrow half of it or more than half.  Very few young couples who are getting married have got the full price of the house and they have to borrow the money.  The Minister is taxing these people, not alone on any savings they may have but on the money they are borrowing, by putting an extra 4 per cent. tax on the transfer.</P>
    <P>This Budget will put a great many people on the bread-and-water line. They will have to deny themselves some things that cannot be really classed as luxuries, such as a pint of stout for the working man or a smoke for the ordinary person.  Smoking has become a necessity for many people, even for a great many women.</P>
    <P>I believe that some of them could not give up smoking now.  It has become such a habit with them that it is almost a necessity.  The Minister H.M. tells all these people that if they do not smoke or drink they will not be paying anything extra in taxation.  He tells the people who want to buy a house that if he puts an £80 tax on the sale of a house they need not pay it; that all they have to do is to pay £80 less for the house.  One might preach that sort of economics on the roadside on a wet day when the people's attention was diverted.  It is a sort of economics that you cannot put over on people who have come at last to realise that they have been fooled long enough and are determined that they will not be fooled any longer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the only excuse given for introducing this Supplementary Budget was that it was necessary in order to reduce the cost <Col N="1444" /> of living.  Our cost of living has gone up nominally by 82 per cent., but, in fact, by about 120 per cent. on the 1938 figures.  The reduction proposed by the Government in the cost of living will enable a person to save less than 1d. per day.  But, if that person smokes or drinks or goes to the pictures, then the cost of living of that person is increased.  No reduction in the cost of living of less than 30 per cent. would have the slightest value, having regard to present conditions.  We allowed our cost of living to rise, in reality, by approximately 120 per cent. since the war began.  Wages and salaries on the average rose by 40 to 50 per cent. and 60 per cent. in some cases.  At all times, our cost-of-living figure was allowed to soar above the rate of the increase in wages.  We are living next door to a country which is competing for labour. In Britain the cost of living has gone up by only 31 per cent. since the war began.  Wages, on the other hand, have gone up by 67 per cent.  In other words, in Britain at all times the increase in wages and salaries was twice the increase in the cost of living. That is the fundamental cause of emigration. The fundamental cause of emigration here is that we allowed a position to develop whereby the wageearners, the small farmers, the agricultural labourers, were unable to earn an economic living in this country, whereas they were able to go across to England to earn an economic living there which enabled them to send money home.  Therefore, if we really want to stop emigration, we must reduce the cost of living to at least the level which prevails in the neighbouring island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any reduction in the cost of living of one penny per day is childishly futile, stupid, nonsensical and a waste of money on the administration of the new taxes.  In any case, this Budget is introduced on the basis that smoking, going to the pictures once a week, or taking a pint is a luxury.  We are living in the twentieth century.  People do go to the pictures.  Every section of the community is entitled to go to the pictures and to enjoy themselves. Every section of the community is entitled to smoke and is entitled to <Col N="1445" /> have an odd pint, and to some, as Deputy Davin and the last speaker said, the pint is no luxury, to the working man, the farm labourer in the country or the docker in the city.  A pint is part of his regular diet and yet that is one of the things being taxed.</P>
    <P>We have heard about the hair-shirt policy, about tightening our belts and generally about undergoing a period of austerity.  Yes, that might be necessary; but, if it is necessary, what justification is there for the Ministers of this Government to increase their salaries by £10 a week and what justification is there for members of this House to increase their salaries by 120 per cent. since the war began?  Is that the example which any Government or any Parliament should give to its nation in a time of crisis?  I would suggest that, before introducing a Budget of this kind, the Government should come to this House and say: &ldquo;We are returning to the Exchequer the £10 a week we gave ourselves three months ago.&rdquo;  If the Government did that, if the Government tightened their own belts and if this House tightened its own belt, the people would possibly understand the introduction of a Budget of this kind.  Otherwise, the people will naturally look upon advice concerning austerity and the tightening of belts as being sheer hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>There are other methods of raising taxation.  One of the reasons for the increased cost of living, certainly in our cities, is the influx of tourists, of foreigners, who, quite naturally, come in here because they can buy more food and various luxury articles.  Why not tax the tourist traffic?  Why not have a purchase tax on luxury articles?  Why not tax the exports taken away by these tourists?  I suggest that if a purchase tax were put on luxury articles, it would yield a return more than enough to meet adequate food subsidies.</P>
    <P>The question of the influx of persons from England to purchase property here was brought up by one of the Deputies who suggested that it was exaggerated or did not exist.  I think the House saw the statement in to-day's paper that at least £10,000,000 had been sent over here from England in the past year and the House will also have read <Col N="1446" /> Sergeant A.M. Sullivan's letter which appeared in one Irish paper some time ago and which indicated that the people coming over here with money to purchase property were of an undesirable type.  That such a traffic exists and that such a traffic must be fairly considerable is evidenced by the fact that at least one firm of auctioneers puts advertisements in our daily newspapers and in English newspapers, giving the address of its London office&mdash;a firm of auctioneers, one of whose leading members is not very far removed from the Government Benches.  What about increasing the taxation on the profits from these sales ?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express agreement with most of what has been said by the last speaker.  I think this is the craziest Budget that has ever been introduced in this or any country. Here we have a proposal to reduce the cost of living, to assist the ordinary worker to survive through difficult times.  Yet the net result of that proposal is to increase the cost of living for practically every household in this State.  The Minister and other Ministers have said that we could avoid the new taxes by giving up the various <Col N="1447" /> luxuries that have been taxed.  Can a man who has been smoking for 40 or 50 years give up smoking?  Can a man who has been accustomed to a pint or a bottle of stout, now and then, reasonably be expected to renounce that small pleasure?  Can we bring about some system by which we can avoid the sale or purchase of land or of houses?  If a person wants a house to live in, can that person obtain a house without purchasing it?  Surely the Minister insults the intelligence of the people of the country when he suggests that we can avoid purchasing the things that are now taxed?</P>
      <P>No really serious attempt has yet been made, and no serious attempt is made in this Budget, to bring down the cost of living.  We know that much more far-reaching measures have been adopted in Great Britain ever since the onset of the emergency and that these measures have kept the cost of living considerably below what it is in this country.  Here everything that could, and did, tend to raise the cost of living has been allowed to go unchecked.  The influx of what I would not call normal tourists but emergency tourists, has been encouraged and promoted.  The normal tourist trade is a good trade for any country, particularly for a small nation such as ours with an exportable surplus of food in normal times, but the type of emergency tourist trade created during the war and that has continued up to the present is no benefit whatever because the things we are exporting through that tourist trade are commodities which are in short supply. Tourists are being fed on bacon, butter, bread and many other essentials which are rationed and of which there are not sufficient supplies in this country to meet our own needs.  In addition to that, excessive prices are being paid for those commodities by these tourists. That is causing inflation and is forcing up the cost of living.  In the same way, we have permitted racketeering to be carried on in connection with our fuel supplies.  I think nothing has contributed more to an increase in the cost of living than the profiteering which has been permitted in the distribution and transport of fuel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1448" /> I think the Minister should give serious attention to the decision which was registered by the people in the past week.  After all, the people are well qualified to decide what is right and what is wrong.  They have expressed an opinion on this Budget in a very emphatic manner and I think that opinion should be respectfully accepted by the Minister.  It is necessary, of course, to subsidise food but we ought to devise more equitable methods of providing the necessary money.  We could have provided the money necessary by a little economy in our various public services.  We have failed to do that and the alternative, therefore, was to impose taxes which do not press so heavily on the poor.  At least 70 or 80 per cent. of the money raised for the purpose of subsidising food under this Budget is being taken from the ordinary working people in the form of taxation on beer and tobacco.  It has been already pointed out that we allowed excess profits to escape absolutely from taxation.  We handed back to the people who have been making excess profits enormous sums which accrued to them during the past two years.  I think that that handing back of money to those people and the consequent imposition of a severe burden upon the ordinary working people cannot by any stretch of the imagination be justified.  There is no evidence whatever that the people who have been making excess profits have returned these profits to industry or utilised them for the expansion of their industries.  Do we not all know perfectly well that the greatest profits made during the emergency period were made out of smart deals in commodities in short supply and smart deals in real estate?  Those excessive profits have been simply handed over to the smart people who made them. We can rest assured that not 5 per cent. of the money extracted by these profiteers will be utilised for either the extension or development of industry with a view to increasing production.</P>
    <P>Nothing is more urgently needed at the present time, particularly in view of the agreement negotiated with the British Government, than a vast expansion in agricultural production. <Col N="1449" /> How is that expansion to be brought about or is there anything in the Budget to provide for it?  There is a small subsidy on fertilisers which will have the effect only of preventing these fertilisers from costing more than they did last year.  Would it not be desirable to consider ways and means of bringing down the cost of fertilisers and encouraging the utilisation of much more phosphates and lime than have been put into the land for a long period ?</P>
    <P>Surely whatever supplies of phosphates can be obtained from any source or whatever supplies of lime can be produced in this country should be applied to the land right now.  So far as I can see, nothing worth-while is being done.  A farmer whose land is poor is usually a poor farmer.  That creates a vicious circle.  No indication was given by the Minister either when introducing the Budget or at any time that any step would be taken to increase the equipment of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Nothing is more urgently needed at the present time than increased capitalisation in agriculture.  More money must be put into fertilisers, lime, farm buildings and good-quality seeds.  These are essentials if we are to bring about that progress in agricultural production that is so urgently needed.  But there is no trace of any awareness on the part of the Government of those urgent needs.  We have sent across our representatives to try to recapture the market that we thanked Divine Providence was gone and gone for ever some years ago.  We have made provision for the utilisation of those &ldquo;damn ships&rdquo; that the Minister was so joyful had been sunk.  We are trying now to build up some kind of a foreign trade, an exchange of our surplus for the things we so urgently need. But we are in the unhappy position that we have not a surplus of anything, with the exception of live stock.</P>
    <P>Real attention to the poorer land, to the land that is impoverished, to the land that has been drained of its fertility during the emergency, to the land which forms a great portion of our national assets would tend, in the course of a year or two, to increase our supply of food for home use and a surplus for <Col N="1450" /> exchange, but no attempt is being made to assist those who own the poorer land and who are trying to work it.  They are simply to be bludgeoned and coerced.  In many cases farmers are compelled to grow wheat, notwithstanding that that compulsion results in putting good seed suitable for milling into the land and reaping no return. Is not that sheer waste, sheer folly?  Is it not time there was a more realistic approach to the problem of expanding production ?</P>
    <P>We have permitted into this country millions of pounds' worth of unnecessary goods from the dollar area and other parts of the world.  We see the big warehouses in the cities and towns packed with the products of North and South America and elsewhere.  What useful purpose has been served by permitting such an enormous quantity of goods into the country, goods which, I believe, could be done without?  There has been altogether too large an import of commodities from the dollar areas.</P>
    <P>I believe our Ministers have been lacking in their duty.  They have failed ignominiously to realise that our best trade is an exchange trade with Great Britain.  It is only now, two years after the cessation of hostilities, that they are beginning to wake up.  There is a national appeal to all sections of the community to tighten their belts and to refrain from demanding higher remuneration.  A Standstill Order is to be imposed, either by agreement or by compulsion, upon all workers.  Why was it not imposed before the legislation was introduced which increased the salaries of the higher-paid people in this State?  Surely, if there is to be a tightening of the belt, it should begin with those who have the widest belts. Surely, the tightening should not begin with unfortunate people who are struggling to make a living upon the land or with the manual workers in the towns and cities.</P>
    <P>All our Government has to say in support of this Budget is: &ldquo;Let the worker make sacrifices on behalf of his wife and family; let him give up his smoking or his pint or bottle of stout.&rdquo; Should not there be some equitable distribution of the sacrifice?  Should <Col N="1451" /> we not ask those who squander large sums on luxuries, those with high incomes derived mainly from an exploitation of the emergency situation, to make some sacrifice?  The first call should be to those people to tighten their belts and give up some of their ill-gotten gains to enable the poorer sections of the community to survive.</P>
    <P>The poor man's smoke is not a luxury.  It has gone long past the stage when anybody can describe the tobacco smoked by the working man after a heavy day's work or during his lunch interval as a luxury.  The time ought to be past when we can regard stout or beer, taken in moderation, as a luxury.  I think the time ought to be past when we can regard an occasional visit to the pictures as a luxury.  Take the unfortunate people living in crowded slums.  What break have they from conditions of squalor?  Once a week they may visit the local cinema.</P>
    <P>There is also this aspect.  For the very poor in the cold winter months the cinema possesses this attraction. It is heated and they can visit it at a reasonable price.  Surely, the poor struggling people are entitled to that small amenity.  During the emergency they cannot afford to heat their homes as they should be heated.  They cannot afford fuel in the winter sufficient to enable them to enjoy the necessary warmth.  They obtain that small comfort&mdash;it is not a luxury&mdash;in the local cinema, and yet the Government seek to deprive them of that.</P>
    <P>We talk about the flight from the land.  In every town and village cinemas have been erected.  The Government are forcing those small cinemas to close down.  I think that will be one of the results of the increase in the cinema tax.  It will compel the people in those areas to turn their eyes towards the larger towns and the cities if they want to enjoy any little amenity such as a cinema.  Everything is being done to make rural life more drab and dreary, to deprive the worker in the rural area of the small so-called luxuries to which he has become accustomed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1452" /> This unnecessary impost upon these people could have been avoided if there were a Minister in control of the Department of Finance who had some vision, some imagination, some ordinary common sense.  Surely he could have envisaged a means of financing these various small subsidies without putting a crushing burden upon the poor and upon the workers?  It must inevitably make this country poorer by depressing production, which depends upon and demands the wholehearted effort of the lowly-paid manual worker whether he is a small farmer working on the land or a manual worker in a factory or on the bog.  Our wealth inevitably depends on the amount of energy and effort he puts into his job.  If we cause widespread discontent amongst those vital workers, we are only driving down the whole standard of living by putting down the standard of national output. We ought to realise that this is a vital matter, that you cannot go on crushing the most deserving and most useful section of the community without creating or adding to the general poverty of the entire community.  No more butter will be produced for home use or for export, no more wheat or other cereals will be produced from the land, no more turf will be produced from the bogs, unless the workers engaged on those lines of production are given the necessary incentive and encouragement to work.  You can do as they do in Russia&mdash;you can drive workers with a machine-gun; but I do not think that even our crazy Minister for Finance would attempt such a policy at the present time.</P>
    <P>The only alternative is to encourage production by incentive and inducement and that is what the Government is absolutely failing to do.  They have turned their backs upon the policy of incentive, of giving a reasonable inducement to producers, and have adopted a policy of imposing hardship on those people.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is all a mistake on the part of the Government regarding the psychology of our people.  Perhaps they were considering how well Mr. Churchill succeeded with his policy of &ldquo;blood and tears and toil and sweat&rdquo; when Britain was in a grave emergency. <Col N="1453" /> Perhaps the Minister for Finance fancies himself as a sort of imitation Winston Churchill and thought that, if he made an appeal and offered the people &ldquo;blood and tears and toil and sweat&rdquo;, they would rise up and say he was a magnificent national leader. I do not think the Minister has calculated wisely.  &ldquo;Blood and tears and toil and sweat&rdquo; may be very good when a nation is faced with imminent invasion; but when you seek to impose a policy of that kind upon one section of the community two years after the cessation of hostilities and allow another section to grow fat and rich, it will not impress anybody.  The sooner the Minister realises that the people have spoken sensibly and emphatically in regard to this Budget, the sooner we will get down to a more sensible policy for the financing of this State and the development of both agriculture and industry.</P>

      <P>This Supplementary Budget was introduced under the plea that it was to decrease inflation. Most Deputies cannot see how it will do that.  In fact, it probably will have quite the opposite effect.  Some of the previous speakers have referred in detail to the increased cost of the various items and the effect it will have, but I want rather to look on the Budget as a whole and address my remarks to that side of the question. This is a Supplementary Budget&mdash;and supplementaries are pretty rare, thank goodness&mdash;but there is another aspect that makes it rather peculiar.  In addition to the introductory speech from the Minister in the ordinary way, the Taoiseach gave us a special speech on one aspect of the question.  He said that, in so far as increases in wages were occurring, it was having its effect on the cost of items.  Of course, that cannot be denied, but I am wondering why we had a speech from the Taoiseach as part of this Budget and if we are going to hear any more of that during the passage of the Bill.  I would ask the Minister, when he is replying, to let us hear when we will have a further instalment of the speech that was used in introducing this Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an aspect which has raised a number of issues.  I think the economist would tell us that some of the <Col N="1454" /> ways to avoid inflation are balancing a Budget, decreasing taxation or increasing production.  Instead of this Budget decreasing taxation, it increases it.  Various speakers have told us that, on balance, there is no average family in the country which will not be hit by the effects of this Budget.  The utmost that was claimed for it was that it would transfer some of the burdens from the backs of one section of the community to those of another.  It is really doubtful that the section of the community that would bear the brunt of these taxes is not the section of the community it was intended to relieve. There is another matter to which I want to refer&mdash;increased production.  I am afraid that this Government are very remiss in their long-range policy. They seem to wait until something happens.  Then, they think of what is the easiest and quickest way of dealing with it and pass on to the next matter. Why I refer to increased production is that we have rather a peculiar situation here.  It is, I think, quite different from that which prevails across the water.  We have a surplus of unskilled labour and a shortage of skilled labour. I should like to make a suggestion to the Taoiseach, because he is, I think, the person who made the portion of the Budget speech to which my remarks would more properly apply.  The unemployed, unskilled workers have constituted a problem for many years with us.</P>
    <P>Shortage of skilled labour is really only a problem of the past few years. The skilled trades have organisations which extend across the water and they bring before their members shortages which occur in particular districts.  A bigger percentage of skilled labour than of unskilled labour has, I think, been taken from us.  The skilled workers are very hesitant about coming back to this country.  They are in a position to pick and choose.  People looking for skilled labour across the water have often put advertisements in papers over there for the class of labour which they were seeking.  They would get replies somewhat like this: &ldquo;Dear Sir, I wish to offer my services and wish to know particulars of the post.&rdquo;  There follow some details which would not interest Deputies as <Col N="1455" /> to the age and qualifications of the applicant.  Then, he comes down to rates of pay, which is very natural, and goes on to ask what the prospect of getting accommodation here is and also if income-tax will be deducted from his pay.  I merely mention that to show that some of the people on the other side are in a position to pick and choose and that they will not come back to this country until they feel that conditions here are comparable with those on the other side.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another aspect of the matter&mdash;the production of skilled workers at a greater rate.  If we have to export workers, or if they have to leave the country, we are, I think, all agreed that it is better they should leave as skilled rather than as unskilled workers.  Before the war, when times were bad, there was, I think, in most cases agreement as to the rates of entry into the skilled trades.  The skilled trades fought very hard to keep those rates at a level which they considered would be just sufficient to supply the wastage.  Now, we are in a position in which the sky is the limit so far as skilled workers are concerned.  That is one of the ways, we are told, in which the effects of inflation could be reduced, and yet, it seems to me that, over a series of years, the Government have done nothing along those lines except hold up their hands in horror at the difficulties in embarking on certain enterprises. They have shown no eagerness to embark on a long-range policy which would do service both to their countrymen and to the country.</P>

      <P>Ag éisteacht leis an díospóireacht seo dhom, tháinic cúpla smaoineamh isteach i mo cheann.  Listening in particular to Deputy Cogan and his complaint about going into the dollar pool to get imports I cannot reconcile that fact with his complaint about the price of the cinemas.  Since the war the local cinema has grown up and has smashed and bankrupted the travelling companies and left them on the unemployed list.  They have smashed the local dramatic societies and drama festivals which were an asset to rural <Col N="1456" /> life.  Then he complained about imports from North America and South America and chided the Minister about his shipments.  One of our biggest imports are films from Hollywood and one of the biggest losses to this country is the constant and increased import of films.  It is money going with no return.  The travelling companies of native Irish men and women who are a credit to the country and who have their origins in the Abbey Theatre have been smashed in the last two or three years by the mushroom growth of the local cinema.  We hear complaints of the cost of beer and tobacco and the cinema.  One Deputy, in comparing the cost of living in Great Britain and Ireland, included in the cost of living in Ireland the cost of beer, tobacco and the cinema but excluded them in the case of Britain.  I challenged that.  It is a fact that the cinema, even with this new tax, is far dearer in Great Britain and will continue to be dearer.  Beer and tobacco are also dearer.  We have heard a Miserere sung on the Budget last week and this week but the country was never more prosperous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we have a mean complaint&mdash;a statement from a Deputy about a firm of auctioneers who advertise in the English papers that they have farms and estates for sale.  It is a well-known fact that the leading auctioneers in this city have offices in England and use every paper from the <i>Yorkshire Post</i> to the London <i>Times</i> to advertise estates.  I know local <Col N="1457" /> auctioneers who are not in a very big way in my place who sold farms to English people because they advertised in the English papers.  But one particular firm has been singled out as a black sheep, as the only firm to have carried out this practice in recent years.</P>
      <P>With regard to the beer, I am in the licensed trade and make my living by it.  It is a fact that within the past year we were without beer two days a week. Because the people have money to burn, the consumption of beer has gone up all over the country.  On Mondays and Tuesdays during the summer, publicans in rural areas and in Dublin were without beer and they were weeks without whiskey.  The pound note and the five-pound note were produced by Irish nationals to give them beer or whiskey or the dearest drinks.  We have heard a lot about hardships but I can tell you this, that on Christmas Eve every publican's shelves will be bare.  Everything Guinness and Jameson can turn out will be drunk.  We cannot conscientiously talk about imports and go on with the advocacy that allows that sort of thing to exist.  This Budget is a blessing in the ordinary home where there is a large family, seven or eight kids, as the price of the loaf and of tea has decreased.</P>

      <P>Of course Deputy Kennedy is all right.  He is a publican and he is a member of the Dáil, but if he goes down to the ordinary publican in rural Ireland who is not a member of the Dáil, he will find the shop empty.  At the moment there is a lot of unemployment in bottling factories owing to the Supplementary Budget. We must face facts.  There are unemployed people looking for work in every constituency.  The people of the West of Ireland have got a privilege over other constituencies in that they are let go to Britain.  In my own constituency in County Wexford, people are coming to me every day&mdash;and I have letters here in my pocket&mdash;as they are coming to every Deputy to try to get them a passport.  They have the offer of work in England and will not be let go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government talked last week and to-day about Locke's Distillery <Col N="1458" /> and all the rest, and about Dr. Ward, but what good does that do the ordinary people who are clamouring for a living in this country, and for the work they were promised?</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Budget was the downfall of the Minister and the Taoiseach. They thought they were hoodwinking the people by reducing the price of tea&mdash;a rationed commodity&mdash; and by reducing the price of sugar&mdash;a rationed commodity&mdash;and of flour, and at the same time asking the workers to pay 2/- for an ounce of tobacco. They give the old age pensioners 15/- a week and take 4/- back for two ounces of tobacco.  Is that the great Supplementary Budget that Deputy Kennedy and the other Fianna Fáil members are trying to defend?  Of course until the general election there will be window-dressing by the Government about the talks in England. They have come back, but when the Taoiseach was asked here to-day in this House what he had got, he said that he could not tell it at the moment. That is the sort of humbug and nonsense that goes on in the Dáil day in day out, while nothing is done for the country.</P>
    <P>People are clamouring for houses round the City of Dublin but private individuals are getting priority over local authorities to build houses.  No county board of health in the country has the materials to build cottages in rural Ireland.  It is true that foreigners are coming in here to buy up houses. I know of a lady who bought a mansion for herself and her daughter for £12,000.  One of them keeps a hunter and the other keeps a greyhound, while the farmers are tilling the land by conacre.  She has got a permit and every tree on Borrmount estate, County Wexford, has been sawn down and brought to the Phoenix Park.  That lady and her daughter are a great asset to this country! There are plenty of such people coming into the country, while a few years ago, the man who is letting them in was putting them out with a revolver and burning down their mansions. Look at the Bishops' pastorals about emigration&mdash;it is the slow bleeding to death of our nation.</P>
    <P>I have a cutting here which says that we have neither butter nor bacon in <Col N="1459" /> rural Ireland.  However, on the 10th August, 1946, 300 tons of bacon left the City of Dublin although the poor people in rural Ireland cannot get a rasher for their breakfast. Two thousand three houndred and forty tons of gift meat went out of this country in 15 months to the people on the other side.  That concession was stopped because, I believe, the Jewish people were sending it to their friends in London.  It was not all going to the Irish emigrants on the far side.</P>
    <P>Since the Supplementary Budget was introduced candles and soap have gone up in price.  Yet you have the cheek to tell us that the cost of living has gone down.  There is no woman down the country or no farm labourer or road worker with 50/- a week to-day who can go into any public house, as Deputy Kennedy said.  He said that all the beer and whiskey will be sold.  Who drank all the beer and whiskey in the City of Dublin?  A quarter of a million people were in this city during Horse Show week.  Americans, Poles and people of other nationalities were in this city drinking the beer and whiskey. The working class people in this country did not drink it.</P>
    <P>At the present time they are hard set to keep body and soul together. The Fianna Fáil members are trying to defend the Government's policy.  From the results of the three by-elections it can be seen that the people do not approve of it.  Is that not the writing on the wall?  Is it not time for the Government to sit up and take notice? Is it not time for the Government to realise that something is wrong and that they are not going to humbug the people all the time?  Of course, they have done it for the past 15 years.  In the 1944 Election the slogan was &ldquo;Vote Fianna Fáil or you will be in the war.&rdquo; They had not that slogan last week.</P>
    <P>The poor people are not considered in this Budget.  It is all very well for those who have money.  The Minister and every member of this House are all right.  We are paying no income-tax. Why should that be?  As one Deputy said, we should tighten our belts.  As <Col N="1460" /> far as I can see very few members of this House are tightening their belts. They have made life very happy for themselves since they came in here.  I say to the Minister: &ldquo;Withdraw your Supplementary Budget.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In my town the owner of the picture-house told me that he would have to close it when the new tax comes on because he would only be keeping it open for the Government.  Things are different in the rural towns compared with the City of Dublin, where the money of the country comes in.  Deputy Allen is sitting over there and he knows that down the country the man with 50/- and less a week cannot even go to the pictures or buy a &ldquo;pint&rdquo;. Consider the case of the old age pensioner. Consider the widows.  Consider the people on home assistance.  I wonder if Deputy Kennedy thinks that they will be able to buy beer or whiskey at Christmas out of the miserable 6/- or 8/- which is handed out to them under the voucher system.  The Government should abolish that system and initiate a proper system so as to put these people on a decent level.  We have money for aerodromes.  We have £4,000,000 to buy aeroplanes.  However, we have to come in here to get the taxes from the poor people throughout the country.  Horse racing is exempt. The dance hall is exempt.  The lounge bars which are the ruination of this country are exempt.  They should be taxed.  They should not be allowed to carry on, because they are ruining the cities and all the country places.</P>
    <P>The Government have forgotten the plain people.  The Government should remember that when they first came into power it was not the capitalists of Ireland who voted for them.  The plain people voted for them in the hope that something would be done for them. But the Government has forgotten, and until the Taoiseach, who is head of this State, remembers his promises, the people will not be satisfied.  He made promises to everyone at every crossroads and in towns and cities that he would provide work for all.  I heard it said that they would put the man who would not work in jail.  The position to-day is that we have thousands of unemployed.  The demobilised members of the defence forces are <Col N="1461" /> clamouring to get out of the country. There are only two places for them&mdash; the British coal mines or agriculture. They must come up to Dublin and go before an inspector and be examined before they will be released for work in the coal mines.  On the other hand, foreigners who, incidentally, have been the cause of a lot of the talk which has been going on here for some time past, can walk around the City of Dublin without a passport.  I say to the Minister and to the Government: Provide the work you promised us.  We were promised post-war planning, drainage, housing, road-making.  What is the position to-day?  There is no work but everybody is bamboozled by all this talk about Locke's Distillery. The country is waiting for the Government to do something for the people who are in need of work.  The provision of work for the people is the problem to which the Government should devote their energies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy spoke about costs in England.  I would say to him that wages in England are a lot higher than they are in Ireland.  Do we all not know that the people who go away can send home £3 a week, and in some cases more, to keep their wives and families in this country while they can keep themselves beyond also?  How many people in rural Ireland on 50/- a week can get an ounce of tobacco or a &ldquo;pint&rdquo; to-night?  The people down the country know that they are finished. We meet those people in shops.  We meet the men on the roads, and we know what they are saying.  The very words they use are: &ldquo;What are you doing in the Dáil? Why do you not kick the Government out?&rdquo; Even the old people say that.  We will not have to kick them out.  It is the people outside this House who will do that, and if the Government does not take notice quickly there will be damn few Fianna Fáil members sitting on the Opposition Benches.  The writing is on the wall because the Government forgot the plain people.  The Government have become capitalists.  They are allowing foreigners to come in here and buy up property.  People who are running away from taxation in England come over here to eat the food that should be left for the Irish people.  In rural <Col N="1462" /> Ireland you cannot get a pound of butter.  Why?  Because the luxury hotels are getting it all.  Their friends are bringing it to them.</P>
    <P>There is not enough milk.  I was told recently that the farmers are threatening to strike and will refuse to produce milk.  Deputy Corry told me that a short time ago.  He also said there is going to be a beet strike.</P>
    <P>The cost of living is going up all round us.  What action is the Government taking?  Have they taken any effective action to keep prices down? We are told that commissions are going to be set up.  The setting up of commissions is just another piece of window-dressing to keep the people a little longer in suspense.  We have not been told anything about the new trade agreements with Britain.  Reading the Press one appreciates that we have at least one trade with Britain at the moment.  All our best eggs are being sent over there while the people at home are paying 5/- a dozen for eggs which are not of the best grade.  Is that a practical policy to give Britain our best eggs at a cheap price while asking our people at home to pay 5/- for inferior eggs?  Can this be taken as a sample of the agreements we are going to have in the future?</P>
    <P>What is the price of beef to-day? Every day one sees reports that prices are down in the cattle markets, but there is no reduction when a consumer goes into the local butcher to buy beef or mutton.  There is no attempt at any kind of control.  The motto seems to be &ldquo;Fleece away&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Some months ago we were told in this House that the reason why timber could not be imported in any larger quantities was because there was no space available.  But there is, as Deputy Cogan pointed out, plenty of space available to bring commodities we do not want from North Africa and elsewhere.  The ordinary people are sick and tired of all the muddle.</P>
    <P>If the Government cannot provide work in this country for its people, then throw all the ports open to them and let them go to Britain.  To-day they are being driven across the border into the British Air Force.  I speak for the workers.  I know what the ordinary <Col N="1463" /> working people in this country are suffering.  I know what the poor and the aged are suffering under this Supplementary Budget.</P>
    <P>I know publicans in the country who are standing behind empty counters to-day because the ordinary working man can no longer afford 81/2d. a bottle for stout and 1/- for a pint.  No man in rural Ireland could afford to drink at that price.  The agricultural rate of wages is fixed at 50/- a week.  Some of the Government members must know what the position really is.  Some of them go down to the country now and again.  Their recent reception at some of the meetings should have taught them a much-needed and long-deserved lesson.  Is the Government going to permit a situation to continue where our own people are driven from their country to seek work elsewhere while undesirable foreigners crowd in here?</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy referred to the cinemas.  Who runs the cinemas in this country?  They are run by those people whom the Government is backing up to the hilt&mdash;namely, the Jews.  They are the people who control the cinema industry in this country.  The Government will not interfere with them. Why?  Because you will always find the Jew where the money is.  Look at the big firms in this city.  Are they controlled by Irishmen?  Recently I was speaking to a man from Youghal and he told me that a Jew had set up in business in County Cork and he put over his door the name &ldquo;Michael Collins&rdquo;. He was engaged in the radio business. Some of the Cork Deputies in this House must be aware of that.  Why should the control of our biggest and best businesses be in the hands of Jews?</P>

      <P>I have tried now to put the facts of the present situation before the Minister.  I have gone through the mill myself.  I am not ashamed to say I signed on at the labour exchange in my time.  I drew national health insurance&mdash;the greatest scandal over which this Government stands.  I know what <Col N="1464" /> the working-class people are going through at the present time.  The bulk of the members of this House are wellto-do men.  Their speeches have of necessity some artificiality in them.  But there is no artificiality in my speeches. I know the facts.  I live with the poor. The hardest job I have is to approach the home assistance officer in my area on behalf of the destitute poor.  There are numbers of people to-day all over the country on the verge of starvation.</P>
      <P>One hears talk of the abolition of the Border.  Who, in present circumstances, would come into the Twenty-Six Counties?  Not one of the ordinary working-class people would come in. They would lose too much.  The only people who want to come in here are those people who come in the special trains in July and August to Bray and elsewhere.  They are the people with money.  They are not the ordinary working-class people.</P>
      <P>Everybody is disappointed with this Budget.  If there is any pressure being brought to bear upon the Government by the British Government then we should be told about it and the Minister should have sufficient courage to tell the truth.  What is the real reason for these increases in the price of tobacco and beer?  Are they due to some dictation from the other side?</P>

      <P>I cannot understand what Deputy O'Leary really wants to find out now.  On the one hand he tells us about the people running over to England for work and, on the other hand, he tells us about the English people running over here from the heavy burden of taxation in England.  Apparently it must be worse there than it is here. Deputy O'Leary says they are coming over here to get enough to eat.  He then talks about our people being on the verge of starvation.  I do not know which of his two yarns is right?</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Leary says he has come from the workers.  Judging by what he has said here to-night he does not want to go back.  One cannot blame him at all for that.  I also listened to the complaints made by <Col N="1465" /> Deputy Dockrell.  So far as I can understand the wages paid to the skilled worker here are higher than they are in England.  So far as housing facilities are concerned most of them have families and homes here to which they can return.  The particular class that I am concerned with must have even more skill than the so-called skilled worker that Deputy Dockrell is talking about.  I refer to agricultural workers, whether they are farmers or farm labourers.  The Minister is a farmer and he knows how long it takes to train an ordinary young lad to be a skilled agricultural labourer.  There can be no progress in this country unless we increase production.  I do not know how we can expect increased production when every other class in the community can earn double or treble the amount the agricultural worker gets. That is the problem we have to set ourselves to.  I have seen men in my own district who were not considered satisfactory as farm workers and who were able to walk into the city and obtain employment from Deputy Dockrell, or the Deputy Dockrells in Cork, at £5 4s. 0d. a week, as against the 53/- or the 53/6 that the agricultural labourer gets.  That is the position we are up against and that is what is killing production in this country.  That, and the fact that the prices at which agricultural products are fixed do not allow of a higher wage being paid.  If we are to have increased production, we must deal with that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard a great deal of discussion about this Supplementary Budget by people who should know more about facts and conditions.  Anybody who has visited a threshing yard this year knows that the wheat crop this year is down at least 50 per cent.  Our average last year was eight barrels to the acre. This year it is four, or less than four. There is a gap there to be filled if the people are to get bread for the next 12 months.  Last year we got a quota of wheat at about £20 or £24 a ton.  According to what I have learnt from the millers, the same wheat this year is costing anything from £33 to £35 a ton, if it can be got.  Is that increased cost to go on to the price of the 4 lb. loaf or not?  If it is to go on to the price of <Col N="1466" /> the 4 lb. loaf, who can buy it?  At what wage can they buy it?  Let us face this problem as men who live in a country to which, according to Deputy O'Leary, all the fellows in England are coming to buy it in.</P>

There is a gap there.  I did not hear Deputy O'Leary or any other Deputy here coming forward to tell us how that gap can be filled.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, a Leas-Chinn Comhairle.  If the Leas-Cheann Comhairle does not keep interrupters in order, I will have to answer them.

      <P>They will be missing when the next Budget is brought in.  We must face the situation that I have referred to.  I have not heard any Deputy on the opposite benches telling us where we would find the difference between the £20 that was paid for wheat last year and the £33 15s. 0d that will have to be paid for it now. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
