      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he is aware that approximately 100 acres of bog were acquired from Thomas Hyland, Coolaught, Murneen, Claremorris, County Mayo (Ormsby estate), about 23 years ago; further, that while this bog adjoins the public road, no boundary fence has been erected there by the Irish Land Commission; and if he will have the necessary fencing provided as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Turbary rights over the bog on Mr. Hyland's holding were allocated many <Col N="1522" /> years ago by the former Congested Districts Board.  The temporary grazing on the bog and the reversion in the cut-away remain with Mr. Hyland.  The Land Commission have no responsibility for the erection or maintenance of fences to protect his holding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 21 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  This section shall apply and have effect only in any county or county borough as respects which an Order made under sub-section (2) of this section is for the time being in force.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister may by Order declare this section to be in force and have effect in counties or county boroughs generally or in a particular county or county borough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1527" /> (3)  Where the Minister makes an Order under sub-section (2) of this section, he shall cause to be published in one or more newspapers circulating in the county or county borough to which the Order relates notice of the effect of such Order and of the date on which it will come into operation.</P>
    <P>(4)  Whenever a medical inspection is arranged under this Act for a child, whether at his home or at any other place, and the parent of such child is made aware of the time and place at which such inspection is to be held, the parent shall submit the child to such inspection unless an exemption from the inspection has been granted under sub-section (5) of this section.</P>
    <P>(5)  The medical officer having charge of the arrangements for a medical inspection provided under this Act shall grant an exemption in the prescribed form from the inspection in respect of any child in relation to whom there is produced to such officer a certificate in the prescribed form signed by a registered medical practitioner stating that he has examined the child within the prescribed period preceding the inspection.</P>
    <P>(6)  A person who contravenes sub-section (4) of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof, in the case of a first offence, to a fine not exceeding five pounds, or, in the case of a second or any subsequent offence, to a fine not exceeding ten pounds.</P>
    <P>(7)  Every person who in connection with an application for an exemption under sub-section (5) of this section makes any statement which is to his knowledge false or misleading in any material respect shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds.</P>
    <P>(8)  An offence under this section may be prosecuted by the health authority who provided the medical inspection.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1528" /> This is a redraft of Section 21, which provides for the compulsory examination of children.  It is changed now from what it was in the original Bill. The Minister may apply it to the whole country or to a county or to a number of counties, or he may not apply it, as the case may be.  When the Order is made, parents are then responsible for submitting their children for examination. Sub-section (5) gives power for exemption where the parent submits a medical certificate saying that the child has been examined by another medical man.  The child is not then subject to compulsory examination. Then there are the usual penalty clauses.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Ministerial amendment and there is an amendment to it by Deputy Mulcahy&mdash; amendment No. 15.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a proposal to substitute a new section for a section that is in the Bill.  I do not think there is any substantial difference in principle so far as the new section and the old section are concerned.  There is the same compulsion in this as that which is implied in Section 21 in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The principle is changed to this extent, that, as the original section stood, it became obligatory on parents to submit their children for examination.  That does not come into operation now until the Minister makes an Order either for the whole country or for individual counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the same idea of compulsion, and there is no change in principle where the section is put into operation.  There is no difference in principle as between the new draft and the old section.  If that is so, I have no objection, for the purposes of orderly discussion, of accepting amendment No. 14 to replace Section 21.  We can then begin the discussion on the general principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that, from the point of view of order, if amendment No. 14 is accepted and replaces Section 21 in the Bill, and that as soon as my amendment to the new Section 21 is disposed of, the new Section 21 will be open for discussion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Would the Deputy move amendment No. 15? The position is that there is an amendment to an amendment, which should be moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we are accepting amendment No. 14 for the purposes of drafting.  I move amendment No. 15:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;exemption&rdquo; in the third line of sub-section (5) and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;in respect of any child in relation to whom there is produced to such officer a certificate by a medical practitioner that the child is under his general care and supervision.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Previously I had amendments to Sections 19 and 20, in which I objected to compulsion in respect of the medical inspection, medical treatment and medical education of children without the consent of the parents.  It was suggested when we were discussing that matter, that we should have an opportunity of discussing that on this later section.  I do not know if that is suitably covered by the amendment I have proposed, but I would like to discuss the general question of compulsion in relation to my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, the obligation to submit children to medical inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 21, as it will now appear, provides that where medical inspection of school children&mdash; or children, perhaps, whether they are school children or not&mdash;is ordered, the parent shall submit the child for such inspection unless an exemption from inspection has been granted under a particular sub-section.  The exemption that is here provided for is that there is produced a certificate in the prescribed form signed by a registered practitioner stating that he has <Col N="1530" /> examined the child within the prescribed period preceding the inspection. If the Minister accepts my amendment, these words will be deleted and exemption will be granted in respect of any child in relation to whom there is produced to such an officer a certificate by a medical practitioner that the child is under his general care and supervision.</P>
      <P>I drew attention yesterday to Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution. Article 41 states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1º The State recognises the family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
      <P>2º The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the nation and the State.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Article 42 follows and says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.  The State acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child is the family and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We must stand over the principle that is enshrined there, which is that under the natural law it is the family and not the State which is charged with the duty of promoting the well-being of its members.  While the State assists the family, where necessary, to carry out that duty, it must be careful to respect the autonomy of the family and if there is failure to do that, there can be nothing but material and moral deterioration for the family in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment moved here does not go the whole way in safeguarding the position as my amendments Nos. 11 and 12, if they were properly applicable to Sections 19 and 20, would go.  I submit to the Minister that it is undesirable that the State should dictate to a parent that his child should be examined, whether by a doctor belonging <Col N="1531" /> to a State medical service or by the family doctor.  It is going very far when the State undertakes to require from the family a certificate that the child is in the care of a general medical practitioner.  I do not know whether that is not going even a bit too far, but it is put against a proposal contained in Section 21 by the Minister that he would require that in the prescribed form a certificate signed by a registered medical practitioner should be presented from time to time that he had examined the child within the prescribed period.  I think that should be deleted and that it should be sufficient, if any certificate is required, that a certificate would be given by a medical practitioner that, in the words of my amendment, &ldquo;the child is under his general care and supervision&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I respectfully press the Leader of the Opposition that, if his amendment is accepted, he will lose the whole principle?  If we admit the right of the State to go to the parents and say that the State takes over responsibility for the general maintenance of the child's health, we thereby admit the right of the State to set the parent aside.  It does not matter how you limit the extent to which the State does that by law, as if we once consent to the enactment of a law which violates a fundamental principle, we may persuade this Minister by law to restrict the extent of his incursion on the principle, but we have no guarantee that on some future occasion the Minister will not come in and say: &ldquo;The incursion to which I restricted myself in the original Bill has proved to be insufficient for my purpose and I propose now to go further; once my right to cross the Rubicon at all has been admitted, it has become a matter of simple expediency as to how far I should penetrate into the hinterland.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the fundamental principle here at stake is this: has a civil servant the right to come into my house and say to me: &ldquo;Submit your child to a doctor of whom I approve or go to jail.&rdquo; Whatever law is passed by this House, if any civil servant comes into my house on that mission, I will throw him out. <Col N="1532" /> I will throw him out and cheerfully take the consequences of that course. If the Government of this or any other country claims the right to take over from parents the day-to-day care of their own children, in the absence of any evidence whatever of negligence of a character which would raise a presumption of criminal misfeasance or non-feasance on the part of the parent, then Article 41 of the Constitution is the purest &ldquo;cod.&rdquo; Article 41 states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The State recognises the family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What are these rights?  Is there any Deputy who will deny that one right of parents, as ordained by God, is to rear their own children?  Does not the rearing of your children clearly include the provision of food, clothing and protection from harm?  How then can you make it a criminal offence if parents, in the exercise of their absolute discretion, for the protection of their children's welfare, choose to say: &ldquo;My child has not been examined by a general practitioner, and, in my judgment, no necessity for such an examination arises.&rdquo; In the absence of any <i>prima facie</i> proof that the child stands in need of medical attention, in the absence of any <i>prima facie</i> case that the child is suffering from an infectious disease and may therefore be a menace to its fellow-citizens as a result of contagion or infection, the State says: &ldquo;We are determined to see that the child is examined.  If you make any effort to prevent that examination, we shall impose a fine upon you, and, if you do not pay the fine, you will go to jail&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am not in the least solicitous that the necessity for testing this matter by throwing a civil servant out of my house will ever arise, because I am convinced that, if this section stands in its present form, the whole Bill will be condemned by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional; but what concerns me is that, week after week, we should be appearing in this House to fight <Col N="1533" /> attempts to enact legislation which encroaches upon the Constitution. What has gone wrong with the Executive in this country?  Has their whole instinct for rights and duties become warped by the length of time for which they have been in office?  Can you conceive any rational body of men in this country, until very recently, claiming the right to walk into a man's home and have his children examined, just for the sake of uniformity?</P>
    <P>Has nobody adverted to the fact that there may be Christian Scientists in this country who have a conscientious scruple in this matter?  I have no sympathy with Christian Science.  I do not understand the mentality which regards it as a matter of religious belief that you should not consult doctors, or have any dealings with medicine, but the fact that I do not understand it and do not sympathise with it is no reason why I should disregard it.  There are plenty of people who have persuaded themselves that their own best interests can be served by eschewing medicine.  I agree that if, in the presence of infectious disease, a group of persons persist in that course and claim the right in pursuit of their belief to disregard all precautions of segregation which are essential for the protection of their neighbours, it becomes the duty of the Oireachtas to wage the rights of society as a whole against the particular rights of the family unit, and, if the claims of the community for protection from the danger of infection clearly outweigh those of the family to have absolute dominion within its own family circle, I believe the Oireachtas is justified in asserting the superior right against the lesser.</P>
    <P>But the section we are considering has no relation to infectious diseases. That whole matter was dealt with in another part of the Bill.  This section envisages the whole juvenile population of the country, whatever the religious beliefs of their parents may be, whatever their conscientious scruples and whatever their rational convictions are.  If we leave religious belief and scruple on one side and consider only the right of two rational citizens who have conferred upon one <Col N="1534" /> another the Sacrament of Matrimony and have undertaken to raise a family in accordance with the law of God, under the rights thereby acquired, to determine that they do not choose to have their children examined by a physician, I deny the right of this Parliament or any other power in this State arbitrarily to declare that these children will be examined, whether their parents wish it or not.</P>
    <P>I respectfully submit to the Leader of the Opposition that if we yield a fraction of an inch on that Rubicon, the whole position of those who object to this becomes utterly untenable. Either the matter is one of fundamental principle or it is not.  If it is a matter of expediency, our view, as laymen, cannot hope to prevail against the assembled so-called expert opinion of medical interests and bureaucrats.  For my own part I absolutely stand upon the Rubicon that there is no power in any authority in this State arbitrarily to announce that, whether the parents of children wish it or not, servants or agents of the State will examine, and that, in the event of the parents asserting their inalienable and imprescriptible right, antecedent and superior to all positive law, the State will proceed to fine them and, if necessary, imprison them.  You may enact that section until the cows come home, but you will never enforce it.  Happily every freedom-loving citizen of this State was refreshed and strengthened by the trechant terms of the judgment of the President of the High Court delivered yesterday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In my respectful submission, Sir, it is at the very root of it. It was a splendid, clear and trenchant <Col N="1535" /> defence of the inalienable rights of our people that no action of any slavish majority in this House can take away. Those who thought that time was wasted and effort vainly spent in fighting for these things in this House were proved wrong.  The fight that was made in defence of those things, albeit seemingly lost in Oireachtas Éireann, providentially has been won in another arena.  I submit with respect, Sir, that our circumstances with regard to this section are identical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy deal with the section now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are fighting for something fundamental&mdash;the right of parents to rear their own children.  We are fighting for that principle in the knowledge that if in any particular, however small, we yield and consent to its being abrogated, we open the gates to an avalanche.  It is a comfort to know that, although some docile majority will carry the section in this House, there in another arena where it cannot hope to survive.  But, remember, that if time and time again, week after week, the legislation of this House is brought before the courts and condemned as being an attempt to destroy fundamental principles of our people, the faith of our people in this Legislature will be gravely shaken.  It should not happen, except by inadvertence, that legislation of this House should conflict with the provisions of the Constitution. One of our duties on this side of the House is to ensure that that inadvertence will never be validly pleaded.  No one could suggest that on the last occasion inadvertence was the cause of the Government's astonishing performance.  I do not want anyone to have it to say in this case that inadvertence should be the Minister's justification if he insists on this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the last occasion when the matter of principle arose I made this suggestion. If, from the point of view of the Government, this is merely a matter of expediency, and if they are satisfied in their own minds that, from the point of view of rational people on this side of the House, a fundamental principle is involved, it is the very essence of <Col N="1536" /> democracy for the Executive, supported by its majority, to say: &ldquo;Although we have the right and the power to make our view prevail, where principle collides with expediency we prefer to allow those who are concerned on principle to prevail against us, albeit we think their solicitude is mistaken&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If the Minister thinks that I am talking with my tongue in my cheek, of course he should press forward and insist on his own section or the section as it is suggested by the Leader of the Opposition it should be amended.  If, on the other hand, he feels that there are people on this side of the House who think that this is a matter of great principle, all I ask is that he should take the section back and say: &ldquo;I will re-examine it&rdquo;.  All I want is to see that the best that can be done to protect the children of this State from ill-health or neglect is being done and will continue to be done, and it is merely a matter of working out a system which will secure that without depriving anybody of the rights to which they attach fundamental importance.</P>
    <P>I am not alleging, and I do not want to be taken at this stage as alleging that the Minister for Health was actuated by any dark motive or conspiratorial intent when he brought the section before the House.  It may well be that, with the multiplicity of matters which the several Ministries he holds require him to study, this section has been taken from some other analogous statute and simply brought forward as a matter of form.  If so, that is very understandable and here is the occasion to correct it in order to meet the views of those who feel deeply about it.  We need engender no heat or misunderstanding.  If the matter is met in that spirit, I will most gladly collaborate in any way I can to achieve the end the Minister has in view without the error which I detect in the section as it stands at present.  I most earnestly urge on the Minister that he should examine the matter from the point of view which I have expressed in order to ensure that, in so far as may be practicable, this public health measure, which in principle is <Col N="1537" /> approved by all sides of the House, may in detail command substantially the same volume of support.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to clear Deputy Dillon's mind of the disturbing cloud of doubt that I am not fully awake to the responsibility on us to safeguard the principles enshrined in Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution. I spoke of them last night and I spoke of them here again to-day.  In approaching this Bill for the purpose of safeguarding these principles, my amendments Nos. 11 and 12, together with amendments Nos. 15, 16 and 17 were, I thought, the most effective way in which the principles to be safeguarded would be safeguarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy were here last night he would have heard us discuss amendments Nos. 11 and 12. The intention of these amendments of mine was that it would not be possible for any health authority to take any action for the purpose of safeguarding or improving the health or physical condition of children, or to arrange for their medical inspection at schools or any other places, or provide for their education in matters relating to health, or provide for the treatment of their illnesses or defects, or ascertain whether they were mentally deficient, without the consent of the parents.</P>
      <P>The amendments, as drafted, after discussion here last night, did not seem to fit in at the exact point that would safeguard everything, so I withdrew them for the present and amendment No. 15 is simply carrying on the development of that idea in this way, that, if you are to have the examination of school children and the parents are to be made cognisant of that, subject to the fact that nothing will be done with regard to their children unless with their consent, the certificate which the Minister requires shall be replaced by a certificate by a medical practitioner that the child is under his general care and supervision.  When that is examined, it may be found to be an unnecessary demand on the parent, but that can be discussed and considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1538" /> As far as I know, in any house where you have children there is contact with the medical officer at some time or another.  There is the general idea in Ireland of having a family doctor.  If, in a discussion of the matter, we find that my amendment goes too far, then that will mean that the Ministerial amendment goes very much further.</P>
    <P>I rose merely to make clear the point that in order to safeguard the principles of Article 41 and Article 42 of the Constitution, I drafted amendments Nos. 11, 12, 15, 16 and 17; in case, when these are faced up to on Report, the principles are not sufficiently safeguarded, I would be glad to see an amendment from Deputy Dillon which will help us to safeguard them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>With regard to amendment No. 15, the wording of the section as it stands before this amendment was put in requires the practitioner to give a certificate that he had inspected the child.  Deputy Mulcahy's amendment seeks to get the medical practitioner to say that the child has been under his care and attention.  So far as I am personally concerned with the provisions of the Bill, I would not see very much objection to Deputy Mulcahy's amendment, were it not that I am afraid that the members of the medical profession themselves would object to it.  This was one of the points raised when I met the Medical Consultative Council and they said that they would always refuse to take responsibility for looking after a person, that they must be free to attend a person, not in the way of a contract, but as the occasion requires. I am afraid that they would object to give such a certificate, that the child was under their care and attention. I do not think this amendment is in any way related to amendments Nos. 11 and 12 and the question could be argued on some other amendment.  I would ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment as it stands.  I am not objecting to it from the point of view of the effectiveness of the Bill, but I am afraid the medical profession would not like it.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The effect of the section would be, let us say, that the inspection will be prescribed twice a year and that the medical officer of health for the district will either examine the children himself or accept a certificate from some other doctor that he has examined a particular child.  That is how the matter stands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we in Bedlam?  There is Deputy Dr. Brennan, an experienced medical officer in a rural district in Ireland, seeing families growing up around him every day of his life.  How many of these families, presided over in practically every case by conscientious decent parents, get their children examined twice a year?  There is Deputy Butler, an experienced man in the City of Dublin.  Does he seriously suggest that he thinks it right for the State to impose on every parent in this country an obligation to have every one of his children examined twice a year or three times a year at the sweet will of a civil servant sitting in the Custom House?  I can scarcely believe my ears that a proposal of that kind is made in a civilised country.  Suppose we give a civil servant in the Custom House the right to say that every parent in the country must produce his child to a doctor or furnish that doctor with a certificate that he has produced his child to some other member of the profession.  What difference in principle is there between <Col N="1543" /> that and empowering the Government to say: &ldquo;Deliver your child once a year to a public health clinic where it will be carefully looked after, for an adequate examination which can only be conducted if the child can be left under observation for three days&rdquo;?  I dare to prophesy that a certain corollary to any power such as is here envisaged will be a claim on the part of the State that if the State-appointed medical examiner is not satisfied as to the child's state of health, physical or psychological, he will be entitled to require the parents to deposit the child in an approved clinic, there to remain for three or more days while the necessary pathological, psychological and physical examinations are carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Come now.  Do Deputies of this House claim that right to take our children from us and to put them in approved clinics?  You know people sometimes allow themselves to be driven mad by a perverted kind of universal benevolence.  And this strange thing is true.  No one is more vigilant than the Labour Party against paternalism by an employer.  When the representatives of organised labour see an employer heaping benefactions on his employees, claiming the right to provide them with free medical attention, free nutritional schemes and supererogations of that kind, the representatives of organised labour say: &ldquo;Look here, none of that; our members want to be free independent citizens doing an honest day's work for a fair day's pay.  If they get that, they want nothing else.  We do not mean to be rude or ungrateful but we do not want that relationship.  We prefer to know where we are&mdash;to know our obligations, our rights and our duties&rdquo;.  I give them credit for that attitude.  I think it is much better to separate business and friendship, and that the relationship of an employee and an employer should be regulated by ascertained duties and obligations on both sides. Outside that relationship there might and should be friendship, which will take the form of reciprocal giving and taking as between friends, not all giving on one side and all taking on the <Col N="1544" /> other.  But why is it, when you substitute the State for the employer and the whole community for organised labour, that the corrupt paternalism which destroys an individual's sense of duty and capacity to do his own job, instead of being something from which an independent man must instinctively recoil, becomes something beautiful, benevolent and desirable?</P>
    <P>I reiterate that I have no fears as to the consequences of this section, for it can never be law, but I hate the thought of this Legislature trying to make it law.  I hate the idea of this Legislature wanting to make this kind of law.  It is all wrong and I do not doubt that many Deputies sitting on the Fianna Fáil Benches believe it to be wrong.  They will do a service to their own leaders if they get up and say so.  I again urge on the Minister to give us some signal, if we believe a matter of principle to be here involved, that he will not persist in a section which will outrage fundamental belief when his purpose is no more than to secure an expedient method of doing something which he believes to be necessary for the preservation of the public health.</P>

      <P>On amendment No. 15, the Minister has indicated that he would accept this amendment but the medical fraternity would not. From what has been said now on the general matter explored by this discussion, I am not quite satisfied with my own amendment, and if I were withdrawing my amendment and substituting it by another one, after what the Minister has said, my substituted amendment would read:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That an exemption would be granted in respect of any child in relation to whom there was produced to such officer a certificate by the <Col N="1545" /> parents that the child was under the general care and supervision of a registered medical practitioner.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Because, when the Minister states that the possibilities under these proposals are that children up to 16 years of age are likely to be examined twice a year by a State medical service and, if they are not, exemptions will have to be sought and exemptions will only be granted when the parents produce certificates covering an examination twice a year of every one of their children&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Minister suggests that perhaps we should not take his suggestion in that particular direction as a completely thought-out and decided proposal, but the very suggestion contained therein is such as to make me quite dissatisfied with my own amendment.  I can appreciate a doctor declining to give a certificate to say that a child was under his general care and supervision if he was not the family doctor, but I cannot imagine a person who is in the position of what we all know and recognise as a family doctor declining to give a certificate, if required, once or twice a year with regard to the children of a particular house, that they were under his general care and supervision.  From my knowledge of families and their relations with the medical fraternity, I can see no difficulty at all in giving a certificate like that.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept this amendment, which, I think, is an improvement on the section as it is, I would prefer to withdraw it in order to preserve my freedom, if necessary, to put it down again in the form in which it is, although, from what has been said now, I think perhaps the only thing the House would be entitled to press on parents who did not wish to make use of the State service is that they would give a certificate themselves, under their own signatures, that their children were under the general care and supervision of a qualified medical practitioner.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (6) of the proposed new Section 21 of amendment No. 14.</P>
      <P>I move this amendment for the purpose of discussion.  Sub-section (6) of the new Section 21 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A person who contravenes sub-section (4) of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof, in the case of a first offence, to a fine not exceeding five pounds, or, in the case of a second or any subsequent offence, to a fine not exceeding ten pounds.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (4) requires that when a medical inspection is arranged under this Act for a child, the parent shall submit the child to such inspection unless an exemption from the inspection has been granted under sub-section (5).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unsatisfactory to attack sub-section (6) when we are not satisfied that proper provision has been made for a complete and reasonable exemption, but the very fact that proper provision has not been made for a complete and reasonable exemption, perhaps, makes it all the more necessary that we would discuss the deletion of this sub-section now.  As it stands, if a person does not wish to submit a child of his to the inspection ordered under the State service, he must present to the State officer a certificate in the prescribed form signed by a resident medical practitioner stating that he has examined the child within the prescribed period pending the inspection. It means, from what the Minister has said, that unless a parent in the future provides in respect of each one of his children, a certificate that he has been examined once a year or twice a year, he must submit the child to inspection by State medical officers and, if he does not do that, for the first offence&mdash;that is the offence committed in the first half of the year, in respect of one particular child&mdash;he will be fined £5 and, for the subsequent offence in that year, £10 and, I suppose, £10 for each six months that pass after that in respect of one child.  Whether the whole family will be lumped together and one fine <Col N="1547" /> be imposed in respect of the whole family or not, the section does not make clear, but if the local authority, which is the authority, apparently, who may prosecute under this&mdash; although, I think, the Minister can also&mdash;it would look as if it was going to be attempted as a revenue collecting machine.</P>
    <P>I submit to the Minister that the punishment section there&mdash;sub-section (6)&mdash;is fantastic.  There should be no punishment there at all.  Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, speaking on Second Reading, very much stressed that if a health service is to be effective, good and generally accepted, it must be a service that will appeal to the people and not one that is forced on them.  I think that to pass a section here which threatens parents, if they do not have their children examined twice a year either by their own doctor or by State service, that they are going to be fined £5 at the beginning of the year and £10 at the end is too fantastic for argument.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinBrennan" hpid="Dr. Brennan Dr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that it is the experience of every dispensary doctor in the country that there are three types of parent.  Firstly, those who are over-anxious about their children and who consult him for the least reason at all.  That type of person will willingly come and co-operate.  Secondly, there is the type which will come when the child complains and that type also will have no hesitation in submitting their children to examination.  Some provision must be made for the third type of parent, that is, the type who wilfully neglect their children and who will not bring their children to doctors at all, even when they are seriously ill. If we are going to combat tuberculosis, if we are going to look after deformities in children in early childhood when they can be remedied&mdash; deformities such as club foot, squint, and that type of thing&mdash;if we are to get institutional treatment for children who are mentally deficient, we must have some law which will comple the parents of those children to bring them for examination.  I do not imagine that doctors will insist on this being a hard and fast rule.  They will know from experience and knowledge of the district <Col N="1548" /> that certain families unfailingly look after the health of the children and that they can be relied upon to bring to the notice of the local dispensary doctor, or the private practitioner, as the case may be, any defects which they may notice in the children.  There is, however, the type who, either wilfully or through lack of proper appreciation of the importance of the health of the child, ignore these things until the time comes when they are incurable.</P>
      <P>Some provision at least must be embodied in this Act if we are to get an early diagnosis of defects which would be easily remedied by institutional treatment.  For that reason, I do not see why some provision such as this should not be embodied in the Act.  If we have not power like that the Act, as proposed, will be lenient. We will not be able to eradicate diseases such as tuberculosis or get institutional treatment for mentally deficient children at a time, at any rate, when there is a possibility of cure.  We often see cases sent to county homes at an age when they are incurable.  If we are to get them early, routine regular examination should be insisted upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully sympathise with Dr. Brennan's solicitude for, as he has admitted, the restricted class of persons who are difficult to persuade to act prudently.  One will get the mother whose child has a bad squint and who, instead of going to the doctor and asking what day the county oculist is coming, pokes around and does nothing. There are two ways of dealing with that problem.  One is to pass a Draconian law giving the State servant the right to take control of all our children. That is the Socialist method and the Socialist who is demanding that right will admit that, in respect of a large number of people, it is unnecessary, but that he must grapple with this little knot of resistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely Deputy Dr. Brennan has shared my experience&mdash;I am perfectly certain he has often done it himself&mdash;of walking along the road and seeing a child with some manifest physical defect.  He might speak to the mother himself, being the dispensary doctor <Col N="1549" /> and say: &ldquo;Bring that child around to me to-morrow.&rdquo;  But suppose the parents are the crochety kind whom one could not approach in that direct way.  In such an instance one could go to a neighbour&mdash;we have often done it &mdash;and say: &ldquo;You ought to get round Mrs. So-and-so to bring that child up to me.&rdquo;  How many times has Deputy Dr. Brennan done that himself&mdash; thousands I am sure.  I have no doubt that he has often done so and suffered considerable annoyance and trouble in getting the child sent to the oculist, pædiatric or orthopædic hospital to get something done&mdash;something which is nothing but trouble and bother for himself. It is common experience in the country that neighbours will go out of their way to try to settle it.  Every one of us has, from time to time, seen a child who wanted some kind of attention and the parents, through ignorance, peculiarity or eccentricity, are not doing all that might be done.  But there are more ways of killing a cat than choking it with a lb. of butter.  We need not dragoon the whole population simply because a few eccentrics through the country fail to take the obvious measures to deal with some easily perceptible fault, physical defect, or otherwise in children.</P>
    <P>I think perhaps Deputy Dr. Brennan overstates his case.  Suppose we bring the children, all the children of the parish, to school medical examination. Surely Deputy Dr. Brennan is not going to guarantee to me that, in the kind of examination that can be conducted in these circumstances twice a year, every early case of tuberculosis will be discovered.  Is not it true that the very early case, of which there is hope of recovery, can be missed by the general practitioner who is simply making a cursory superficial examination of the child?  Deputy Dr. Brennan will agree with me that that is true.  I do not think that there are very many small children under 16 years of age in this country who decline in advanced tuberculosis, as a result of neglect&mdash; between 16 and 25 years I will admit it at once.  But take the growing children about the house&mdash;how often in the Deputy's own experience has the middle type of parent to whom he <Col N="1550" /> refers, the reasonable, sensible woman, brought her child to him and said that: &ldquo;She is looking very badly.  All the spirit is gone out of her and she seems to have lost all desire to be running about&rdquo;.  I think that the vast majority of rational mothers in rural Ireland will detect that as quickly as any doctor and quicker.  I quite agree with the Deputy that we will find in every parish, as I say, a couple of cases who, either through eccentricity or innocence, do not realise what can be done to remedy defects if taken in time.</P>

I doubt very much if Deputy Dr. Brennan, in looking over his own dispensary area of which he has an intimate knowledge, could call to mind the name of one child who, he thinks, requires medical care that cannot be brought to the source where the child can get it.  I dare say that, if there is a single child in his dispensary district which could benefit now by medical care and is not getting it, he knows a neighbour whom he could send to the child's house to use her influence with the parents to bring the child up to him so that he might send it away to the appropriate institution where it would get the care it required.</P>

      <P>Not at all.  My idea is that this is wholly unnecessary.  You are taking power here to put the mother in jail for six months.  The Deputy knows well that the doctor will be able to get the woman to bring the child up to him if the child is in need of medical care.  He will not have the slightest difficulty in getting that done.  I am familiar with this problem so far as it concerns the rural district. I cannot speak with the same knowledge of the City of Dublin, but I am quite certain that in the rural districts where you have a dispensary doctor and a dispensary nurse there will be no child requiring medical care that will not be coaxed up to get treatment from the doctor, and you can do that without giving the mother six months in jail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to deal with the fines it is necessary to get the perspective, in view of Deputy Dillon's last remarks.  I make that submission to the Chair with respect.  The fines depend on whether the examination is to be compulsory or otherwise.  Deputy Dillon objects to that.  The difficulty is simply this, whether the provision is to be a nullity or an effective one.  So long as there is provision for another medical examination, in other words, so long as the parent is free to choose the medical examination in question, I think that leaves the section a perfectly legitimate one, and that it does not unduly interfere with the parent's rights.  I had hoped to be able to answer Deputy Dillon a little more fully, but I think I must interpret the Chair's call to order in this way, that I am to address my self to the sub-section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The simple answer to Deputy Dillon is whether you are going to make the section effective or not.  If there is to be no sanction, then you will certainly make a joke of the section.  On the other hand, if the section is to be effective, some sanction is necessary, and hence fines and penalties are warranted.  Deputy Dillon has referred to the size of the <Col N="1553" /> maximum penalty.  This point has to be noted in connection with that, that the section says the fine is not to exceed £5 and not to exceed £10.  To my mind the limit is, if anything, too low.  My reason for saying that is that while a fine of that size will be a deterrent to the ordinary working man or ordinary farmer it will be no deterrent at all to certain classes that I prefer not to specify, and that are to be found in big cities.  I think that we can rely on the district justices, or whoever are to be the enforcing authority, to use discretion in fitting the fine to the case. My reaction to this is that the prescribed maximum penalty, so far as the fines are concerned, is, if anything, on the low side.  I would anticipate that certain people who would be relatively well off might be put in an advantageous position in view of the fact that they had only a small maximum penalty to meet.  Instead of taking the same view as Deputy Dillon, I would on that basis suggest going a little further and I would say that the limits of the fine are too small.</P>

The reason I do not want to specify a class is that the vast majority in those classes are perfectly reliable citizens. Just as you are catering for cases in one class, in order to cater for those in another, I would suggest that the minimum be raised, relying on the very sound discretion of the district justice. It is purely a matter of making the <Col N="1554" /> punishment effective with regard to the principle obtaining here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to all the provisions of this section and, therefore, I support the amendment to delete sub-section (6).  I cannot understand the mentality of a Minister, and particularly a Minister with medical knowledge, who insists that we cannot have a good standard of health without having compulsory powers and using them to the extent that we must bring offenders into court and have fines imposed.  Particularly in that respect, I want to make it clear to the last speaker that the individual who is going to take proceedings under sub-section (8) is the health authority who provided the medical inspection and that health authority is going to be the county manager&mdash;so that the bureaucratic machine will operate and the local people and local representatives will have no say whatever; and when it comes to the Minister, the Minister will wash his hands completely of responsibility and will point out that the law now provides that it is the health authority through the county manager who is responsible for prosecutions and that he has no responsibility in the matter.  I cannot understand that and I do not believe that the Minister is convinced that he is going to get results along those lines.</P>
      <P>If the neglect by parents in this country were to such an extent that the health of the community and the health of the children was completely undermined because of their neglected condition, there might be some excuse for transgressing and setting aside the fundamental principles and trampling on the sacred rights of parents.  Surely it is ridiculous to expect&mdash;and I cannot understand Dr. Brennan in suggesting it&mdash;that you can have the help and co-operation of the parents&mdash;and I am sure he fully appreciates the necessity for that&mdash;towards maintaining good health, by compulsion and regimentation.  Medicine and compulsion are not compatible, and you must have the goodwill and co-operation of the patient&mdash;the child&mdash;and the parent, if you are to succeed in your treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In suggesting that this is necessary, <Col N="1555" /> the Minister is not being realistic.  It is legislation gone mad.  It is making for a bureaucratic system here, giving power to certain civil servants to make a decision and the county medical officer will be compelled to do certain things.  He will eventually report to the Custom House how many parents have not presented their children for examination and instructions will go down to the local authority, and the county manager will not give two hoots for the concern of the local people.  His anxiety is to satisfy the Custom House and, provided he does that, it does not matter about anybody else.  That is how the bureaucratic machine is going to operate.  The local people will have no say.  The machinery will be put in operation and the people will be dragged into court, no matter what excuse they have to offer.  The penalties are there and they will have to be imposed.  It is a scandalous proposal and the Minister should be ashamed of it.  We should put this to the Minister in the strongest possible way that there is a fundamental principle at stake and that mere animal health is not everything.</P>

      <P>There are certain things that are above that and are more valuable still.  The Minister, in a materialistic fashion, wants to trample on those sacred principles.  He wants to invade the secrecy of the home and place the power of the State above the family and above the parent.  I do not think he is going to succeed or get the co-operation of medical men in that.  When the amendments by Deputy Mulcahy, to reduce the powers given in the proposed new section, were withdrawn, to be discussed later, the Minister told us he felt the Deputy's proposal would not be accepted.  He was advised by his advisory council that it would not be accepted.  I can understand the advisory council saying it would not be accepted, as if they agreed that a practitioner would certify that the child was under his general care and supervision it might imply some responsibility for the health of the <Col N="1556" /> child and the parent might happen to neglect, inadvertently or through ignorance, bringing the child for treatment in certain circumstances. What advice did the Minister get from his medical council?  What were their proposals and were they satisfied with the Minister's proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Observe the step further taken by Deputy de Valera.  I think Deputy Dr. Brennan had in mind, when he referred to certain categories of persons who could only be induced to bring their children for examination by compulsion, people like tinkers and vagrants, who are very often very difficult to urge and prevail upon to act prudently.  It may be, of course, through ignorance; but observe Deputy de Valera's approach to it.  He says the fine of £5 is not enough; he wants to raise the maximum&mdash;so that it will be an effective deterrent to those who, fully informed, having had all the advantages of education and as well equipped as any citizen of this State could hope to be to determine calmly and deliberately and in an informed way what their duties as parents were, in the exercise of the rights conferred upon them by Section 41 of the Constitution, determine with full deliberation that it is not in their child's best interests to have him examined at the stipulated intervals.  It shall be within the power of the State to impose upon that person a fine so onerous that, rather than face it, he will reluctantly submit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely Deputy Brennan does not stand for that doctrine?  He may feel exasperated sometimes, when some neighbours or friends will not do what he feels would be prudent and sensible to do, in respect of a child which he feels is urgently in need of a particular kind of treatment; but if he felt that that parent had intelligently weighed up all the relevant arguments, had understood the significance of the case made by the doctor, even if the parent reached a wrong conclusion, provided Deputy Dr. Brennan was satisfied that he really understood the arguments and had conscientiously weighed them, surely he would not claim the right to stalk into that house, in effect to lock the parents up and leave them under <Col N="1557" /> constraint, to take the child from them and to do with that child what he thought was the right thing to do, in direct violation of the authority of the parents whom God put over the children.  There cannot be any rational Deputy who will stand for that proposition, and that is the proposition which is put forward by Deputy de Valera when he says the maximum fines under the Bill must be raised to such a figure as will enable the district justice to impose on a person, whose financial position has enabled him to have a full education and the fullest possible intellectual training adequately to weigh up argument, warning and advice that may be tendered to him by friends, professional or otherwise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that Deputy Dr. Brennan will expound my thesis to Deputy de Valera because I cannot help feeling that I have somewhat shaken the doctor&mdash;only somewhat. I do not believe there is a Deputy who will defend that proposition on its merits, and, although we have discussed this in great detail, I dare to suggest that an aspect of this problem has been presented to the House during the last hour of which the House was not fully seised before this debate took place.  I want to reiterate that, in all I have said on this section and its implications, I have no desire at this stage to indict the Minister for Health with some dark conspiratorial purpose to do something he knew to be wrong.  I am simply putting to him most strongly that there is an aspect of this provision which may have completely escaped his attention, having before his mind the primary purpose effectively to provide medical care for all, free, which, now that it has been expounded to him, should give him cause to reconsider the matter and nothing more cogent, nothing more illuminating as to the need <Col N="1558" /> for that reconsideration has been put forward, than Deputy de Valera's proposal that these fines should be raised to such a level that, no matter who the parents are, no matter what their qualifications are to consider the pros and cons of having their children medically examined, if they do not toe the line, the district justice is to have power to make them do so.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the Minister stands for that proposition.  I do not believe that he would desire the situation which Deputy de Valera wants.  He wants a situation in which if Dr. Ryan &mdash;not the Minister for Health for the moment&mdash;goes to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and says: &ldquo;I think your child is not looking well. You ought to bring it to a doctor&rdquo;, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce replies: &ldquo;I have examined that matter carefully.  She is a nervous child and for the present I do not think it expedient to frighten her by bringing her to the doctor, or by bringing the doctor in, because she becomes terribly upset.  I have discussed the matter with her mother and we have made up our minds that it is better to wait&rdquo;, we are effectively to arm Dr. Ryan to go into the house of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and bring out his child, in his despite, and have it examined.  Is there any Deputy who stands for that?  Does anyone seriously propose that the Oireachtas should enact legislation of that kind? Again, I remind the House that it does not matter a fiddle-dee-dee whether you do or not, because it will be declared unconstitutional at once, and will never function, but do not let us disgrace ourselves by going on record that we espouse this proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I owe an apology to Deputy Dillon for not being here for all he said, but I was unfortunately called out by a person who wanted to see me, as people occasionally want to see Deputies.  I hope the Deputy will forgive me.  I think Deputy Dillon misunderstands me.  I must reserve what I have to say on this section until the general discussion on the section comes up, when I shall have something to say, but I have this much to say at <Col N="1559" /> the moment, that I have a great deal of sympathy with Deputy Dillon's instinctive approach to much of this problem, as he may gather from my attitude to this Bill when it was before us in another form.  Postponing for a moment the arguments I would adduce in favour of the general principle of the section until the section comes up for discussion, I will explain to the Deputy what I meant with regard to this proposal of the fines.</P>
      <P>In addressing oneself to this section and suggesting that the maximum limits of the fines were too low, one has to make the necessary assumption, first, that the other provisions of the section have been decided upon.  I did assume that, in order to keep myself within the direction of the Chair.  I assumed gratuitously, for the purpose of this discussion and subject to whatever may transpire on the general discussion, that these powers were necessary. I assumed that the principle in this section is governed by the question of the Minister making a reasonable Order and dealing with some real threat, and that the general implementation of these compulsory provisions would take effect only where there was a grave communal need therefor, such, for instance, as a very serious incidence of tuberculosis in a certain area; perhaps tuberculosis is not the best case to take, but something more acute.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Dillon will bear with me, this is the way my mind was working. Deputy Dillon knows as well as I do that, if it is a case of evading provisions of this nature, you will get evaders in all classes and sections of the community, and the effect of the monetary sanction will be to make that an effective sanction for the lower-paid members of the community and a mere token matter for people on another scale.  What influenced me, therefore, in making the remark about the limits of our fines is that, if it is necessary to have compulsory power, some sanction is needed and, if some sanction is needed, common justice demands that the sanction should apply equally to all sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing I do object to, and I think Deputy Dillon will object to it as <Col N="1560" /> strongly as anybody else, is the proposition that we should coerce the poorer defaulters of the community and allow, by our own neglect in such a matter as a penalty, the more opulent defaulters to escape.  I am glad to say that the defaulters in any class do not represent the particular grade in question.  The only way to adjust that would be the commonsense of the court which will inflict these penalties.  That is what I was suggesting and nothing further.</P>
    <P>In view of the construction that Deputy Dillon has put on much of what I said, I want it to be quite clear that I am confining myself to that part of this section, because, as I have said, I have a great deal of sympathy with the instinctive approach of those people who say that the less compulsory interference with the child and with the family the better.  I think it is a sound reaction on the part of any Deputy. But then, as against that, the crowded circumstances of modern life, particularly in our cities, poses communal problems which also cry out for solution and which have been referred to so frequently from all sides of the House.  Therefore, inevitably, it will be a question of judgment and choice, unfortunately even a choice between the lesser of two evils, a necessary choice in this connection.  But, subject to anything else that may be said, my remarks about penalties were strictly confined to that point I was making and had no reference to any wider proposition. I hope the Deputy will accept that.  For that reason, I am not at this stage dealing with a number of other arguments that he adduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not interested in either maximum fines or minimum fines in connection with this question. What I am interested in is that we should show the minimum amount of commonsense, and there is certainly no commonsense displayed by the Parliament of this country in spending time wrangling as to what penalties we will impose upon parents if they do not utilise free medical services freely given.  If we have reached that point in the history of this country, then the <Col N="1561" /> sooner we turn the key in the door and the whole lot of us go home the better.</P>
      <P>I am happy to say that this particular issue is absolutely unnecessary, that there is no evidence whatsoever on the all-over scale that school medical inspection is not going along progressively successfully and, in the main, harmoniously.  The Minister is familiar with the old saying that one swallow does not make a summer.  At a full meeting of county medical officers of health I made inquiries and there were only two out of the whole lot who would like to have the powers that are contained here.  When they went more closely into it, they were satisfied that it was not the way to deal with it.  I do not know how many Deputies or advisers of the Minister have experience of the subject we are discussing; but I can tell the Minister and Deputies that one difficult, nervous or frightened child can hold up the whole work of medical inspection of a school for the best part of a couple of hours.  You can bring a child forcibly to the school, but you cannot examine a child forcibly with results.  If one child starts to bellow and to get cantankerous and frightened, that kind of thing is infectious when dealing with young children.  One child brought to a school by a reluctant parent who is in a bad humour because she is under threat of legal proceedings, the mother and the child arriving in a bad temper, will turn the school into bedlam.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Minister's case in introducing the Second Reading of this Bill and to the Minister's case in concluding the debate.  I invited him to get all the ammunition he could to justify this particular set of proposals. I am satisfied that he has not come here to-day with an empty gun, but I will guarantee that, when he attempts to fire off his gun, he will find that he has a blank cartridge; that there is no genuine case to be made for bringing the law into the work of school medical inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has a desirable aim and legitimate objectives; but, on the face of it, it has every evidence of hysteria, of jumping off in one direction in one section and another direction in another section.  We are discussing <Col N="1562" /> what penalties the courts will impose on parents whose children happen to be absent.  When we come to Section 43 we will find that there is another provision prohibiting parents from sending a child to school if they have any reason to believe that the child is infested with lice.  What will be the obvious defence when you mobilise all your absentees and bring them to court?  What will be the defence of every parent?  &ldquo;Little Mickey was scratching and I had reason to believe he was infested.&rdquo;  There is the answer in Section 43.  Are we either lunatics or commonsense people when we argue about the height of the penalties to be imposed and provide later on in the Bill a perfect escape, so that it will not be possible to impose a penalty on any single parent for a child being absent?</P>
    <P>Some of us have to think of the human machinery that is to be charged with the responsibility of carrying out the really futile and absolutely unnecessary proposals in this Bill.  In the first place, you cannot prosecute any parent except the parent has got due notice of the time and place of school medical inspection.  In a court of law it is not just as simple as arguing across a desk in the Custom House.  In a court of law due notice will be a personal call, with personal notice or a registered letter.</P>
    <P>The work of school medical inspection is difficult and slow enough as it is, and one of the reasons for extending the machinery in this Bill is because it is so terribly slow.  But, as it is, all we have to do is to notify the school manager or the principal of the school of the date of the school medical inspection.  If you mean anything by all your legal threats here, you will have to send a registered letter to the parents of every child in the school. There is no other legal evidence of due notice being given to the parents. You would need an office staff if you are dealing with any kind of big school. The preliminary work that has to be done, if these proposals are not to be absolutely meaningless, will be considerable. There would be a couple of weeks' preliminary work in every big school.  You must remember that in the country there are a great number of <Col N="1563" /> names and a great number of families and there are many families of the same name in the same townland and there will be any amount of mistakes made in the notifications or in the subsequent prosecution&mdash;which, I hope, I will never see.  Even the teachers make mistakes arising out of the multiplicity of Byrnes and so on.  They make mistakes over the correct name of the parent of this or that little girl.  Time and again that has happened.</P>
    <P>We will prosecute and interfere and tinker with a machine that is working quite satisfactorily.  What will be the result?  We will be replacing harmony and confidence with distrust and the virus of coercion and compulsion.  Do you think you will popularise your new health schemes in any district in Ireland by parading unfortunate mothers before the district justices, who will impose, according to Deputy de Valera, maximum fines according to the people's capacity to pay?  I do not care whether it is a maximum or a minimum fine.  Do you think that is the way to inspire confidence in the health machinery of this country, or that that is the way to create harmony?</P>
    <P>All this idea of public health service, of school medical service and child welfare schemes came from the United States of America.  Read any of their literature on the question and what is blazoned across every piece of literature? That if there is not harmony and co-operation, if the people do not cry out for the scheme, then the whole thing is worthless.  How was it started in America?  It started in one State and a lot of publicity and propaganda followed until the next State started shouting for the scheme.  That State was left until the shout became a roar and then they got the scheme as a concession. There was publicity there again and a third State shouted for it. They gave the people the service that the people wanted and appreciated.  If they had begun by saying: &ldquo;This is the law, you will have your children medically examined or you will pay a fine; you will have this, that and the other done or you will pay a fine,&rdquo; the thing would have been a failure from the very beginning.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1564" /> One of the very things we are warned against, and one of the things that anybody with any knowledge or experience knows should be avoided in connection with health services, is what we are inviting in this Bill&mdash;that the people are to be compelled to accept it.  The Minister has grown up in a county that was the first in Ireland that showed its violent reaction against health measures, which the Minister must admit are beneficial, and the only justification he advanced last night for that reaction was that the whole scheme was compulsory.  In other words, it was a natural reaction last night because there was compulsion behind a particular health service.  Now we are going to apply it to the schools and, as Deputy de Valera said, it is unjust to penalise or coerce people merely because they are poor.</P>
    <P>I accept that.  Are not the rich given a perfect let-out in this Bill?  They have only to send a certificate saying that their own private practitioner has examined the child and there is the let-out.  The wealthy can escape.  It does not matter how sky-high you make your penalties, there is a perfect escape for the wealthy.  There is also an escape for anybody who adopts the obvious defence by saying that he had reason to believe his child was infested.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give his views on the operative side of this question.  I referred to it on the Second Reading.  How will it be implemented? You cannot, in justice, take these particular powers and be selective in their application.  No official, no officer working honestly under any Act of Oireachtas Eireann can say: &ldquo;I will prosecute Tom Brown because his children were absent, but I will not prosecute John White.&rdquo;  If there are to be penalties for children being absent, then there can be no selectivity; they will all have to pay a penalty for the offence.</P>
    <P>I want to get down to the human machinery for carrying out all these prosecutions for manufactured illegalities. Goodness knows we have enough breaches of the ordinary law without manufacturing new crimes or new <Col N="1565" /> offences.  Let Dr. Brennan go in.  He is a busy man and let us say he inspects a large school with a couple of hundred pupils.  There would be a good attendance.  The average attendance out of the 200 pupils on the rolls any day would be, we shall say, 170.  You have an attendance on the day of the school medical inspection up to the average.  You have 170 present and 30 absent and in none of the 30 cases is there a certificate.  Neither Dr. Brennan nor myself has the right to discriminate, if this is the law, as to who will be prosecuted and who will not.  We shall either proceed against all or none.</P>
    <P>Say that we prosecute the parents of the 30 children and the court is fixed for 11 o'clock in some place.  It may be the doctor's dispensary day but some other arrangement will have to be made to get the dispensary done. Or the doctor may be away on a maternity case.  If so, the case in the court collapses for want of evidence.  Let us take it that he is available and that he gets to the court with these 30 prosecutions. There will be a solicitor appearing for four, five, nine or ten of the parents&mdash;perhaps different solicitors. They are going to do their job and earn their fees.  They are going to defend their clients to the last ditch. The district justice has also to deal with all the other offences listed&mdash;prosecutions under emergency regulations and everything else.  Charges against people who are in custody, we will say, come first.  The doctor sits at the back of the court and it comes near to the adjournment hour.  Perhaps one or two of his cases are taken and finished but, by the time the doctor is out of the box, he will have a lot more experience of the foolishness of this kind of legislation than before he went in. He will be amazed at the things he will be called on to prove, things that as between ourselves, we would accept. &ldquo;Who took that record of attendance &mdash;did you?&rdquo;&ldquo;No&rdquo;. &ldquo;Very well; who did?&rdquo;&ldquo;My nurse&rdquo;. &ldquo;Is she here?&rdquo;&ldquo;No&rdquo;. &ldquo;Oh, dismiss&rdquo;. The court is not just the kind of simple affair that some people think.  However, one or two cases are taken that day and the other 28 are postponed, say, <Col N="1566" /> to the following Wednesday at another venue.  The doctor gets a few more through there&mdash;perhaps more if there are no solicitors.</P>
    <P>Who is going to do all that?  Who are the witnesses going to be?  How are they going to prove their cases? What is the human machinery?  What regard are you going to have for the law of evidence?  How are you going to prove your case and is there any use going to court if all your cases are going to be &ldquo;turfed&rdquo; one after another?  Even if you succeed, after a good many days in court, with regard to that one school, look at all the time that is lost.  Look at the school children who could have been inspected while your staff was sitting down in court.</P>
    <P>Frankly I regard the proposals contained here as nonsense.  They are not required and there is not, I think, one of the officers dealing with this particular question, that welcomes or even will accept the responsibilities put on them here.  I know that in cities and in the very dense areas there is a high percentage, higher than anywhere else, of absentees from school inspection. You have a choice of two roads to go&mdash; either by attraction to get them there or by compulsion to try to drive them there.  Do you think that fines on 20 or 30 parents who are brought into that court are going to work miracles? You will blister those parents all right, but do you think it is going to have the effect you want?  The school medical inspection scheme is going to be cursed by every one of those parents. Now the whole scheme of school medical inspection has not yet come of age.  It is only in the phase of youth. It is still growing, still developing, but it is growing and developing in the right way.  It is becoming healthier every year that passes over and this kind of officious meddling is going to do immense and irreparable harm.  It cannot possibly do good.  It is not required and it can only do harm.</P>
    <P>The whole foundation of a health service is confidence, co-operation, harmony and a rather greedy acceptance of the facilities of the service being given.  The very minute that <Col N="1567" /> these services have got to function with the aid of the police, under the shadow of the courts, through fear of penalties, then the whole new service is still-born. Not only is it still-born, but it is still-born with an ugly disfiguring scar.  The whole thing is ill-conceived, prompted all right by the best intentions in the world, but rushed into print without taking consultation or advice.  I think that one of the grandest services established in this State is the school medical inspection and treatment scheme.  I do not think there is any other service to equal it in beneficial results.  I do not think any other service has brought parents and the State so closely together in harmony and confidence. I know there are areas that are still backward, but there is no area so backward as mine was 18 years ago &mdash;not a single one in all Ireland.  If I had got compulsory powers and applied them, the very name of public health would be detested in County Meath.  It has developed up to the point now that good parents, anxious about the health of their children and the remedying of their defects, are weekly applying to have them examined out of turn and to have the school rotation upset so as to give it another direction.  The same remark applies to teachers.</P>
    <P>My experience is the experience of the vast majority.  There may be an exception or two.  But, if that is the position, why take chances with it? Why introduce this hateful element of coercion?  Why have the work go on under the threat of the big stick and why should we people here, sensible people, with plenty of work to do, spend our time, waste our time, arguing as to the extent of the penalty that we will impose on parents whose children happen to be absent from school medical inspection?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, this has been a most unsatisfactory debate.  I have tried to confine myself to amendments, so far, but Deputies have come in and made very long speeches on the whole principle enshrined in this section.  I do not think that Deputy Dr. O'Higgins or Deputy <Col N="1568" /> Dillon could maintain that they have kept to the amendments.  They have taken occasion to make a speech on the whole principle underlying this section. Of course, if the particular amendment we are dealing with is carried, the section goes and therefore, it could possibly be argued that I cannot argue against that amendment unless I argue for the section because, if the section is necessary, penalties are necessary and if I want to tell the Dáil that I believe the penalty is necessary, I must tell the Dáil that I believe the section is necessary.</P>
      <P>When I came to the Dáil with this Bill on Second Reading, I thought it was received rather favourably and I thought we could have amendments brought into the Bill in a friendly and good spirit but it is not so easy to maintain that spirit when you have Deputies like Deputy Dr. O'Higgins and Deputy Dillon mentioning in practically every sentence of their tirade &ldquo;lunacy&rdquo;, &ldquo;hysteria&rdquo;, &ldquo;bedlam&rdquo;, &ldquo;nonsense&rdquo;, &ldquo;tinkering with a machine that is going satisfactorily&rdquo;, &ldquo;officious meddling&rdquo;, &ldquo;ill-conceived legislation&rdquo; and so on.  Surely if these Deputies have a good case, they ought to be able to make their case without being offensive but it does not appear to be possible for the Deputies to make the case without using these epithets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said this is a matter of principle, that he was against this compulsory examination as a matter of principle.  If you are standing on principle, you cannot depart from it but Deputy Dillon did say that if, for instance, there was an epidemic, he would agree to have compulsory examination.  Surely, if you undermine the principle, the principle goes. Why does Deputy Dillon agree, for instance, in case of epidemic to allow children to be examined?  Because he thinks that these children should be protected and that the community in general should be protected from any disease spreading.  Deputy Dillon probably has in mind epidemics like, let us say, typhus or some of these very dangerous epidemics but there are insidious diseases that spread if not detected.  Tuberculosis is one instance of a disease which may be there and <Col N="1569" /> which may spread to the whole family if it is not detected and treated.  There are such things that affect children like impetigo and itch, which interfere with their health very much and, unfortunately, as we all admit, these particular diseases affect the very children who are not submitted for medical examination at school or elsewhere, the children who are likely to be affected with impetigo, itch or one of these diseases that come to children that are not very well kept in their own homes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They can be examined. Deputy Dr. O'Higgins made a very long speech on this particular amendment and went into the matter very widely and I had the greatest patience when listening to him and not interrupting him.  Deputy Dr. O'Higgins talked for the medical officers of health in this country.  I have their reports here and I have as good a right to quote them as Deputy Dr. O'Higgins has.  I will quote some of them to show whether it is necessary to go farther in this medical examination of children, or not.</P>
      <P>The first that I have a quotation from here says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Attention has been repeatedly called to the difficulty of impressing upon parents the wisdom of paying attention to the care of their children's teeth and in spite of all our efforts in the way of personal interview, follow-up visits, etc., there is still a decided fall in the numbers presented.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Another says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Anything less than 75 per cent. <Col N="1570" /> of the children on the rolls cannot be looked upon as satisfactory because the very children who are most in need of medical examination are among those deliberately kept at home by careless or incompetent parents on the day of the school inspection.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are the people we want to get after&mdash;the careless and incompetent parents who, according to this medical officer of health, keep their children deliberately at home on the day of inspection and Deputy Dr. O'Higgins says: &ldquo;Do not do anything about it; try to persuade them&rdquo; and so on.  Are we to stand idly by and not only permit those parents to neglect their own children but also to put the neighbours' children and others in danger of the spread of infection of those things I have mentioned?</P>
    <P>Another medical officer of health says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Some parents think that if the child is in apparently good health any medical examination is uncalled for.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That might answer some of Deputy Dillon's arguments.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Such an attitude indicates ignorance of the real object of school medical service, namely, the prevention of illness and the maintenance of normal health, and it is to be regretted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are still parents who refuse to allow their child to be examined either because they consider it beneath their dignity or, according to their own estimation, unnecessary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I find that on my next visit to the schools in question, within a few years, these teeth which could have been saved by fillings have to be extracted.  There is legislation which compels children to attend school.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Party opposite must not have been here when that was brought in.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There should also be legislation to compel parents to have their children's teeth attended to.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1571" /> It is very hard to see how any Legislature should compel children to go to school and not compel them at least to submit to an examination&mdash;we are not compelling them to be treated&mdash; so that parents may be told, at least, that their child should have his teeth attended to or his eyes attended to or that something else should be done for the child's sake and for the sake of the community in general.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Another report is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Under such a scheme as school medical inspection, there will, I presume, always remain certain individual parents who, for no good reason, refuse to avail themselves of the facilities offered.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These are reports of some of the medical officers of health who at least have to complain that things are not going as smoothly as Deputy Dr. O'Higgins would convey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Going back to school attendance, I do not think the Deputy is right in what he says but, at any rate, I think <Col N="1572" /> the Parties in this House never objected on principle, as they do here, to compulsory education.  Why was the drive made for education?  So that we might have the children of this country grow up without illiteracy amongst them.  In other words, the idea was to train the children to be good citizens, able to look after themselves.  Surely it is just as important that we should have the health of the children attended to so that they may grow up physically strong and healthy as well as educated, if we want them to look after themselves properly when they come to a certain age.  It is not only that. After all, an illiterate person is not dangerous to his neighbours, whereas a delicate child may be.  There is a double reason why we should be particular about the health of our children in this country.  Therefore, we should do everything that is humanly possible to see that the child's health is improved.  The Constitution was quoted about family life.  I would like Deputies to know that Article 42 (5) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In exceptional cases, where the parents for physical or moral reasons fail in their duty towards their children, the State as guardian of the common good, by appropriate means shall endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard for the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon raised the question of Christian Scientists.  I want to point out that so far as this section goes, the section compels under certain circumtances parents to present their children for examination but it does not in any circumstances compel the parents to have their children treated.  The doctor will tell the parent, if he thinks that the child requires treatment, that it would be advisable for the child to get treatment but he does not go further than that.  The parent can adopt his advice or not as he thinks fit but the section does not go beyond that particular point.  It should be remembered too that this particular section is adoptable.  In the Bill as it was brought in first it was to have been applicable to the whole country but, <Col N="1573" /> in view of speeches made on Second Reading and, in particular, a speech made by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins in which he suggested that the section might be made adoptable, this amendment was brought in.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. O'Higgins stated on the Second Reading:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the general powers asked for here are necessary or defensible in certain zones or areas, I suggest to the Minister that he should make these powers adoptive; if any administrative body wants to adopt legal compulsion behind the medical work of the county, let them adopt it the same as all adoptive Acts are applied to certain areas, but do not apply them to the country generally.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what I have done by putting down these amendments.  One would have expected that having, as it were, fallen in with the request of Deputy Dr. O'Higgins in bringing in this amendment to make the clause adoptive that the amendment would not have been described by all these epithets of &ldquo;lunacy&rdquo;, &ldquo;hysteria&rdquo;, &ldquo;nonsense&rdquo;, &ldquo;officious meddling&rdquo;, &ldquo;ill-conceived drafting&rdquo;, etc., that met it when it came along.  As I have said in the beginning, if this amendment put in by Deputy Mulcahy is carried the section goes.  Therefore, a vote for the amendment or against the section appears to amount to the same thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I invited the Minister on the Second Reading, and again speaking on this section, to make to the House a reasonable case so as to convince Deputies, on the case made, that school medical inspection was not going along progressively and in the right direction.  Might I say now that one point which I did make every time I stood up in connection with this Bill and to which I called the attention of the Minister and of every Deputy on each occasion I stood up is that I did not claim to speak on behalf of any organised body of the profession; that I was speaking as a Deputy of this House with a certain individual experience of the work we are discussing? I made that clear.  I think that <Col N="1574" /> the suggestion put forward by the Minister that I was claiming to speak on behalf of the society or the main body of the county medical officers of health was uncalled for.  I did invite the Minister on the Second Reading&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to misrepresent the Deputy but I thought the Deputy said that at a full meeting of county medical officers of health two of them said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; but after argument said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fact.  I am not speaking on their behalf.  I do not claim to, and I made it clear that I was not claiming that.  However, I am entitled to give to the House the benefit of any experience I have had whether in association with others or in pursuing my own particular field of activity.  I invited the Minister&mdash;and I can see that there has been a rather thorough search of the Custom House vaults&mdash;on the Second Reading, to bring all the information, all the ammunition he could mobilise to justify asking for compulsory powers behind school medical inspection.  We have got the ammunition now.  I told the House before it heard the explosion that it would turn out to be a blank cartridge. There are some 30 medical reports on school medical inspection every year. The work has been going on, all over, for 12 to 15 years.  About four or five medical reports on school medical inspection and a number of abstracts&mdash; some of them completely irrelevant&mdash; are all that can be dug out of all that huge mass of material to judge by what we have heard here from the Minister. One medical officer deplores the fact that there are a number of parents who do not appreciate the value of school medical inspection.  Do you think a fine will make the parents deplore it any less, or make the situation less deplorable?  Do you think a fine will make them appreciate the value of school medical inspection?  A fine will arouse anger and make them detest school medical inspection.  That is what I fear&mdash;the stirring up of a volume of hatred in every district against the new health machinery and the existing health machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1575" /> There was a lot of distrust, suspicion, and a certain amount of animosity in the early days.  There were suggestions of probing by officialdom, etc.  We survived all that.  We have lived it down.  We lived it down and triumphed by getting the confidence, the trust, the co-operation and the friendship of parents, teachers and managers, even getting a certain amount of the affection and confidence of the little children.  Now we are going to call in the police behind our new health services.  We are going to make people toe the health line under the threat of heavy financial penalties. The Minister objects to adjectives.  I am not a master of adjectives, but even if I were, I would confess myself incapable of finding a suitable one to apply to what we are proposing to do here.</P>
    <P>In the case of these infectious ailments that are to be detected, according to the Minister, at school medical inspections&mdash;itch, infestation, impetigo, tuberculosis, etc.&mdash;Section 43 will convey to any parent that he is not to send his children to school if the children are in an itchy condition.  The real value of a school medical inspection in my opinion, particularly in certain areas, is that it is a private confidential way of getting after the dirty child whose parents to not know, or understand, how to keep a child clean and free from vermin.  That is the biggest value of all and I am not minimising the value in other directions.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had made any use of the knowledge that is in the books before him as regards the number of cases of lice infections found at every school medical inspection he would have seen that the real value of a school medical inspection is that one comes across those cases and that the nurse can give the parent, in private, a little bit of advice, and a little bit of material.  She can tell her how she is to clean the child and how easily she can keep the child clean.  That is the real value of those school medical inspections, but when you come to Section 43 you prohibit that child going to a school medical inspection.  In <Col N="1576" /> other words, you are prohibiting, inside the Bill, the attendance of the very kind of child that you want there on the day of school medical inspection. Is that evidence that this provision has been carefully worked out, that there have been ample and adequate consultations, and that there has been a reasonable amount of consideration given to the clauses which the Dáil is asked to adopt?</P>
    <P>This is a new health Bill.  I understand that the primary school medical inspection is to be carried out through the machinery of the district medical officer.  The machinery of the district medical officer is far closer to parents and children than the central county machinery.  The district medical officer, in the course of his ordinary practice and of his routine duties from day to day, knows very well who are absent and who are present, and particularly those who should be present.  He is the friend of the people in his district.  If there is a certain amount of absenteeism in certain districts at the moment, why not have enough confidence in the new machinery, with its close contact and continuous approach between the medical examiner and the parents, to bring about an improvement? Does the Minister seriously think that a 75 per cent. attendance is a bad attendance, or that by any legal machinery or process he is going to get a higher attendance?  He should ask his colleague the Minister for Education how a roll is made up in a country school.  It is made up at the beginning of the school year by bringing all the little kiddies of three and four years of age to the school.  They all go on the roll, but most of them do not continue going to school in the first year. A 75 per cent. attendance of those on the roll is, in fact, a 98 per cent. attendance of the effectives.  If, at the school medical inspection, you reach or pass the average attendance, is that not good?  If you have a higher number present at school at a medical inspection than what is the average attendance, is not that excellent?  Does it not show that you are beating the average because of the desire of parents to avail of the machinery, even though that attendance may be only <Col N="1577" /> 75 per cent. of the attendance of those on roll?  In most rural areas that will be so.</P>
    <P>One of the quotations we got from the Minister was that a 75 per cent. attendance was not satisfactory.  It was certainly an optimist who wrote that, and Utopia is the place where that particular medical officer should be functioning.  We all know that a 75 per cent. attendance is a good attendance. The Minister for Education does not have that as his average attendance in the schools as against those on the roll.  With all the new health machinery, with all the aids that we have to our hand at the moment and that we did not have even three years ago, with the lightning speed with which it is possible to clean up even the worst cases of infestation, has not the Minister not enough faith and confidence in his machine to know that the parents of dirty children, seeing the results obtained in the case of others, will be keen and anxious to avail of that machinery and to have their own children cleaned up in the same way? In the early days when there was a very poor attendance at school medical inspection the children who attended got their glasses and they got their teeth and their tonsils removed.  When the parents of other children saw the benefits that were to be obtained they were panting for the next school medical inspection so that their own children would get similar benefits.  It is a wrong time to be taking a decision to invoke the law in the first year when ordinary supplies are beginning to come in.</P>
    <P>Those materials which were discovered and used during the war would be of immense benefit to the school medical inspection staff and would have wonderful results with regard to parents.  Surely this is not the time to go in for force?  Surely it is not wise that the start of our new health legislation, sound and beneficial and in every way admirable in its aims and objects, should be to go to the police station and to the District Court, to see that one person is brought to hospital between a pair of Civic Guards, and that another person is mulcted in the District Court because <Col N="1578" /> he did not avail of the benefits that we have provided.  It is very unwise, it is folly, it is going to put the brand of failure on the new Health Bill.  At this period, little more than 20 years after the start of our public health service, if you associate it with an element of compulsion, the policeman's baton, the district justice's fine, you are going to replace trust and confidence, affection and harmony by hatred and detestation.</P>
    <P>I am not going to take up any more of the Minister's time or the time of the Dáil arguing this point of compulsion, either on this section or subsequent sections.  Any person with any experience in any walk of life and with any sense of honour can only make available to others his absolute convictions and, if those who had not any such experience by weight of numbers or by virtue of position or authority say they are going to have their way, I for one will not block their path.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In referring to the Constitution, the Minister produced Articles 41 and 42 and finally found anchorage in sub-section (5) of Article 42.  What does that sub-section say? It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In exceptional cases, where the parents for physical or moral reasons fail in their duty to their children, the State as guardian of the common good by appropriate means shall endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard to the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Does any rational Deputy argue that I &mdash;or any citizen of this State-have failed in my duty towards my children because I did not have them examined twice a year by the public health doctor or an approved physician?  Is there any lawyer in Ireland so thread-bare and destitute that he would accept a fee to argue that proposition before any bench, however incompetent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister acknowledges that, reading Articles 41 and 42, he feels the whole weight of them are against him, unless he may avail of the specific exception provided for under Section 5, where is there any Deputy who will argue that we have failed for physical <Col N="1579" /> or moral reasons in our duty towards our children if the only allegation brought against us is that we did not submit them twice a year to medical examination?</P>
    <P>Do Deputies realise the implications of conferring these compulsory powers? Do Deputies realise that the Bill provides for &ldquo;authorised persons&rdquo;? Authorised persons are persons designated by the county manager to see that the provisos of this legislation are made effective.  It is not until you get to Sections 86, 87, 88, 89 and 90 that you begin to realise what is going to happen to you.  If you do not submit your child to medical examination as often as the county manager tells you, he may break down your door, may burst into your house, he may arrest you in the street, he may remove you in custody to a police station and there detain you for 24 hours.  Unless you satisfy him that your answers to his questions are true&mdash;and produce independent confirmation of the information tendered to the authorised person&mdash;he may summon the Guards, who must at his instance assist him to drag you to the police station and if you resist you thereby commit a criminal offence.  Now, if you produce an exemption, he is entitled to ignore it until you prove its validity.</P>
    <P>Section 91 and all these pains and penalties are to be provided for the parents of a child in this country who are not prepared to submit it to medical examination as often as the county manager by regulation should provide.  Surely we are not all in bedlam. If this House votes for a proposition of that kind, the sooner we move our deliberations to Grangegorman and ask the R.M.S. of that institution to look after us the better. Can you conceive some warble-fly inspector out of a job, appointed an &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; under this Act, turning up at the door of any one of us and saying he wants to satisfy himself that all the children in the house have been submitted for inspection? You tell him to go away about his business, but he breaks down the door and forcibly enters and cross-questions you and, if you do not afford him <Col N="1580" /> satisfactory answers, he arrests you and brings you to the police station, where he may detain you for 24 hours.</P>

      <P>Deputies will please remember that this is the Report Stage and they may speak only once to an amendment.  With regard to amendments Nos. 1 to 3 on the Paper it might be argued that the principle in each case was was decided on amendments in Committee.  The first two, however, propose to substitute amounts for those contained in the Bill substantially less than proposed by the Deputy in Committee.  Amendment No. 3 caused me some doubt, the difference between it and the corresponding Committee amendment being only £100 as compared with £120 but, having accepted the other two, I will admit all three.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, Section 2, lines 30 and 31, to delete the words &ldquo;two hundred and sixty pounds&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;three hundred pounds&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendments I moved on Committee were related definitely to the value of money to-day as compared with the value of money pre-war.  I wanted to put the position in that particular perspective and I feel that the case I made on Committee was practically unanswerable from the financial point of view.  The amendments I have tabled here contain suggestions made by an organised body of professional and clerical workers in the city.  Their representations were put very clearly and very fully before the Revenue Commissioners in a number of interviews they had with them, and, I am sure, have reached the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put one simple point.  In 1939, an unmarried individual with an income of £150 per year was entirely <Col N="1581" /> free of income-tax.  He secured relief of one-fifth in respect of earned income and a personal allowance of £120, so that his total income was free from tax.  Under the proposals in the Bill, a person with £175 income will receive relief of £35 in respect of earned income and £140 personal allowance, so that he will be free of income-tax, but if the 1939 man went above £150 and the 1947 man above £175, the 1939 man would be assessed to income-tax on the first £100 at 2/9, and, above £100, at 5/6 and the 1947 man would be assessed on the first £100 at 3/3, and, above £100, at 6/6.  An income of £175 per annum to-day represents a standard of living represented by £105 pre-war, so that, in fact, whereas pre-war the man with a standard of living marked by an income of £150 would be entirely free of income-tax, to-day the man with an income of £105 related to 1939 would reach the income-tax level, so that the actual penetration of the burden of income-tax has moved down by one-third to the class represented by those with an income of £150 per year in 1939.</P>
    <P>It is that fact which I have been trying to drive home to the Minister and to Deputies in order to emphasise to them that that is the penetration into their lives of a very considerable hardship, and when one considers the enormous amount of income-tax being raised at present and the field there is for raising it, I think it is unjust, and I accordingly propose that the level to which the personal allowance should be raised should be £300 instead of £260, as the Minister proposes.  If he does that, he will still leave a position in which the burden of income-tax will fall on people who are below a standard of living represented by an earning of £150 in 1939.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed an amendment very similar to this but slightly different in amount very fully in Committee. I pointed out then the reasons why I could not accept a series of amendments on these lines moved by Deputy Mulcahy.  There has been no change in the situation since last week, when we discussed it.  One would like to go as far as one could to relieve the burdens of the people who are hard hit, <Col N="1582" /> but, after considering all the circumstances of the country, the bill we have to meet and the position of the people from whom we collect the taxes, I feel that we are doing pretty well for the income-tax payers when we increase the personal allowance by £40 for the married person.  We cannot go any further at present.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, before line 35, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Finance Act, 1936, shall be construed and have effect as if the words &ldquo;one hundred pounds&rdquo; were substituted therein for the words &ldquo;sixty pounds&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of accepting the amendment would be that, instead of £60 relief being given for each child, there would be a relief of £100.  The Minister spoke of the position of a married person with three children when we were discussing <Col N="1583" /> this matter in Committee.  In 1939, a person with an income of £500 who had three children would not have to pay income-tax, but if he had an income above that, he would have to pay income-tax.  He would receive a relief of £100 for earned income, £220 for being a married person and £180 for three children.  In 1947, an income of £500 in a similar case would be completely free of income-tax.  An income of £550 in such circumstances would also be completely free of income-tax, because the allowance for earned income would be £110; the personal allowance for a married person under the present Finance Bill is £260; and the person will also receive £180 relief in respect of three children.  But the earning value of £550 to-day as against £550 in 1939 would mean a very seriously reduced standard of living.</P>
    <P>In fact, the standard of living on £325 in 1939 would compare with the standard of living on £500 to-day.  That means that the weight of income-tax has penetrated the standard of living represented by £500 in 1939 to the extent that a person would have 35 per cent. less than in 1939.  When we take into consideration the standard of living in 1939 of a person who had to maintain a wife and family and a home on £500, we can realise how his standard of living would be depressed when the money value of his income is reduced to £325.  The Minister's proposals at present, therefore, mean that, instead of having an income of £500 free of income-tax, he will really have to pay income-tax from £325 up.  That is the effect of what the Minister is proposing in the Finance Bill.  I, therefore, press that the addition proposed in this amendment in respect of children should be given and that, instead of a relief of £60, the relief should be £100 in respect of each child.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a proposal which I want to support, and I support it as a result of my experience behind my own counter.  A person with three children has a very considerable quantity of clothes to buy in the 12 months.  Before the war, a person could have bought a pair of boots for <Col N="1584" /> a school-going child for 12/-; the the same pair of boots would cost him to-day from 18/- to £1.  He could have bought a ready-made suit of good quality with short pants for 37/6; the same suit would cost £3 3s. 0d. to-day. He could have bought a jersey of durable quality for 3/-; the same jersey would cost from 4/11 to 5/6 to-day.  He could have bought a pair of three-quarter length turned-down top hose before the war of durable quality for 1/11, and of good quality for 3/-; the same stockings to-day would cost 2/9 and from 4/- to 4/6, respectively.</P>
      <P>Take the little girl.  A great deal of the raiment she would ordinarily wear might reasonably be made by her mother in the case of a family with three children whose income was £500 a year.  Therefore, if you turn to the price of textiles, you will find that a piece of serge, 54 inches wide, suitable for making a school frock for a child might have been purchased for 5/11 pre-war; the same cloth to-day would cost, I should say, 17/- per yard.  A summer frock could be made out of a wide variety of excellent cotton material which could have been purchased for 1/- per yard; the same material to-day would cost from 3/- to 3/6.  The comparative costs of hoisery would, in the girl's case, be approximately the same as the boy's.  The same may be said of shoes.  That item of clothing alone has cast upon parents on the border line of income-tax liability, with three or more children, a very onerous burden.  If my recollection serves me aright, the Minister stated, in his concluding observations, when this matter was raised, that the concessions here envisaged would cost £280,000 in revenue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We will call it £250,000. Considering the acute difficulties under which the parents of families in that <Col N="1585" /> particular stratum of society are labouring, surely we can contemplate whatever economy might be necessary on all the services of the State to permit of this extra concession.  I think it is agreed that one of the most hardly pressed sections of the community at present is the salary earner.  Observe that I use the word &ldquo;salary.&rdquo;  The wage earner has had the powerful support of his trade unions and the Labour Court, who have laid down generally that there should be an increase of from 40 per cent. to 60 per cent. on pre-war wages, according to the level of wages obtaining pre-war. We all know that that kind of person, who had from £400 to £600 a year before the war, has not received an increase which would compare with the percentages to which I have referred.</P>
      <P>I think most of us are aware, amongst our own personal acquaintances, of numbers of people who are in a state of very acute embarrassment and I think many are going seriously into debt, simply because they are hoping against hope that they shall not be required to call upon their children to accept and display a quite different standard of living from that to which they have been accustomed since their education at school began.  What more deserving section of a community can we contemplate than two young persons who, on the threshold of their careers, have given hostages to fortune and married, trusting that providence would smile on their venture and see them through?  It is such as they who belong to the category who would benefit by this proposal; it is such as they who, for the time being, must sometimes feel that what was deemed to be praiseworthy optimism when they set forth, has turned out to be somewhat foolhardy in the situation in which they now stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all understand fully that it is impossible for the Minister for Finance, in the early stages of the Finance Bill discussion, to announce material concessions because, if he does so, there will rise around him a cloud of applicants like midges on a summer evening, all with their special axes to grind.  No midge can fly after this amendment has <Col N="1586" /> been disposed of.  There is no further stage at which a concession can be sought or granted in respect of this financial year.  If, as I imagine is the case, all sides of this House would combine in praising that section of our community which has dared to establish their own homes early on, trusting to their own industry and ability to meet the growing charges of a growing family, surely it would be no extravagant gesture, at a cost of less than £250,000, to contribute in some small measure to the readily ascertainable additional cost that falls upon those parents in clothing their children, over and above the other increased costs that the admitted inflation is bringing upon them, especially when we consider that, unlike a member of a trade union, they have not got the advantage of concerted action to adjust their income; unlike a man engaged in business, they have not earned, from an inflated turnover, a larger profit; and they are unlike the man of commanding position, who may challenge his employer to adjust his remuneration to the new circumstances or else lose his services.</P>
    <P>Most of these people are at that moment in their careers when, with the responsibility of a family upon them, they must walk warily lest they should find themselves confronted with the unthinkable catastrophe of unemployment. Nothing should more refresh a Legislature omnipotent in its own sphere than to choose the most defenceless section of the community and confer upon it whatever benefits reasonable discretion will permit, leaving it to those who are strong to fend for themselves.  Here then is a section of our community who, because they have made this precious and valuable contribution to the State and the community generally in that they are founding families and voluntarily undertaking the obligation to work to the limit of their capacity in order to maintain their households in accordance with the standard that their status in society requires, appear to want some concession to meet the difficulties which have impinged upon them with peculiar severity.</P>
    <P>We have the resources to provide for <Col N="1587" /> them.  There is no danger, if the Minister will see his way to do it now, of his being bombarded by other requests.  It would be from every point of view, as I see it, desirable.  I can think of no argument against it.  I believe he would be the first Minister for Finance in 25 years who ever made a handsome gesture if he were to say: &ldquo;Very well, that is a good suggestion and I will adopt it.&rdquo;  It would be a benefit to those people quite disproportionate in its beneficence, for it would relieve them of so heavy a strain.  It is the kind of thing I would love to have a chance of doing because it would mean that, being responsible for the public purse, one had not retired into the dustier fastnesses of the Department of Finance, but still kept half a foot in the everyday world.  It is too much to hope, I suppose, that the Minister will grasp this unparalleled opportunity.  It would be a great happiness to think he might.</P>

      <P>They have to pay no income-tax practically speaking.  A man who has £600 a year, earned income, and who is married with three children, pays £9 5s. 3d.  He gets £6 10s. in children's allowances.  He is, therefore, only a few pounds out of pocket.  A married man with three children who has an earned income, does not have to pay income-tax unless he earns over £529.  I make the Deputy a present of what he would have to pay up to £600 a year.  A vital difficulty in Deputy Mulcahy's amendment is that it would not effect the purpose which he advocates.  While Deputy Dillon spoke of three or four children, this amendment would only give an increase from £60 to £100 a year in the case of the first two children and the allowance for other children would be left at £43 a year each.  He probably <Col N="1588" /> had not that in mind, but that is the effect of this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking of the comparative allowances.  A single man has a certain allowance and a married man is granted an allowance on another level.  I was saying that on the last day when we were discussing this matter, we considered that as we were confined to giving a personal allowance of £140 a year to a single person, £60 per child was a reasonable amount to grant for children.  I think that if the State found itself in circumstances in which it could give further reliefs from income-tax, those reliefs from now on should keep in step as between the single person, the married man with no children and the married man with varying numbers of children.  I think the allowance is fair and equitable at the moment.</P>

    <P>I spoke on the Committee Stage on the subject matter of amendment No. 4 and that is the reason I did not move it on this stage.  I did not give any particular attention at that time to the subject matter of this amendment.

A director whose salary is earned may have to pay the particular tax referred to in this amendment, surtax, and, at the same time, his salary is not allowed as a deduction from the profits earned by the company of which he is managing director in order to arrive at an assessment for corporation profits tax.  There is, therefore, an element of double taxation, particularly in the case of the company in which the managing director is proprietor.  It is really a one-man company.</P>

On his behalf, I want to protest at this conspiracy of Deputy Costello, behind Deputy McGilligan's back, to give more money to the profiteers&mdash;instead of charging them 2/- or thereabouts, to give them 7/6 additional relief.  If a surtax payer is one of these directors and if he can get rid of his surtax by paying corporation profits tax alone, he might very well save 7/6 at the cost of paying 2/-.

      <P>With your permission, I would like to say one or two words on a subject matter that I have not mentioned and that perhaps I ought to have mentioned in the course of some of the earlier stages of this Bill.  My explanation for not having raised this particular matter is that it was only brought to my attention last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has taken refuge in some sort of suggestion that Deputy McGilligan and I are at cross-purposes, he charging against the profiteers and I vigorously defending them.  On this particular proposition that I have to make I am descending to the lower scale, going down to the person who has not had to pay income-tax until quite recently and who has now to pay it by reason of the increase in wages and salaries.  It has been brought to my notice that there are certain people who, by reason of increases in wages and perhaps in the lower salaries, have been brought within the ambit of the income-tax code. They now have to pay income-tax where they never had to pay it before. They make no complaint about that beyond the same complaint that anybody makes who has to pay that tax, but it does fall more heavily upon those in a particular trade or business because they have not been in the habit of paying income-tax and the income-tax is not deducted from their wages or salaries.  They have not got the custom of saving against the time when the income-tax becomes payable and, <Col N="1591" /> accordingly, they find themselves in the position of having to resort to a plea to the income-tax collector to give them time to pay and to pay by instalments. What I want the Minister to do is, if he can see his way to do it, to make arrangements administratively, or, if necessary, by the appropriate legislation, in respect of that kind of income-tax payers, who find the imposition of the income-tax for the first time bearing heavily upon them, not so much in the matter of the actual weight of the taxation as in its mode of payment, to have a system&mdash;I presume it would not be possible to arrange such a system as exists in England of pay as you earn&mdash;but a system by which people on making a particular case can make payment of their tax by instalments.</P>
    <P>The only trade I was approached about is the bakery trade and, by reason of the increases in wages, by reason particularly of the fact that workers in that trade have to work overtime, income-tax is payable by certain of the tradesmen in that trade. They have endeavoured from time to time, as I am informed, to pay their income-tax in instalments and they have been refused acceptance of the income-tax in instalments or in part. I bring this, perhaps belatedly, to the attention of the Minister in order to see that if at all possible these people may receive some consideration.  Of course, in strictness, everybody has to pay income-tax twice a year at a particular period of the year and income-tax collectors normally give a certain amount of rope, so to speak, to the payers until a certain number of months has elapsed.  But these people pay their income-tax twice a year.  The normal human thing for a person is to spend the money on himself or his family, overlooking the fact that a bill will come in six months' time when a heavy demand will be made on him for income-tax, and unless such persons have had the practice of putting aside from each week's wages a sufficient sum to meet that half-yearly demand when it comes, they will find themselves faced with bills which weigh extremely heavily upon them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1592" /> I would ask the Minister to consider that aspect of these cases.  I regret that I had not the opportunity of bringing it to his attention before and perhaps that I have not, even at this late stage, brought it to his attention in such detailed fashion as might enable him to consider the whole circumstances of the case.  It was only brought to my attention late last night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the last occasions on which we will have an opportunity of referring to the Minister's general finance policy and I want to avail of it to say a word about the implications of the customs revenue that he designs to raise in the current financial year.  I watch with growing dismay the robbery and plunder that is being done by a bunch of racketeers in this country under the protection of the Minister's customs revenue' policy.  I see tariffs levied on commodities ordinarily usable by the less prosperous elements of our community and I see the domestic price of the commodity in respect of which the tariff is imposed raised by racketeers in this country up to the highest possible penny that that tariff will permit them to collect.  I see girls and women trying to buy a hat.  I see millinery hats coming in from Great Britain, the wholesale price of which is 7/11, and I see those hats copied, deliberately copied&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to deal with the consequences of levying tariffs of the kind which, collectively, are designed to raise a customs revenue of £19,000,960.  I see the 7/11 hat brought into this country and the copy hat being sold at 12/11.  Is there rhyme or reason for that?  Why in the name of common sense should women of modest <Col N="1593" /> means in this country pay a levy of 5/- on every hat that is worn to a monoplist who exists by virtue of a prohibitive tariff imposed by this House?  Reckon up what that means. Is anyone in this House sufficiently interested to count the units of millinery consumed in this country in the year and see what 5/- per unit costs to the community?  Did any Deputy ever bother to reckon, taking quality and price into consideration, what those customs duties add to the cost of a pair of children's boots purchasable by the country people?  I wish that Deputies had the experience that I have had of standing behind a counter and collecting from the country people the excess price charged on indispensable commodities, to know that you are collecting them from people who are put to the pin of their collar to make ends meet, and to know the individuals into whose pockets those profits were going.</P>

      <P>I feel the Minister for Finance has a very grave responsibility which, I regret to say, he and his predecessors in office have felt themselves entitled to shovel off and simply collect as a windfall the revenue deriving from these tariffs, declaring that while he has no responsibility for them they are a matter for another Minister.  The net fact is that it is the Minister's Bill that imposes them and levies them and he is the person, the Minister for Finance, who makes the case to this House that the customs duties provided for in his Finance Bill impose a burden which will yield £19,960.</P>

      <P>The question of prices is a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make this point clear to the Minister: that it is only a very small part of the burden imposed upon our people and that sooner or later those Deputies in this House who are supposed to represent the ordinary people down in the country will be called upon to give an account of their stewardship when the people come fully to understand what has been done?  But there is another aspect of this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have at the present time accumulated in Great Britain very substantial sterling assets.  There is only one means whereby we can bring them home and that is by the purchase of commodities&mdash;capital or consumer goods&mdash;which our people can advantageously use at the present time. There can be very little doubt that there is proceeding in the world a pretty rapid inflationary spiral.  What does that mean?  It means that if we have external assets to-day worth £400,000,000 we can either seek to encash them in the form of goods which our people require or we can leave them on deposit where they are.  If we leave them on deposit by design and policy let us face this fact that, when we ultimately seek to bring them home, approximately one-third to one-half of <Col N="1595" /> their purchasing value will have disappeared. We could, with great advantage, at the present moment expend a substantial volume of those assets in Great Britain on the purchase of certain commodities which the British would be glad to sell us.  I am thinking of agricultural machinery in particular.  It might be a matter of negotiation.  But what is the position? Far from seeking to get that machinery, to get value for our money, we are forbidden to import and we leave our people deprived of what they urgently need.  We are unable to produce it here and we suffer our assets to dwindle in real value instead of using them advantageously at the present moment.</P>
    <P>Will Deputies in this House sit back and ask themselves when the new innumerable farmers of this country want equipment and cannot get it&mdash;are forbidden to acquire it from Great Britain&mdash;who benefits from that prohibition? There are numbers of consumer goods at the present time the cost of which is a heavy burden on that class of income-tax payer in whose behalf the amendments were moved here to-day.  Do Deputies know that very recently at the request of the racketeers in this country customs duties that had been taken off in order to facilitate the purchase of these goods were put on again because the domestic rackets were not as profitable as they used to be as the result of competition by the consumer goods coming in from Great Britain?  Is it not hard to believe at the present time, in face of all the scarcities, in face of the fierce burden that the cost of clothing a family involves, in face of the fact that certain categories of clothing are available for exchange, that with the sterling assets that we hold in Great Britain, our own Government prevents our people from having access to them because the domestic racketeers complain that if our people were permitted to purchase these things their profits would fall?  Is it any wonder that, in those circumstances, an individual can come in here from abroad and lay out approximately £50,000 on the erection and equipment of a factory and secure <Col N="1596" /> a tariff levied by our own Government in order to ensure that he will have free scope to force our people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Very well, I will return to it some other day.  I want to go on record as saying that the greatest curse that ever fell upon suffering humanity was the institution of tariffs. At the present moment the racketeers of the world, who are the sponsors and promoters of customs duties of this character, may well in their selfish viciousness be dragging the whole of humanity down to destruction.  This country, and the Minister for Finance, might give a lead to save the world if we took the initiative in banishing from our economy the accursed customs tariffs, and proclaimed the free passage of men, money and goods in so far as the territory that we are concerned with had relation with the outside world.  Were we to preach that doctrine, and were we to secure the <Col N="1597" /> adherence of the United States of America and the rest of the Commonwealth to it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is a strong statement, and perhaps on another occasion I shall get an opportunity of demonstrating its truth.  Let me end by saying that I want this House to remember that the greatest curse that ever fell not only on this country but on humanity was the protective customs tariff.  God grant that some day we will see it outlawed all the world over.</P>

We are a bit doubtful about Deputy Dillon's cure-alls for the difficulties that the world is in at the moment.

      <P>The only other point was raised by Deputy Costello, that we should introduce a system of paying by instalments for low income-tax payers.  I pointed out the level of income at which income-tax starts to be payable and payment begins very gradually.  It is costing us enough to collect the borderline cases where people only pay small sums and instead of having the Revenue Commissioners set up offices where people could pay a few pence a week, a much better idea would be for those income-tax payers themselves to pay a few shillings a week into one of the savings banks and then give it as a lump sum to the Revenue Commissioners when payment becomes due.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 16.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to be banking on the feeling that there is power to require compulsory attendance at school.  He ought to look up the decision given by the Supreme Court when the last School Attendance Bill was declared unconstitutional.  It was sent to the Supreme Court on a net point in connection with the Bill, but a judgment was given which <Col N="1601" /> showed that there was no power under the Constitution to require compulsory attendance at school.  It was declared that the only power the Government had under the Constitution was, under Article 42 (3) 2º, to set a minimum standard of education moral, intellectual and social, that these were the only compulsory powers the Government had, that it had no constitutional power to require compulsory attendance at school.  If the Minister is banking on a misunderstanding on that matter, to think that he may have compulsory powers analogous to that to operate this section, he would do well to refer to that matter.</P>
      <P>I would recall to him that, while only one point in the School Attendance Bill was referred to the Supreme Court at that time, the Bill, although it contained provisions that were considered to be very necessary, has never been brought before the House since then.  The Minister suggested that there was very general acceptance of the idea of compulsory school attendance in this country.  That is so; and the question of any difficulty in connection with it would never have been raised if undue interference with the rights of people in connection with the schooling of their children was not forced through this House, in spite of general warnings from various Parties in the House.  An element of compulsion of a particular kind was brought in, in a way that drove the Supreme Court, when the matter was brought before it, to examine the whole question and to show the constitutional weakness there was in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Now the Minister is apparently likely to find himself up against this&mdash; that by persisting in a particular type of compulsion in connection with medical inspection, he may find that there will fall from under his feet the authority that would come from a general and harmonious acceptance of a particular position by the people themselves.  That may fall from under his feet because he is proceeding to provide a service and to demand that that service be accepted by the people under a compulsion which the Minister may find he has no constitutional power to require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1602" /> I rather sympathise with the Minister in the position in which he has got himself.  This whole business of compulsion started with Section 87 of the unfortunate Public Health Act, 1945, when, with regard to the medical treatment of school children, in respect of which there was an educational movement, an excellent State service provided and a more extensive and voluntary acceptance of that service and a seeking after that service, the Parliamentary Secretary in charge of that Bill of 1945 brought in the idea of compulsion.  Section 87 of the Public Health Bill, 1945, read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  The parent of a child shall submit the child to any medical inspection provided for the child or at the child's school pursuant to the Public Health (Medical Treatment of Children) (Ireland) Act, 1919, or Section 85 of this Act.</P>
    <P>(2)  A person who contravenes sub-section (1) of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof in the case of a first offence, to a fine not exceeding £5 or, in the case of a second or any subsequent offence, to a fine not exceeding £10.</P>
    <P>(3)  An offence under this section may be prosecuted by the county authority who provided the relevant medical inspection.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister finds himself asked to handle that particular idea, and, in the new section, he gives just one outlet, that is, that where a person does not wish to submit to it, he is offered the alternative of getting whatever doctor he likes and having his child examined, or his two, three, four or five children examined, perhaps twice a year.  But, unfortunately, the original sin is there at the back of the whole idea and the Minister has to extricate himself from it.</P>
    <P>That is the position in which he finds himself.  He has a legacy of original sin from that section, and however awkward the Minister may find his position in having to endeavour to stand over the idea, I think he will realise, if he stands back from the <Col N="1603" /> situation, that much of what has been said here is quite correct, that is, that if the service is provided and the educational work done <i>pari passu</i> with the improvement and extension of the service, there will be more work done in a voluntary way than the service to-day, next year or the year after, can do.  He will find that, as the service grows and is capable of doing all the work there is to be done, compulsion will not be necessary and that compulsion introduced to-day will only prevent the voluntary work which could and would be done being done to the extent to which it might be done and will merely walk the Minister up against constitutional difficulties, difficulties with regard to liberty and freedom which the School Attendance Act walked everybody up against, a situation which has never yet been faced and which is accepted only because of the commonsense of the people.  The people even acquiesce in the cases brought before the District Court to-day for non-compliance with <Col N="1604" /> the School Attendance Act, because quite a number of people feel that it is reasonable and because the people being proceeded against are so poor and so far away from an understanding of things that they do not know that the Supreme Court has decided that there is no constitutional power in the State to compel the attendance at school of any child.</P>
    <P>I feel that I must press this amendment. The Minister says that to pass the amendment is to destroy the whole section.  I think it would be healthier to destroy the whole section by passing the amendment than to destroy the whole idea by bringing the Minister up against either the reaction of public opinion against this proposal or a declaration by the Supreme Court that what he proposed to do was unconstitutional and that the Legislature had no power to require people to surrender their children for medical examination and treatment in this way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (8) of the proposed new Section 21 (amendment No. 14).</P>
      <P>Sub-section (8) says that an offence under this section may be prosecuted by the health authority which provided the medical inspection.  The health authority may be either the county manager, the county medical officer of health, or perhaps some subordinate officer of the county medical officer of health.  We have had the position in relation to those who cut turf during the emergency that, in a rather discriminating way, a certain number of valuations were increased here and there throughout the country, without its being done in other parts of the country, entirely on the initiative of some local person.  We have had the Minister for Local Government washing his hands of any responsibility in the matter and saying that these people are only carrying out the law.</P>
      <P>If compulsion of this particular kind &mdash;I have yet to be clear as to the extent of the compulsion and what its effect will be&mdash;will be imposed either in particular districts or particular classes of districts or against particular classes of people, under whatever regulations the Minister may make, the Minister ought not to be allowed to wash his hands of responsibility in relation to what is being done under the Act.  I think it is not proper that, with so much doubt as to what is going to be done and as to what the effect of it will be, we should relieve the Minister of all responsibility and fix the local manager or the county medical officer of health with complete statutory responsibility for carrying out the provisions of this section, whatever they may be ultimately.  Therefore, I move the deletion of the sub-section. The House can consider subsequently who will be the prosecuting authority in this matter, but, whoever the prosecuting authority may be, the Minister for the time being should not be able to wash his hands of joint responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give the House the benefit of his information as to the individual or individuals who will be responsible for carrying prosecutions successfully to a conclusion?  The health authority is a rather vague affair.  It would be the manager or the county council.  But there is some individual who will have to attend court, who will have to give evidence on oath, who will have to produce records and satisfy the court that the conditions of the Act were complied with, namely, that the parents had due notice of the time and place of inspection.  Who will that individual be?  There is no member of my profession who has any ambition to find himself a head constable at the end of his days, and that is exactly what you are going to make out of each one of us, <Col N="1607" /> because it is obvious that the school medical inspector is the only person who can, with knowledge that will be acceptable as evidence in a court of law, give evidence as to who was or was not medically examined at a particular place at a particular time.</P>
      <P>If there is any serious intention behind this particular sub-section, and if it is not just a bluff, then we will spend the rest of our official existence in district courthouses.  Anyone who has had any experience of trying to carry a prosecution under any of the recent Acts&mdash;the Milk and Dairies Act or any one of those Acts&mdash;knows it is easy enough to go to court, but then you find yourself for six or seven weeks going from one courthouse to another. This is what I described before as interfering with a machine that is already going well.  The Minister must have had advice on this point and I would like him to tell us what steps will be taken, what procedure will be followed and what instrument will be used in proving these cases before the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I inquire of the Deputy if he has looked at Part IX, which provides for the enforcement of the measure?  Whatever the Minister's intentions may be, it is open to the local authority to proceed under paragraph (f) of Section 85 to appoint an officer of a sanitary authority, in writing, to be an authorised officer for the purpose of the enforcement of the Act.  That may mean any unemployed warble fly inspector.  He may be appointed an enforcement officer, but the Deputy need not be apprehensive, because if the ex-warble fly inspector's qualifications should seem to be inadequate this Bill proposes to give him powers to compensate for the inadequacy of his professional equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ex-warble fly inspector can proceed to you house and there address a series of questions to you. If you do not answer them to his satisfaction, and produce independent proof of the truth of your replies, he can arrest you and remove you to the local Garda station, there to be detained for <Col N="1608" /> 24 hours.  Should, however, the offending parent have the impudence not to be in his house when the ex-warble fly inspector arrives, or should the ex-warble fly inspector suspect that, when the parent emerges with six children for display, there is a seventh concealed upon the premises, under Section 88 he can break into the premises, but he must produce for inspection the letter which has transmogrified him from being a warble fly inspector into being an enforcement officer for the purposes of this Act, and he must confine his breaking-in activities to the hours of the day between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m.</P>
    <P>If you attempt to deter him from breaking down the door of your house, if you attempt to prevent him, you commit a criminal offence, on summary conviction for which you may be fined £20.  If the ex-warble fly inspector finds that his accoutrements are insufficient to grapple with the demands made upon him, he can command the attendance of a Civic Guard, who must, in uniform, at his behest, help to break into your house and, if needs be, to drag you to the police station, there to detain you for 24 hours.  That is provided for in Section 89.  Section 90 reaffirms that, but do not imagine, if you have got a document expressly exempting you from a demand made upon you by the ex-warble fly inspector, that that will be any protection, because you must prove to him, since the onus of proof is on you, that the document you produce&mdash;and this is provided for under Section 91&mdash;is genuine and valid.</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputy Dr. O'Higgins need apprehend that the medical profession will be troubled with the enforcement of this Bill. There is abundant power to provide a displaced warble fly inspector with compensatory employment.  Mind you, we are going to vote for giving a county manager of any county in Ireland power to delegate the powers set out from Section 85 to Section 91 to any authorised servant of the public authority.  How in the name of Providence can any rational Deputy of the Fianna Fáil or Labour Party stand for the proposition that any person receiving the primary written <Col N="1609" /> authority here provided for shall thereafter be invested with the rights set out in the sections to which I have just referred?  It is no use saying, as people so often say, that in theory these things can be done but they will not be done.  If they will not be done, this House should not give power to anybody to do them.  We have no right to proceed on the presumption that the exercise of these authorities and powers will be prudent, moderate and sensible.  We have no right to deliver the people for whom we stand as trustees into the power of any reckless man who would, were he given powers such as these, trespass on his neighbour's liberties.  It is perfectly manifest from the terms of Section 85 that the Minister himself does not know who is to be the enforcement officer. What is sinister and evil is that he can consent to the proposition that a competent enforcement officer might be, could be, a displaced warble fly inspector.  It is humiliating to think that this Dáil should be a Party to any such enactment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. O'Higgins wants to know who will be the enforcement officer.  The health authority will look after that matter, in appointing whoever is responsible.  The district medical officer in the first instance will be responsible.  When this scheme is working properly, he will have a nurse and assistants of that type with him. If this section is to be enforced, the person who goes to court to assist in the prosecution will be, I presume, some person who will have some knowledge of the Bill.  I do not think that it should be assumed that there will be any more objection to appearing in court in connection with this section than in connection with any of the other Acts.  Medical officers have to appear at the moment in connection with other prosecutions such as those connected with the Milk Acts.  I do not think it is worth while following the fantastic arguments of Deputy Dillon because the whole basis of his argument is wrong.  The section he quoted deals with premises.  There is no use in talking about an ex-warble fly inspector bringing a case to court.  That just goes to show that Deputy Dillon cannot <Col N="1610" /> make a case against the section except by this fantastic propaganda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not interrupt in the middle of a sentence but keep his interruption to the end?  As I was saying it is certainly a commonsense approach to the Bill to inquire what is the human machinery that will be used for court purposes. The Minister says, presumably the nurse or the district medical officer. He goes further and says that the district medical officer or any doctor should have no greater objection to going into court in that type of case than in any other type of case.  The Minister apparently missed completely the point I was endeavouring to make. That may be due to my inability to express myself clearly or it may not, but the illustration I gave the Minister was that of a medical officer who was doing a number of schools or one very big school.  There is a very large number of children absent.  He cannot or should not discriminate as to the parent he will prosecute and the parent he will miss.  If he is doing his duty conscientiously he will prosecute the whole lot or prosecute none at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We shall say that there are 40 prosecuted in a particular area.  A number may employ a solicitor or counsel to represent them.  To deal with these 40 prosecutions, we have the district court where a man sits for a day here, a day there and another day 12 or 15 <Col N="1611" /> miles away.  He will not take any more than three or four of these cases on any court day.  He will not take any more than two, if they are adequately and competently defended.  To deal with that one group of absentees from one school, you will have that man going from court to court for six months.  People may say that that is an exaggeration but I had an experience twice of going to court on comparatively trivial matters in connection with public health.  The case was adjourned from one court to another and from one area to another.  There were witnesses from one side or the other absent on some of these occasions.  Other witnesses were called for and the merry-go-round went on for weeks.  Then we found ourselves in the High Court in Dublin, engrossed in conferences with junior and senior counsel and all the rest of it until very late hours at night.  That was all over a trivial minor thing.  Either we are employed to carry out our professional duties or we are not.  There is a waste of public funds if we are paid to do a specialised type of professional work and we are going to become a kind of county prosecutor.  I cannot see any other machinery for the prosecution. I cannot see, no matter who else you may have as a prosecuting officer or as a legal officer, anybody but the examining medical officer who can give the type of evidence that would be required in a court of law in order to prove that the person in question was absent from the school medical examination on a particular day.  The school teacher does not keep this kind of record.  The person that is responsible for keeping the records of those present and those not present is the school medical examiner.  I can see immense difficulty in operating that particular section.  I can see serious waste of professional time and I cannot see that on the other side there is any commensurate gain.  I said before that the scheme is going on well.  It may not be going excellently but it is going on well and all this coercion is not going to make it go any better but will create antagonisms and loss of time.  It will not improve matters</P>

For instance, where the Deputy talks about breaking into premises, the question of breaking in does not arise unless something is done on or in connection with the premises in connection with which there is a contravention of the Act.

      <P>Wait a moment.  I will try to find out what the truth is.  The enforcement chapter of this Bill lays down the machinery to be employed by the various authorities concerned for the enforcement of the provisions of the Bill.  Section 85 sets out the several types of persons who may be appointed an authorised person for the purpose of enforcement of the provisions of the Bill.  Section 86 limits him to the area for which he is appointed.  Section 87 entitles that authorised person to go to a parent&mdash; does not it&mdash;who he believes has failed to comply with the requirements of the Act.  Is not that true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And to ask the person his name and address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>You have that already, of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the parent fails or refuses to state his name and address in compliance with that authorised person's demand, states a name or address or produces corroborative evidence which the authorised person has reasonable grounds for believing to be false or misleading, the authorised person may detain the parent and bring him to the nearest Garda station.  Is that true or is it false?  Is not that there?  The authorised person may detain the parent in the Garda station for 24 hours.  The authorised person may use force, if necessary, to bring the parent to the station and to keep <Col N="1613" /> him there and the parent who refuses to give his name or address or gives, in purported compliance with the requirements of this section, an address or corroborative evidence which is false or misleading, or resists being detained, commits a criminal offence.  Is not that also in it?</P>
      <P>Now we come to Section 88, under which an authorised person may enter premises for the purpose of ascertaining whether there is or has been on or in connection with the premises any contravention of any provision of this Act, the extent and nature of any such contravention, or whether circumstances exist on or in connection with the premises which would require any action to be taken under this Act or the regulations made thereunder.  An authorised officer shall not enter any premises under this section unless he produces for inspection by the person in occupation or in charge of the permises his appointment in writing as an authorised officer.  He may not enter except between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m.  The section applies to a tent, van, shed, hut, vessel or aircraft in like manner as it applies to premises.  He may seek under Section 89 assistance from the Guards.  The Guards are required to collaborate with him and he may enter by force.</P>
      <P>Suppose he has reasonable grounds for believing that a parent, on being called upon to produce her children to give corroborative evidence of some kind or another, has concealed some material fact in the house, has not an enforcement officer, under Sections 88, 89 and 90, power to break into her house if he believes it necessary to do that in order to get the information he requires?  Has not he?  What is the point of denying to the House what is in the Bill when Deputies, if they care to read it, can read it for themselves?</P>
      <P>The meaning of Section 91 is not easy to determine, but surely it is without precedent to say that if a person produces a permit, licence or exemption under this Act, its production is insufficient and that the onus is on him to prove that it is a valid and genuine document?  That is just put in for good weight.  I have never seen the like of that section in any other Act passed in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1614" /> What I am directing the attention of the House to is that every word I have said to describe what an authorised person may do for the enforcement of the provisions set out in Sections 18, 19, 20 and 21, is strictly true and it is not at all outside the bounds of possibility that, on the county medical officer of health or the dispensary doctor pointing out that it will be physically impossible for him to examine the children and to attend at the district court in order to prosecute defaulters, the county manager will appoint persons of the general standard of warble fly inspectors and attach them as sort of clerks to the examining doctors and constitute them authorised persons for the purpose of the Act and to do the kind of police work that Deputy Dr. O'Higgins has referred to and which he rightly suggests doctors in rural Ireland would bitterly resent being called upon to do.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister now to deny that, if the county manager did deem it desirable to appoint a person like an ex-warble fly inspector as a sort of pseudo-clerk, just for the purpose of sparing the doctor the chores outlined by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins in the event of a prosecution, he would have all the powers I have described in Part IX of this Bill.  Maybe the Minister did not mean that but that is certainly what the Bill says and, if this Dáil enacts that, this Dáil is daft.</P>

      <P>To get us all out of the difficulty in which we are at the moment we will discuss amendment No. 14 as if we had not heard of it before and as if it was before us now as a section.  The position now is <Col N="1616" /> that we are back where we were at the beginning of last year when dealing with Public Health Bill, 1945, and that we are really back into the spirit in which we were forced to discuss that Bill.  The Minister tells us now that there is going to be compulsory inspection of children from the age of one plus to 16 years of age, that a State medical service will be set up for the purpose and that if people resist sending their children to the doctors on the State medical service for this twice a year examination they must provide a medical certificate from some other doctor for each child concerned&mdash;probably every six months, the Minister says&mdash;to the effect that the child has been examined by some other doctor. This is not a proposal put forward in the interests of public health.  This is a proposal put forward in the interests of the personal health of the individual. In the uncompromising spirit in which the Minister puts it before us now this is a dictatorial, totalitarian approach to the individual which is utterly contrary not only to the spirit but to the letter of the Constitution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a proposal to invade for personal health purposes the privacy of the life or of the person above 16 years of age but there is a proposal to make parents responsible for subjecting their children either to the examination of State medical officers or to the examination of some private medical officer whom they will select, twice a year.  It is an outlandish and a fantastic position.  I sympathise to some extent with the Minister for the position into which he has slipped from the brutal foundations of the Public Health Act of 1945.  I think the Minister should stand back from that situation and face the situation which is now disclosed. He has indicated that he has already set up an Advisory Council of Health. He has indicated for what purpose such a council has been set up.  I can quite imagine that it is intended to advise the Minister on various matters in relation to public health but I also think it is quite conceivable that he intends it to advise him with regard to <Col N="1617" /> matters referring to personal health generally.  I would like to ask the Minister if he has in any way consulted the members of the medical profession whom he has already asked to act on that body with regard to the provisions of this amendment or of this section. I feel that if he has not it would be an economy of Parliamentary time in the first instance and it would be an economy of something more.  It would be an economy of that which enables us to have clear understanding and harmonious discussion here among ourselves. There would be that economy if the Minister would report progress on this Bill until he has had some discussion with the Advisory Medical Council he speaks about.  Early to-day he indicated on my amendment No. 15 that he did not think the medical profession generally would give a certificate of the kind which I suggested might be given, that is, a certificate from a doctor in respect of a child to the effect that the child was under his general care and supervision. The Minister may be expressing that as an opinion of his own or he may have been in consultation with the advisory council on the matter but I plead with him to step back a little from the atmosphere that has been created by the things that have been elucidated in the discussion here to-day and face what he thinks could be done for the personal health of the individuals in the community through the basis of the medical inspection and treatment of children.  But to proceed in the spirit in which the Minister has suggested he is proceeding is to bring us into a very disastrous position from the point of view of this very excellent service and of the very necessary work that requires to be done in an educational, advisory and service way for the public health of individuals in their earlier years.</P>

      <P>That is what staggers me.  The Minister for Health rose here in this House and said that it was under that provision in Section 42 that he proposes to reconcile this Bill with the provisions of the Constitution.  Is that not so?  The Deputy knows that the Minister made that case on the floor of the House to-day.  Well may the Deputy raise his eyebrows.  It is daft; it is crazy.  I do not believe that the Minister himself believes in it.  It <Col N="1619" /> is the child of the power-crazed bureaucrat.  Who can conceivably imagine that this Dáil would declare that the county manager of the county in which we live has the right to take from us the discretion as to when and how the health of our own children should be protected?</P>
      <P>There is no suggestion in connection with this section that the child is suffering from an infectious disease and that it is, therefore, necessary for the protection of his neighbours to impose certain requirements upon him. That is all attended to in another part of the Bill.  This section is designed not for the protection of the child's neighbours but for the child himself, so that the man and woman who brought the child into the world are now to be set aside in favour of the county manager.</P>

      <P>No.  I want the Deputy to face the facts.  Chapter IV of this Bill is devoted to infectious diseases. It deals with the dangers that arise from a person who is a victim of an infectious disease and will not submit voluntarily to the rational precautions necessary to ensure that he will not communicate the disease to his neighbour.  That is another question which we can discuss on its merits when we reach it, but that has got nothing to do with Part III, which deals with the mother and child service. Its purpose is to provide free of all charge ante-natal and post-natal care for the mother, and medical attention for the child of every parent in this country up to the age of 16.  Now, it is one thing to make certain amenities freely available and to say to the community at large, that anyone, rich or poor, wise or foolish, can avail of these services if they want them free of all cost and free from all charges.  That is not what we are asked to do.  We are asked to provide the service and then we are asked to authorise the county manager&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Originally, it might have appeared to many of us that these sections were designed to enable a county manager of a public health authority to deal with tinkers and vagrants and people like that, who through ignorance or eccentricity could not be expected to understand the value of the public health service; but when we came to the penalty sections which provided for a penalty of £5, Deputy de Valera intervened and said that he wanted the penalties raised.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the section itself now and I am entitled to make this case.  I asked him: &ldquo;Do you mean that the county manager would be entitled to go to a person of the intellectual equipment and experience of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and order him to submit his children and, if the Minister for Industry and Commerce replied: &lsquo;I have heard ample medical opinion on the desirability of having these children medically examined and, having weighed all the opinion carefully in my mind, with the special knowledge I <Col N="1621" /> have of my own child, I have decided to reject the advice of having the child examined at the present time and postpone it; the child is a bit nervous at the present time and I think better to postpone it&rsquo;; under this Bill the Minister for Industry and Commerce commits an offence and can be prosecuted, fined and, if he does not pay the fine, put in jail?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not suggesting that he should have some advantage over the tinker, the tailor, the soldier or the sailor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I am suggesting that it is fantastic to go to a parent who is well able himself to weigh up intelligently, rationally and competently medical opinion and, when in the light of that opinion he has taken his decision as a responsible parent, to authorise the county manager to overrule him and to go into his house and have the child examined in spite of him.</P>
      <P>Suppose Deputies do believe that that is desirable&mdash;and I cannot conceive any Christian man or woman believing such a thing&mdash;suppose in aberration they do believe so, I ask them to look at the Constitution:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The State recognises the family as the natural, primary and fundamental unit group of society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What are the rights referred to in that section?  If that section means anything, it must refer to some rights. What are they?  Surely the first right of the parents is to raise their own children&mdash;to feed them, to clothe them and to protect their health.  Is it or is it not?  If it is, how are you going to reconcile these provisions in this Bill with paragraph (1) of Article 41 of the Constitution?</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister for Health that question and he charged those of us who dwelt upon those Articles with seeking to mislead the House by a <i>suppression veri</i> and he said we had forborne from reading on down to paragraph (5) of Article 42, which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1622" />&ldquo;In exceptional cases, where the parents for physical or moral reasons fail in their duty towards their children, the State, as guardian of the common good, by appropriate means shall endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard for the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does Deputy Butler contend that if, in the circumstances outlined by me, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in the exercise of his own informed discretion, decided that it was in the best interests of his own child not to submit him to the medical examination prescribed by the city manager, he would thereby be a person who failed in his duty towards his child and for that reason should be excepted from the general rules governing the relations that exist between the State and the family in Ireland?</P>
    <P>I am not in the least apprehensive of the consequences on us as individuals of the passing of this section, because it will not survive an hour's inspection by the Supreme Court.  It will be declared unconstitutional.  The only effect of leaving this section in the Bill in its present form is that the whole Bill will be condemned.  What I am solicitous about is this&mdash;that I hate to see this Dáil acquire the reputation, in one statute after another, of breaking the Constitution in its letter and in its spirit.  I dislike, and I know it is bad, to have this Oireachtas rebuked in stern, incisive and commanding language by the judiciary for having sought to take from the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If Bunreacht na hÉireann was not in existence, tattered document though it is and fraudulent as most of its provisions are, I would be more deeply concerned about the intentions of the Minister under this Bill, but, wretched and fraudulent as it was the day it was drafted and as it is to-day, flatulent and deceptive as most of its provisions are, such as it is, I believe it is adequate to prevent the outrage contemplated in this section.  For that reason, it is not necessary to exhaust the resources of this House for the purpose of holding up the passage into law of this detestable proposal, but if this fraudulent derelict were not available, we might have longer and more tedious work to do.  They say that if you keep any rubbish for 100 years it turns out useful.  Fortunately, we have been constrained to keep this bit of rubbish, and, with the help of God, we will turn it to use in due time.</P>

      <P>In spite of the style of speeches to which we have listened from the Opposition, I should like to make an appeal for consideration of this section and of the Bill in a calm and reasonable way.  I thought, as I said before, Deputies opposite would try to consider a Bill like this, dropping <Col N="1624" /> this political propaganda, at least while dealing with this Bill.  This is an amendment which I brought in as a result of an appeal made by Deputy O'Higgins on Second Reading and I am called dictatorial, outlandish and fantastic.  These are the expressions used by Deputy Mulcahy.  I suppose I have learned a lesson.  I was deceived by the speeches on Second Reading and thought that the Party opposite intended to deal with this Bill in a reasonable way.  I tried to meet them as well as I could, but I see now that, in expecting that attitude, I was only wasting my time.  Deputy Mulcahy says we are back to the old atmosphere.  I am very sorry to hear that, but we have to go on as best we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How is this section going to work? What is the meaning of the section? It was amended, as I have said, so that it now can be applied to a particular county or county borough and, in fact, if it is not necessary, it need not be applied at all.  I do not believe it will be necessary, but I may be wrong. There is one thing, however&mdash;I have no intention of applying it for some time because there is no organisation in existence to undertake the working of a section of this kind.  Another point is that if it is applied and if it is found after some time that there is no longer a necessity for it, it can be withdrawn and we can go back again to the voluntary method.  How will it work?  If it is applied, I need not tell Deputies&mdash;I suppose they have sense enough to know, although they may feel it would suit them better to say otherwise&mdash;we are not going to send warble-fly inspectors and policemen to knock down people's doors.  What will happen, as every sensible Deputy knows well, is that the district medical officer will carry out his school inspection. He will have with him a nurse under the new organisation and he will find on inspection certain children are missing.  He will tell the nurse to call on these children and to find out if there was any reason for their absence, and if they would agree to come for examination on another day, or if for any reason the children are not able to leave their own homes, to arrange for the doctor to call to see them.  It <Col N="1625" /> will be possible for the district medical officer to call on certain of these people as, the district being so small, he will be passing their houses.  It is only where the nurse meets with persistent refusal that she will report refusal and then the question of prosecution will be considered.</P>
    <P>There is no use in Deputies saying that the system is satisfactory as it is. It is not satisfactory and it could not be satisfactory because the machinery was not there.  As a matter of fact, in most counties at the moment, a school is not examined more than once in every two or three years, and if certain children are absent on the occassion of that examination, they may go through their whole school career without being examined at all. There will be more frequent examinations as time goes on, as soon as we get our organisation built up, but there is no use in putting forward the argument that things are satisfactory, because they are not.  The most extravagant statements have been made about this section and Deputy Dillon threatened to become inarticulate if certain Deputies voted for it.  If Deputy Dillon ever becomes inarticulate, I shall have to re-examine the position, because I would have to admit that I had done something terrible, if that were to occur.</P>

      <P>Take out what Deputy Dillon wants out and everything will be all right.  I do not agree with Deputy Dillon and he does not agree with me, but I do not see why we cannot argue the case on its merits, without painting these terrible pictures of what will happen. Deputy Dillon knows that, when he leaves this House to-night, he may meet a child in the street outside with a deformed spine.  That may happen in ten years' time.  Deputy Dillon's rhetoric will not cure that child&mdash;this clause may.  It may at least prevent it &mdash;I do not say it will&mdash;because, as everybody knows, there are careless parents who will not submit their children unless they are told they have to do so.  It may be sufficient to tell them that they must do so under the law, and I believe it will be sufficient in practically every case, but there are these careless parents who have no thought for, and perhaps no belief in, these medical inspections, and, because they do not bring their children for inspection, a latent deformity is not discovered in time.  They may perhaps become blind or lose their teeth, if defects are not discovered in time.  All these things may happen because they do not submit their children for medical inspection. If through this section we save the health of some of these children, we will have done something if we succeed in doing that.</P>
      <P>Let us drop this talk about battering at doors and that sort of thing, because I think it will be quite obvious to anybody when we come to one of these later sections that that question of breaking in refers to an offence committed on a premises; that means an offence, say, under the food regulations or one of those offences which relate to premises.  But when we are talking about school medical inspection and infectious diseases, we are not talking of premises but of persons.  This question of breaking in does not refer to an offence by a person but to an offence on a premises.  If that is not clear, we can make it clear when the time comes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in trying to defeat a section like this by holding out the most terrifying pictures of policemen battering down doors and taking a <Col N="1627" /> person off to the police barrack for 24 hours to investigate and to get names and addresses, etc., because these things, as every Deputy knows, will not occur.  Every Deputy knows that what will happen if this section has to be enforced is that the nurse will call on the people and reason with them first.  She will know their names and addresses.  There will not be any difficulty about that, because the nurses will know their district.  It will be part of their job to know the district well and everybody in the district.  The nurse will call on the parents whose children have not appeared for inspection and she will get their names.  If her entreaties prove to be a failure, then she will report the case.  In such a case the health authority may, if they so think fit, issue a summons and have the case tried in the District Court.</P>
    <P>Let us at least have the argument kept on a fair level.  I can understand Deputies objecting to it even if nothing worse is to happen.  But let us argue the case on that without exaggeration.  Let us make up our minds as to what we intend to do about the section.  I believe the section will be useful.  Some Deputies may think that we would get on better without it.  The only way to decide it is to let the Dáil decide it.</P>

      <P>Might I make a correction in regard to myself?  I do not mind being told I am in the wrong, when I am in the wrong, but I object to being put in the wrong by a repetition of inaccuracies.  For the third time since we came to this particular section the Minister said that that was what I asked for on the Second Reading. If the Minister will look up the reference, he will find that what I urged was, if it was necessary to have compulsory powers at all, that they should be adoptive.</P>

They will apply where the order from on top directs. There is no question of their being <Col N="1628" /> adoptive or asked for down below. What is here is exactly what I did not ask for.

      <P>My understanding of what is meant by an adoptive Act may be a misunderstanding.  But what I had in my mind was that an adoptive Act was an Act that could be used on the request of the local authority or the local council, but not otherwise.  This section empowers the Department to make an Order applicable to any part or parts of the country whether the people in the area ask for that Order to be made or not.  That is a very different thing; in fact it is the very opposite to what I urged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>If you have the proper machine, if you have properly qualified men conscientiously carrying out their work, the best judges as to what is required in any area are the people working in that area; not the people working one hundred miles away.  If these powers are wanted in any particular area and are asked for, then I am agreeable that the machinery should be available to the Minister and to those local authorities to give all the powers that are there, but only when they are asked for locally.  I have longer experience of the Department of which the Minister is now the head than the Minister has.  I know very well that powers will be forced on us and that we will be forced to use instruments that we find highly objectionable, if it is not adoptive, that is asked for down below.  If the Minister did seriously intend to meet my objections by this particular section, I apologise for not having made my mind sufficiently <Col N="1629" /> clear, because I think we are approaching some common ground.  The Report Stage has still to come and, with that laboured effort at clarification, I leave it to the Minister for his consideration between this and the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I should like to say to the Deputy that I certainly have no desire to misrepresent what he said.  What I said was that it was as a result of the appeal of the Deputy on the Second Reading that I brought in this amendment. I do not want to argue the matter again at this stage.  I think the Deputy agrees that compulsion might be tolerated under certain circumstances anyway.  I am afraid it might happen, at least in some cases, that the county that would need this most would be the county very much against it, because the work might not be done in that county as well as in many other counties.  That is a point to be kept in mind.</P>

      <P>If it is urgently or specially required in an area, surely the county manager or the county medical officer of health would be as conscious of the urgency of the requirement as anybody in Dublin.  If the request comes from them, then put the machinery in motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a woeful thing if we all got into one another's wool as a result of a misunderstanding. I know no valid argument to advance against power to confer compulsory powers in the event of an epidemic or an emergency.  Everyone admits that the public weal may, in certain circumstances, overrule certain individual rights and I think there is a good deal to be said for the argument that, if there was an outbreak of smallpox, typhoid or diphtheria in a particular area, the county medical officer of health should have, for the time being, until the epidemic was effectively disposed of, very wide powers indeed for the express purpose <Col N="1630" /> of stamping out the epidemic or, indeed, any endemic condition such as had to be grappled with in certain parts of Connemara.</P>
      <P>But that is quite a different cup of tea from giving the power as an ordinary part of the mother and child scheme.  The Minister has said that he feels that a good deal of the nonobservance may have been due in the past to inadequate equipment&mdash;the personnel was not there, the machinery was not there&mdash;and that he would not contemplate putting these compulsory powers into operation until he had given the fully-equipped machine and the new personnel that he has in mind an opportunity of proving itself.  What in the name of heaven is the point of having a stand-up row across the floor of the House about powers which the Minister says he thinks it is quite likely he will never have to use and which he would prefer not to use?</P>
      <P>If he comes here and says: &ldquo;I want authority to equip the service properly, to provide the personnel to get this job of mother and child attention properly attended to, and I warn the House that if this step fails I will come back and we will argue the toss about compulsory powers&rdquo;, so far as I am concerned and so far as I can hear from other sides of the House, I believe we will all endorse his proposal and provide him with every facility he wants.  I am more than willing, I am extremely anxious, to postpone or eschew altogether this fundamental argument about compulsory powers.  This is the kind of thing in regard to which it would be much better that we should have no difference at all.  Let philosophers argue it out; it would be an-interesting discourse in academic circles, but we here with a practical job to do should avoid it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may never use these powers and, therefore, what is the purpose of having exchanges across the House in order to acquire powers that the Minister does not believe he will be ever called upon to use? Let him drop the compulsion.  If he notifies us that he wants every scintilla of Part III of the Bill, I will undertake to give every conceivable help I can down the country, <Col N="1631" /> to encourage my neighbours to co-operate with the local authority.  I will do anything I can to persuade people to exhort the country people or anybody who can help to make this thing succeed.  I will most gladly do that and I venture to say every other Deputy will do the same.  Why, then, does the Minister think it expedient to start a stand-up row about our rights under Article 41 of the Constitution?</P>
    <P>This Bill can go through with cordiality on every side of the House, albeit we are notified that, if it does not work on a voluntary basis, the Minister intends to come back with an amending Bill to inject compulsory powers. We will fight that battle another day. But is not that an unreasonable position to take up?  Is not that provoking unnecessary controversy?  Is not that obstructing legislation in a spirit of mischief?  I do not give a fiddledee-dee what any member of the Fianna Fáil Party says about me.  The more abuse they hurl at me, the more votes I will get.</P>
    <P>But, from the point of view of public health, I believe the Minister is anxious to do a useful job and I will help him in every way I can.  I assure him that if he will reconsider the decision to insist on the incorporation of that portion of his proposal at this stage, he will be amazed at the difference of the atmosphere in which he will have to do his work, and I imagine that he will come to see that it would be much better to try it out on a voluntary basis first and that the necessity for the compulsory part of it will never arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen such an extraordinary advantage resulting from medical examination in the schools, that I was quite overjoyed when I read this Bill.  I have an experience going back practically 40 years, and for a great part of that time we had no school medical inspection, and I am perfectly certain that many lives were lost simply because we had not a school medical inspection.  When the medical inspection was first carried out in my district I saw cases of heart disease diagnosed&mdash;it was spotted in a few moments by the visiting doctor.  Sometimes <Col N="1632" /> there are children who, to all appearances, are perfectly strong and healthy, but I have seen defects in their eyesight spotted straight away and rectified.  I have seen stupid children transformed into quite bright and clever children by a little nose or throat operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen children who were declared to be suffering from lung trouble or who would be liable to lung trouble and one would never suspect they had any trouble or any tendency to trouble in that direction.  I always felt that if we could have a yearly examination or an examination every six months of every child in the schools, the results would be almost miraculous&mdash;they would be something wonderful.  We have not the organisation there; we have not the necessary personnel to carry out these things. When I saw this Bill I was convinced that it travelled a very great distance in the right direction but even with a sufficient personnel, without some element of compulsion we shall never derive full advantage from medical inspection of the family.  Very many children object to being examined.  Some parents object to having their children examined.  For instance boys, I find, are very shy of being stripped and examined by a lady doctor, and I presume that in the case of girls they would simply hate to have to submit to examination by a man.  Sometimes, too, through pride, parents will not have their children examined.  Possibly their underclothing may not be very good and the parents have a certain pride or objection to having their children stripped and examined.  Sometimes a parent might know that a child possibly was verminous.  The parent might be trying to remedy that but, fearing that the child might bear the mark of vermin, the parent would keep the child at home on the day of inspection. These children then slip through the net, as it were.  I do not think we shall ever get anywhere unless we have compulsory powers.  I think it is drawing a very long bow to say that these powers would be used in the way Deputy Dillon seems to fear they may be used.</P>

      <P>Except I misunderstood the Deputy, he said that he could understand compulsion applied in cases like that, in case of people who had not a proper appreciation, and who could not be expected to have a proper appreciation, of hygiene and health matters. Then as against that he seemed to be of the opinion that it was altogether unthinkable that the children of the Minister for Justice or any Minister should be subject to inspection, because he might reasonably be presumed to have knowledge of hygiene and health matters and to know as well as the city manager what should be done.  You can have pride in any walk of life or any grade of society; you can have dangerous pride but there should be no discrimination for one class as against another.  It is necessary to have compulsory powers if <Col N="1634" /> we are going to reap a full and proper advantage from this measure.  I believe that and I cannot see that it is antagonistic to the Constitution.  If I were persuaded that it was, I would say so honestly.  The Constitution points out the respect for and indicates the rights of the family.  I believe that this Bill makes for the protection of the family and the protection of the community.

      <P>Deputy Butler has approached this question in such a reasonable and persuasive way that one would like to follow his arguments and support him.  I feel, however, while there is much in what he said with which I entirely agree, that I cannot accept his conclusions.  Deputy Butler said that without compulsion we shall never get a satisfactory service.  I am prepared to agree that in this world, where there is nothing perfect, we shall never get a completely satisfactory service but I believe that without compulsion we shall get a more satisfactory service than with it.  I believe that this Bill was introduced in a kindly spirit, was well received and that there was an attempt on the part of all Parties concerned to give it a good send-off.  I think that that spirit should be followed up right to the end but I suggest that we will get the maximum advantage from this legislation if we leave compulsion aside for the present and develop all the aspects of this Bill which are capable of development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health admitted that the existing service is not satisfactory, that there is not sufficient organisation and machinery available at the moment and that it is his intention right now under this Bill to provide a more satisfactory service, to provide a better organisation and to ensure that the school inspection service will be more efficient in future. By setting out along these lines I believe we can step up the system very considerably but we might do considerable harm if we were to accompany these improvements in the existing <Col N="1635" /> machinery with the threat, the ugly threat, that people who do not avail voluntarily of these services will be penalised.  Apart from the increases in staff provided for medical inspection and all the other improvements that are contemplated, we must remember that during the past couple of years there has been a tremendous advance in medical science so far as dealing with disinfestation is concerned.  This tremendous advance will have a very important and fundamental bearing on the value and success of school medical inspection.</P>
    <P>When parents who do not submit their children for inspection see the advantages derived by other children, they will be more inclined to avail of the service.  The improvement contemplated should be given a free trial without the threat of compulsion.  The threat of compulsion is bad.  It is all right for Deputy Butler to say that there are cranks, and dangerous cranks, everywhere.  There are, of course, among parents and among officials, and there is the possibility that some perhaps foolish official will start talking about compulsory powers when he is trying to induce a parent to submit a child for medical inspection. Suppose the doctor, or the nurse, as is more likely, goes to a parent who has failed to present her children for inspection and says, &ldquo;If you fail to submit your child, you will find yourself in the District Court&rdquo;, that threat would tend to get people up against the medical service and make it unpopular. The whole success of this service depends upon its popularity. It can be made not only efficient but attractive, and that is what we should seek to make it.  There may be some counties and districts which have not advanced as much as others but with all the advantages provided in this Bill the service will be improved and expanded, and it is better to leave out compulsion for the moment.</P>
    <P>I was one of the few Deputies who on Second Reading forecast that there would be difficulty in regard to the compulsory sections.  My forecast has been borne out.  The Minister would like to have the wholehearted support for all sections of the Bill of all the <Col N="1636" /> members of the House and, therefore, he should be willing to make some little sacrifice in order to get it.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (4) of the new Section 21, states: &ldquo;whenever a medical inspection is arranged under this Act for a child, whether at his home or at any other place....&rdquo; I would suggest that that should read: &ldquo;...whether at his home or any other suitable place, suitably equipped for the purpose.&rdquo; I am aware that there are schools in Dublin where it would not be suitable to unclothe a child.  I have in mind schools where there is no hot water, where there are stone floors.  It would be most unsuitable, for instance, that children should have to stand barefooted on stone floors.  Examination might take a long time if a number of children are being examined together.  Is it not only right and proper that there should be a suitable room for that purpose to which there would be a supply of hot water, so that instruments could be sterilised and the doctors and nurses could wash their hands?</P>
      <P>The case I am putting forward is not my own.  A few years ago I was in one of these schools where there was a stone floor, where windows were broken, where there was no water except in the yard.  Sub-section (4) does not prescribe a &ldquo;suitable place, suitably equipped&rdquo;, and I hope the Minister will provide that it must be a suitable place suitably equipped.  Where a doctor has to examine, say, six children in half an hour, hot water should be provided for the sterilisation of instruments and for the washing of hands.  That case was put to me by a parish manager some three years ago. He complained about the condition of this small school, which was totally inadequate and unfit for the purpose. That school still exists in the City of Dublin, in the condition I have described. It was not built for the purpose of a school, and I would not like that any of my children should be undressed in that stone, cold passage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also suggest that when a doctor finds a backward child or a child who is slightly mentally defective, who is not suitable for admission to any of <Col N="1637" /> the homes in the City of Dublin, the doctor should be in a position to recommend&mdash;&mdash;</P>

However, I will leave it at that and conclude by saying that I am perfectly satisfied that there is not enough being done for the backward or slightly mentally defective child in the City of Dublin.  I rose for the purpose of asking the Minister to assure the House that the words &ldquo;suitable place, suitably equipped&rdquo; will be inserted.  When the Minister says in the sub-section &ldquo;or at any other place&rdquo; what type of place does he mean?  If it is not a suitable place for the undressing and examination of children, and if the parents protest on that ground, then the penal sections should not be operated.  Perhaps the Minister would reply to the point I have made about the suitability of places for examination.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>()  Regulations made under this section shall provide for&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  freedom of judgment and action for the medical practitioner carrying out the work, and <Col N="1639" /> (b)  the maintenance of professional secrecy.</P>
    <P>This particular amendment was put down by Deputy Mulcahy as a result of a very considerable volume of correspondence from individual practitioners in different parts of the country: The section states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may make regulations applicable to every health authority, every health authority of a particular class or a particular health authority as to the manner in which and the extent to which they are to exercise their powers under this Part of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly the set-up of that section is giving very, very elastic powers, and rather indefinite and vague powers, as to these regulations that will or may be made by the Minister with regard to the carrying out of the functions and duties.  A number of members of the profession are rather uneasy and fear that through regulations a medical man may be instructed as to how to carry out, or in what particular manner he will carry out, his medical functions. Such a state of affairs would be inconceivable.  There would be no such thing as a professional conscience if anybody higher up presumed to instruct or direct a practitioner in the performance of his duty.  Personally, I do not think that that is the intention in the section, but the amendment is put down because a considerable number of doctors throughout the country are uneasy about this matter.</P>
    <P>Further, the question of the confidential nature of medical documents arises.  This health service is, of course, a development of the managerial system.  The medical examiners will be working under a scheme drafted or designed by the health authority in that area, namely, the manager.  The medical person responsible for the health of the mother, the infant, the child and the youth will have to have, if his records are going to be of any value, very confidential information. He must have information not only as to the health of the individual but as to the health of the family&mdash;the diseases, ailments and disabilities from which near relatives suffered.  It has always <Col N="1640" /> been recognised that all that kind of information which passes between a patient and a doctor or between the parents of a patient and a doctor is absolutely secret and confidential which would not be seen by any other eye except another medical eye and then only when there was certain necessity for another medical mind to view those documents.  The whole maternity and child welfare scheme would break down utterly and completely if there were any suspicion in the minds of the women that any little weakness which they considered a taint that might be in their family, and which it is important the doctor should be aware of was, within this service, going to be made known to a manager and a managerial staff.  Whatever may be said of the professional fears that directed the first part of this amendment a very full and frank statement would require to be made by the Minister with regard to the absolute confidence that will safeguard documents containing any information passed from a patient to the doctor or on behalf of the patient to a doctor.  These things cannot be unduly stressed at the present moment because, where medical officers were individuals in the past, they are now becoming part of a great State machine.  The chain of command is there from the Custom House right down along to the dispensary district. As a result the people may think, even doctors may think, that the manager has a right to call for one of these registers, for one of these folders or for all of the folders: they may think that a representative of the manager, as other than a medical man, has a right to come along and examine those records, those school cards, those cases.</P>
    <P>The whole foundation of medicine in this country will be undermined and blown up if there is any uneasiness anywhere with regard to the degree of secrecy maintained in relation to any information passing between the patient and the doctor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>While this is an amendment that we might agree with in principle, the Deputy, I think, will see the difficulty there would be in putting it into the Bill.  There will, of course, be <Col N="1641" /> freedom of judgment and action where there is room for freedom.  The first thing a doctor will have to do under this is to examine the school children. That will be done under a fairly routine system.  I have never done it myself, but the doctor has to certify that the child is free from all the various things that may be wrong. There is freedom of judgment there. As regards treatment under this Part of the Bill, where there is room for a choice of treatment the doctor will be free.  It might happen, on the other hand, that the Department would prescribe a certain type of vaccine for prevention. I do not think it would be wise to allow freedom in that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Department would not prescribe it.  It might suggest it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just saying that it might happen that the Department might suggest it.  I am not sure that it would be necessary to order it.  The Deputy must remember that at present we are dealing with something like 34 or 35 county medical officers who are better qualified for this work than the ordinary medical man.  Under the new system we may be dealing with 900 or 1,000 medical men, some of whom may not be very up to date in their methods.  I think it will be agreed that it may be necessary to point out that certain diagnostic tests or certain methods of immunisation must be used if we want to immunise against infectious diseases.  It would be impossible to do that in the case of pneumonia.  That would be a matter for the medical practitioner himself, but there would be cases where certain directions would be given.  I think they would be very few.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Deputy will agree that no Minister for Health could possibly prescribe a certain vaccine for diagnostic purposes or for immunisation purposes unless it was freely recognised by the greater part of the world as being the best.  That is as far as freedom goes. I have given a lot of thought to the question of secrecy.  I have discussed it with a number of my officials.  I think they have succeeded, in the diagrams which they have shown me, in meeting that position.  The doctor who <Col N="1642" /> examines the children will put their names on the margin of a sheet.  He puts the numbers and all the particulars on an extension of the sheet.  When he has finished his work, the sheet tears down and the names are put into a locker.  It is only the particulars and the reports that are sent up by him.  Nobody knows who the children are except the doctor himself and he has the key of the locker.  These particulars will be necessary for the Public Health Department in the building up of statistics.  We can hardly hope to get rid of some of those very intractable diseases like diphtheria, measles, enteric fever, typhus, unless we have all the statistics and know where the diseases are likely to be found.  As far as our statistical department goes, it is only the particulars and the numbers that come up to it, so that nobody there can identify any particular person. I am sure that secrecy can be maintained as far as this mother and child welfare service is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, provided the scheme works in a manner suggested by the Minister.  Under the section, however, there is nothing to prevent the manager asking the doctor to supply him with the names of particular patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That did not occur to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine, however, that that would not happen except in very rare cases.  Suppose a dispute arose between the parent of a child and the county health authority and that proceedings ensued, the manager, in that case, might ask the medical officer for particulars of the case and might wish to identify the person not merely by a number but by name.  I think some precaution should be inserted in the Bill so that the doctor who examined the child would be in a position to refuse to supply the manager or any other official with particulars, beyond setting out the fact that the patient was examined in accordance with the regulations.  The doctor should not be obliged to supply the name of the patient.  While I can see that it would be highly undesirable if doctors administering the scheme or the local medical officer were to use <Col N="1643" /> out-of-date methods, or a vaccine other than that in current use, at the same time it must be remembered that in many cases doctors may differ as to the suitability of a particular vaccine for a particular disease or for a particular type of immunisation.</P>
      <P>While it would be reasonable to expect that whatever particular vaccine or immunisation standards were favoured by the Department the medical officers would adopt them, it is undesirable where professional experience and practice are concerned, that any compulsion should be adopted.  I would suggest to the Minister that if the Health Council adopted or suggested a particular vaccine or method of immunisation, it might be satisfactory as in no way infringing on the professional independence or liberty of choice of the doctor concerned.</P>
      <P>I can well see doctors differing on the type of vaccine which one man would use as against another and while, in general, agreement is usual in these matters, if a particular doctor did not wish to use the vaccine which the Department suggested, it might involve him in a dispute with the Department. I have no personal experience of the ordinary methods adopted by doctors in these cases, but I think that, with few exceptions, liberty of choice and freedom of opinion as exercised by doctors is not merely something most cherished by them but something which they regard as being their peculiar right.  Any suggestion that that should be regulated by control from the Department or from the county manager would, in my view, be most obnoxious.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>A debate such as this on this kind of question is going to be read very closely by a great number of members of the medical profession and I am only intervening a second time in order to give the Minister an opportunity to see the full implications of some of the observations he made when he was last speaking and to see that he is treading in a very dangerous direction. If any doctor or group of doctors in this country or in any other European country presumed to take to themselves the authority to direct other doctors even what specific immunisation <Col N="1644" /> agent they must use, a question of that kind would go to the medical council for that particular country and would have to be ruled on by them.</P>
      <P>The most rigid discipline prevails in armies, the chain of command is most continuous in armies, but the medical authority on top would never lay down in a flat-footed manner what particular treatment or preventative would be used for any particular disease.  The procedure is laid down and must be adhered to, the routine is laid down and must be adhered to, but a certain choice of agencies is left there for the practitioner down below.  It is strongly urged that (a) rather than (b), (c), (d), or (f) be used, but beyond that it does not go.</P>
      <P>The Minister might have been informed that an issue of this kind appeared to be arising a couple of years ago between the Department of Local Government and Public Health and certain medical people down the country.  An instruction or a circular was issued.  I do not think the intention behind that circular was exactly or clearly expressed in the circular itself, but there was a danger at that time that misunderstandings might arise with regard to the functions and responsibilities of medical men in the Department and the functions and responsibilities of medical men working down below.  Catholic teaching in association with the practice of medicine lays it down very firmly and very emphatically that a doctor is not entitled to treat any human being in a way that he is not, by conviction and conscience, convinced is the proper line of treatment.  Arising from that, it is very clear that no one of us, no matter what our rank or position, can be the keeper or the director of the professional conscience of another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite with the Minister that it is the function of people in a medical headquarters to give assistance and guidance, to give advice and to make recommendations and suggestions, to place at the disposal of those below all the available information which they can get with regard to the success of one particular product rather than another.  That is the way the matter must be approached and those down below, whether very experienced or <Col N="1645" /> only with slight experience, would each one of them only be delighted and relieved to get that particular form of assistance and advice from the Department; but anything in the nature of a direction, instruction or order with regard to the practice of medicine, whether on the treatment side or the preventive side would not, should not and could not be tolerated by any member of the Minister's profession and mine.</P>
    <P>In connection with the remarks concerning the confidential nature of documents, when we were discussing it we were doing so with the hangover of having been some hours dealing with school medical inspection only; but these regulations referred to in Section 24 refer to all the duties under Part III of the Bill.  In other words, they apply to the treatment for every illness and defect of the mother and the children up to the age of 16.  So it is not just a matter of designing a card with a number instead of a name.  That might meet it in the case of school records, but the rules and regulations will apply to and govern all the relevant documents relating to any and every illness suffered by the people coming within the service.  It must contain the most intimate details of family life and inter-family relations.</P>
    <P>It must contain the most confidential information with regard to illnesses in that family, perhaps back for one or two generations and in respect of near relatives in the present generation.  It would be unthinkable that any information of that kind should be available to anyone but a medical man, and only available to that medical man under a rule of the most stringent secrecy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with much, and practically all, of what Deputy O'Higgins has said with regard to the freedom of the doctor.  He will have complete freedom, so far as his clinical work is concerned, and, so far as his administrative work is concerned, he will be under the direction of the county medical officer of health, and I suppose we can assume that things will work out fairly smoothly between them. If the county medical officer of health complains that the man is not doing his work properly, it will be for the <Col N="1646" /> health authority to deal with the position.</P>
      <P>With regard to the secrecy point.  I should have said that the system I outlined refers to everything under this part of the Bill.  The expectant mother goes to the doctor and the doctor puts on one side of a sheet of paper or a card her number, and on the other, her name and fills in whatever details are necessary.  He will then tear off the part with the name and lock it away. He will, of course, lock the other away, too, except that, from time to time, these cards or sheets may be required at headquarters for the purpose of statistics.  They would not be required for any other purpose.  It is hoped to get machines which will be capable of dealing with these cards for the purpose of preparing statistical returns. There is one point which did not occur to me until it was raised by Deputies opposite, that is, that the doctor might think he was obliged to give information to his civilian manager, the county manager or anybody else.  I think we had better make that clear and I will try to bring in an amendment on Report to cover the point with regard to professional secrecy.</P>

      <P>This is the last section of this Part dealing with the mother and child service.  It is the general provision empowering the Minister to make regulations covering all the matters dealt with and I want to avail of it, before passing from this Part, to renew the most earnest appeal to the Minister to enable us to give him that measure of cordial and unfeigned co-operation <Col N="1647" /> in making this Bill a success which he could do if he would proceed on the basis of completing his personnel, providing the equipment necessary to realise his ideal and allowing the voluntary principle to be tried out with the co-operation of all those who are ready and willing to help him to make the voluntary scheme 100 per cent. successful.  He can do that without prejudice to his own view on the question of compulsion, even making a specific reservation that, if the voluntary practice falls short in future of what he desires, he reserves <i>in toto</i> his right to come back to the House and to inject into the Act, as it then will be, the compulsory principle in a new Bill, when the merits of that principle can be debated independent of the general purpose of this code of law.  I understand that, in the acceptance of the amendment to Section 21, we are not to abandon hope that between now and Report Stage the Minister might consider that aspect of the situation, with a view to determining whether, consistent with his own purpose, it would be feasible to meet the views of some of us on this side in regard to that detail of compulsory powers.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>() Regulations made under this section shall be subject to the approval of the national health council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is put down for the purpose of giving a real function and a real existence to the proposed national health council.  A similar amendment is put down to other Parts of the Bill.  What the amendment aims at is that the approval of this health council should be secured for any regulations which may be made <Col N="1648" /> under the Act.  I think the Minister will agree, and the discussion is making it very clear, that this Bill is really an empowering Bill, an authorising Bill, a Bill which, when passed, will give authority to the Department of Health, and, through the Department, to the various health authorities throughout the country, to get certain very important health services established and functioning.  That will be done, not through the Bill, but, arising out of the Bill, through the regulations. This House, although it is passing the Bill, will have no voice with regard to the regulations.  I know that the usual clause appears here and there that regulations under this Part of the Act shall be tabled for so many days.  The Minister is a member of this House for greater length of time than I, and he knows that that provision is worthless. He knows very well that there may be a very important regulation containing from ten to 50 sections and that it cannot be amended.  It can only be scrapped <i>in toto</i> or swallowed <i>in toto.</i> The person who thought of that device of laying regulations on the table was clever enough to avoid any interference by Parliament, because they are not subject to alteration or amendment; they can only be completely wiped out or completely accepted.  That is no safeguard.</P>
    <P>We have established a new Ministry of Health as a special Department of State and the first work undertaken by that Department is a new Health Bill. Out of that new Health Bill will arise new health services which every one of us hope will show very great benefits in the course of time.  Under that Bill you are appointing a national health council, with so many members nominated by the Minister, so many nominated by the Medical Association and other medical and nursing bodies. Apparently the Minister has not yet made up his mind as to the complete design of the council.  But it will be a council of specialists specially elected or selected.  Surely, neither the Minister nor his Department need be afraid of laying it down that regulations under the Act, or at all events regulations under certain portions of the Act, should get the approval of that body.  Nobody would think of suggesting <Col N="1649" /> that a health council of that kind would be out to sabotage or interfere with or impede the health work of the State.  They will be a body whose mere participation in the responsibilities of such a council will be evidence of the fact that they will be helpful and not obstructive.</P>
    <P>I would regard it as evidence of lack of confidence on the part of any Department of Health if they were afraid of or had any objection to having any of the regulations approved by a council such as that.  If a council of that type disapproves of the regulations drafted or suggested by the Health Department it could only be because those regulations were not suitable and would not carry out the work in the best interests of the health of the nation as a whole.  If I were in the Minister's position, I would welcome a suggestion that a body such as that should approve or disapprove of suggested regulations.  I certainly would not like that there should be any suspicion that my Department would issue a type of regulations in respect to which there was any risk that the council would not approve.</P>
    <P>Everybody fancies himself at his own particular job, but pooled minds are better than the single mind and the experience of many is much better than the experience of a few.  People immersed in the atmosphere of a great State Department are not always the best judges of what is required away down the country or how things should be done at the periphery.  But the pooled minds of those from the periphery and those from the centre would be invaluable, and on this national health council you will have the pooled minds of departmental medical chiefs, medical men from the provinces and experts specially elected or selected from a group of teaching institutions or clinical hospitals.</P>
    <P>It would be impossible to imagine that a body constituted in that way would hold up any regulations that would be of benefit to the people and in the best interests of the health of the people.  I therefore strongly urge on the Minister that the wise course is not only to accept the suggestion contained in the amendment, but to welcome it.</P>

      <P>I indicated earlier that I would have to oppose this and similar amendments with regard to getting approval of the council.  This consultative council, as Deputy O'Higgins says, will be composed of medical men, some of them sent forward by their organisations, representatives of nurses and dentists and, in all probability, some members of health authorities.  They will be people who will be giving their services free and they can hardly be expected to meet more than once every two months.  I have a lot of experience of consultative councils in another Department and they found it hard to meet more than twice a year.  I admit that a health council like this will probably be prepared to meet fairly frequently for a while until we get things straightened out.  But it might happen that we would wish to add some disease to our list and we could not possibly expect the council to come together for the sake of ratifying that.  It would be unfair to ask them, and the circumstances might not allow us to wait until they would meet.  Deputy O'Higgins will probably say that that could be provided for, that they would sanction it afterwards.  That is true. The principal work of the health council will be to give advice on regulations of all kinds.  It would be my intention to submit all the regulations as they are drafted or ready for publication; they would be circulated to the members.  In the case of the principal regulations that will be made in the beginning, we will call the members together, having given them time to read those regulations, and then we will ask them for their views on the regulations.  I have no fear that we would meet with any sort of destructive criticism from such a body.  I am sure they will be as helpful as they can be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, it might not be possible to get them together when we want them, and that is the first reason.  The principal reason that I have to advance is that in my view the Minister must take responsibility for what is done, because the Minister is responsible to the Dáil. Deputy O'Higgins does not think there is very much use in submitting regulations to the Dáil, but I have always <Col N="1651" /> found that the House is rather jealous about having that inserted in every Bill.  I know that there are disadvantages in that the regulations must be either rejected or approved, but at any rate Deputies will have an opportunity of bringing them forward for discussion and perhaps pointing out that the regulations were good in many respects but that there were one or two things to which they strongly objected.  Anyhow, it will give them an opportunity to express their views.  The regulations will be laid before the House and provision can be made to have them discussed if Deputies so desire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is&mdash;that they must be laid on the Table of the House.  I think we should follow that procedure&mdash;that the Minister should take responsibility for his Department, that he should be responsible to the Dáil and not to any health council.  I have a great belief in consultative councils.  I had them when I was in the Department of Agriculture and I met them very often on various subjects.  I very seldom had to disagree with or reject any advice they gave me &mdash;I do not recollect any occasion when I had to do so.  I think the Minister should be free to do it, if he feels that way.  He seeks advice, but he must be free to accept or reject it, because he is responsible.  I am afraid I shall have to oppose this amendment.</P>

      <P>Would it be possible to <Col N="1652" /> prescribe, in regard to regulations laid upon the Table under this section by the Minister, that the opinion of the consultative council would be taken and made available to Dáil Éireann by the same procedure as the Order itself is communicated to the House?  That is to say, that annexed to each Order, either contemporaneously or subsequent to its being laid on the Table, there should be a note to the effect that &ldquo;the medical advisory council agrees with the regulations,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the medical advisory council has submitted the following comments to the Minister in relation to these regulations,&rdquo; thus enabling Deputies, in the event of there appearing to be a difference of substance between the Minister and his medical advisory council, to raise the matter in the House, to have it discussed and to afford the Minister an opportunity of informing the Dáil of the grounds on which, in a particular case, he overrode the advice tendered to him by the medical advisory council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two objections to what the Deputy suggests.  One is that sometimes a rather trivial regulation is made and it would be hardly fair to ask the council to come together to give their views on it.  Of course, it would be rather difficult to interpret what is trivial and what is not.  The second objection is that I do not think the Deputy should tempt the Minister to select a council to tender advice in such circumstances.  He should allow the Minister to get a council that would be really helpful to him in important matters.</P>

      <P>This section puts an obligation on a person who knows he is a source of infection to take reasonable precautions.  I think it would be impossible to state in an Act what reasonable precautions are.  The court will have to decide, and I think that Deputies will agree that, as a rule, the court will give every consideration to the person in a case of this kind.  There is no strictly comparable provision in existing law, but there are certain limited requirements in various Acts. For instance, in Section 142 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, and Sections 52 and 62 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907, there are provisions that may not altogether coincide with this, but they are of a somewhat similar nature and this codifies them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that if he brings an unfortunate person into court, charging him that he did not take reasonable precautions, that he did not take every reasonable precaution to prevent the spread of infection, he may involve that person in <Col N="1654" /> a very serious problem as to how he will make a defence?  The Minister will have the whole machinery of his Department to make a case against that man, but the man will not know what particular point of human imagination he has to be prepared to make his defence against.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be very difficult to lay down all the various contingencies this Act will refer to.  Section 142 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, gives a lot of details, but it leaves out a lot of equally dangerous situations.  I think, on the whole, it would be better to leave it in a general way and let the courts decide.</P>

Now, time brings about changes in circumstances.  I move to report progress.</P>
