    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether his attention has been drawn to an article, written by the Northern Minister of Home Affairs, relating to this country; and whether he proposes to make any pronouncement in relation thereto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the article in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of November 16th.</P>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to that article.  While I do not think that this is an appropriate occasion for dealing with it comprehensively, there are several statements in it which give such a completely misleading picture of the situation that it would not be right to let them pass wholly without comment.</P>
      <P>At the outset I would like to say that I was glad to note Mr. Warnock's expression of official goodwill towards the people of this part of Ireland. Regarding, as we do, the Six Counties as part of the national territory, we in the Twenty-Six Counties have also a very deep concern for the welfare of the people of the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>Mr. Warnock says that&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;when the British Parliament partitioned Ireland in 1920 no one was enamoured of the plan&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Certainly no Irish member in the British Parliament voted for it.  But is not the fundamental point that the vast majority of the Irish people, as proved by the Elections of 1918, and previously, denied then, as they still deny, that the British Parliament had any right or authority to devise any system of Government for Ireland? Mr. Warnock points out that we had not peaceful conditions in Ireland in the past.  Was not the reason this: that not for 100 but for more than 700 years the Irish people were resisting by every means at their disposal Britain's claim to rule them?  Partitioned Ireland is at peace, he says, to-day.  Does he wish to suggest that the nationalists in the Six Counties are satisfied with Partition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He speaks of the Six Counties as &ldquo;Ulster&rdquo;.  Everyone knows that the <Col N="3" /> Six Counties are only a part of Ulster and that the historic province of Ulster is partitioned no less than Ireland.</P>
    <P>Mr. Warnock's article suggests that the area governed from Belfast and Westminster is homogeneously a partitionist area.  The fact is, of course, that the peoples of the pre-1920 Parliamentary constituencies of South Down, South Armagh, together with the Counties of Tyrone and Fermanagh and Derry City, by a substantial majority, all desire union with us.  All those areas adjoin our territory.  On what principle does Mr. Warnock claim that they should be cut off from us and included in any partitioned area?  Are they not held apart, separated from us, by coercion? Does he deny that they desire by a majority to be with us?  Will he agree to put it to the test of a plebiscite of the inhabitants of those areas?</P>
    <P>The figures show further that even in a block of four counties out of the six, and these again, areas adjoining our territory, there is a majority for union with us.  On what principle are these four counties separated from us? Are they not held from us by coercion? Even in Belfast City itself there is relatively as big a Nationalist minority that object to Partition and the régime under which they are now compelled to live as there are partitionists in the whole of Ireland.  Why must one be coerced if not the other?</P>
    <P>So far for the political side of the picture presented by Mr. Warnock. When we come to examine the economic side we find it an equally inaccurate representation of the position.  When he alleges that wages in the Six Counties are about 20 per cent. higher than in the Twenty-Six Counties, he is completely at variance with the facts.  It is, of course, notoriously difficult to obtain strictly comparable data for any two arbitrarily defined areas.  But in a list of 33 occupations for which reasonably comparable wage-rates can be obtained I find that in only four are wage-rates higher in the Six Counties than they are here and that in general wage-rates <Col N="4" /> are considerably higher here than in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>In regard to the cost of living, it is altogether misleading for Mr. Warnock to say that it is no less than 70 points lower in the Six Counties than it is here.  As far as I am aware, there is no cost-of-living index number compiled for the Six Counties at all and, if there were, a comparison of crude indices would be fallacious in the absence of an adjustment to make allowance for the varying degree to which items entering into the compilation of the cost-of-living index number are subsidised in the two areas.</P>
    <P>A special calculation that has recently been made here shows that, if subsidies had not been paid, the rise in the cost of living between 1938 and 1947 would have been about 72 per cent. in the Twenty-Six Counties and about 64 per cent. in Great Britain; this suggests a very different picture to that conveyed by an alleged disparity of 70 points &mdash; whatever that may mean &mdash; in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>It is undoubtedly true that cash social services are, on the whole, higher in the Six Counties than they are in the Twenty-Six Counties, though in some particular instances ours are, as a matter of fact, the higher.  But while Mr. Warnock stresses the advantages of the Six-County resident in this respect, he is very careful not to mention the other side of the account&mdash; namely, the price that the Six-County resident has to pay for these higher social services through heavier taxation. The proceeds of central taxation in the Twenty-Six Counties in the past financial year, that is, 1946-47, amounted to £15.9 per head of the population, whereas in the Six Counties in the same year it amounted to no less than £34.6 per head of the population &mdash;that is, more than twice as much.</P>
    <P>To give some examples of this higher taxation: In, say, Belfast, a smoker pays 3/4 for 20 cigarettes.  In Dublin he pays 2/-.  A bottle of Guinness's stout costs about 1/2 in the north-eastern area.  Here it costs 8½d.  Our income-tax rate is at present 6/6 in the £.  True, it will be 7/- from the beginning of the next financial year, but that <Col N="5" /> rate will still be low in comparison with the present rate of 9/- in the £ which must be paid by the Six-County resident.</P>
    <P>There are other disparities.  Beef, mutton and eggs are unrationed here. They are severely rationed in the Six-Counties. Our butter ration is twice that is the Six Counties and our sugar ration is 50 per cent. higher.  Apart from a few items, the subsidised prices of the principal foods are, it is true, lower in the Six Counties than here, but taking wages, prices, taxes and availability of supplies all into account I do not think that any Belfast worker who knows the corresponding conditions in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford or Galway, would deny that the standard of living is in fact very much higher in those cities than in his own.</P>
    <P>Mr. Warnock also refers to education. All I will say in this regard is that we have never received any complaint from the minority here on the score of religious discrimination against them in matters of education.  One might venture to ask whether Mr. Warnock can say the same.</P>
    <P>As regards health services, a comparison is difficult to make and it is doubtful whether any useful comparison can be drawn between the two areas, having regard to the fact that the services in both areas are in a state of transition.  A comparison of housing conditions shows that the Twenty-Six Counties are in a far superior position to the Six Counties; the total housing deficiency in each area in 1943 (the last year in which surveys were made in both areas) was estimated at about 100,000 houses, which represents a deficiency of approximately one in 12 of the population in the case of the Six-Counties and only one in 30 of the population in our case.</P>
    <P>Mr. Warnock tells us that great water and sewerage schemes are afoot in the Six Counties.  The necessity for such is evident from a White Paper on the subject published by the Six-County Government in 1944 which stated that &ldquo;reports have shown that these services are extremely inadequate&rdquo;, that there were four towns with a population <Col N="6" /> of over 1,000 which had no piped water supply, and that the great majority of the 109 towns and villages with a population of from 250 to 1,000 had neither a piped water supply nor, as a consequence, adequate sewerage facilities.  In contrast with this, in the Twenty-Six Counties, there are only two towns with a population of over 1,000 which are without a piped water supply, and, of the 307 towns and villages with a population of from 200 to 1,000 less than one-third are without a piped water supply.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I add that if Mr. Warnock is as confident regarding the attractiveness of the conditions created by Partition in the Six Counties as his article might lead one to believe, he should have no hesitation in putting the question of that attractiveness to the test of a plebiscite in the areas I have mentioned above&mdash;that is, in the old Parliamentary constituencies of South Down, South Armagh, the Counties of Tyrone and Fermanagh and in Derry City, or in the block of four counties Armagh, Tyrone, Fermanagh and Derry.  Which of us is right can then be settled conclusively by the vote of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is prepared to have compiled and published, for the use of the Labour Court and for general use, an itemised estimate of the weekly amount of money required, at present, in Dublin, by an average family unit consisting of (a) father, mother and two children under five years of age; (b) father, mother and five children under ten years of age; (c) father, mother and seven children under 15 years of age; and if he will arrange that such estimates include rent, clothing, food, fuel, transport, church dues, school requisites and entertainment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the amounts actually expended by families of different types, data of <Col N="7" /> the kind specified by the Deputy will no doubt be forthcoming from the national nutrition survey at present proceeding as regards food items and from the new family budget inquiry, the institution of which was announced by the Taoiseach on 15th October, 1947.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the inquiry into the church dues requested in the question would, if undertaken, constitute an infringement on the ordinary citizen's privacy in regard to religion and would be most undesirable?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the question.  &ldquo;Church dues&rdquo; is included in the question.  The question asks for an inquiry into the church dues paid by the member of each family.  Can the Minister give the assurance I have asked for?</P>

      <P>It has been reported to me that persons in some areas have not been able in the past month or so to procure the quantities of cement they wished to purchase.</P>
      <P>It would appear that the total demand for cement at present is in excess of the supply despite the fact that the cement factories are working to their full capacity and delivering to the trade 50 per cent. more cement than in 1946.</P>
      <P>The position may become easier during the winter months but I am having consideration given to the arrangements necessary to ensure that the progress of important building projects such as the housing schemes of the local authorities will not be interrupted by difficulties about supplies of cement.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether, having regard to the fact that scales of pay differentiated on a marriage basis were not in operation when many unmarried principal teachers were appointed, and also having regard to the anomalies created by the operation of these scales, he will consider improving the salaries of these teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take the Deputy's four questions (18) to (21) together.</P>
      <P>The scheme for salaries and other grants payable to national teachers which came into operation from the 31st October, 1946, represented a complete revision of the scales, etcetera, formerly in operation and included the following special features:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Three main scales: One for women teachers; one for single men teachers; and one for married men teachers, as compared with the two former scales: One for women teachers and one for men teachers.</P>
      <P>(2)  Rent allowances for married men and widows.</P>
      <P>(3)  The figures in the new scales do not represent a series of uniform percentage increases on the old scales; it was not intended nor was it so arranged, that the increases would be uniformly proportionate for the different categories of teachers or even for teachers in the same category with different periods of service;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="18" /> (4)  The system of making an allowance to principal teachers based on the number of pupils in average attendance, which might vary from year to year, was replaced by a series of fixed allowances, not subject to reduction if the number of pupils fell but which might be increased on certain conditions if the number of pupils rose.</P>
    <P>The inception of separate scales for married men and unmarried men teachers had the result, that single men teachers could not benefit to the same degree as married men from the new arrangement.  Having regard to the basis on which the present scheme rests I do not admit that there is any anomaly, in the sense of an injustice or an inequality where in a particular case a principal teacher who is a single man receives less by way of scale salary and principal's allowance than a married man assistant teacher of the same or even shorter service would have by way of scale salary.</P>
    <P>I do not propose, therefore, to make any alterations in the basic principles of the existing scheme, under which highly-efficient unmarried men principal teachers may receive in respect of maximum salaries and principal's allowance&mdash;£491 per annum in a school in the category of 120-179 pupils; £506 per annum in a school in the category of 180-239 pupils; £536 per annum in a school in the category of 240-299 pupils; £551 per annum in a school in the category of 300-349 pupils.</P>
    <P>The answers to the other points in the questions are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(18)&mdash;Highly-efficient unmarried men teachers at the maximum of the scale, i.e., with 23 or more years' service, may receive by way of scale salary and principal's allowance increases of from 10 per cent. to 21 per cent. above the amounts payable to them under the 1938 scales in respect of scale salary and the equivalent of principal's allowance, depending on the number of pupils in the school.  The percentage increases given to classes of teachers other than single men vary according to whether the teacher is a woman or a married man, whether a principal or an assistant, the length of service and <Col N="19" /> whether or not the teacher is in receipt of rent allowance, and would vary more widely than from 40 per cent. to 50 per cent., as stated by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>(19) and (20) &mdash; If it is intended in the cases to refer to married men assistant teachers, the answer is that it is possible, depending on length of service and size of school, for a principal teacher in a particular instance to receive less pay than an assistant teacher.</P>
    <P>(21) &mdash; Separate scales for unmarried men and married men are an integral part of the new scales of salary introduced on 31st October, 1946.  All teachers benefited by the introduction of these scales and I see no reason for differentiating between unmarried men appointed before 31st October, 1946, and those appointed since that date.</P>

      <P>My Department has been in correspondence with the manager for some time past with a <Col N="20" /> view to the erection of a new school to replace the present Clashbee National School, Beeing, Mallow, County Cork, but certain arrangements have still to be made as regards the provision of a water supply for the new school and the production of evidence of title to the site before a grant can be sanctioned from State funds towards the cost of the new school.  Every effort will be made to have the case expedited, with a view to enabling a grant to be sanctioned and the erection of the new school to be proceeded with as soon as possible.</P>

The same thing applies to pig production.  If pig breeders cannot get a proper ration at an economic price, pig breeding will go from bad to worse.

      <P>In page 4, line 47, before the word &ldquo;the&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;Sections 2, 3, 4 and 5 of&rdquo; and delete the word &ldquo;is&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;are&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I suppose in some ways this Bill does simplify procedure but there is one very objectionable feature in it.  The Act of 1893 which it is proposed to repeal in its entirety contains a provision that 40 days' notice has to be given of its intentions by the Government. Far too little publicity is given in matters of this kind and a big number of people incur the most severe penalties by reason of ignorance.  The Minister has not told us why he intends to do away with this very important safeguard.  In the explanatory memorandum, he states that&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;provision is made in Section 3 (3) of the Bill to ensure that contravention of a statutory instrument will not be punishable as a criminal offence unless adequate publicity has been given to the instrument when made&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that all that that means is that when a person has committed an offence a certain amount of mitigation will be allowed, if he can show that he knew absolutely nothing about the <Col N="29" /> provisions but I should like to suggest that the time has gone &mdash; and we hope it will not return &mdash; in which it was necessary to have this extraordinary haste in which statutory rules had to be passed overnight and given effect to the next day.  I would ask the Minister to consider why he cannot revert to the provisions of the Act which has been in force for over half a century and which has apparently worked very satisfactorily.  I accordingly move this amendment and I thank you, a Chinn Comhairle, for allowing me to move it.</P>

I think that anybody who has had experience of Statutory Orders in recent years, whether he was acting for the Government or acting in defence of somebody charged under and by virtue of such Orders, experienced the same difficulty in ascertaining exactly what Orders were in force and whether they had been amended.  I think that that was largely due to the haste in which Orders were often made and that any form of brake on that haste would prevent confusion.  Very often Orders were made and amended, possibly three or four times within a month of their being made.  That was due probably to haste at the time the Order was made.  A brake would have avoided all these amendments; any kind of brake that would have delayed immediate action would probably have helped the Department concerned to appreciate the various difficulties that might be met if the Order were drafted hurriedly.  Not infrequently, I think, a number of prosecutions brought forward on behalf of the State failed because the prosecutions were brought under Orders that had been repealed or amended.  I think the Government should consider carefully the advisability of limiting its own powers in that respect and evolve some machinery that will ensure that these Orders will not be made hurriedly.  It only leads to confusion, not only for the person affected by the Order, but for the Department of State involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another suggestion I will make to the Minister; I do not know <Col N="30" /> if he can consider it on this stage, but it would be well worth considering, and it is this, that, as regards any Orders that impose a liability or affect a right, copies of such Orders should be filed at least in the High Court and Supreme Court offices.  Judges often have considerable difficulty in obtaining copies of Orders and in knowing what Orders are in force.  It is a thing that would facilitate the courts considerably if an official set of copies of these Orders was filed at least in the High Court and in the Supreme Court. It would be well, if it were not too complicated, also to have them filed in the Circuit Courts throughout the country.  Coupled with that, I also suggest to the Minister that there should be an official file of all these Orders made available publicly, say, in the National Library or in the General Post Office, so that a person would be in a position to go there and ascertain exactly what Orders had been made.</P>
    <P>I know that nominally all these Orders are supposed to be published by the Stationery Office, but very often, owing to printing difficulties, they are not available for a long time, or they may be out of print.  In these circumstances, it is difficult even for a lawyer to ascertain what Orders are in being. The Minister might well consider the advisability of arranging to have copies of all Orders filed in the National Library and possibly also in the Law Library, where they will be available to members of the public for inspection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest that the practice of amending Orders by reference to previous Orders should be avoided, if that is at all possible?  I have in mind Emergency Orders during the emergency period.  No sooner was the Order made than an amending Order was immediately made by reference to the principal Order, and so on <i>ad infinitum.</i>  In some cases as many as 12 amending Orders had to be referred to and very often these were not in print before one could find the law on a particular point.  I think when it becomes necessary to amend an Order a fresh Order should be made in full and this system of amending by reference should cease.  It means in <Col N="31" /> practice that a lawyer has to go through all the amending Orders, plus the principal Order, correlate them and waste much valuable time in tracing the existing law on a particular point.  It would save the lawyers and the courts much time if that practice could be avoided.</P>
      <P>There is a good deal of merit in Deputy Dockrell's amendment, preserving the old system of notice before an Order is made.  I desire to support his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to retain one section of the 1893 Act which, I am given to understand, has never been observed here.  Deputy Dockrell said it has been, but I understand that it has not. The whole idea is to have from now onwards all these Orders printed in serial numbers.  We will have to go back a certain distance.  An index of statute rules from 1939 to 1945 has to be prepared by the printers and it will be put on sale when it is printed.  It is intended to publish and put on sale volumes of Orders made in 1946, and subsequent Orders, and, as from 1948, the volumes will be published annually. I think that is a very big improvement.</P>
      <P>This idea of giving 40 days' notice before an Order is made would be impossible.  There is provision in the Act for all sorts of authorities to make representations and it would do away with the usefulness of making the Orders, some of which, as people know, are not very important to the general public.  As to Deputy Dockrell's point, that if a defendant can show he did not know about an existing Order it might be that there would be some mitigation, that is an entirely new provision and it does not say anything about mitigation but, if the defendant can prove that the instrument had not been published, the charge shall be dismissed, and there shall be no mitigation at all.  That is a new and a very useful provision.  As to Deputy MacBride's point about the judges, I am informed that copies of these rules have been given.  I am told that that is the practice and if not, it certainly will be henceforth.</P>

      <P>If I were going to accept this &mdash; and I certainly am not &mdash; it could not be done by repealing one section, but it would be necessary to redraft the whole Bill.

      <P>I think it might be better if we confined the discussion to the amendment and to take the general points raised on the sections.</P>
      <P>In regard to what Deputy Dockrell draws attention to in the section of the 1893 Act, one can take sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 1:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  At least 40 days before making any statutory rules to which this section applies, notice of the proposal to make the rules, and of the place where copies of the draft <Col N="33" /> rules may be obtained, shall be published in the <i>London Gazette.</i></P>
    <P>(2)  During those 40 days any public body may obtain copies of such draft rules on payment of not exceeding 3d. per folio and any representations or suggestions made in writing by a public body interested to the authority proposing to make the rules shall be taken into consideration by that authority before finally settling the rules: and on the expiration of those 40 days the rules may be made by the rule-making authority, either as originally drawn or as amended by such authority, and shall come into operation forthwith, or at such time as may be prescribed in the rules.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And sub-section (6):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the case of any rules which it is proposed shall extend to Ireland publication in the <i>Dublin Gazette</i> of the notice required by this section shall be requisite in addition to, or, if they extend to Ireland only, in lieu of, publication in the <i>London Gazette.</i>&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And Section 21:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a rule making authority certifies that on account of urgency or any special reason any rule should come into operation, it shall be lawful for such authority to make any such rules to come into operation forthwith as provisional rules, but such provisional rules only continue in force until rules have been made in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The matter has not been adverted to at all in the discussion of this measure up to the present and the Minister does not appear to be clear as to what is involved.  It would be well, in passing new legislation, if it were made clear what exactly was being dropped and the extent to which, for the purpose of making a statutory Order, it would be desirable to keep some delaying period of the nature suggested in Section 1 of the 1893 Act.  I suggest, perhaps, if the Minister is not in a position to deal with the matter, that Deputy Dockrell, following any further discussions, might withdraw <Col N="34" /> his amendment on the Committee Stage and put it on the Report Stage.</P>

According to Deputy MacBride there is a doubt whether it applies here or not.  Certainly if the Minister's suggestion is correct that if a case is brought and a person can prove that he did not know anything about the Order, the case is dismissed, surely the Minister ought to try to strike some balance in which there would be a reasonable chance for the ordinary individual to be aware of what the law is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>move that the Bill be now read Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="35" /> The main object of the Bill is to provide for the adjustment of Garda Síochána superannuation awards granted in respect of men ceasing membership of the force during the period over which the Civil Service (Stabilisation of Bonus) regulations operated.</P>
    <P>As has already been explained to the House by the Minister for Finance in connection with the Superannuation Bill, 1947, Civil Service bonus was, under these regulations, stabilised at a cost-of-living index number of 185 from 1st July, 1940, to 31st October, 1944, and at 210 from 1st January, 1945, to 31st October, 1946 (with certain modifications allowing for the payment of emergency bonus).  While Garda Síochána pay is not expressly related to the cost-of-living index number it nevertheless keeps step with it in generally the same manner as Civil Service pay.  At the time of the commencement of the Civil Service Stabilisation of Bonus Regulations the scales of Garda pay then in operation had been fixed by reference to an index number of 185, which was also the figure applicable to the Civil Service at the time.  Later, as from 1st January, 1945, when the Civil Service bonus was advanced to the index number of 210, the Garda got a corresponding increase in pay.  Although Garda pay was not formally stabilised as was that of the Civil Service, nevertheless throughout the stabilisation period it was not permitted to vary except in direct relation to the increases allowed from time to time to civil servants.</P>
    <P>I can best illustrate the effect of these provisions by giving examples of two typical cases.</P>
    <P>The first is that of a man retiring between the dates 1st January, 1945, and 31st October, 1946, and still drawing his pension on the latter date. His pay was related to the 210 index number and on this his pension was calculated.  He will now have the pension reassessed on the basis of the pay which he would have received if it had been related to the 270 index number, with effect as from 1st November, 1946, which was the date from which the present Garda scales of pay related to <Col N="36" /> the 270 figure were brought into operation.</P>
    <P>The second case is that of a man retiring between the dates 1st July, 1940, and 31st December, 1944.  His pay was related to the 185 index number and on this his pension was calculated. As from the 1st January, 1945, new scales of pay for the Garda Síochána were introduced, which were related to the index number of 210. The man I have instanced will, if he was still drawing his pension on the latter date, have his pension reassessed by reference to pay related to the 210 figure, or the figure applying at the date of his retirement whichever is the lesser.  This will last from 1st January, 1945, until 31st October, 1946, and if he is still drawing his pension on the latter date he will then enter into the category of the first example and his pension will again be reassessed by reference to pay based on the figure of 270, or the figure applying at the date of his retirement whichever is the lesser.</P>
    <P>I may add that widows' pensions and children's allowances, if assessed on the basis of years of service, will also benefit in the manner indicated in the examples I have given.</P>
    <P>The present opportunity is being availed of to provide, as was done in the case of civil servants under the Superannuation Act, 1936, that a man who left the Garda Síochána at any time solely for political reasons and rejoined the force later, might reckon for pension purposes the time for which he was out of the force between his two periods of service.  This is done in Section 8 of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the Garda Síochána there will be a great number of cases of hard luck by reason <Col N="37" /> of the arbitrary drawing of the line at the 1st July, 1940.  I would ask the Minister to induce the Minister for Finance to go back further if at all possible.  A number of men retired about the beginning of the war period. They had not the benefit of the increased pay now obtaining for the Gardaí and they find themselves in very distressing circumstances to-day.  Many of them have young families not fully schooled.  Many of them have sons or daughters at the university and they are trying to finish their education.  In all the circumstances, they find it impossible to carry on at the present time.  Representations have been made to me by numbers of these men to ask the Minister to be good enough to go back a few years further in the hope that they might be included in this pension scheme.  I can give concrete cases of men retired within a few weeks or months of the 1st July who will fail to get the benefit of these new pensions.  Others who retired in 1938, in 1939 and early in 1940 feel they have a distinct grievance in that not only had they to go on short pension but that they never had the advantage of the increased pay which their comrades of to-day are enjoying.  There is a good deal of discontent amongst these retired officers and men because, having retired a few weeks before some of their comrades, they are denied the increased superannuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other point is that in the case of those who retired within the period last mentioned by the Minister, that is the 1st July, 1945, to the 31st October, 1946, and subsequently, these men ought to be retired on the new scales of pay rather than by reference to the figure of 270.  Certain anomalies arise because of these to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention.  I have a concrete case here before me.  It concerns a man who served in the Garda Síochána and previously in the R.I.C.  He had 21 years nine months' service in the Garda Síochána and he was retired at a pension of £119 3s. 4d. on a pay of £325.  Previously he had 14 years' service in the R.I.C. and was retired on an actually higher rate of pension of £138 6s. 4d. though, in fact, he held a <Col N="38" /> lower rank in the R.I.C. than in the Garda Síochána.  As a result of his being retired on the maximum pension his allowance from the British Government was reduced by £40 16s. 4d. Had it not been for the Stabilisation Order, in all probability this man would have been earning not £325 per annum but a salary of £390 per annum. He finds himself, by virtue of the provisions of this Bill, in the position that he will be forfeiting a sum of 16/8 per week whereas if he could have been retired on the higher pay he would be in the position not only of getting a little extra from the State here but also of claiming 7/6 per week of that 16/8 from the British authorities.  The amount to us would be very small but it is a big consideration for the individual concerned.  There are many similar cases and I would ask the Minister, if at all possible, to include such cases on the basis of the existing pay rather than by reference to the cost-of-living figure of 270.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join in this debate, because I am very concerned about the plight of the widows of deceased members of the Garda Síochána.  A widow with six children gets £30 for herself and £30 for the children.  That is not fair when we take into consideration the years of service given by her deceased husband.  I know of a widow who had to leave this country to go to England to work in a hospital.  She had to leave her children in this country with her own parents.  She had to go away because she could not keep them, although her husband had given years of service in the Garda Síochána.  I consider that the pensions paid to widows of deceased members of the Garda Síochána are a disgrace.  The Minister for Justice should be ashamed of them. There are other people in the country enjoying big pensions who did not serve the State half as faithfully as the members of the Garda Síochána. Their widows are almost paupers, trying to exist on small miserable pensions given to them by the present Minister for Justice.  They cannot manage because of the present cost of living.</P>

      <P>On that last point I would say that the only widows provided for are those whose husbands died during the stabilisation period.  I do not think widows in the Civil Service get any pension at all.  They get a gratuity when the husband dies.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy Coogan, I do not think there is any likelihood of any departure from the scheme laid down here.  It is run almost paralled with what was done in the case of civil servants.  If, however, there are any cases of the kind mentioned by the Deputy, and if he will give me any information he has on these between now and the Committee Stage, I shall see if it is possible to do anything about them.  These two Bills were drafted at approximately the same time and had regard to the same period.  As the Deputy is aware, there is always the border-line case and, no matter how one may legislate, it is not always possible to bring such a case within the scope of a particular measure.  We are all aware of the difficulties and we are equally well aware that it is not always easy to make provision for or remedy them. If the Deputy will consult with me, however, I shall do anything I can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Local Elections Bill, 1947 be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>One object of the Bill is to restore the closer and more specific relationship, which, prior to the enactment of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1919, and the operation of the system of election then prescribed, formerly existed between the members of the local authority and the electors in the areas which they represented.</P>
      <P>The maxim: &ldquo;What is everybody's business becomes nobody's business&rdquo; has its application to local affairs, for what is the responsibility of a number of men soon ceases to be the responsibility of any of them in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="40" /> Bearing this in mind, the Bill seeks to reimpose upon the members of county councils that peculiar personal obligation which attaches to a single individual who does not share with others the responsibility of representing a particular district.</P>
    <P>The peculiar personal responsibility I refer to was abrogated when, to suit a certain system of proportional representation, the system of single-member divisions was abolished and large multi-membered electoral areas were substituted therefor.  From this two consequences have flowed.  First there is no one individual on the council to whom a ratepayer with a grievance or complaint can turn with certitude and say this is my man, he and he only represents my district, and it is his personal responsibility to bring my complaint to the proper quarter and secure me redress.</P>
    <P>The next is that the average area representd by a county councillor is far too large for him to be familiar with its requirements or for any person with his own business to look after to give it the attention which it needs.</P>
    <P>It may be open to doubt whether when the existing system of proportional representation was first introduced, the primary object in view was to make the local authorities more truly representative of the electorate, or whether the real purpose was not to retain some vestige of power for a small and disappearing minority which held itself aloof from the rest of the nation.  If the latter were the purpose we may congratulate ourselves that if there were ever need for it, which I do not admit, there is none now.</P>
    <P>No man in this State, whatever his creed or his class, is debarred by them from taking the place in our public life to which his talents and his readiness to serve entitle him.</P>
    <P>Apart from this consideration, however, we have the fact that it is possible to have, as Deputy Dillon pointed out on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, a system of proportional representation, based upon single-member constituencies. Such a system will enable us, not only to avail of whatever advantages its advocates may claim <Col N="41" /> proportional representation to have, but will restore to our local government that factor of particular individual responsibility for an area, without which it is doubtful if the individual members of local authorities will be as alert and vigorous under the managerial system as the interest of the community requires.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the last stage of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1947, Deputy Dillon, while giving at some length his adverse views on proportional representation, was careful to distinguish between that principle as applied on the multi-membered pattern and the use of the single transferable vote in combination with a system of unitary constituencies.</P>
    <P>In my reply to him I took occasion to point out that while the system he advocated had little to commend it when applied to the election of the Legislature, it was quite otherwise if applied to election for local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the single-member system of proportional representation, while quite unsuitable for the Legislature, is almost ideal for electing a local authority, arises from the fundamental and essential difference between the National Assembly and a local authority.  The former is a sovereign Parliament whose competency to make laws is only circumscribed by the wide ambit of the Constitution. A local authority is an entirely subordinate body and can only exercise such powers and perform such duties as may be delegated to it by the Oireachtas.  The function of a local authority is to administer the law as given to it by Parliament, and in accordance with the delegation of Parliament, but it cannot change that law.  It cannot legislate.  Even in the <Col N="42" /> matter of by-laws, the terms of a by-law must be <i>intra vires</i> the legislative provisions enabling the by-law to be made.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of a local authority is in fact administrative, to carry on the local affairs on behalf of every section of the local community. In order that this may be done effectively, it is highly desirable, if not indeed essential, that the local authority shall be equally as representative of all parts of the area which it administers, as it is of the area as a whole.</P>
      <P>Equal distribution of representation, however, can only be attained when each individual member is specifically elected to represent a particular area in a way that admits of no overlapping, confusion, or, on his part, evasion.  But experience has shown that in the large electoral areas called county electoral areas, which have been brought into being by multimember constituencies, the representation instead of being widely distributed over the whole area, as sound local government would require, has tended to be concentrated upon the more densely populated districts of those areas.  In this way the rural parts of the county have tended in general to be under-represented on the county council, while the urban areas on the other hand have been very much over-represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concentration of representation in county affairs upon the urban areas not only tends to impair the representative character of the local authority; it is also highly inequitable.  The main revenues of the county council are derived from or in respect of the rural areas.  By comparison with the amounts thus raised the contributions of individual boroughs or urban districts to the common county treasury are not very significant.  Yet under the present system of election those areas which are the main source of the council's revenues are greatly under-represented on the spending authority.  But the anomaly goes further, for, while the urban residents on the county council may discuss and by their votes determine every question affecting the rural area which <Col N="43" /> arises, whether it be in relation to housing, sanitary services, roads other than main roads, street-lighting, or such like, the rural residents on the county council are debarred from any voice or vote whatsoever in settling these matters should they relate to a borough or urban district.  Quite clearly this position is contrary to natural justice.</P>
    <P>To correct this anomalous position this Bill proposes, under Section 2, to rearrange representation so that the present disequilibrium between representation and financial responsibility will be adjusted.  In this way we shall not only remove the discrepancy between the representation of town and country on the local authority, but, by increasing the special personal responsibilities of the individual members to the districts for which they are elected, we shall greatly improve the standard of representation for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The expedient of increasing the personal responsibility of the local representative by reducing the size of his constituency is to be applied also, though in a lesser degree, to urban authorities.  Henceforward, instead of whole cities and towns being taken for the electoral area as is, with the exception of the County Borough of Dublin, the case at present, the administrative area of the county borough, borough, urban district or town, as the case may be, will be divided into a number of electoral areas, each returning three members.  As in the case of the county electoral areas, this will be done under Section 2, particularly by sub-sections (2) and (6).  I should mention, at this stage, that it is not intended to change the size of the several local authorities as at present fixed.</P>
    <P>The principles to be followed in framing the Orders dividing a county into local electoral areas are set out in sub-section (3) of Section 2.  Briefly, they provide that in the case of the purely rural areas due regard is to be had when framing the Orders to: (a) the number of local government electors registered in the areas; (b) the rateable valuations of the areas; (c) the density of population; (d) the general character of such areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="44" /> So far as county electoral areas, which comprise boroughs or urban districts, or which are constituted within boroughs or urban districts, are concerned, paragraph (2) of the sub-section provides that where the average amount of the county charges charged upon the urban area, in respect of the three years which preceded the year in which the Order is made, justifies it, the urban area shall be constituted as one, or if the financial position justifies it, more than one electoral area.  As things now are, this rule will apply only to the largest boroughs and urban districts.</P>
    <P>If, however, the average amounts thus charged upon the urban district would not justify the creation of a special urban electoral area or areas, but is at least one-half of the amount which would justify it, the urban area may be divided into two or more parts, and each such part shall be amalgamated with a contiguous non-urban area to form an electoral area, the county charges upon which would have approximated to the average of the county charges upon the purely rural electoral areas. This rule (which is set out in paragraph (b) of sub-section (3)) represents a mitigation of the first rule.  It will apply to many of the urban districts and it is believed will afford a larger representation to these areas than would be given by the strict application of the first rule.</P>
    <P>Where the average of the amounts charged upon an urban district is less than half the average charges in the same period upon the average rural electoral area, the urban district will not be divided but will be merged with the surrounding rural area to constitute an electoral district, the average county charge upon which would have approximated to that upon a rural electoral area.  In framing the Orders relating to county boroughs, urban areas and towns the number of local government electors in and the rateable valuations of the areas are to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The creation of the new electoral areas in the manner I have described may require new polling districts and provision is made for this in Section 3. <Col N="45" /> Heretofore the normal period of office of members of local authorities has been three years.  Local elections, however, as the House is aware, have been postponed very frequently so that the three-year election rule has not been regularly followed.</P>
    <P>Arising out of this, representations have been made by bodies representative of local authorities that the normal term of office should be fixed at five years.  The conclusion is inescapable that the five-year term, which has become almost normal in practice, should be the statutory term, and it is proposed, under Section 4, to make it so accordingly.</P>
    <P>Under the existing law the next election for local authorities should take place next year but we are also to have a general election next year. Here again it has been the universally demanded practice to postpone the local elections when they are due to take place in the year in which a general election is being held or in which it is intended to hold such an election.  I propose to conform with that precedent and accordingly Section 4 also provides that the next local elections will be held in 1950 &mdash; the last elections were held in 1945 &mdash; and that subsequent elections will be held in every fifth year thereafter.</P>

      <P>It may happen that in some future time there may be good reason why these elections should be held in the fourth or the sixth year on a particular occasion, particularly where it is clear that by the normal efflux of time a sitting Dáil will come to an end and a general election be held, in what will correspond to the fifth year of the term of office of a local authority.  It is, therefore, proposed to give the Minister for Local Government a discretion which will enable him to avoid forcing a clash between the expiration of the term of office of a local authority and the holding of a <Col N="46" /> general election.  To do this, the section will enable him either to bring forward or to postpone the date of the local elections in whichever way seems more feasible.  But if he desires to do either, the Minister must make an Order to that effect at least nine months previous and obtain the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas for it.  Furthermore, in order the more effectively to avoid having to hold the local elections within a too brief period following a general election, it is provided in sub-section (4), Section 4, that if Dáil Eireann dissolves within nine months before local elections are due to be held, the Minister may postpone the elections for one year.</P>
      <P>Section 5 defines the qualifications for membership of the local authority. It provides that in the case of a county council a candidate must be a local government elector for the local electoral area for which he is nominated. In the case of any other local authority he must be a local government elector for the functional area of the local authority.</P>

      <P>Section 6 gives electors a single transferable vote. With such a vote, the elector can indicate the order of his choice for the candidates and the vote can be transferred to a subsequent preference if it is not required for the first choice who may have been elected or eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 declares that a candidate who is credited with a number of votes equal to or greater than the quota is elected.  The quota is defined in Section 1.  It is ascertained by dividing the total valid votes by the number of vacancies plus one and adding one to the result.  The quota is the lowest number that may elect a candidate. Under the law as it now stands, two irresponsible electors can nominate another irresponsible at no cost to themselves and the returning officer has no option but to hold an election at the expense of the ratepayers.  It is quite wrong, I submit, that irresponsible persons should be entitled to involve the ratepayers in such expense. It is desirable to discourage such irresponsible <Col N="47" /> japes in future.  Section 8, therefore, proposes that a candidate for election shall deposit with the returning officer a sum of £10.  This deposit will be returned to him, unless, should a poll be taken, he fails to get one-fifth of the quota, in which case the deposit will be forfeited to the local authority.  This is not at all an onerous condition.  In a single member area where there were, say, 500 votes cast, a candidate who failed to get 51 votes could not be regarded as a <i>bona fide</i> candidate.  It is generally clear that candidates at local elections, with extremely few exceptions, got votes sufficient to justify their candidature so that this provision will not operate as a bar or deterrent to any <i>bona fide</i> candidate.  We have already a similar provision with regard to Parliamentary elections.</P>
    <P>Section 9 consolidates the law for filling casual vacancies.  The vacancy must be filled, it declares, after one month.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the measure is really consequential on paragraph 2, sub-section (2) of Section 2.  Aldermen under existing law are elected for each electoral area, the first two candidates elected being aldermen and the remaining councillors.  This method would not apply where boroughs are divided into three-member areas.  I do not propose that there should be a separate election for aldermen as was the case 40 years ago.  I suggest that the election of aldermen might properly be left to the borough council at its first meeting.  If the election is contested, the election must be in accordance with the principles of proportional representation.  The number of aldermen will be one-fifth of the council with a minimum of five.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Deputy is thinking of his own case, but he will have an opportunity of speaking later.</P>
      <P>By Section 11 existing members will continue in office for their current term. I have already mentioned that Section 4 of the Bill provides that no elections for local authorities will be held in 1948 or 1949.  Section 12 makes an exception to this general rule, but only where the members of a local authority stand removed from office at the passing of the Act.  There are at the moment two local authorities to which this section would apply, namely, the County Councils of Dublin and Kerry. It is in my view desirable that these councils should be reconstituted as soon as the commissioners have completed their task of overhauling, cleaning-up and reorganising the county services.  I hope that this may be done in time to permit the elections to be held in Kerry, perhaps, next year, and certainly in 1949.</P>
      <P>In Dublin, however, the reorganisation required is more far-reaching, involving as it will the complete reorganisation on a new basis and under new authorities of the health services and the social welfare services of the county, as well as a readjustment of the relationship between the county and the County Borough of Dublin in respect of the county services proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am hopeful, however, that all this may be done in time to permit the new local authorities to be reconstituted in 1949.  If, however, an election were held in 1948 or 1949, there would be no point in holding another election in <Col N="49" /> 1950.  On the other hand, if the next election were not held until 1955, or even perhaps until 1956, the period of office of the members would be too long.  I think the mandate from the people would require to be renewed.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, in these circumstances, it is proposed to give the Minister power to direct that another election should be held for either or both of the county councils in any of the years between 1950 and 1955.</P>
    <P>Section 13, 14, 15 and 18 make adaptations in the Vocational Education Acts, the Agriculture Act, the Public Assistance Act and the Harbours Act which are consequential on the alteration of the triennial sequence of local elections and the creation of single-member areas for electing county councillors.</P>
    <P>Section 16 amends the Local Government Act, 1941, to bring that Act into conformity with this Bill and extends by not more than six months the time within which an election must be held to a local authority, the members of which have been removed from office. The rule will be that a new election must be held after three years, but if the following year is a year in which elections under this Bill are to be held, the new election may be held in that year also.  If the elections are postponed under Section 4 to the following year, the new election will also be postponed.  This will enable the regular sequence of local elections to be preserved.</P>
    <P>The Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1945, required elections of the Boards of Assistance for Balrothery, Rathdown and Dublin to be held in the year 1948.  In that year, but for this Bill and the imminence of a general election, there would have been an election of Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation and the boards I have mentioned would have been elected at the first meeting after the election.  Section 17 provides that these elections will be held in the year in which an election of members of Dublin County Council is held under Section 12 or 4.  If the year is not 1950, it will be necessary for the Dublin Corporation to elect their <Col N="50" /> members on the joint board at a meeting within one month after the day of election of the county councillors and the members will come into office on the day on which the election is completed.</P>
    <P>Section 19 makes a general adaptation of the term triennial election which is necessary by reason of the provisions of this Bill and any particular adaptation or modification which is required may be made by Order.</P>
    <P>Section 20 contains the usual repeals and Section 21 deals with the short title and collective citation.  These are the main provisions of this Bill.  It is highly desirable that it should be passed at the earliest possible moment and I trust the House will see its way to pass the Second Reading and facilitate me in taking the remaining stages later.</P>

      <P>To delete the word &ldquo;now&rdquo; and to add at the end the words &ldquo;this day six months&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government asked on 14th July for permission to introduce a Bill of this kind, but before this Bill saw the light we had a declaration by the Taoiseach on 31st October that it was imperative that this Dáil be dissolved and that a general election be held at the earliest practicable moment.  Not until more than a fortnight after that, on 15th November, did Deputies get a copy of this Bill, so that here is a Bill that vitally affects every local authority and not a single one of them has had an opportunity of discussing it.</P>
      <P>It would be very tempting to take the Minister's speech and discuss the incongruities and inconsistencies of it, but I do not think it is worth while taking up the time of the Dáil doing anything like that, because we could only discuss it in a rather unreal atmosphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, when the general election was announced, dipped into his Departmental rag-bag, took some of the most scatter-brained ideas he could get and strung them into this measure and, on the basis that local authorities are unrepresentative and inequitably formed in relation to their <Col N="51" /> representation, he puts a whole string of proposals together here, wiping out, in respect of county councils particularly, the whole idea of proportional representation.</P>
    <P>The White Paper suggests that he thinks the utilisation of the single transferable vote in a single-member constituency has an element of proportional representation in it, but he changes the whole nature of the representation. He extends the life of the local authorities; he proposes to prevent any local election taking place earlier than 1950; he proposes to make a deposit payable in respect of each candidate at a local election on the ground that some of the adults to whom this Party gave the vote in connection with local elections are irresponsible and may be nominating some of their irresponsible colleagues or friends for election to local authorities. It would be very tempting to pursue the various rag-bag ideas in the Bill but I do not think it would be advisable to comment on it in any way except to state that it is hardly a matter for a Dáil which is practically dissolved, because there is not at present any possibility of doing any systematic work on any subject, after the Taoiseach's announcement in the first place and the inconsiderate way in which Ministers are presenting all kinds of Bills to be passed through now which are not at all urgent.  It is impossible to think that this is a working legislative Assembly at all.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister should drop a little of his attitude of &ldquo;I say&rdquo; and take into consideration, when he is remodelling the representation on local authorities and remodelling a scheme that has to be worked by thousands of representatives of the people in various parts of the country from Donegal to Wexford and Dublin to Cork, if we are going to have any respect for ourselves as a Parliament, or hope that local authorities or the electorate will have any respect for us, that we should not, in a hurried way and without discussion, be asked to drive through the Dáil and Seanad a measure on which the opinions of the working local authorities throughout the whole country to-day ought to be <Col N="52" /> obtained and which might be more intelligent than some of the opinions expressed here.  I submit that the Minister is utterly inconsiderate if he is pressing the measure and I move that consideration of the measure be deferred and taken up by the new Parliament.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with the Minister in his anxiety to introduce this Bill.  I think that he feels at the bottom of his heart or at the back of his head that the time for introducing legislative measures into this House is getting very short, and that he is anxious to make the utmost use of the little time available to display his skill in formulating new legislation and passing it through the House.  I would like if a record were put before the House of the number of Bills dealing with local government which have been enacted since the Fianna Fáil Government came into office.  They have altered, amended, changed, revised, recast and remoulded every particular branch of local government administration and the manner in which local authorities are formed and constituted.  Such a spate of legislation should, one would imagine, produce the most perfect system of local government in the world.  With all the reformation and change and renovation our local services should have become the most efficient of any democratic country in the world.  We know from practical experience however &mdash; as most of us have experience of local government &mdash; that every change of legislation enacted has added nothing whatever to the efficiency of the services, but rather to confusion and to the cost of administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a time when, if you wanted a pump repaired, you had only to notify the local engineer and somebody was sent out to repair the pump. Now, if you want a pump repaired, files have to pass from the county council, from the local authority, to the Department of Local Government and they pass up and down perhaps for weeks before anything can be decided in the matter.  Local administration is being brought into conformity with central administration and the whole system is being loaded down and overstaffed <Col N="53" /> with administrative officials and administrative rules and regulations of every kind which tie the various officials up in a maze of red tape. This is the net result of all the legislation enacted by the Fianna Fáil Party since they came into power. Now on the eve of an election, the Minister, feeling that time may be short for initiating fresh legislation, rushes this fairly far-reaching and comprehensive measure through the House, or rather rushes into the House with this rather revolutionary change in local administration and representation. Why should we be asked at this time when there are urgent and pressing matters to be dealt with before the Parliament is dissolved, matters relating to the economic life of the country, matters relating to trade and matters relating to agriculture, matters which call for urgent and pressing attention, to regulate the manner in which county councils will be elected in 1950?  We do not know who will be alive in 1950 or what Government will be in power in 1950.  It is still a number of years ahead, and I think that in the new Parliament which will be elected there will be ample time and opportunity before 1950 to go into this question very carefully and then for the local authorities to go into it.  There will be time &mdash;and urgent need&mdash;to consider alternative measures of election of local authorities.  The Vocational Organisation Commission sat for months and months and outlined a system of local representation on vocational lines. They outlined a very elaborate system. That system might have flaws or it might not.  But it is a system well worthy of earnest and careful consideration.</P>
    <P>The view expressed by the Vocational Organisation Commission on this matter of representation of various interests in the country on local bodies, and on central bodies also, is a matter that should be thoroughly debated upon by this House before any legislation is introduced to rearrange our system of local government and local election.  Why set up a commission representative of the most important people in the country?  Why invite a member of the Catholic Hierarchy to <Col N="54" /> preside over this commission and devote his attention to it for months and invite other important and representative people to act on the commission, and then, without giving any consideration whatever to the recommendations of the commission, proceed to introduce legislation dealing with the procedure of local elections and setting up an entirely and directly opposed system of representation to that proposed by the Vocational Commission? That, I think, is a deliberate insult to the very distinguished clergymen and citizens who sat on that commission and who gave such long and such earnest attention to the work entrusted to them.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to say very much about the system of local elections proposed in this Bill.  It is necessary, however, to say that it is a complete departure from proportional representation and I do not think that the Minister should try to hoodwink the people by saying that proportional representation is in any way preserved in this Bill.  It is not.  It is completely and absolutely eliminated.  There is a transferable vote but when you have a transferable vote taken in conjunction with a single-seat constituency you go further towards eliminating proportional representation than if you had not that transferable vote.</P>
    <P>I can explain that very simply. When you divide an area into single-seat constituencies and preserve the transferable vote the net result is that the Party with the majority will obtain all the representation and minorities will be completely eliminated. If you had not a transferable vote there would be an off-chance, and perhaps a fairly good chance, that in some constituencies representatives of minorities might be elected.  We all know that Britain has preserved the system of single-seat constituencies for the legislative assembly.  They have not introduced the transferable vote and the reason is not far to seek &mdash; they want to give minorities a chance of getting some representation somewhere. That is the idea underlying their system.  I consider that their system is bad.  I am in favour of proportional representation not only in local <Col N="55" /> affairs but also in national affairs &mdash; particularly in national affairs.  As far as local government is concerned, I would be inclined towards the suggestion put forward by the Vocational Organisation Committee that we should seek some measure of vocational representation. In this Bill there is provision for a re-division and sub-division of the various electoral areas both in town and country.  There again you have provision for a good deal of gerrymandering with a view to strengthening the position of the Party of whatever Minister is dealing with the matter.  I do not think that that is desirable.  The Minister wants to make this Bill attractive to the rural community by claiming that he is giving them increased representation &mdash; I think &mdash; to their contribution to the local expenses.  I wonder if the Minister has ever gone carefully into this question of contributions made by the various sections of the community to local administration. I mentioned a figure here some time ago in relation to agriculture.  I am speaking from memory now because I have not the figure before me.  I pointed out that in the estimate of national income produced by the Government it was found that the income of the agricultural industry for the most recent year available was 35 per cent. of the national income.  I found, at the same time, that the valuation of agricultural land and farm buildings was something like 80 per cent. of the total valuation of this country.  There you had a section of the community enjoying 35 per cent. of the national income assessed with a valuation which is 80 per cent of the total valuation. I am using those figures from memory but I think they are substantially accurate.</P>
    <P>It is that disparity in valuations, the inequality between the agricultural community and other sections of the community, the manner in which they are called upon to provide for local expenditure, that is the first injustice that ought to be removed.  I fail to see why some real effort is not made to remove that injustice.  The system which the Minister provides for under this Bill is merely tinkering with the problem.  It is a problem which has <Col N="56" /> got to be faced and faced resolutely. There is, of course, an attempt to offset the inequality of our present system of valuations by providing an agricultural grant.  But, there again, that agricultural grant is provided only for short terms &mdash; from year to year &mdash; and local authorities are never given a opportunity of knowing in advance what they are going to get in the matter of relief under the agricultural grant.  The whole thing adds to confusion and makes for inefficiency in local administration.</P>
    <P>Another point which should be taken into account is the instability of local rates &mdash; the fact that the rates tend to rise from year to year.  We will never have efficient administration until a definite statutory limit is fixed to rates.</P>

      <P>There are a number of rather weird ideas incorporated in it.  We have the provision that in certain cases elections may be held in certain counties in different years and at different times from the dates upon which elections are held in other counties.  We have the proviso that the Minister may vary the time at which a county council election is held from year to year according as political opportunity offers.  I think the idea of holding elections at different times in different counties is an absurd one.  I think local elections should be held in the same year and at the same time for all counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister should be very, very slow to dissolve a representative body duly elected by the people.  It is possible that at some time in the future there will be a responsible Minister in charge of Local Government. If there is a responsible Minister and the necessity for dissolving a council should arise, then a duly representative council should be elected immediately to replace it.  The Minister may hold that that would defeat the object of this measure since a council similar in personnel and policy might be reelected. Surely, if that is the Minister's view, then his own conscience convicts him.  No county council should be dissolved unless it is criminally negligent or dishonest in its administration. If a council has to be dissolved for either of these reasons then the people can be relied upon to elect a better council in its place.  We should face this situation with a proper sense of responsibility and a true appreciation of the sense of responsibility of the ordinary people.  If a county council proves to be unworthy of its office the people will not be slow to change the personnel of such a council if given an immediate opportunity of doing so.  The idea of leaving the county for a considerable period completely without local representation is both unjustifiable and anti-democratic. Having regard to the weighty consideration given to this question by the Commission of Inquiry into Vocational Organisation and having regard to the fact that this Dáil is facing almost immediate dissolution and that the local authorities have not had any <Col N="58" /> opportunity of expressing their views upon this Bill, the Minister should, I think, withdraw this proposed measure for the time being.</P>

      <P>I want to support the amendment moved by Deputy General Mulcahy.  I have listened all the time to the Minister in an effort to discover whether this is the body to consider any change in the method of local government elections.  This Dáil will be dissolved very shortly.  Because of that you are not going to get the attention and concentration that any proposal to change a system of elections for local authorities deserves.  I waited throughout the Minister's entire speech to discover the reason why it is necessary to change the present system.  I wanted to hear what was wrong with the present system and wherein it had failed.  I wanted to hear if any demand had emanated from anywhere for a change in the method of election. Where did the idea of change develop? Is the idea one conceived in and born of the Minister's own brain without any intervention from an outside source?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Minister's child and I am not responsible for it. The Minister did not give the House any intimation as to whether any demand had come from anywhere else. I suggest, therefore, that it is the Minister's own conception.  If he does not accept that, then will he tell us who is responsible for it?  There must be some demand made and there must be some reason for the change.  That reason should be given to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The obvious reason, of course, would appear to be that the system has failed.  If that is so we should be told why it has failed.  Is this merely another experiment?  We have already had three Fianna Fáil experiments.  I suppose I might call this the fourth Fianna Fáil experiment so far as local administration is concerned.  The Minister waxed eloquent on the peculiar <Col N="59" /> personal obligation and what that personal obligation meant to the small area represented by one individual and his sense of responsibility to that particular area.  He went on to say: &ldquo;This is my man; this is the man who is responsible for looking after my particular problem.&rdquo;  He drew a grand picture out of his own imagination.  I do not know whether the Minister served during any part of his life on a local authority.  It appears to me that anything he knows about the administration of local affairs he learned from the top and not from the bottom.  We all know that that is not the best way in which to glean information or gather experience of local affairs.  The Minister talked about the disequilibrium between representation and financial responsibility.  That is rather an extraordinary comment coming from a member of the Government that extended the franchise in regard to local government administration and gave power to everyone over 21 years of age to elect members to local authorities.  The natural corollary to that piece of legislation is that local authorities become irresponsible.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that they did become irresponsible because he himself had the distasteful duty of dissolving a number of them.  The natural corollary to that situation is the managerial system.  That was inevitable the moment the Fianna Fáil Government extended the franchise.  The Minister was then faced with the necessity of introducing some system of check.  To-day the administration of our local affairs is anything but democratic.  The Minister has put in charge of local affairs someone responsible only to himself &mdash; namely, a county manager.  We have had those two experiments &mdash; one being the natural corollary to the other.</P>
    <P>A further experiment is now going to be tried where we will have one individual representing a local government area &mdash; a very small area.  A county with 24 or 25 representatives will have 24 or 25 electoral areas.  Does the Minister really think that will be an advantage in helping to pin responsibility in a particular area?  The local authority <Col N="60" /> has only very limited functions because it has very, very limited powers under the present managerial system.  The county manager's functions are purely executive.  Once the finances are provided by the local authority, he can tell the local authority to &ldquo;go to hell&rdquo;, as far as the administration of the finances is concerned provided they are administered under the relevant headings. Is it not obvious that under this system of one transferable vote there will be a preponderance of representation of a particular type and that sections in the county will go unrepresented?</P>
    <P>Is that desirable?  As to the arguments advanced by the Minister that this was very favourable to local administration and would not apply to Parliamentary representation, I think he could reverse the argument to much greater effect.  He could argue, as his Leader did, that proportional representation makes for instability and that the main consideration at a general election is stable Government. He might have argued that in regard to this particular system very effectively. I think his argument completely falls to the ground so far as local administration is concerned, because there is no danger there of collapse, no danger of the fall of a Government or the fall of a local authority. At any rate, the Minister has the whip-hand.  If they are not behaving as good boys, he can dissolve them.</P>
    <P>Surely it is desirable that in the administration of local affairs the various sections of the community should be properly represented.  I think that the Minister's ideal falls flat; that the grand individual he has conceived who is going to feel very great responsibility for the whole area he represents will have feet of clay. He may be a very popular individual and be returned to represent the area. But, in fact, he may not represent it at all.  He may do nothing and the people in that area will have no one else to go to.  If we preserve the system in operation under which there are three or six representatives drawn from different interests, if an individual has a grievance which he wants discussed by the local authority and, if one representative fails him, he can <Col N="61" /> go to another.  Under this system, he has only one man to go to; that grand fellow who will devote all his time to the problems of the people he represents and who will always be at their service.</P>
    <P>That is the grand idea the Minister has.  I do not think the Minister has any practical experience of local administration. I do not believe he ever served on a local authority.  Those who have served on a local authority know that that is all bunk and humbug and that it is the Minister's own child.  If he had consulted any persons who had experience of local bodies they would not give him that as a solution.</P>
    <P>The Government have muddled this whole matter of local representation. They have destroyed the incentive of men capable of giving good service to give good service to the people.  Now they are trying to patch that up in this way; to restore to one individual a sort of power and importance that is not there.  The Minister knows well that there are people who can give valuable service to the country but, because of the undemocratic system of local government which we have in operation at present, they will not serve.  They have the guts to say that they would not serve under it.  They will say: &ldquo;If I am going to serve on a local authority, I am prepared to accept responsibility and to do my best, but I am not going to be dictated to by a creature of the Minister's whose main consideration is to please the Custom House and who does not give a damn about the representatives of the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot congratulate the Minister on his child.  My advice to him is that he should put this Bill in the pigeon hole and let another Parliament consider it. In the meantime, if he wants to go on with this Bill, he should consult the local authorities and give them an opportunity of expressing their opinion on this fundamental change so far as local administration is concerned. He is going to deny many smaller interests any representation at all.  If an individual wants to appeal to a local authority and, if one man fails him, he ought to be in a position to go to somebody else.  The Minister feels that he is going to find the perfect man in <Col N="62" /> every case who will be available at all times to the people, who will give his services for nothing and sacrifice his time listening to everyone's problems. I venture to prophesy that if this Bill is put into operation we will have a further change in the near future; that it will not work as effectively as the present system of representation.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about financial responsibility.  I am glad he admits there is a disequilibrium there so far as the main industry of the country is concerned. They are contributing the bulk of the cost of local administration. Then, when they look for service, what happens?  Take the question of the housing of the agricultural workers. We house people on the basis of health and not upon a man's capacity to give service to the main industry of the country.  We talk about expanding production on that basis while we are turning cottages all over the country into sanatoria.  That is the sort of administration we have got from the system which the Minister has in operation. The local representatives have no say as to who should get a cottage or who should not get a cottage.</P>

      <P>We are discussing administration and it is all bound up with that.  I do not want to initiate a discussion on local administration.  I am merely giving that as an example because as you know, Sir, as a member of a local authority, the members are denied any voice in the selection of tenants for cottages or the methods by which they should be selected.  I do not think that this is the time to discuss this Bill in a Parliament which is going to be dissolved any day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister wound up by saying that it was desirable that the Bill should be passed at the earliest possible moment.  One would have expected the Minister to give a reason why it is so desirable and so urgent. This is a matter which can be delayed for a long time, and surely local authorities ought to get an opportunity of expressing their views upon it.  I ask the Minister to postpone this measure and let us deal with any matters or Bills that are urgent between <Col N="63" /> this and the dissolution.  I think also that it is grossly unfair to have a big number of Bills fired at the House dealing with matters that cannot be dealt with efficiently; a volume of business that makes it impossible for Deputies to study the various implications in the many Bills that have been circulated in recent weeks.  Here is a measure that is not urgent and the House is being very unfairly treated by having measures of this sort rushed in this manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a local authority, I thoroughly agree with everything Deputy Hughes has said.  It will be very hard to get persons to go forward at the next elections, because under this Bill they must make a deposit of £10 if they want to contest an election for a county council.  The powers that councils had previously have been taken away under the county management system.  No man will put down £10 to contest an election for the Wexford or any other county council because he will have no powers.  I should like to know why the Minister brought in this Bill?  Is it intended to take away more of the rights of the people?  Are we heading for a dictatorship?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that some people were not suitable for membership of local bodies, but in bodies attached to the county council, I see the Fianna Fáil Party always putting forward persons who were defeated in the county council elections.  They put them on the committee of agriculture, on the vocational committee and on the mental hospital committee.  Such people are not representing the people at all, and their only claim to be on the committees rests on the fact that they are members of the Party. Although they failed to get elected to the county council, they were able to get on these sub-committees.  That should never happen.  I believe that it is not possible for the Minister to say that a demand for this Bill came from anybody except the civil servants who drafted it for him.  This proposal to require farmers and other people in the country to make a deposit before they can go forward as candidates is going <Col N="64" /> to do away with county councils altogether.</P>
    <P>People will say: &ldquo;What is the use of lodging £10 when you would have no power even if you are elected?&rdquo; Members of a county council have not even the power to let a cottage.  The only power left to us at the moment is that of striking the rates.  After that is finished, the county manager can do what he likes with the money.  When you do bring forward a matter at a council meeting, you are told: &ldquo;Oh, that is an executive function; it is not a matter for the council at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The present Government has abolished the system in existence for generations under which people worked voluntarily on county councils and local bodies without county managers and things worked far more smoothly at that time.  At the present moment, if repairs to cottages and road works are not carried out satisfactorily, the members of the council have no power in regard to these matters, but the county manager cannot be all over the county.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the powers we have.  If a candidate is to be required to make a deposit of £10, before he can go forward for election, it will have the effect of preventing many desirable people from offering themselves as members of such bodies.  This Bill is a further step to take away all powers from the people and Deputy Allen will see when the next local elections come along, that it will not be possible to get some of his own colleagues to go forward for election if they are called upon to make a deposit of £10, seeing that they will have no power even if they are elected. Every measure that is brought forward here in connection with local administration has the effect of putting more expense on the people without getting any compensating advantage for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Day after day, we receive complaints from all over the country as to cottages being out of repair and pumps being out of order, but the members of the council have no power to deal with <Col N="65" /> these matters since the county managers were appointed.  We attend council meetings month after month and put forward our complaints, but things are just as bad a month after, because nothing is done.  I think that the Minister should withdraw this Bill and instead try to bring in some measure that will be for the good of the country and will provide employment for our people.  Plenty of work could be provided by housing schemes and important projects of that kind, and we should not be asked to provide for local elections in 1950 when nobody knows who will be in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great pity that those who have spoken against this Bill did not address themselves to the fundamental problem with which it is concerned &mdash; the problem of reviving the old interest which used to exist in regard to the administration of our local affairs and the problem of making the elected members of local authorities an effective element in the whole scheme of local government.  I have given a great deal of thought to this matter and, fortified by the advice which I have had from experienced men, and by my own experience, because I have been very closely associated, directly and indirectly, with local government in this country for a great many years &mdash; as an officer of a local authority, a member of a local authority and as the son of a member of a local authority &mdash; I have come to the conclusion that the fundamental reason, the great reason why public interest in the administration of local affairs has greatly diminished, is because there is not, as the centre of the local community, a person who specifically represents that community on the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear from time to time many pleas made for the revival of the old rural district authorities.  We hear many pleas made for the encouragement of parish councils.  The reason which gave old rural district councils their great value as representative bodies and the reason which would make parish councils valuable as representative bodies, is the fact that they are closely associated with relatively circumscribed areas.  You have only got to extend that idea further until <Col N="66" /> you see that there is a great deal of value indeed to be attached to the fact that you have a person who does specifically represent, not a particular interest, but a particular community. For it is to such a person the people of that district can look to advance their interests on the local authorities, to ensure that their interests are fully regarded by the local authorities and to obtain redress for them, if they have grievances or feel that their interests are being neglected.  That is why I am seeking to end the existing system under which you have individuals, with their own private affairs to look after, responsible for constituencies many times bigger than those for which members of Parliament were responsible in the old days.  There are county electoral areas in this country under the present system which are 50 to 60 miles long and 10 or 12 miles wide &mdash; county areas between 500 and 600 square miles in extent.</P>
    <P>The consequence of that is that very often you have the whole representation of a big area concentrated in a small pocket and that people who might look to their county councillors to do something for them in ensuring that they are adequately served by the county services cannot get in touch with their local county representative at all.  They are even in a worse position than they occupy in regard to Dáil members.  As the converse of that, you have members of county councils, with their own business affairs to attend to, who could not possibly look after the multifarious interests of the individuals in the wide area they are supposed to represent.  The remedy for that is to base the representation on the local authorities henceforth upon areas which are compact enough to enable one person, who is giving voluntary service and has his own interests to look after as well as the public interests, such an area that he can conveniently attend to it, and correspondingly to give to the people in that area one specific person whom they can call upon to look after their interests and who cannot say, &ldquo;I am only one of five representing your area.  I live here but Tom or Séan So-and-so lives much more convenient to you and go to him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When this new system of singlemember <Col N="67" /> constituencies comes into effect we will have, in every county administrative area, county electoral areas of such size that they will be broadly equivalent to parishes in most cases, and you will have a representative for the parish on your county council instead of having, as at present, a person representing what would be the equivalent of a parliamentary constituency in the old days.  I am perfectly certain that when we have these compact electoral areas in the future, when we have this parish representation, that we will have a much more lively and alert interest in local administration than we have at present, because the county councillor can be seen at his parish chapel Sunday after Sunday; he will be in much closer touch with his constituents and he will be much better informed as to the manner in which the local services are being administered throughout the compact area which he represents.</P>
    <P>I believe this proposal will have the effect of stimulating and reviving interest in local government throughout the country.  I believe it is essential to do that if we are to make the managerial system work in a democratic way under the close supervision of the elected representatives of the people.  That is the way I visualise it as working and that is the way in which I want it to work.  That is the only way in which it will be successful and can justify itself.</P>
    <P>As I listened to Deputy Hughes referring to the county managers as creatures of the Minister and, by implication, roundly condemning that system which he has so often strongly championed in this House, I began to think that, as he kneels down at night, Deputy Hughes must offer up a prayer to that merciful Providence which &ldquo;fashioned him hollow on purpose that he might his principles swallow,&rdquo; because there never was so complete a recantation of everything which he has been saying in this House up to the present on the part of any Deputy as we listened to from Deputy Hughes tonight. It was also a revelation of Deputy Hughes's own evaluation of himself, because Deputy Hughes is a member of a county council.  I am not <Col N="68" /> certain whether he is not at the moment the chairman of that county council, but I know he has been chairman of it and I wonder does Deputy Hughes really regard the county manager of Carlow as a mere creature of the Minister who is not in any way responsible to him?  If he does, I suggest that Deputy Hughes ought to read the Managerial Act, because there he will see that the manager is bound to give to the chairman of the county council all the information that is at his disposal in relation to anything he may do on behalf of the county council.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Hughes does not happen to be chairman of Carlow County Council at the moment, I know he has been and I must assume that, as he has put himself up as a fit and worthy representative of the ratepayers of Carlow on that county council, he has from time to time demanded some such information.  I am fairly certain that there may be many things that a manager may do that would require a certain amount of elucidation on occasions and I hope that whenever it seemed to Deputy Hughes to require it to be done, he, in his capacity as chairman of the county council, put such questions to the manager as would satisfy him that everything the manager did was done in the interests of the ratepayers of the county.  It may have happened that Deputy Hughes, as the aforetime boss of the County Council of Carlow and as the aforetime boss of the officers of the County Council of Carlow may have found that the county manager was not going to administer the affairs of Carlow in the particular interests of Deputy Hughes but rather in the interests of the ratepayers of Carlow as a whole, and that at the moment the manager showed he was going to administer the affairs of the county conscientiously and with full regard for everybody's interests as well as the interests of Deputy Hughes, at that moment may we assume that Deputy Hughes's opinion of the county manager and the managerial system changed and, because he found that the officer was no longer going to be his pliant tool, he could only characterise him as a creature of the Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="69" /> But county managers are not the creatures of the Minister.  The Minister does not appoint managers. Managers are appointed by the Local Appointments Commission.  The Minister cannot dismiss them except after due inquiry.  They are appointed by the Local Appointments Commission to be the officers and servants of the local authority and not the servants of the Minister.  If a manager does anything which is, in the opinion of the majority of the council not justified, or anything contrary to the interests of the county council or anything which is wrong from the point of view of the general body of the ratepayers and wrong in the opinion of the majority of the county council, or if he is in any way neglectful of his duties in the opinion of the majority of the county council, that majority can suspend the manager and can ask the Minister to hold an inquiry to investigate the manner in which his duties have been performed. The fact of the matter is this, whatever Deputies Hughes or O'Leary may say, that members of local authorities are completely masters in their own sphere and the county manager deals with executive duties.</P>

      <P>The people who are most outspoken, unrestrained and irresponsible are the very people who go toadying to the manager looking for favours from him and trying to get them by backdoor or backstairs methods, and when they do not get them they come out attacking the manager in an attempt to intimidate and terrorise him.  I want to get rid of all that, and one way I propose to get rid of that is to try to ensure that every district within a county is properly and fully represented on the local authority.  When there is one local representative to whom a community can go and whom a community can hold responsible for ensuring that its interests are looked after we will get a much more alert public authority than we have at present.</P>
      <P>It was said by Deputies, including Deputy Cogan, that the system of elections proposed in the Bill is not a system of proportional representation. Of course it is.  Deputies who said that do not know their own Constitution.  It provides that a person shall be elected by proportional representation and the single transferable vote.  What will happen in many cases in future, I think, is that a great number of candidates will go forward in every area who will appeal to the people on their merits, and you will have minorities coalescing with each other in order to obtain the election of the person generally most acceptable to the local community as a whole.  That is what I mean by proportional representation. You can narrow it down as we are narrowing it down, trying to make people, by exercising not merely one preference but a number of preferences, secure the person most generally representative of the whole community, representative of minorities as well as majorities.  We are giving, in that way, the system of proportional representation which can be applied most effectively to local affairs.</P>

    <P>I was astonished at the arguments&mdash; or rather the only argument &mdash; advanced here against a Second Reading of this Bill.  Those people pleaded that we were already incompetent to legislate. Those very same Deputies passed a <Col N="71" /> Bill dealing with the representation of the people which is the most fundamental issue with which they can deal.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that a general election would follow in a certain eventuality.  The Second Reading of that Bill was taken after it was clear that this general election was in the offing.  Nobody contended that we should not pass it or that we were incompetent to pass a fundamental measure because a general election was in contemplation, but it was generally conceded that we should get it through as soon as possible.  The House has passed by an overwhelming majority the Second Reading of a Bill to revise and amend the present method of electing the Seanad.  Of course, there were one or two dissentients to that Bill, but the majority of the House in favour of accepting the Seanad Bill, was, as I have said, overwhelming, notwithstanding the fact that a reasoned amendment had been put down on the Second Reading.  A number of other measures have gone through the House within the past few days, and surely this is an indication that the House held itself perfectly competent to deal with any measure, as it is under the Constitution until it is dissolved.  As the competency of the Dáil to legislate for this State does not expire until the Dáil is dissolved, there is no reason why we should put our faculties in cold storage and as this measure is highly desirable and likely to be conducive to good, it should be passed and passed before the Dáil is dissolved.  It should be passed because as the law stands we are going to have local elections in the normal way in 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the 20 years I have been in the House everybody in the House has conceded that when a general election has taken place or is in contemplation we should not have an election for local <Col N="72" /> authorities within the same year.  That was conceded by all Parties in the House, not once, but on every occasion on which there was a possibility of that occurring.  We are going to have the general election next year, perhaps in the early part of the year, and in the normal course we would also have had an election for local authorities next year.  When the new Dáil re-assembles we will have all the financial business normally taken in the spring, all the Estimates and the Budget, and a number of other measures which have not been proceeded with now, such as that dealing with the control of prices, so it would be highly desirable if this measure were passed at the earliest opportunity.  I think that the legislative programme in front of the Dáil should urge us to deal with the issue of the elections before they take place and it would be better to dispose of it now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to encourage and assist private building for the classes, other than those already catered for by the local authorities, who most require financial assistance to provide themselves with houses.  It will also confer additional powers in respect of housing on the Minister and on the local authorities; and it will amend existing housing legislation in a way which experience has shown to be necessary for the purpose of conserving existing houses and expediting the promotion of new housing schemes.</P>
      <P>The Bill has thus two broad aims: to encourage private enterprise to provide houses in relief of the acute housing scarcity and, to remove certain legal and other obstacles impeding local authorities' housing programmes.  The housing drive inaugurated in 1932 proved eminently successful until the world-wide diversion of resources of money, manpower and materials from constructive activity during the war years slowed it down.  We are resuming, as far as present conditions permit, the partially interrupted realisation of that policy.  Our immediate efforts are directed to attain as speedily as possible pre-war production standards and from that to press on to the goal which this Government has always had in mind &mdash; the provision of an adequate minimum standard of housing accommodation throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are something over 600,000 habitable houses in the country.  Of these, about 140,000 or more than onefifth of the whole have been built or reconstructed since 1932.  Everybody appreciates that this was a notable achievement.  It is in fact unique in the record of housing endeavour anywhere. A world tragedy, for which this Government cannot be held responsible &mdash;even by members of the Opposition&mdash;<Col N="76" /> halted that constructive social progress over the period from 1939 to 1945.  Each of those intervening years saw a new arrear added to those which had accumulated over the preceding generations. In each of them also not a few of our houses became uninhabitable through decay and obsolescence, against which in the existing world conditions we were powerless to provide. Other factors helped to swell the present demand, among them, and the most important the growth of new families.  In the light of these factors we have revised the estimate of our total housing requirements, and we now fix the figure at about 100,000 dwellings.  Of these probably about 60,000 are required to meet the needs of those urban and rural classes whose dwellings are normally provided by the local authorities, and the balance of about 40,000 for those of other classes.</P>
    <P>To provide 100,000 dwellings at a speed which the acuteness of the housing scarcity demands would be a formidable, task even in normal times. But these are not normal times.  The world disorganisation consequent upon years of destructive war manifests itself not only in global shortages of food, fuel, clothing and houses, but in monetary crises, in labour troubles and in losses in production.  While we, in this country have been comparatively fortunate, we cannot but be affected in various degrees by economic stresses elsewhere.  Not the least important effect is an inability to secure all the skilled labour and materials which our housing effort could absorb.  The flow of materials is inadequate and uncertain; there is a continuing scarcity of timber; the fuel crisis of last spring led to a partial interruption of supplies of cement and steel; and rainwater goods and other equipment are difficult to obtain.  Even if the building effort were not grievously impeded by these crippling shortages of material, it would be drastically restricted by the present insufficiency of skilled labour.</P>
    <P>In Dublin City, for example, the contractors engaged on corporation housing schemes could employ considerably more than the present number of brick-layers, carpenters and plasterers, if such tradesmen were available.  In <Col N="77" /> the country areas the position is no better.  Of 1,317 labourers' cottages advertised for tenders during the past 12 months or so satisfactory tenders were received for only 245.  Because of shortages, work on only 140 of these had commenced by 30th September of this year.</P>
    <P>These are the conditions against which we have been struggling and must struggle in getting the housing programme under way.  It is evident that no amount of Government activity, or activity on the part of local authorities or private enterprise will enable the programme to be undertaken at the rate we would wish if adequate materials and labour are not available to get the houses built.  The housing problem, let me emphasise, is no longer a financial one.  Under this Government it never was a financial one.  It is pre-eminently one of materials and skilled labour; and as these become available in increasing supply our housing programme will go forward with ever-accelerating speed, for our preparations are well in advance of the present capacity of the building industry to undertake the work.</P>
    <P>With such materials and men as we have, however, we are making steady progress, thanks to the continuous urge on the local authorities which has emanated from my Department.  The number of local authority houses in course of construction was 2,212 on 31st March of this year; at the end of August it was 2,433; at the end of September, 2,556.  In the field of private enterprise the number of grant-aided houses being built on 31st March of this year was 1,394; but at the end of September the figures had increased to 2,041; the corresponding figures for houses in process of reconstruction were 1,932 and 2,019.</P>
    <P>Concomitant with all this, every effort is being made to ensure that the local authorities' share of total building activity will match the predominant housing needs of workers both in town and country.  For instance, we are investigating the possibilities of prefabrication as a means of by-passing labour shortages in the execution of housing schemes.  Again, as a means of getting ahead with our programme, <Col N="78" /> local authorities are being encouraged to carry out housing schemes by direct labour; and I have recently asked them to lay in stocks of timber for use in future schemes.  Some of the larger authorities indeed have been asked to buy other materials and equipment, as well as timber.</P>
    <P>I cannot on this Bill speak about the arrangements which will represent what I may describe as the &ldquo;new norm&rdquo; of local authorities' housing finance.  There is not yet sufficient evidence of stability in prices or other factors which would enable the Government to make &ldquo;normal&rdquo; arrangements. But since May, 1946, we have established the Transition Development Fund, and the local authorities have been aware also of the Government's intention to reduce to 2½ per cent. the interest rate on issues from the Local Loans Fund, and to extend to 50 years the repayment period for such loans.  In these several ways the local authorities were made aware at an early date that the Government were prepared to make their due contributions towards the added cost of their housing projects, and since then there has been, I am glad to say, a continuous acceleration in the progress of local authority schemes.</P>
    <P>I have given this preliminary review of the general housing position in order to impress upon the House that, though the deficiency in accommodation is great and growing, the effort to reduce it is well under way and is gathering momentum.  I should like to stress also that because of the shortages of materials and skilled labour to which I have referred, the costs of house building are extremely high, and that the Government is sensible of the fact that these now bear most heavily on the middle income classes, whose efforts to provide themselves with homes are at the moment unaided.  And, finally, while the housing shortage affects every class of the community, it is recognised that it is most acutely felt by particular sections, such as newly-married couples.  Some of the financial and other provisions of this Bill are designed to deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>So far as the existing system of private building grants is concerned, it is admitted that it is quite inadequate <Col N="79" /> to meet present-day needs, and the Government has decided that a new scheme of grant in aid of certain kinds of private building should be introduced to replace it.  Heretofore grants to private persons ranged from £40 for reconstruction work to £70 for new buildings.  These grants have been differentiated in amount on the basis of occupation; in rural areas up to £60 or £70 was paid for new houses for agricultural labourers and small farmers, while others might receive £45.  Reconstruction grants were limited to agricultural labourers and small farmers.  Grants of £70 to £80 could be made to public utility societies building houses for occupation by agricultural labourers and small farmers. In urban areas a public utility society building houses for letting to members of the working classes would qualify for a grant of £150 for each house, or two-ninths of the cost, whichever was less. Such grants were payable as to two-thirds by the State and one-third by the urban authority.</P>
    <P>Finally, grants might be paid both by the State and the local authority to persons reconditioning houses in urban areas in pursuance of a repairs notice served on them by the urban authority, the grants being payable only in respect of houses suitable for occupation by members of the working classes, and being limited in amount to £40 or one-quarter the cost of the work, whichever is less, from either source.</P>
    <P>The grants under the new scheme will be considerably larger than under the old, and they will be payable in respect of houses built in both urban and rural areas.  But, perhaps, the first thing to be emphasised in regard to them is that no grants will be made to the purely speculative builder, i.e., the man who builds houses for sale to purely chance customers.  To qualify for grants under the scheme, the houses must be built by a public utility society for its members for letting, or to the specific orders of individuals for their own occupation.  With the present acute and widespread housing shortage the speculative builder <i>per se</i> requires no encouragement, for he is operating in a seller's market where he can very largely demand his own price.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> For new building, the grants will range in amount from £125 for a three-roomed house erected by a private individual for his own occupation to £400, payable over a period of ten years, in respect of a five-roomed house built and let by a person or company.  Within this range, grants of differing amounts may be made according as the house is being built by or on behalf of a private person for his own occupation, or by a public utility society for a member, or by a person for letting, and depending on the size of the house and the presence or absence of piped water and sewerage facilities.  For details of the grants, I would refer Deputies to Part III of the Bill, and to the Second, Third and Fourth Schedules.  It will be noted that the grants to persons building houses for letting are to be payable in instalments over a period of ten years.</P>
    <P>The amounts payable in respect of houses built for owner-occupation will, as I have said, be differentiated on the basis of the availability of piped water supply and sewerage.  The reason for the differential, which amounts to £50. is that houses incorporating plumbing and sanitary fittings, bathrooms, wash-hand basins and other amenities, customary in houses which can be connected with water supply and sewerage systems, are more costly than houses of the same size and type, built in districts not so serviced.  The differentiation will also tend to rectify the effects of dissimilarities in building costs in urban and rural areas.</P>
    <P>Certain important restrictions will govern the payment of the new grants. Let me emphasise again that they are limited to persons building for their own occupation, to public utility societies building for occupation by their members (which, in effect, is the same thing) and to persons or public utility societies building for letting.  As I have already said, there is no provision in the schemes for grants to persons building houses for sale.  Furthermore, the grants will be payable only in respect of houses containing at least three rooms, having between 500 and 1,250 square feet of floor area, and which are begun after the 1st November of this year and completed before the 1st April, 1950.  There is, I might mention, <Col N="81" /> one exception from the general application of the last condition: in the case of houses built by persons for letting, grant may be made in respect of houses begun after 1st November, 1945.  The grants-in-aid of houses for letting will be made jointly by local authorities and the Minister.  I thought it appropriate that local authorities should assist directly in the work which is so nearly related to their own housing activities. Private individuals, companies and public utility societies who erect houses for letting at moderate rents are, in effect, assuming part of the heavy burden which local housing authorities have to carry, at the moment, practically unaided.</P>
    <P>Reconstruction and repair grants, whether for urban or rural houses, will be doubled in amount, and in the case of those payable to agricultural labourers and small farmers, the qualifying valuation limit is being raised from £25 to £35.</P>
    <P>In accordance with existing practice with regard to rates remission on grantaided houses, houses in respect of which grants have been made by the Minister, but not by the local authority, will be assessed to rates at only one-third of their valuations for a period of seven years, and this will apply likewise to the valuations of reconstructed premises.</P>
    <P>The Bill furthermore contains a provision, similar to that embodied in existing housing legislation, that no grant may be paid where it is shown that, in the erection of an otherwise eligible house, labour has been employed on terms less advantageous than recognised trade union standards for the district.</P>
    <P>These proposals should go far to encourage and assist persons with moderate incomes, a class whose needs are not served by the direct housing activities of local authorities, to provide houses for themselves either individually or in combination with others as members of societies.  The proposals should also encourage persons who may have the capital to provide houses for letting at reasonable rents, and thus co-operate to a greater extent in this very essential part of the <Col N="82" /> housing programme.  The province of the local authority in the sphere of housing, the vital function it must discharge, is the rehousing of the worker who is badly housed, the replacement of old unhealthy working-class dwellings with new houses, and, in a word, the establishment of a basic standard of adequacy in the housing accommodation of the economically weakest section of the community.</P>
    <P>The private grants scheme formulated in this Bill is intended for the man who can and will pay a moderate rent for a house, but who cannot buy one; or, alternatively, who might be able to build or buy a reasonablypriced house, but not one at present-day prices.  The class I have in mind includes the white-collar wage-earner, low-salaried employees and small middle-man and tradesman; but it also includes the better paid artisan, the small farmer, the comfortably-off rural worker and the middle income group generally.</P>
    <P>Building is, of course, going ahead already to the limit of our resources in materials and manpower, but this new scheme of grants is intended to stimulate, within the limits set by the capacity of the building industry, the production of the smaller and cheaper type of house.  Our aim is to divert, if we can, a large part of the present private house-building activity to the provision of homes of a size and price-range suited to the pockets of the intermediate class.  For the person building a house for his own occupation, the grant will reduce the capital cost to an appreciable extent and help to bridge the gap between the cost of the house and the proportion of that cost which he may be able to borrow.  The grants should also provide an incentive for persons and public utility societies to erect houses for letting at reasonable rents and thus to re-enter a field and share a responsibility which has been too long and to much too great an extent left to local authorities. I might add that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will give a high priority, in the issue of building licences, to houses for which grants will be payable.</P>
    <P>In urban areas the proposed increase <Col N="83" /> in the repairs grants payable to owners should aid in conserving existing dwellings suitable for workers, and in reducing correspondingly the overwhelming demand on local authority houses.  In rural areas the proposed grants to small farmers and agricultural labourers should have a somewhat similar effect; a house properly reconstructed is given a new lease of life, so that to prolong its habitability in present circumstances is a practical alternative to the erection of a new house.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of the general recognition that to-day speculative building is not in need of any adventitious aid, grants to persons building houses for sale to others will be discontinued as from 1st November, 1947.  However, the old grant of £45 per house, which was limited to houses being built in rural areas, will be paid in respect of houses begun prior to the 1st November, 1947, and completed before 1st April, 1950.  The Bill also provides for the discontinuance in the same way of other grants which are at present payable in respect of house building and reconstruction, with the same reservation in respect of work begun before the 1st November, 1947, and completed before the 1st April, 1950.</P>
    <P>As the law stands, a grant, though promised to be paid in respect of a house begun in a rural area which later becomes included in an urban area through boundary extension, cannot be paid.  This is a manifest hardship and the Bill contains provisions to remedy it.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of private enterprise housing, I should perhaps mention certain amendments of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts which will be found in Part VI of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts at present authorise local authorities to advance money to persons intending to build or buy houses, for their own occupation, the market value of which does not exceed £1,000. This limiting value has hitherto been set by statute and was fixed at its present level by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931.  The original Act, passed in 1899, fixed it at <Col N="84" /> £400 (four hundred pounds).  Section 56 of the Bill incorporates a new procedure for determining the maximum market value for houses coming within the scope of the Acts.  Under this procedure the figure will be fixed in future by Order of the Minister for Local Government, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  This method will enable the market value limit to be more rapidly adjusted in accordance with a rise or fall in building costs, house prices, and other factors.  I may say in this connection that it is my intention, as soon as the Bill becomes law, to raise the maximum limit from its present level to £1,750, and I have the assurance of the Minister for Finance that he is prepared to concur in such an Order.</P>
    <P>The interest rate for the purposes of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts is fixed for each local authority by Order of the Minister for Local Government, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  The rate is almost invariably fixed at ½ per cent. over that at which the local authority has borrowed for the purposes of the Acts.  New Orders must be made with every fluctuation in the latter rate.  It is proposed in the Bill that the lending rate should vary automatically with the borrowing rate, with a constant margin of ½ per cent. between, which should cover the normal running expenses of the local authority under the Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Small Dwellings Act, 1899, provides that where in any local area the excess of annual expenditure over income under the Acts involves a charge on the rates greater than ld. in the £ in an urban area or county borough, or ½d. in a county, the operation of the Acts shall be suspended for at least five years.  In certain areas the local authorities have had to suspend the operation of the Acts because of the fact that, while the Acts allow advances to private persons to be repaid before the agreed time, local authorities themselves cannot as a rule make excess repayment of principal without premium or fine.  During and after the war many house-purchasers found themselves in a position to repay outstanding loans under the Acts, and a number of local authorities accumulated capital repayments which were used in <Col N="85" /> effecting a corresponding reduction in their own indebtedness.  The fines exacted by lenders, however, increased the local authorities expenses under the Acts with a result that in particular years the statutory limit was exceeded. It is proposed that in future these fines should not be counted as expenses, so that existing suspensions will be abolished and the Acts again become operative.</P>
    <P>The Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts have been, especially from 1932 onwards, a material factor in the solution of the housing problem.  They provide a means whereby credit-worthy borrowers of limited means can obtain capital advances on reasonable terms for the purchase or erection of the smaller type of house.  They have particularly benefited that class of the community which, while ineligible for local authority houses, finds that house provision through the commercial lending agencies is beyond its resources. The usefulness of the Acquisition Acts should be considerably enhanced by the new power to adapt the scope of the Acts to the requirements of the market situation and by the reduced rate of interest; so that persons wishing to become owner-occupiers should find in the Acts, as now amended, a very considerable measure of help.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the general housing programme of local authorities.  Both the Government and the local bodies themselves are alive to the importance of the part those bodies have to play in the solution of our housing difficulties. As early as 1943, all local authorities were asked (a) to survey the extent of the housing deficiency in their areas; (b) to proceed with the acquisition of suitable and sufficient sites for the coming housing drive; and (c) to push ahead with the preparation of contract documents for post-war schemes.  They were asked also to consider getting development works under way in good time.  As a result of this appeal for the exercise of foresight, approved sites have been acquired for 17,339 dwellings; roads, water and sewerage services are available on many of those sites.  Plans have been approved and are ready for contract for 5,673 dwellings; and plans are well advanced for 1,480 dwellings. <Col N="86" /> In short, preparations have been made for as many dwellings as could be commenced with reasonable prospects of completion in the next two or three years.</P>
    <P>I may now deal with those parts of the present Bill which affect the powers, duties and responsibilities of local authorities as providers of working-class houses.  I would first refer to an important new power sought in Section 26 of the Bill which will enable specified local authorities to be required to provide houses to be reserved for a particular class.  What I have in mind is the erection of houses specially for newly-married couples.</P>
    <P>The problem of providing housing accommodation for this class has assumed serious dimensions in recent years.  The marriage rate took an upward trend during the war years and continues at a relatively high level; the amount of new accommodation becoming available has, on the other hand, declined sharply.  While the scarcity of suitable houses and flats affects all classes it is most keenly felt by workers beginning married life who have no homes of their own; these cannot readily look to private enterprise to furnish them with the moderately priced accommodation they want, nor, under the law as it stands, to the local authorities who are catering mainly for larger families living in overcrowded or unhealthy conditions.</P>
    <P>It will not, I think, be contested that some part of the resources of local authorities might with great advantage be devoted to the housing needs of newly-weds.  It is desirable that as many as possible of these young couples should begin married life in proper surroundings; a good house, a house in which the young couple can take a certain pride, would be a potent factor in the eradication or prevention of that slum mentality which bad housing conditions so easily engender.</P>
    <P>Since needs are greatest in the cities, it is proposed, as a beginning, to require only the local authorities in the Cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford and the Borough of Dun Laoighaire to provide the special houses.  Two types of house are envisaged: Class A for tradesmen and <Col N="87" /> workers generally who are in a position to pay an inclusive and economic rent of about £1 10s. 0d. weekly; and Class B for less well paid workers.  The rent in the latter case would be about £1 per week.  The proportion of Class A and Class B houses would be determined by the number of applications received for each class.  The houses would contain two bedrooms and have the most up-to-date equipment.</P>
    <P>No subsidy either from the State or the rates will be given in the case of the class A house.  For class B houses it is proposed to meet the deficiency between the capital cost of the house and the capitalised value of the net rent by lump sum grants from State funds up to a maximum grant of £250 per house.</P>
    <P>In order to prevent overcrowding of these special houses (which, as I have said, will have two bedrooms) it is proposed that a certain number of ordinary local authority houses would be made available to which the tenants would be transferred after a specified period (say, five years) subject to their having given satisfaction as tenants of the special houses.  These ordinary houses would be eligible for State subsidy up to 33? per cent. of loan charges on £450 in the county boroughs and the borough of Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>The number of special houses built in any year must be limited by reason of the urgent need to re-house families living in unfit dwellings and it is accordingly intended that special houses should, for the present, let me emphasise that&mdash;for the present, be restricted to about 15 per cent of the local authority's annual output.  As the capacity of the industry grows the proportion of reserved houses may be increased, provided the experiment has justified itself.  In the case of Dublin the number on this basis of reserved houses should be roughly 150 in the coming 12 months.  I contemplate that the scheme would operate for a period of five years in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Assuming that the Dublin Corporation built an average of 2,000 houses a year over the next five years, the total number of special houses available would <Col N="88" /> amount to 1,500 at the end of that period, and may be more, and will, I hope, continue to increase as time goes on, until want of a house is no longer an impediment to an early and provident marriage.  During the subsequent year&mdash;during the sixth year after the initiation of the scheme &mdash; an average of about 20 per cent. of the special houses would, we estimate, become vacant for further newly-weds.  Allowing for deaths, unsatisfactory tenancies, etc., the number of ordinary corporation houses required to rehouse the persons to be transferred after a five-year tenancy from the special houses would amount to from 15 to 20 per cent. per annum.  But naturally the whole question of reserving ordinary houses will be reviewed from time to time in the light of the experience gained in the operation of the experimental scheme.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill contains a number of provisions which will enlarge the powers of local authorities in relation to the preservation of dwelling accommodation in their areas, and in relation to the tenants or prospective tenants of houses provided by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>A certain wastage of dwelling accommodation takes place through the demolition of habitable houses to make way for other structures, or through the conversion of houses into offices or factories.  It is desirable, therefore, in present circumstances, to give local authorities, who are responsible for housing accommodation in their areas, power to check this process.  It is, therefore, proposed in Sections 7 to 9 of the Bill to prohibit, under penalty, the demolition, or use otherwise than as dwellings, or habitable houses, unless the written permission of the local authority has been obtained. Provision is made for appeal to the Minister in the event of refusal, and for excluding from the scope of the sections houses whose demolition or conversion is required by statute or for a statutory purpose.  In 1919, when the housing situation was broadly similar to what it is now, similar powers were vested temporarily in local authorities by Section 6 of the Housing (Additional Powers) Act of that year.</P>
    <P>Sections 10 to 13 implement a recommendation <Col N="89" /> of the Dublin Housing Inquiry Committee, 1939-1943, regarding the licensing of houses let or to be let for occupation by more than one family.  It is proposed that the section giving effect to these recommendations should apply not only to Dublin but to the County Boroughs of Cork, Limerick and Waterford, and to the Borough of Dún Laoghaire as well, and that its provisions may be applied to any other area by order of the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>In connection with the new provisions I might mention that the Dublin Corporation's by-laws do impose a duty, under penalty, of fine, on the owner of a house to notify the corporation that he has let a house to more than one family; upon which the corporation can specify their requirements as regards repairs, sanitation, etc., in connection with the building and dwelling, as registered.  But apart from the fact that many owners fail to register, the system is not effective in improving tenement conditions inasmuch as the corporation's powers can be exercised only where the house has already become a tenement.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the new provisions should apply to all unfurnished lettings, irrespective of rents, and to furnished lettings where the inclusive rent does not exceed what a person of the working classes might be likely to pay, as determined from time to time by the local authority.  The local authority would be empowered to attach conditions regarding prior repairs, etc., to the issue of a licence.  Licences would come up for revision annually.</P>
    <P>Section 14 proposes to empower local authorities to secure information from tenants or intending tenants of their houses.  The type of information envisaged is that which would be required in connection with the introduction or operation of differential renting system. It will enable local authorities to judge economic circumstances of tenants and their families.</P>
    <P>Systems of differential renting whereby the rents of houses are adjusted to the means of the tenants are in operation in a large proportion of corporation houses in Cork County Borough and to a limited extent in a <Col N="90" /> few other areas.  The Committee of Inquiry into the Housing of the Working Classes of the City of Dublin, 1939-1943, recommended the introduction of a differential renting system or, more accurately, a system of differential rent rebates, in Dublin County Borough.</P>
    <P>There are many difficulties attending differential renting and the question of introducing such a system in Dublin would be decided only after full examination of its probable effects on existing and future tenants, on the financing of housing schemes, and on the corporation's housing programme as a whole.  It is essential for the purpose of this examination that an accurate picture should be obtained of the rent-paying capacity of the present occupants of corporation houses, and this is the object of the present proposal.</P>
    <P>Sections 25 and 31 propose to give comprehensive powers to the Minister for Local Government to make regulations to secure the proper letting and good management of local authority houses.  Existing powers relate mainly to houses provided after 1932.  It is desirable that local housing estates should be treated as units and that a single code should be framed applying uniformly to all the houses provided by a local authority.</P>
    <P>It is also intended that in the letting of houses due regard shall be had to the character and industry of applicants, as well as to their occupations, family circumstance and housing conditions. The regulations would also enable local authorities to revise, in the case of re-lettings, rents fixed under old regulations; and to reserve a certain proportion of their houses for a particular class, such as newly-married couples, and for tenants called upon to vacate their reserved houses.</P>
    <P>The priority for single-room families laid down in the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, has been preserved, so far as is compatible with the new proposals contained in the Bill.  This priority will be found in sub-section (5) of Section 6 of that Act, which requires a preference to be given wherever practicable, to families in single-rooms where a <Col N="91" /> member of the family is suffering from tuberculosis or one or more of the children are over 16 years or where the dwelling has been condemned as unfit.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the regulations made in respect of cottages provided under the Labourers Acts should ensure that farm workers will have first preference in the allocation of tenancies. This provision has become necessary as a result of the gradual widening of the legal meaning of the expression &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; to cover practically every type of worker living outside a town.  As a consequence the greater number of claims to cottages are put forward by persons who, though technically within the meaning of the term &ldquo;agricultural labourers&rdquo; do not do agricultural work; and where as hitherto the urgency of the claim is determined almost entirely by the housing conditions under which the applicant lives, it may and does occur that the genuine agricultural worker is passed over in favour of some claimant doing less essential work or no work at all.  The importance of agricultural production to our national economy justifies insistence on the priority for agricultural labourers which it was the intention of the original Labourers Acts code to accord.</P>
    <P>The expression &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; though extremely wide in its application has not included hitherto farm workers who work otherwise than for hire on the family holding, and a considerable class of agricultural labourers is, therefore, cut off from the benefits of the Labourers Acts.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to rectify this anomaly by extending the definition of &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; for the purpose of the Acts to include male persons who habitually work on the family holding. Whenever the farmer leaves the family dwelling to his son he can then be appointed tenant of a labourer's cottage under the scheme.  It is hoped that this provision may thereby contribute towards the removal of what is recognised to be one of the major obstacles in the way of early marriages in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Workers on the family holding are <Col N="92" /> not, I should however emphasise, to be regarded as &ldquo;agricultural labourers&rdquo; for the purposes of a purchase scheme under the Labourers Act, 1936.  The cottage built under the section in the present Act should be available for an ordinary agricultural labourer in the event of neither the farmer nor the farmer's son continuing the tenancy.</P>
    <P>Certain sections of this measure which will be found in Part III of the Bill have a bearing on the important question of local housing finance.  As Deputies may be aware, housing subsidy is paid by the State to local authorities in the form of a percentage of charges incurred by them in repayment of loans raised for housing urban and rural workers.  Under Section 6 of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, the subsidy can be so paid for a period of not more than 35 years.  As announced some time ago by the Minister for Finance, it is intended that housing loans issued from the Local Loans Fund should in future be repayable over a period of 50 years.  It becomes necessary, therefore, to extend the subsidy period to bring it into line with the new loan repayment period.  A proposal to this effect is contained in Section 19 of the Bill.  That section also provides for certain adjustments in relation to the payment of subsidy on some old housing loans.</P>
    <P>Up to the year 1935 many loans obtained from the Local Loans Fund by urban authorities were repayable over a period of 37 years, during the first two of which interest only was paid. Subsidy, however, was paid in respect of this two-year period in accordance with determinations made by the Minister under Article 7 of the Housing (Loan Charges Contributions) Regulations, 1932.  As the total subsidy period was limited by law to 35 years, these local authorities would have to bear unaided the loan charges in respect of the last two years of the 37-year repayment period.  It is proposed in this Bill to make the extension of the subsidy period retrospective so as to enable subsidy to be paid for the full repayment period of 37 years in these cases.  Urban authorities borrowing <Col N="93" /> from the Local Loans Fund under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts pay interest charges only on advances during a &ldquo;waiting period&rdquo; of two years immediately following the date of the mortgage deed, by virtue of Section 1 (2) of the Housing of the Working Classes (Ireland) Act, 1908.  This concession is not available in connection with loans obtained otherwise than from the Local Loans Fund.  Now that the rate of interest payable in respect of loans issued from the Local Loans Fund has been reduced to 2½ per cent. and an extension of the repayment period is proposed, the &ldquo;waiting period&rdquo; can be discontinued.  Section 1 (2) of the 1908 Act to which I have referred has accordingly been included in the list of repeals in the First Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 19 also makes some amendment in the conditions attaching to housing subsidy, in order to provide that the assistance payable in respect of houses erected for persons displaced by demolition orders and other operations of the local authority under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts will also be payable in respect of the re-housing of persons displaced from houses condemned under certain enactments dealing with dangerous buildings, or which have collapsed or otherwise become suddenly unfit.</P>
    <P>Section 37 contains a proposal for the exemption of local authorities from the requirements of Section 201 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, for certain purposes connected with housing.  That section laid down a number of rules to be observed by sanitary authorities in the making of contracts.  Those rules govern contracts entered into for housing, including the purchase of materials.  The form of contract is outlined, and requirements as to advertisements and so on are laid down.  These requirements are wise and useful in the case of ordinary contracting, but they unnecessarily hamper a local authority in the execution of urgent work in present circumstances. In the carrying out of a housing scheme by means of direct labour, quick decision and action are necessary on the part of the local authority in connection with the purchase of large <Col N="94" /> quantities of materials.  The question of having a certain proportion of housing schemes carried out by direct labour has been given a good deal of consideration.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Housing Inquiry Committee recommended that the Corporation should establish an organisation for the erection of houses by this method.  I am satisfied that in Dublin and other local areas direct labour would at present provide a valuable alternative to the usual contract method for erecting houses for the working classes.  In a number of districts contractors are very slow to tender for this class of work.  Accordingly an expansion in direct-labour building schemes has become imperative if the execution of our housing programme is not to continue to be impeded by the present inability of private enterprise to meet the demands upon it.</P>
    <P>Interest at 5 per cent. is payable on the compensation money where, in the case of lands compulsorily acquired for housing purposes, the local authority enters on the lands before the compensation has actually been paid.  It is proposed under Section 27 of the measure to reduce this rate to 3 per cent. as being more in keeping with the present-day trend in interest rates. I should mention that 3 per cent. is the rate specified in recent statutes such as the Tuberculosis (Establishment of Sanatoria) Act, 1945.</P>
    <P>The existing provision for the remuneration of solicitors for work done under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts is contained in Section 48 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931.  It has been found to work out somewhat expensively in the case of registered land.  And Section 28 of this Bill will replace Section 48 of the 1931 Act, and will rectify that position.  Local authorities have powers of entry on lands which are in process of compulsory acquisition.  The powers of rural authorities, vested in them by Section 4 of the Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1896, are less effective, however, than those of urban authorities and it is proposed in Section 32 of this Bill to assimilate rural to urban powers in this regard.</P>
    <P>Certain doubts have arisen about the <Col N="95" /> validity of county council's borrowing powers under the Labourers Acts for certain purposes connected with those Acts.  It is proposed in effect under Section 33 to re-enact the old borrowing provisions, but to define them more comprehensively.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to the fact that the repeal of the old provisions, Section 17 of the Labourers Act, 1883, carries with it the removal of the old limits on the poundage in the rate which might be levied for rural housing purposes.  Rating limits of this kind have practically all disappeared. The latest to go was the limitation on the libraries rate, which was removed by the Local Government Act, 1946.  I might mention, in order to remove any misunderstanding, that there is no statutory limit on the rate which may be levied for urban housing.</P>
    <P>Section 38 and 39 contain a very important proposal to enable the Minister to divide compulsory purchase Orders under the Labourers Acts into opposed and unopposed parts with a view to having the unopposed part of an Order proceeded with at once.  Compulsory purchase Orders under these Acts commonly cover a large number of sites, and, heretofore, where an objection has been lodged to one or more of these sites and pursued in my Department or in the courts, the whole Order has been held up while the necessity for, or validity of, the Order as it affects those sites is investigated and decided.  Protracted delay has occurred and, if left undealt with, might continue to occur on this account, and I propose to bring in this procedure in the interests of speed.  A similar provision was embodied in the old compulsory acquisition procedure under the Labourers Acts, which was replaced by a new system in 1932.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the main features of the Bill, and summarised the reasons which lie behind its most important proposals.  I would ask the House to give the Bill speedy consideration, so that there may be as little delay as possible in utilising its provisions and in effecting its enactment.  I should have wished that time would have permitted of a thorough overhaul of the present <Col N="96" /> mass of housing legislation, and the preparation of a codifying measure em bodying what is worth preserving of the multitude of provisions which has accumulated over the past half-century or more, together with such new provisions as might commend themselves in the light of our experience, but I am sure the House will agree that it is more advisable that an interim measure like the present Bill should be introduced now when aid is most sorely needed, than that we should wait for the preparation and enactment of a more comprehensive measure.  Consolidation, moreover, should aim at some degree of permanence, and that is a quality which the uncertainty of the present situation with regard to housing costs and house building capacity renders it exceedingly difficult to capture. A transition period like the present demands transitional methods, a more flexible attitude to housing problems, and a rapid adjustment of means and methods to the exigencies of a developing and evolving situation.  The time must come, however, sooner or later, when the housing code must be re-fashioned, unified and modernised to suit what will emerge as the normal conditions of the future.</P>
    <P>By way of forecast, it is my intention to publish at an early date a White Paper, in which the whole position regarding housing and the various parts of the programme now projected for the provision of new houses, will be reviewed in detail.  It will include a convenient summary of all the facilities available for local authorities and others erecting houses, including the new scheme of grants provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The country does not want either White Papers on housing or codification; it wants housing. We have been asking for the last two or three years for some indication on the part of the Government of what their approach was towards the housing problem.  More than 12 months ago, with Deputy Costello, I tabled a motion asking that a joint committee of the Dáil and Seanad should be forthwith appointed for the purpose of reporting on the matter.  Originally I think we asked to have a report made by 1st February last for the information of <Col N="97" /> the Oireachtas and the building industry generally giving a general outline of the housing problem existing in cities and urban areas particularly, and the service required immediately from the building industry to solve the problem. That motion was put on the Order Paper more than 12 months ago and no attempt of any kind was made to facilitate the House by setting up a joint committee to put a picture of the housing problem before the Oireachtas and the building industry.  The Minister now comes forward with certain financial proposals.  On 4th July last, the Dáil was asked for permission to have the measure printed and circulated. It was not until some time well on in November and after the Taoiseach had announced that the Dáil would be dissolved at the earliest possible date that we got this measure.</P>

The Minister surely does not expect that the House will discuss these details now.  He surely cannot expect from anybody in this House anything but a gesture telling him to take this measure.  We shall have an opportunity of discussing it and reviewing the situation in very different circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certain that the Minister will not, but I do not want to go into that.  We have a housing problem which the Minister has not made any attempt to delineate.  That problem must be dealt with by the building industry.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has had from seven to ten different committees working for the last two years dealing with various branches of the work that requires to be done by the building industry in order that houses may be <Col N="98" /> built.  They have not shed a single ray of light on any aspect of the problem. That may not be their fault; it may be the fault of the Government. At any rate, the building industry has a main function in the matter.  The Minister is offering them what they have been looking for for some time past.  He is offering them the present Government's mind on what financial facilities should be made available for them.</P>
      <P>All I wish to do is to tell him to take his Bill and to look at what is happening. At present materials urgently required for housing are being used for all kinds of buildings other than housing, and men urgently required for housing are engaged on all kinds of buildings other than housing.  One of the first things the Minister ought to do when he gets this measure is to see that they are diverted from some of the unnecessary and luxury building which is going on at present to providing houses for the working classes and the middle classes.  The Bill before us is one that can be judged only when we see what happens under it.  The Government have decided that they require the dissolution of this Dáil and a new Parliament will have an opportunity of reviewing this matter and of reviewing the work done under it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that the Minister did not take the opportunity of introducing this Bill much sooner. We then would have perhaps more adequate opportunities of discussing its various clauses.  As far as we are concerned, we shall give the Bill to the Minister as speedily as possible consistent with that review of its various sections which is necessary.  About six months ago the Minister announced&mdash; I think it was announced in the Budget statement&mdash;that the requirements of this country in the matter of housing were 61,000 houses.  I mentioned at the time that I considered that an underestimate and that I thought we required in all probability, double that number.  The Taoiseach interrupted me in the course of my remarks and asked me how did I come to the conclusion that we required a larger number than the estimate given.  I replied that it was because there were so many farmers and farmers' sons throughout the <Col N="99" /> country in need of housing accommodation who were not included in that number of 61,000.  Now the whole estimate has been revised and the number has been raised to 100,000.  I doubt very much if that either is an accurate estimate.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister did not wake up sooner and introduce this Bill.  The shadow of a general election, I suppose, has roused his conscience, made him more active and more solicitous in dealing with urgent national problems.  More than six months ago our Party put down a motion stating:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That, in order to promote the erection and reconstruction of farmhouses, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that legislation should be introduced increasing by 100 per cent. the grants payable to farmers for the erection of new dwelling houses and the reconstruction of existing dwellings; that the Dáil is further of opinion that the maximum grants for new houses and the grants for reconstruction should be payable to all farmers whose poor law valuation does not exceed £50.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>After having in various debates during the last three or four years voiced these demands, we put down that motion six months ago with a view to having the matter discussed and decided by Dáil Éireann.  Evidently the Minister is anxious to get this Bill passed before that motion comes up for consideration and certainly before the Dáil is dissolved.  He is not prepared to face the people, leaving the position in regard to these grants as it is at present, because it is manifestly unjust to provide such inadequate grants as have been provided for rural housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if we take as a basis of consideration, a comparison with the grants which are made on houses built by the local authorities, the houses built by local authorities in many cases are intended for persons with as high or sometimes with a higher standard of income than the small holders in rural areas.  Yet the grant for houses built by local authorities is at least twothirds of the cost.  That would mean £400 or £500 in the case of ordinary <Col N="100" /> houses even in rural areas at present. Compare that with the miserable grant of £60 provided for the small farmer who wanted to build a new house.  It is obvious that the £60 would not pay for the carting of the material to build the house.  However, the proposals contained in our motion have been implemented to a certain extent.</P>
    <P>The grants have been doubled in most cases and in addition the valuation limit has been raised to a certain extent, though not to the extent we demanded. Our demand was that the valuation limit should be raised to £50. I think everyone who has any knowledge of rural Ireland will realise that there is a vast number of houses on holdings under £50 that are unfit for human habitation and require renovation. The average man who knows rural conditions will acknowledge that the person with a valuation under £50 in rural areas is not in a financial position to raise the money necessary to build a house out of his own resources. Therefore the farmer with a valuation up to £50 is entitled to a substantial grant to assist in the reconstruction of his house.  However, it is well that the Minister has moved in the right direction.  If the Minister remains in power after the election and there are frequent elections afterwards, I suppose it will be possible to move him still further.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Mulcahy has pointed out, we want to get houses built and one very important matter is to ensure that building materials are directed towards the type of houses which are urgently needed and not towards the erection of luxury hotels and buildings of that kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Where have building materials which are suitable for use in the erection of ordinary houses been diverted towards the erection of luxury buildings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can judge from what we see around us.  We see luxury buildings, palatial buildings in many cases being erected, whereas county councils who are seeking to erect, by direct labour, houses for workers and other classes cannot get the essential materials at any price.  It is essential, when the whole community is crying <Col N="101" /> out for housing, and when we are legislating to provide housing, that the basking sharks, the profiteers, the racketeers, are not allowed to corner supplies or by combination, to keep up the cost of building and to prevent building at a reasonable price.  There is no doubt whatever that contractors can combine in that way.  That is a thing that must be faced and fought. There must be no profiteering, no racketeering in the provision of decent housing for the ordinary people of this country.</P>
      <P>I notice that the Minister for Local Government appears at last to have been converted to the Taoiseach's idea of a second house on the farmer's holding, or a dower house.  The Taoiseach has been pleading for that for a long time.  He told us here in this House that he could not get anybody to agree with him in regard to that suggestion. He has, however, succeeded, evidently under the shadow of the election, in at last converting the Minister for Local Government.</P>
      <P>I think the idea of bringing the farmer's son, working on his farm, within the scope of the provisions relating to agricultural worker's houses, is a sound one and it will have beneficial results, though not on the magnificent, far-reaching scale that the Taoiseach seemed to imagine.  I am glad there is also a provision in this section which will prevent those houses from being bought out and detached from the original holder.  That is also reasonably sound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be many defects, even when this Bill becomes law, in our housing laws.  For example, there is a disparity in the rate of interest which the Agricultural Credit Corporation charge when they give a loan to a farmer to build a house, and the rate of interest provided under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.  Why have we all those different bodies concerned in the financing of houses?  Why is there not some definitely guaranteed scheme by which anyone who wants to build a house for himself or a member of his family can borrow at the lowest rate of interest?  Take, for example, a farmer who wants to build a decent house which does not come within the scope of the Small Dwellings Acquisition <Col N="102" /> Act.  He has to go to a bank or to the Agricultural Credit Corporation for a loan and he pays a very high rate of interest.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which, I think, calls for slight amendment.  It is in connection with the date upon which this Bill will take effect.  The grants are provided in respect of houses commenced after 1st November of this year.  Since the Bill is retrospective to the extent of some weeks or, by the time it is enacted, possibly to the extent of a month, it could be made retrospective to the extent of at least six months.  A sound case could be made for that.  If a man commenced building six months ago he did so faced with all the difficulties that confront a man who is commencing to build just now and, since the work is not complete and he has not yet received his grant, he should be entitled to whatever benefit he may derive under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Any man who has been paid off could not, of course, have his case reopened or his grant increased, but, in the case of any small holder whose house is in course of construction, he should be entitled to benefit under the grants proposed here.  He has not yet received any money and I think it would be unfair if he were to get the lesser amount provided under earlier Acts.</P>
    <P>The scale of grants for new houses is graded according to whether the houses are linked up with a water supply or not.  In the first place, for a three-roomed house built by a person for his own occuption, he receives a grant of £125; for a four-roomed house, £175, and for a five-roomed house, £225. Where water mains are available the grant for a three-roomed house is £175; for a four-roomed house, £225, and for a house of five rooms and over, £275. That would be approximately £50 higher in the case of a house linked up with the water supply.  Why should there be so much?  Surely the man who is building a house in an area not linked up with a water supply is more entitled to the maximum grant than a man who has a water supply?</P>
    <P>A man in an urban area, if he wants to install a water supply and have <Col N="103" /> sewerage amenities, has to provide them entirely at his own expense and it is much more expensive to have these things in an area not linked up with an urban area.  We ought to wipe out the smaller grants and give grants in all cases on the basis that the houses are linked up with sewers and a water supply.  The present proposals are absurd and, even through the time is limited and the general election is approaching, I think the Minister should see about getting that particular section amended.</P>
    <P>There is a very useful provision for newly married couples.  I have on frequent occasions here pleaded for the old people and I suggest that some provision should also be made for them.  They would appear to be the outcasts of society and, if there is not already some provision for them in the Bill, I strongly urge that some effort should be made to come to their assistance in the way of providing a very small house for a single old person or even a married old person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, perhaps of all the Bills that have come before the House since we assembled after the recent summer recess, is one of the most important and requires very detailed consideration.  I am absolutely amazed and astonished to hear the Leader of the principal Opposition Party approach a Bill of this nature with &ldquo;I will leave it there&rdquo;.  He did not address himself to one single item in this Bill, which is, perhaps, one of the most important Bills introduced. He and his Party are much too busy playing politics to get to the bottom of a Bill which deals with the organisation of one of our most essential social services and which, even on a cursory examination, presents so many problems that we could fruitfully discuss them for more time than is available on the Second Reading and Committee. I will admit that this is a Bill of the kind sometimes called a Committee Bill, but one would have expected at least some constructive approach and criticism&mdash;because every measure is open to criticism &mdash; from the principal Opposition Party.  I think that is an appalling state of affairs and a bad recommendation <Col N="104" /> for our Parliamentary system.  I will try to supply some of the deficiency by trying to look into the substance of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I said that it was one of the most important Bills introduced, and so it is, for two reasons.  Firstly, because at the present moment we are faced with a serious social problem in the housing question.  Secondly, it is a question of the revision of the whole housing code, as the Minister mentioned.  Omitting for the moment to go into points which can well be left for the Committee Stage, there are two broad questions to be considered.  Firstly, how far this Bill goes to meet the present housing problem&mdash;and that involves an examination of the nature of that problem, and secondly, how far a Bill of this nature can be used to simplify the already unwieldy mass of housing legislation that is in force.  The first problem is historically as follows: during the first few years after the foundation of the State, a certain amount of housing construction was carried out but nothing at all sufficient to meet the growing demands of the community for houses.  According to the figures available, between 1922 and 1932 approximately 25,000 houses were erected.  That would be the total number of houses built and reconstructed by local authorities or private enterprise aided by grants.  Between 1932 and 1947, 120,000 were erected.  That was something to meet the growing needs of the community, but notwithstanding that development of houses over these years, the problem was becoming more acute in certain areas such as Dublin City.  It was growing more acute in Dublin, as we were faced on the one hand with the growing population of the city or in certain areas of the city, and faced on the other hand with the deterioration of existing accommodation, particularly in slum areas.  Before the war a substantial attack had been made on that situation.  The figures generally reflect the figures which I gave at first and, to avoid repeating them they can be found in Appendix III of the Report of the Dublin Housing Inquiry and also in Appendix VI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that the methods put into force since 1932 for dealing with <Col N="105" /> the housing problem in Dublin were effective, in that they gave an increased number of houses, but when war broke out the shortage of materials and other complications of supply and labour resulted in construction being temporarily suspended or slowed down.  That is the general picture with which we are confronted. In other words, it would seem from these figures that the method of attacking the problem adopted before the war was, generally speaking, satisfactory.</P>
    <P>At the present moment we are confronted more particularly with the problem of shortage of supplies and labour.  What does such a situation suggest in the line of legislation? Surely it suggests nothing more than a continuation on the lines which had already been adopted in regard to machinery.  Of course, then there is the administrative problem of getting over the supply situation but that is not really a subject which is easily dealt with by legislation.</P>
    <P>The next question is, does this Bill face up to these requirements?  In my opinion it does.  In the first place, in providing for grants&mdash;that is financial encouragement for building&mdash;it is giving ordinary incentive to prospective builders and to prospective private builders who are building for their own purposes, that is, for contractors and for those people who are building houses for themselves to live in. Experience proved that this method is effective and commonsense dictates it. Make building attractive in the business sense and people will build.  The principle contained in Part III of this Bill is just designed to do that, and that I take to be the kernel of the Bill &mdash;further and better encouragement superimposed on the old provisions for encouraging the building of houses.</P>
    <P>The details of the section involved can be dealt with in the Committee Stage.  There is no doubt that the provisions here first of all encourage societies and contractors to build houses for renting, and encourage particularly people who might wish to have houses built to occupy themselves.  It is above all an encouragement, and an <Col N="106" /> enabling Bill, to stimulate local authorities and public and semi-public bodies to build houses for the community and particularly for those classes of the community which are most in need.  On that basis none of us can object to the Bill.  It is timely and it is desirable.  There is a definite question to consider whether its method is proper.  In my opinion it is.</P>
    <P>Coming to the question of what the delay has been of getting housing under way again since the war, the answer is a physical one.  It is simply that the building materials which were required in certain quantities for particular jobs were in short supply.  Large girders required for building very big factory premises are not the same thing as the small doors, parts, and similar fittings required for building houses such as are in question here.  It was materials for doors, small parts, and fittings of that nature which were in short supply because they could not be made in this country in sufficient number.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The shortage from which we suffered was one over which we in this country had no immediate control or could not remedy by one wave of the hand.  It is quite legitimate to say that a Minister or a Government has been slow to get over such a difficulty but I would expect the people who make that criticism to show us how they could have done better and how, more quickly, the necessary building material could have been provided. A Building Research Organisation was set up just to get over these difficulties. Every effort was made to import the necessary materials, to collect them and to get building under way.  Even in advance of this Bill, certain encouragement was given to contractors and to people who were under way with work in order to get as much work done as could possibly be done in anticipation of the materials necessary for the erection of the actual houses, as the Minister himself mentioned in the course of his opening statement. We must, therefore, not confuse these two things&mdash;the delay which is due to physical circumstances, and the timing of the arrival of this measure before the House.  So much for the general <Col N="107" /> principle of the Bill.  The control of premises and other provisions in it are largely for Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I will pass to the second point which could have been considered by the Leader of the Opposition if he were minded to get down to work on this Bill.  It is the question of the Housing Acts.  Anybody who takes up an Index of Statutes will feel that over a period of years, going well back into the last century, Acts have been passed, one after the other to deal with the provision of houses and that initially some of these schemes were not co-ordinated.  Taking up Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy's excellent Calendar of Statutes passed by this Oireachtas we find when we open &ldquo;Housing&rdquo; that the first note is:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;See also Local Government, Public Health, Rates, Town and Regional Planning, and Gaeltacht.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a note before one gets to housing at all.  Then we have &ldquo;Housing for the Working Classes Acts, 1890 to 1931&rdquo;, and it notes one Act under that heading as being an Act since 1922. The next set are &ldquo;Housing Acts, 1924 to 1925 and 1925 to 1931.&rdquo;  There you have the Housing (Building Facilities) Acts, 1924; the Housing Act of 1925; the Housing Act of 1928; the Housing Act of 1929; the Housing Act of 1930; Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931.  Under the heading &ldquo;Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, 1932 to 1942, you have further Acts.  Grouped under the heading &ldquo;Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous) Provisions Act of 1932&rdquo; you have the &ldquo;Housing and Labourers Act of 1937&rdquo;.  Then one has to turn further to meet a whole group of Acts known as &ldquo;The Labourers Acts, 1883 to 1941&rdquo;.  That mass of legislation is, in my humble opinion, rapidly getting out of hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next question which might be considered is whether the Minister should not have at this stage attempted a unified code.  The Department has ample experience now to know what is necessary and whether a unified code such as the Public Health Act should not have been attempted straightaway instead of bringing in what is, in effect, merely another Act in a very complex <Col N="108" /> and lengthy series.  The list I have read out is a sufficient answer to that again, in my opinion.  I cannot see the Minister with all the resources of his Department attempting to codify the existing legislation within any reasonable time.  In a sense I am amazed that an amending Act to such a complex code can be produced in a relatively short time.  We all admit this housing problem is urgent.  The Minister himself said he thought it was expedient to bring in the Act in this form to get the work done.  I, for one, thoroughly agree with him and any thinking Deputy will do the same.</P>
    <P>It would have been wrong at this stage to wait to do the necessary consolidation and codification and so hold up the work till that was done.  On that second general point then, I think the Minister was also right in the procedure he adopted, but I think that the sooner he puts in train the machinery for&mdash;I shall not say codify&mdash;producing a unified and simple housing scheme applicable to all types of dwellings that can replace this extraordinary mass of legislation the simpler it will be for all people who have to deal with this legislation whether in an administrative or in a judicial capacity.  I would go further.  I would suggest to the Minister that with the knowledge and the experience available in his Department now it would probably be better at this stage to take a bold line and to produce a simple and as far as possible a unified housing scheme applicable both to rural and to urban areas.  That can be done with the necessary qualifications to suit both areas and without undue reference back to what has already been done.  The fact that you have had a complex legal situation does not mean that it must be continued. I would suggest to the Minister that he and his Department should take courage in their hands and produce the scheme that is thought to be the best to fit the actual facts and forget the various legal anomalies and complexities that have inevitably developed under the old system.  In other words, I would suggest to the Minister not to concern himself so much with codifying existing legislation as was done to a large extent with the Rent Restriction Act but rather to produce <Col N="109" /> a consolidated measure that will deal with the situation as it existed in the way in which it could be dealt with from a practical point of view.</P>
    <P>There should be no difficulty in operating a scheme of that nature.  It may give some people, with set ideas in regard to the powers and provisions in the old Acts, a shock.  What about it if it does?  The main thing is to have houses built and to have them built in a reasonable and consistent manner and under a reasonable and suitable scheme.  The legal machinery for the carrying out of the work does not matter very much.  The provisions which have been in force for so long have no sacrosanct merits which would constrain us to keep them for eternity.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that this Bill could have been done in no other way having regard to the mass of legislation already in existence.  The Minister could do nothing more than introduce an amending Act carrying with it the provisions which he requires to encourage housing construction and reconstruction. Consolidation must be left for a later date.  While agreeing with him that consolidation is not possible at the moment I would ask him to hurry forward such consolidation in order to remove from our statute books the mass of unwieldly legislation that is there.  In admitting that the Minister has done the right thing I am afraid I shall have to forego a point which I would like to have pressed&mdash; that is, the question of legislation by reference.  I admit that my case is not as strong on this Bill as it has been on other Bills where the ominous marginal note appears.  You find it in Section 27: &ldquo;Amendment of Article 24 of the Second Schedule to the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890.&rdquo;  That is the type of legislation to which I refer and to which I take serious exception. Such legislation is pernicious. It means that the ordinary layman can never hope to understand the code. Years of study are involved and even trained lawyers who have specialised in this particular branch of the law find themselves at a disadvantage and are uncertain as to what the true legal position is.  That situation is bound to arise when you legislate by way of amendment and by reference.  But I <Col N="110" /> have no case for attacking the Minister on this Bill.  The damage has already been done long before he took office. Departments should endeavour to get away from this legislation by reference and by amendment.  Instead of amending Acts or section of Acts why not re-enact the whole Act as amended?  It would cause very little trouble to do that.  It would take a little more paper.  It would mean a little more copying.  But we would all know what the law really is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  It is extremely difficult for the ordinary individual to understand such legislation. In order to digest the contents of this Bill one has to pull down several volumes of statutes.  One has only to look at Section 2 to see the number of statutes dealt with there.  The labour involved is too much for any ordinary person.  That excuse, however, cannot apply in the case of the Leader of the Opposition who, in his time was Minister for Local Government. I will be interested to know if my remarks now will provoke a little more interest in the Bill.  It is of a very important nature and yet one seems to feel a certain lack of interest in it.</P>
      <P>On the general principles I think the Minister is on sound lines, but I want to make now a few points which might be more appropriate on the Committee Stage.  I wish to make them now in order to give the Minister an opportunity of considering them before the Committee Stage.  To some extent I may be usurping the functions of the Leader of the Opposition but, perhaps, I may be excused for doing that in the present circumstances.  Under Part I the only question which arises is on Section 6.  I would like to point out to the Minister that in Section 6 by the introduction of the word &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; an automatic offence seems to be involved on the part of directors or managers. That may not be intended but the Minister might consider whether the section is not a little too sweeping in its present content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming then to Part II, this Act reflects once more a tendency which has <Col N="111" /> gradually been creeping into our legislation; that is, a tendency to mix up what should be judicial with administrative functions.  If that tendency goes too far the Minister may find himself in the position of having his Bill deemed unconstitutional in some particular respect.  Quite apart from that it is undesirable to have an executive authority exercising judicial functions. If you take the definition in Section 2 of a habitable house it means not only a dwelling-house or building but a house &ldquo;which, in the opinion of such authority, is reasonably fit for habitation or is reasonably capable of being rendered so fit.&rdquo;  That is the first point&mdash;&ldquo;in the opinion of such authority&rdquo;.  Is the Minister satisfied that a decision of this nature should be left to a local authority?  If there is a conflict between a local authority and a private individual, or even the Minister, would it not be better to have that determined by a competent tribunal such as the Circuit Court?  A similar situation arises under Section 7, where in sub-section (2) power of appeal is given to the Minister.  That admittedly is a departure.</P>
    <P>Under Section 27 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931, a power of appeal is provided to the Circuit Court.  In the long run I think it would be wiser to leave such decisions to a proper tribunal rather than permit them to lie in the Minister's own office. Even though there may be some slight delay involved in appealing to a tribunal it is better to have such independent power of decision.  This matter has arisen before.  Akin to that is the power the Minister takes to make regulations. For instance, in sub-section (6) of Section 16 it says &ldquo;the Minister may make regulations for the purposes of this section&rdquo;.  There are practically unlimited powers of making regulations under this Bill.  Is it desirable that the Executive should take such wide powers?  If it is, why do it in this complex way?  Why not put in a simple omnibus section to deal with it?  It will at least make it easier for construction. This Bill is being discussed on Second Reading and it is open for further consideration.  Frequently Ministers themselves have amendments <Col N="112" /> to make to Bills.  I bring these two points to the Minister's attention and perhaps he might consider them.</P>
    <P>The prohibition on the demolition of habitable houses is reasonable; there is nothing in that.  But the prohibition as to the use of premises is to my mind very questionable.  For instance, in Section 11 you have a rather startling provision in sub-section (1):</P>
    <P>&ldquo;After the coming into operation of this sub-section, the owner of premises shall not permit the premises to be used as a tenement house (whether or not the premises are so used at such commencement or were previously so used) without the permission, in writing, of the housing authority in whose functional area the premises are situate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder has the Minister considered the difficulty that arises there.  Quite apart from whether it is desirable to limit the use by persons of their own property to that extent, supposing the housing authority withholds its permission in writing for a tenement house to be let which has been let previous to the commencement of the Act, what is the position of the owner?  He is not supposed to have the premises let in tenements.  On the other hand, his tenants are protected by the Rent Restrictions Act of 1946.  That may need some clarification in Committee and I just mention it in passing.  Most of the points which arise on this Bill are Committee points.</P>
    <P>In Part IV of the Act, under Section 25, &ldquo;the Minister may make regulations for the purpose of securing the proper and efficient management of houses provided under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, providing for all or any of the following matters.&rdquo; Then a list of matters is given.  Paragraph (d) reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The terms and conditions to be included in any agreement under which any person is permitted to occupy or use such house;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph (e) reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Such other matters as the Minister may consider necessary or expedient.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here you have it again: &ldquo;such other matters as the Minister may consider <Col N="113" /> necessary or expedient&rdquo;.  How far does the Minister intend to push his powers of control under this Bill and, particularly, is that section designed to deal with the decision in the case of Boland against the Dublin Corporation which is reported in the 1946 Irish Reports, page 88?  The importance of that decision was that it dealt with a right of ownership.  Is the purpose of this section to get over that decision, and is it desirable that that decision should be reversed?</P>
    <P>Again, there is a point in Section 28 which it might not be any harm to mention now.  As regards the remuneration of solicitors for business arising under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, that section is not quite up to date.  These are merely small points.  There are obviously a number of points under this Bill which can be carefully studied.  It would be profitable to the community if they were carefully studied and it would help considerably in the solution of the housing problem if they were studied.  In that way Deputies could help to solve that problem by an intelligent discussion and also help the Minister.  Instead of that, the Bill has not even been dealt with by the Leader of the principal Opposition Party, a gentleman who was a Minister for Local Government and who talked about the deficiency of the Fianna Fáil Administration in building houses, although, when he was Minister for Local Government, there were only 25,000 houses built as compared with 120,000 houses built under the present Administration.  There is obviously need for a constructive Opposition in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as this Bill responds to repeated requests to remove certain defects which were standing in the way of housing progress, I should say it will be welcomed. So far as I can see, it does not presume to provide a solution of the building situation so far as it is reflected in the shortage of houses.  What it does, in effect, is to include within the ambit of housing facilities certain categories that up to now were excluded and, to increase certain grants which are made.  As I see it, it does not deal with the immediate solution of <Col N="114" /> the housing problem and people need not expect houses over-night or within the next month or two.  In so far as it purposes to remove vexatious restrictions on housing, it is welcomed.</P>
      <P>We have, for instance, been speaking in this House and outside for a number of years of the absence of any provision for newly-weds or people about to get married.  The Bill makes provision, to a certain extent, for that type of person, but not sufficient provision in my opinion, because the amount which it is proposed to allocate under this Bill does not cover more than 1,100 houses and is intended to provide for the five county boroughs.  Therefore, the amount that Dublin would get would not be very material.  I am not sure if I gathered correctly from the Minister that the intention was that houses of that character would eventually expand to 50 per cent. of the annual output. If that were so, of course it would be an entirely satisfactory position.  I do not think that the amount granted to a local authority under that provision is sufficient.  In view of the amount, the number of houses will be restricted.  I suggest to the Minister that, while the proposal to make provision for that type of person is a very good one, nevertheless the manner in which it is proposed to be effected is socially unsound, so far as my judgment goes, in any case.</P>
      <P>The Bill makes provision for putting newly-weds into a form of compound for a period, taking them out of their houses and transferring them over to local authorities presumably, when the family circumstances warrant such a step.  Might I put it to the Minister that newly-married couples who go into these houses and rear a family in them will naturally have their roots in their local areas?  They will be rearing their children and sending them to school in that particular locality.  They will have made their friends and the woman of the house will be doing her shopping in that particular area and to attempt to uproot them almost arbitrarily at a certain stage is in my opinion not good social policy.  I would commend the Minister to examine that particular section just one stage further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the grant of £175, I do not <Col N="115" /> think that is a sufficient contribution for the local authority.  I think it should be more.  Bearing on this whole question of housing, I must confess to some surprise and so does the local authority to which I belong, that opportunity has not been taken here to remove at least one disability which has been handicapping local authorities particularly during the last five or six years.  The Minister is aware that under the 1931-32 Acts a ceiling was fixed, so far as subsidies were concerned. That was a ceiling of £450 in the case of houses and £500 in the case of flats.  Everyone knows how building costs have advanced in recent years and the fact that these ceilings have been fixed means that a very heavy burden has been cast on local authorities during the last six or seven years. The Minister will claim, and justifiably I may say, that that burden has been eased since last year by means of the Transition Development Fund.  That is true.  One wonders, however, if that is going to be of a permanent character or to what extent it may be continued.</P>
    <P>I think some indication might have been given here to local authorities as to the form of change which I thought was envisaged for some time past&mdash;that is, by removing these arbitrary and out-of-date ceiling figures to which I referred.  It would be an encouraging gesture to our local authorities who are engaged in a herculean task, particularly the Dublin Corporation, against very heavy odds.  I may say that I am particularly pleased, as one who has taken some interest in the section to which the Minister refers, that some facilities are again being provided for what he termed the &ldquo;white collar&rdquo; classes or the middle classes.  They have been suffering under a very serious disadvantage in so far as housing is concerned for a considerable time as a result of what might be described as the lapse of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act. Under that Act, the ceiling figure for advances was £1,000.  Admittedly the house which could be purchased for £1,000 nowadays bears no relation to the type of house that could be bought at that figure some years ago.  I did gather from the Minister that his intention <Col N="116" /> under this section is to suggest to the Minister for Finance a ceiling figure of £1,750.  Might I put it to him, as he is interested just as I and other members of the House are interested in that class, that houses of the type they wish to acquire would now cost round about £2,000 or £2,500?  I think anybody associated with the building trade at the moment will agree that the type of people who were using the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act some years ago would now have to go to figures I have mentioned to acquire a comparable house.  It may be that you will rule out a number of these people if you limit the ceiling to £1,750.  I would urge on the Minister to look into that matter and to raise the ceiling to £2,000.</P>
    <P>On the question of grants for private persons, this Bill deals with the provision of grants for persons who build houses for personal occupation.  I think it is rather a neat point to define exactly that type of person.  Is it usual to find an individual of that type who will have the experience and the technical skill, even to undertake the supervision of the erection of a house, no matter how small?  How will you define a person who builds his own house?  The Bill largely concentrates upon public utility societies as being the media.  I am not quite sure what the record of public utility societies in the country as a whole is.  I know some of them have done very good work but I think there would be general agreement that the number of houses for which they have been responsible over a given period is not altogether outstanding.  It may be that the machinery is not flexible enough or attractive enough to induce a number of individuals to get together to form a building society.  There will be, particularly in the City of Dublin, a number of people who do not understand the public utility society machinery and who may still want to buy houses or to get houses built for them by a private builder.  The Minister is anxious to ensure that the grants will go to the individual who is going to live in the house.  I put it to the Minister, would it be possible to find a solution particularly in the case of Dublin, where there are so many private <Col N="117" /> builders, whereby it would be possible for an individual to buy a house built by a private builder on the understanding that he would still get this grant as distinct from the individual who built the house himself or who goes to a public utility society? Frankly I am afraid that the appeal of the public utility society will not be so great as the Bill might suggest or warrant. I am anxious that the type of person to whom the Minister has referred should not now, after having waited so long, be restricted in any form.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been under discussion with the Dublin Corporation, the Minister will be interested to know, and possibly an amendment or two will be put down on the Committee Stage.  I should like to refer to one point, as a matter of general policy.  If there is one problem more than another that confronts the Dublin Corporation and which has confronted them for a number of years, it is the extraordinary situation which arises from the inability of the corporation to house certain families, no matter how overcrowded they may be in a single-room dwelling or a two-roomed dwelling.  There are large numbers of one- and two-room dwellings in the City of Dublin, as distinct from apartments in a tenement. Under the regulations, if the Corporation house those families they will not be entitled to a major subsidy.</P>
    <P>I think that is something that needs to be altered.  It very often happens that you have a family more overcrowded in that one or two-roomed dwelling than you would in an apartment, no matter how large, in an ordinary tenement.  The Corporation are anxious to get that restriction removed.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has seen fit to introduce a regulation regarding direct labour.  It was quite proper to do so, because here again local authorities will, perhaps, be encouraged when times become a little more normal to engage in work of that type.  The Dublin Corporation some time ago passed a resolution deciding they would do so, but their operations were restricted because of certain statutory regulations that had to be adhered to <Col N="118" /> in connection with advertisements for contracts for particular items over a certain figure.  In so far as these restrictions will be removed, I think the advocates of direct labour on local authorities will be greatly encouraged.</P>
    <P>I did mention the disability from which local authorities suffer in relation to subsidies.  It is only right to record that relief is being provided for them under this Bill, in so far as loan charges are concerned, by an extension from 35 to 50 years.  That is a step in the right direction.  As distinct from the major question of the housing shortage, we say that this Bill contains good and useful provisions and members on this side of the House are prepared to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as this measure goes towards meeting the housing problem, it is welcomed here, but it does not go anything like the distance that Deputy de Valera tried to suggest. He criticised the Leader of the Opposition for not studying the measure.  The attitude of the Leader of the Opposition was: &ldquo;Get on with the job; the houses are urgently required; take your measure and we will see how it operates.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera advised the House to study the Bill carefully.  He stressed its importance and suggested that it covered in a comprehensive way our housing requirements.  I do not think the Deputy studied the measure at all.  He said it enables and encourages local authorities to build all the houses that are required.  It does not. It removes some difficulties and anomalies, and it removes certain things that impeded the construction of houses.  But it does not deal with the all-important factor, the financing of house building by local authorities.  It helps the individual to construct his own house and provides increased grants for public utility societies in order to encourage the construction of houses.  It also encourages the speculative builder.  That is the extent of the financial provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House fully realises that the main work, so far as housing the working classes is concerned, falls on the shoulders of the local authorities&mdash;it is <Col N="119" /> their responsibility.  The position at the present time is that a local authority has no clear understanding of what the financial provisions are so as to enable it to proceed with house building.  As regards the materials required, there is much more of it available than Deputy de Valera mentioned. It is not want of material that is giving us such a very low output in housing; it is the unsatisfactory attitude of the Minister's Department in relation to the financing of local authorities.  We all know that the old rate of subsidy is still in operation and the Minister has power, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, to make certain increased provisions out of the Transition Development Fund. Even the regulations governing the amounts that are to be provided in that way are highly unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a local authority that accepted a tender for the construction of houses.  Their decision was submitted to the Department for approval, but the tender was turned down and the local authority was advised to readvertise. They readvertised and further tenders were received, and the lowest tender in response to the second advertisement was more than 50 per cent. over the tender accepted in the first instance and turned down by the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>There is nothing definite as to what the subsidy is and as to what amount will be provided out of the Transition Development Fund.  The county manager has to invite tenders, set out what the rent will be and give other information, and it is only when that information is submitted to the Custom House that the local authority gets the particulars that are essential if they are to make a clear and simple proposal with regard to housing in their area.  Until there is some improvement of that state of affairs, housing construction by local authorities will be extremely slow.  The vast majority of our people have to depend on an intensive drive by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera missed completely what is absent from the Bill.  The Bill provides financial assistance for individuals or public utility societies so as <Col N="120" /> to enable them to construct houses for individuals.  Mind you with the lack of construction of houses during the emergency there is a tremendous amount of leeway to be made up with a tremendous increase in the cost of production. While at first sight the grants provided may appear adequate, when you take the value of the pound into consideration they are very little more than those provided before the war.  It does come to the assistance of that most neglected class, the small farmer with a big family, living very often in a house unfit for human habitation who was a very good fellow to rear his family and make ends meet.  While he was anxious to have his family better housed, he was unable to face the financial situation and knew that it would be inadvisable to attempt to face it because he would sink himself under a heavy burden that he would never be able to clear and have a worry for his lifetime.  While I do not want to belittle the financial provisions here, when we consider the emigration of population from rural Ireland, the appalling situation there is going to be in this country and how vitally essential it is to do everything humanly possible to encourage people to remain on the land, we begin to appreciate how essential it is to make an even more handsome provision than we have here.  I am afraid that Deputy de Valera does not appreciate the problem at all and that he does not know what he is talking about.  He approached the problem merely from the city point of view, because, I suppose, of his city environment and because his view is influenced by the city, but the Opposition Deputies know what is involved. Deputy de Valera drew a comparison between the provisions made in the first ten years of this State's existence and the following 15 years.  He conveniently forgets the reckless campaign of destruction by the Government Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thought we were going to get some extraordinarily constructive ideas which were going to be very useful for Dáil Éireann from Deputy de Valera.  At least when he started talking he gave us to understand that we were going to get some information we never heard before.  He talked a lot about codification.  I do not worry about codification at all.  If ample financial provisions are made and priority is given to building materials and we get on with the job, then we will have houses built, but you will not build houses on paper or by passing Bills.  The principal part has to be done outside and the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition is not far wrong &mdash; there is the Bill if you want to make use of it, and get on with the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provision of houses for newly-weds.  Any amount of young people who are anxious to settle down in life and raise families, are prohibited because they have no means of making a home.  But the fact of its being restricted to the county boroughs makes the provision far too restricted.  You will have to provide for newly-weds outside county boroughs and I do not know why the Minister restricted it. The provision should be general for local authorities throughout the whole country and he could make greater provisions for county boroughs.  I do not know whether the interpretation given by the last speaker to the methods by which the Minister proposes implementing the Bill is correct or not.  The Bill will provide small houses for newly-weds first and then remove them to <Col N="122" /> bigger houses and a number of small houses will be utilised for the solution of the housing problem of people getting married.  The sum of £80 provided for reconstruction is, I think, exactly double what it was up to the present. I want to appeal to the Minister again to reconsider the matter, particularly the valuation basis of £35.  I think he should raise the valuation limit and raise the provision too.  There are quite a lot of small houses where an extra room is to be provided and £80 is very little assistance to the man who has to tackle the job.  Again it is mainly a matter for rural districts.  Reconstruction is a most important work and should be encouraged.  There are many houses which could be saved which will become useless if they are allowed to fall into further dilapidation.  The preservation and utilisation of whatever houses can be reconstructed is an important matter and that provision is a step in the right direction.  It should apply, however, to a higher valuation than £35 because a farm with a valuation of £35 is very small, and to a man living on such a holding with a large family a reconstruction job is a very big proposition.  The Minister must bear in mind that while the provision for construction is unlimited&mdash;for any man who is going to build is entitled to a subsidy&mdash;when it comes to reconstruction work, which, I submit, is most essential, he sets a limit to the provision at a pretty low valuation.  I think the Minister ought to reconsider it.</P>
    <P>As far as the financing by the local authority is concerned I think Sections 16 and 17 enable a housing authority to make a grant to utility societies not exceeding a sum mentioned in the Third Schedule, and under sub-section (3) the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and subject to regulations made under this section, recoup to a housing authority an amount not exceeding two-thirds of a grant made under sub-section (1).  Why does the Minister put in &ldquo;may&rdquo; if he is going to recoup the local authority? I think this is not fair to the authorities or to the people who have to pay rates.  The Minister admitted this evening on another measure that the <Col N="123" /> bulk of the rates so far as local administration in this country is concerned was paid by the people on the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The bulk of the revenues of the county councils was in respect of the moneys derived from or paid in respect of lands.  If the Deputy will throw back his mind to what the agricultural grant amounts to he will see where it comes from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Where does the agricultural grant originally come from?  It is only handing back to agriculture something it was entitled to.  Under Section 16 it is compulsory on a local authority to make a grant under this Bill.  Under sub-section (3) of Section 16 the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, and subject to regulations made under this section, recoup to a housing authority. I do not know the Minister's intention but if it is the intention to recoup the local authority, I suggest the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be used there and encourage the local authority to do their best so far as housing construction in their administrative area is concerned. That provision is essential. There is no use in making it compulsory in one case and making it optional in a second case so far as the Minister is concerned.  We can well understand this section.  Section 7 makes provision against the demolition of houses that can be made fit for human habitation. I can foresee some difficulties in its administration.  Take, for instance, a house on a farm.  If a farmer decides to build a dwellinghouse for himself and if he contemplates that the old dwellinghouse can be converted <Col N="124" /> to house animals, in that case the local authority should not be the final arbiter in deciding whether he has power to do so or not.  It would probably be useful and constructive from an agricultural point of view that it should be done.  There is another provision which gives priority to farm workers. That is most essential and it is a point which I have raised many times in the past in this House.  The agricultural worker, the man who performs the most vital service of all to the community, was not getting what he was entitled to.  He should be properly housed and made as contented as possible on the land if we are to encourage him to remain on the land.  Deputy de Valera suggested, or appeared to suggest, that some of the parts of houses, doors, etc., could not be made here.  I want to assure Deputy Major de Valera that if we have the raw materials for housing construction all the parts can definitely be made here, and made very well.  I think there is very little in the measure, beyond the financial provisions, to be criticised. The financial provisions in present circumstances are scarcely adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that this Bill provides for a subsidy for every individual who is constructing a house regardless of his valuation.  It might appear at first sight that that is scarcely necessary. I suppose the House has taken objection on many occasions to the application of the means test and if we were to draw the line somewhere in the administration of this plan we would be applying the means test.  Perhaps in the last analysis it is better that the grant should apply regardless of any limitation.  There is a limitation in regard to reconstruction but none in regard to housing construction.  I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider the matter in regard to reconstruction. It is terribly important at the present time that we should preserve whatever houses can be reconstructed. There is a very long programme and it will take a number of years to overtake the arrears.  In the meantime, houses which can be made fit for human habitation ought to be preserved and reconstructed.  Looking back now it is a pity we demolished many houses pre-war.  which could have <Col N="125" /> been reconstructed.  Our experience of the war has led the Minister to decide that any house that is suitable for reconstruction should be preserved.  I think it is true, as has already been said, that material was used in constructing cinemas, luxury hotels and buildings of that sort that should have been earmarked and utilised for housing construction because housing construction is one of the biggest problems the country has to face.  If we are to keep our population here we must house them.  An Order was recently made in that connection which is a step in the right direction.  What I have already said in regard to the financing of local authorities should be undertaken at an early date.  The Bill is all right to the extent it goes but it goes only to a very limited extent. Housing for the working classes must be provided by local authorities and local authorities cannot get properly under way until we have a financial provision that will encourage them to get down to the job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The position regarding housing in Dublin at the present moment is extremely serious and if the Bill will provide facilities that will even increase the output of house building by a few hundred houses a year we all must welcome the Bill.  In the course of the debate attention was drawn to the scarcity of materials.  In every department of the corporation we are informed, when we ask for the speeding up of house building or for the speeding up of repairs or for electric lighting for houses that require it, that there are no materials.  I would ask the Minister if it is not possible for him to appoint a representative of his Department who will secure priority for the local councils' house-building schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will make efforts to procure from the people across-Channel building materials in exchange for our foodstuffs and other goods which we shall supply to them. At the present moment, there are some hundreds of newly-married people appealing to every member of the municipality for houses.  It is true that in the last two weeks or so special provision <Col N="126" /> has been made for these people. In the section under which provision is made it is stated that at the end of a period of five years they shall be moved out to other dwellings.  I want to know what is the meaning of that? Surely, if accommodation is going to be provided for newly-married people that accommodation ought to be provided at the very outset in order that they may have a permanent home right from the commencement of their married lives.</P>
    <P>At the present moment we have applications from several newly-married people for houses.  Inevitably what is happening is that, owing to lack of accommodation, the boy goes back to his mother's room, or two, and the girl goes back to her mother's room, or two.  Down in Talbot Street there is a woman who has a two-roomed flat.  In that flat living with her there is her married son and his baby and her married daughter and her two babies. That mother has been told that if she does not put this son and daughter out she herself will be evicted.  There are a number of similar cases all over Dublin.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another point in relation to the less well-to-do classes of the community.  Quite recently the corporation held an inquiry into the Temple Street clearance area and it was stated publicly that 500 families there were to be dispossessed.  Out of that 500, 300 would be permitted to go back to the reconditioned houses.  The other 200 would have to &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo;. Those were the exact words.  The 200 were in the class earning 30/- a week approximately.  I would ask the Minister to consider the question seriously of providing accommodation for the 25/- to 30/- a week class.  What provision is going to be made for the people who are on home assistance or the aged men and women in receipt of old age pensions?  Accommodation will have to be provided for them commensurate with the rent they will be able to pay out of that 12/6 a week.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the revision of the grants to local authorities in order to ensure that such grants will be sufficient to enable a considerable reduction to be made in <Col N="127" /> rents so that the lowly paid worker and the less well-to-do members of the community will have provision made for them.  In that inquiry which I have already mentioned, it was stated that there were 100 old people with 15/- or 16/- a week from some authority.  Now a woman in receipt of 15/- a week is at the end of her labours.  She cannot earn.  Out of that 15/- a week she is paying 2/6 for her room.  She has now been ordered out under the clearance scheme.  Where is she to find alternative accommodation at the same price? I would ask the Minister to give these questions particular consideration during the progress of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Another point which arises in our housing schemes is in connection with sites for shops.  The municipality either provides the sites or builds the shops.  These cut right into the heart of the working-class areas.  The small shopkeepers who normally cater for these people pay a rate in the city of £5 or £6 a year.  Is the Minister aware that the corporation is forced by his Department to ask for tenders for ground rents and that the tenders in such cases run as high as £125 for the smallest imaginable frontage?  The ordinary business people in the working-class areas cannot afford to pay such rents and the shop sites are taken over by some chain store or multiple store.  No other businessman has an earthly chance of competing against them.</P>
    <P>I am hoping that the Minister will review the question of the rents to be charged to the very lowly-paid persons or those who are on relief, and that he will also review the question of the rents for shops.  I know what the Minister will say and what other corporation members will say: &ldquo;It is the ratepayers' property and we are not going to deprive the ratepayers of the highest rent they can get for the shops. We must protect them also.&rdquo;  But, remember, it means a half-penny or a farthing on every item that the shopkeeper will sell to people transferred from condemned premises in the city to Cabra, Kimmage, Crumlin and other areas.</P>
    <P>I was a little bit alarmed to hear a <Col N="128" /> Deputy who spoke from behind the Minister saying that the Minister is seeking too much power to make rules and regulations.  He made a reference to a law case known as Boland versus the Dublin Corporation, and asked if under Section 25 it was intended to reverse that decision in connection with house purchases from the corporation. This Bill, I am sure, will pass and none of us can do anything about it.  But it would be an appalling position, after a decision was given in a court, if any effort was made to take power to interfere with leases held by a few hundred people who have a vested interest in these houses.  These houses were purchased under a 40 years' house-purchase scheme, and there are 21 or 22 years still to run.  It would be grossly unfair if anything was done to interfere with the rights of these people.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he would help the Dublin Corporation by getting them priority for materials required for building schemes.  There are houses in the Cabra area which were let to tenants five years ago in which seven or nine electric lights were to be provided.  On account of the emergency, only three lights were provided. Every time they asked for the extra lights to be put in they were told that there was no material available. In these houses also baths were to be provided.  The people have occupied these houses now for five years and the war has been over for two years and yet the corporation cannot procure these baths.  Builders' suppliers in some foreign countries are advertising these things in trade journals.  The Minister should ask the Government representatives in these countries to see what can be done to get this necessary equipment for our people here.  I would also ask the Minister to revise the grants to be paid to local authorities in connection with building schemes.  A house which could formerly be erected for £400 is now costing the Dublin Corporation £1,000, yet the Government are only giving the corporation a grant on the £400 basis.</P>
    <P>In the reconditioning of tenement houses in Seán MacDermot Street and Gardiner Street it may be interesting to Deputies to know that a splendid <Col N="129" /> job has been done by the city manager, with the Minister's approval and backing.  It is not generally known, however, that these flats cost £1,000 apiece, so that the reconditioning of a house in Seán MacDermot Street costs £4,000.  The job has been well done and the reconditioning is fully appreciated by the people who occupy the flats.  I wish there were more of them and that we could continue the work of reconditioning, but not by putting people out of their rooms and then putting them back in the flats at rents which are based on the cost of reconditioning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on bringing in this Bill, even though, in my opinion, it should have been brought in some time ago.  It is more than six months ago since Deputy Cogan and myself tabled a motion asking to have the grants increased by at least 50 per cent. and also to have the valuation increased to a sum which would cover the smaller type of individual who would be inclined to build his own house and who should be encouraged to do so.  The Minister, however, has taken a step in the right direction.  In my opinion, this Bill will be very well received and I hope that local authorities will be more active in connection with housing schemes and the Minister's Department more expeditious in sanctioning the schemes when submitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few matters I should like to refer to that may require alteration in order to make the Bill more effective.  The first point is that people who have embarked on a building scheme, whether large or small, particularly individuals who have started to build for themselves, should come within the scope of the Bill.  I understand from the Minister that building societies will benefit retrospectively under this Bill back to 1945.  These building societies generally operate in the cities or bigger towns, because it is more convenient for them to carry on building in a big way.  Unfortunately, we have not such building societies in the rural areas and, because of that fact, private enterprise is debarred from the benefit of the Bill.  I understand <Col N="130" /> that private enterprise will not come within the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If houses have been built for letting, whether by a public utility society, by private individuals, or by any other agency, then the grants will be retrospective to 1st November, 1945, whether they have been built in town or country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>The people who have built for letting since 1945 come within the scope of the Bill.  But, building societies who build houses for the purpose of letting them, are building for profit, whereas the individual who has built his own house and who will not come within the scope of the Bill is being penalised.  These are the people who should be encouraged.  I should like the Minister to amend the Bill so that the people to whom I refer would come within its scope, otherwise I think that their exclusion amounts to victimisation.  I have previously drawn attention to some of these cases.  I could quote a few instances without giving names.  There is the case of certain workers who during the emergency period saved a little money and embarked on schemes to provide houses for themselves.  These people are really an asset to the country because they were relieving local authorities of a certain responsibility by providing houses for themselves.  I could quote two instances where some time ago certain people started to build their own houses having a certain amount of money in hands.  Now they find themselves without sufficient money to complete the building, because of the fact that they will not get the grants until the buildings are completed.  These people are as much entitled to come within the scope of the Bill as the type of society operating since 1945 to which reference has been made.  I strongly urge on the Minister to give consideration to their claims because they should really come within the scope of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand also that a number of people who embarked on building schemes during the emergency period were deprived of grants.  I think that some provision should be made for these people who built even in urban areas.  They got no grant whatever.  I <Col N="131" /> think it is grossly unfair that such people should not come within the scope of the Bill or under the scope of Acts which had been in operation up till recently.  It is regrettable that people who have given of their best to the State, when it comes to the period of their retirement, should be denied the right of any State assistance in providing houses for themselves in their old age.</P>
    <P>I would also suggest to the Minister that the Small Dwelling (Acquisition) Act should be made applicable to every county.  Some counties did not avail of the Act.  I think it should be made a general rule that all local authorities should operate the Act and thereby give encouragement to people in these areas who are desirous of obtaining loans to acquire houses or carry on building schemes.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that farmers with a valuation of over £35 are debarred from getting grants for the building of houses or for reconstruction. I consider that the limit is too low and that it should be increased to £50.  In rural areas one finds many small farmers living in very bad houses but whose valuations are slightly over the figure stipulated in the Bill.  That prevents them from undertaking the building of new houses. Some of these people while rearing a young family were not in a position to build houses and now, when they are in a better position to do so, they find that because the valuation limit has been fixed at such a low figure they are deprived of any State assistance.</P>
    <P>I would particularly draw the Minister's attention to the fact that if people in rural areas were able to avail themselves of the provisions of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, they would be able to get money at the low rate of 2¾ per cent., whereas if they do not come within the scope of this Bill, they will have to make application to the Agricultural Credit Corporation for a loan at a rate of 4½ per cent.  Because of the difference of a small sum in their valuation, they will have to pay a much higher rate of interest on the money <Col N="132" /> necessary to defray the building of houses.  I think the Minister should take particular note of how unfairly that valuation clause may operate.</P>
    <P>I should also like to draw his attention to the fact that it is a farmers' total valuation which is taken into account in deciding his eligibility for a grant.  I made some representations to his Department on behalf of a person who wished to build or reconstruct a house and I found that it was the total valuation of his holding that was taken into consideration.  I would suggest to the Minister that if a man wishes to build on one rateable parcel of land on which no house previously existed, that parcel of land should be considered separately in fixing the valuation. Recently some people came to me who had a couple of holdings and who were excluded because the total valuation of these holdings exceeded the limit.</P>
    <P>Then there is the case of a large farmer, perhaps like myself, who may be inclined to give a piece of land to his son.  The valuation clause will debar him from embarking on any building scheme on that land, whereas if the limit were increased to £50 it might induce that man or a member of his family to build an additional house on that land and thereby lead to the creation of more suitably-sized holdings in the country.</P>
    <P>I should also like to call attention to the section dealing with reconstruction. In cases where a grant of £40 was previously obtained, some people may have since sold their holdings or, as a result of a family arrangement, one of the sons or daughters may have got married in the house.  The fact that they obtained a grant previously now debars them from getting a second grant.  I should like the Minister to make some provision in the Bill whereby when changes of that character take place, such people will be free to make application for a further grant.  They are a type of people who, to my mind, should be encouraged.  There may be an old couple in the house, and if a young married couple are coming in, if they were eligible for a second grant to enable them to build an additional room, it would encourage larger families.  In doing that, I suggest that the increase given should be at <Col N="133" /> least 50 per cent. of the amount proposed here.  If, where a grant was made available for a certain holding, say a number of years ago or a year ago, and a fresh application is made under the new scheme, I suggest they should get 50 per cent. of the amount proposed in the Bill.  That will meet the situation and I hope the Minister will give that idea favourable consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister has dealt with the provision of trade union rates of pay for people who avail of the grant to construct their own houses.  Where a family is in a position to carry out work of reconstruction, or the building of a new house, they may have skilled labour of their own.  Must those people comply with the regulation to pay trade union rates where their own families or friends build the house? That might be a snag where tradesmen are anxious to build a house and would do the work themselves, with family help.  I agree with the provision in the Bill, but there also should be provision made so that, where people using their own labour decide to build the house, they should not be debarred from the grant.</P>
    <P>These are points that I hope the Minister will consider.  As regards the people I referred to in the first instance, they should be brought within the scope of the Bill.  Any man who has courage enough to undertake a building scheme of his own and to provide his own house without asking assistance from the local authority, should be brought within the scope of the Bill and those people should get as much consideration as any public utility society or any other persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>With other Deputies, I welcome this Bill.  It is a step in the right direction.  There are a few points I would urge the Minister to reconsider.  The first one has been stressed by Deputy Hughes and Deputy Heskin, and that is the valuation limit for reconstruction of agricultural holdings. For the purpose of the farm improvement grant the qualification is that the applicant derives his livelihood solely or mainly from the pursuit of agriculture.  When that is established, any farmer, no matter what his valuation is, qualifies for a grant for <Col N="134" /> drainage, building of out-offices, improving the yard and surroundings of the house, erecting piers for a gate, and other things.  No matter how poor he may be, or how dilapidated his house, there is no grant for the reconstruction of his dwelling if he is over the prescribed valuation limit.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the statement that the agricultural community are living in improved conditions and that some of them, as has been said, are making money, it is equally true that the farmer with a £40 or £60 valuation who is married and has a weak family, as we say in the country&mdash;a family aged from 15 years to zero&mdash;when he has to pay agricultural labour, is very poor.  I know farmers who have fair farms, but when they pay the wages that they must pay and do their tillage, they are worse off than they ever were before and yet, no matter how much the house may be in need of repair, there is no financial aid for such a person.  I appeal to the Minister to waive that limit and make the condition that, to obtain a grant, the person earns his livelihood solely or mainly from the pursuit of agriculture.</P>
      <P>I am sure it is not the Minister's heart that would stop him from giving this assistance.  I have no doubt it is the Department of Finance that resists him.  The case must have been made to him time after time.  Once they have accepted that principle with regard to this other type of work, there is no reason why it would not be extended to the dwelling-house.  The Minister may argue that this opens the door too widely and there must be some limit. I admit that if he makes it £100 valuation, there are farmers who will be £101 or £100 10s. 0d. and it will be just too bad for them.  I argue that if the same principle is adopted as in the farm improvements scheme, the difficulty can be got over.  It is rather important that that should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it is done, I suggest to the Minister that wherever and whenever possible&mdash;and I think that is nearly on every occasion&mdash;when the officer examines the proposed work, he should insist that some modern equipment is installed in every house in the way of sanitary arrangements.  It is not too difficult at all.  When a porch or a <Col N="135" /> scullery is being built, it would not be too difficult to have a water tank erected for a sanitary system.  As the grant for reconstruction is now a fairly good one, compared with the existing grant, there should be some incentive, such as an extra grant for the installation of such an addition to the holding, because it is too bad that, at this period, in a great number of cases the sanitary arrangements are as bad as they were 100 or 200 years ago.  It is imperative that these additions should be made.  When the young farmer or the agricultural worker comes to the city he sees all these amenities and realises the conditions under which he is living at home.  There is no reason in the world why the same conditions should not obtain in the country, and if you are going to build now is the time to start and make proper headway.</P>
    <P>I agree with the other speakers, but of course again you will always have hard luck cases.  It is hard luck on the private individual who started to build a new house three months, two months, or five weeks ago because he is just outside the grant and if he were lazy and waited another week or a fortnight he would be inside it.  But if you put it at the 1st December, 1945, you would have the fellow who started a week before that.  There should be some consideration however, if possible, for the borderline cases and where a man started a house within the past 12 months and is prepared to put in the sanitary arrangements to which I referred a moment ago, provision should be made that he should come in.  It would be an incentive to put in sanitary arrangements and in that way the Minister would perhaps meet the Reverend Mother of Finance and satisfy her that he was doing everything orthodox in that Department.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate&mdash;Subletting of Dwelling.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>About two years ago the Land Commission decided to give Mrs. Mary Anne Byrne, Duffery, Hacketstown, <Col N="136" /> County Carlow, an addition to her holding in order to raise her uneconomic holding to an economic holding.  They gave her a small parcel of land on which there happened to be a dwelling-house.  The dwelling-house on that parcel of land was in much better repair and was a much better house than the one in which Mrs. Byrne was living, and I think, as far as my recollection goes, that she was given the preference of living in either house.  However, that does not enter into the question and she decided to remain in her old home and the Land Commission decided to convert the dwelling-house on the new parcel of land into an outhouse.</P>
      <P>The formality they pursued in that case was merely to take the chimney off the dwelling house and call it an outhouse.  Since that allocation was made to Mrs. Byrne her son got married. Her son was living with her but on his marriage he took temporary accommodation on a farm where he was employed.  His employer decided to acquire that house from him when he terminated his employment as he required the house for his own use. This created a position in which this woman's son with his wife and child had no home whatever and the result is that the man has got to live with his mother while his wife and child had to return to her people.  Mrs. Byrne applied to the Land Commission for permission to allow her to sublet the second house on the holding to her son. I do not suppose that there was any question of charging rent but she wished to allow him to live in it since he had no home of his own.  That seems a perfectly reasonable application and particularly reasonable in view of the long agitation which An Taoiseach has been carrying on to secure a second house on every farm so that the eldest son can marry and settle down.  The Taoiseach has been agitating for that for a long time and he has succeeded in getting it in this new housing Bill, but, pending the operation of the new housing Bill and pending the erection of cottages by the local authorities, this women's son has no home and it seems to me to be a hardship to refuse to allow her to settle the home on this holding on her son.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="137" /> The Minister may say that there is nothing to prevent this man from bringing his wife and child into his mother's home, but there are other members of the family and the house, which is very small, is already sufficiently crowded.  The net result of the Land Commission's stubborn attitude, or the Minister's stubborn attitude, is that this man is deprived of his home and his wife has to live with her own people.  Application was made to the Land Commission, and I made application also on behalf of this woman and her son, and they sent the following reply:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With reference to the representations made on your behalf by Deputy Patrick Cogan, I am desired by the Land Commission to state that they are not prepared to permit the building on the parcel of land, let to you under agreement for letting for temporary convenience, to be used as a dwellinghouse.  They adhere to their decision that this building should be used only as an outoffice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have no fault to find with the Land Commission as they are probably bound up by rules and regulations. This particular parcel of land was given under a temporary convenience agreement rather than a purchase agreement and that adds to the difficulties of the Land Commission, but the Minister is a strong man and is, I think, a man who does not like to allow himself to be bound by too much red tape or green tape or any other kind of tape. If he says that this woman should be permitted to give the house to her son, means would be found to implement the Minister's wishes, even if necessary by revising existing legislation because similar cases may arise from time to time.  So I would call on the Minister to deal with this matter.  The matter may seem to the Minister and to some Deputies small, but an important principle is involved which is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>I would certainly not have raised the matter on the adjournment if the Minister had been a little more informative in replying to me at question time.  The Minister is the very soul of courtesy in normal times but perhaps the times we are living in are not absolutely <Col N="138" /> normal and the Minister may have been affected thereby.  He certainly gave very abrupt answers to very polite supplementary questions.  I appeal to the Minister now to use his powers while he still wields them to see that this young man is not deprived of what is a natural right, his own home on his parents' farm when such a home is available.</P>

      <P>Sir, I am never affected by the fact that an election may be approaching. I have often been anxious to get some sort of chartered blue print to give me an idea of what is the justification for raising a matter on the adjournment. If a Minister gives an adequate and courteous answer to a Deputy that, I think, should be quite sufficient to clear the matter.  I think I was quite courteous.  If the Deputy will remember, I think I was inclined to give him much more information but for the impatience of the Ceann Comhairle and, of course, the Ceann Comhairle is not affected by the election.  He is safe, whatever about Deputy Cogan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Or the Minister.  But possibly any policy logically pursued will create certain seeming difficulties or injustices.  The policy of the Land Commission is not directed or devoted to the building of houses.  The fundamental policy of the Land Commission is that of dealing with congestion.  As Deputy Cogan has said, the Land Commission in pursuit of its policy of relief of congestion added to Mrs. Byrne's 11 acres 15 more.  There was an agreement between Mrs. Byrne and the Land Commission that the old, rather decrepit house in which she lived would be turned into an outoffice and that a better house on the farm she was getting in addition to her own holding would be utilised by her as a dwelling-house.  She decided she would not go from the old house to the new one, but she signed an agreement that the new house she was getting would not be used for any other purpose than an outhouse.  I say that in the logical pursuit of policy there may be certain seeming injustices but those who really <Col N="139" /> understand or try to understand what the purpose of Land Commission policy is will see that there is no injustice here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one fundamental policy of the Land Commission, I want to say again, is the relief of congestion by the creation of economic holdings.  In order to relieve congestion, to bring holdings up to an economic level, land must be resumed, acquired and divided but, in addition, we must take very sound precautions against sub-division.  If we are to permit a man to whom we have no responsibility to live in a house that has been converted into an outhouse we are on our way to agreeing to the sub-division of the holding which we have just made an economic holding.  It is not because of any want of sympathy with this man's unfortunate position but it is a fundamental principle, altogether different from that principle which Deputy Cogan holds, that we must prevent sub-division of a holding <Col N="140" /> that has been made economic and that we must not permit it to be made uneconomic again.  That is the one reason why we will not permit the second house on the same land to be utilised as a dwelling-house.  That is all I have to say about the matter and I believe I am perfectly right.</P>
    <P>With regard to the agitation of the Taoiseach&mdash;I would not agree that the Taoiseach is prone to agitation.  If Deputy Donnellan were taking an attitude in regard to what the Taoiseach proposed I might call it an agitation. I think Deputy Halliden also has an idea about a second house on the farm. I am entirely in disagreement in all things with Deputy Halliden and in this matter about the Taoiseach.</P>
