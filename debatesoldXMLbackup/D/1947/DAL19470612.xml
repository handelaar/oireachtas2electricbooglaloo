      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will again make representations to the British authorities to secure the removal of the restrictions on citizens of this country, particularly young men, travelling to England to visit friends; and if, in this connection, he will direct the attention of the appropriate British authorities to the fact that large numbers of English visitors are catered for all the year round in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that citizens of this country wishing to visit friends in England experience any difficulty in obtaining permission to do so.  As regards the removal of the visa restrictions, for the reasons which I explained in my replies to previous questions by Deputies Fogarty, O'Sullivan and Corish, I do not think that the representations suggested would serve any useful purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach says he is not aware of any persons having been refused permission.  It is true that young men who wish to travel to England on a holiday have been refused permission.  In my opinion these young men are not associated with any organisation which would cause the British authorities to refuse them facilities to travel to Great Britain.  They are young men who, because of their economy, have saved the price of a <Col N="1656" /> holiday.  In view of the fact that quite a lot of English people spend holidays in this country I do not think that these young men should be denied the right to visit their friends in Great Britain.  I ask the Taoiseach to inquire into the circumstances again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the serious consequences arising out of the closing of certain branch railway lines and stations, he will hold a public inquiry into this decision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have explained to the House on a number of occasions a railway company cannot permanently discontinue a service of trains on any branch line until they have first obtained an Order from me under Section 9 of the Railways Act, 1933. Public notice must be given and ample-time afforded for interested parties to make representations.</P>
      <P>A number of branch lines are at present closed temporarily under Emergency Powers Order.  I am aware that the long-term policy of the board of Córas Iompair Éireann involves the closing of uneconomic branch lines and stations.  No decision has, however, been taken by me in regard to any of these branch lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of branch lines was examined by the Tribunal of Inquiry on Public Transport which reported in 1939.  The tribunal considered proposals by the Great Southern Railways Company for closing a number of branch lines and regarded them as acceptable in a general sense.  They felt, however, that the matter called for more careful examination of the <Col N="1657" /> factors affecting each branch line before a decision could be reached to discontinue the service on the line.  I have powers to arrange for the holding of an inquiry should I consider this necessary or desirable in the public interest before reaching a decision on any application for closing a branch line.  Each application will be carefully examined and on the result of this examination I will consider whether a public inquiry would be warranted.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in view of the improved rail services now being provided, he will direct Córas Iompair Éireann to run a number of trains each week on the Clonakilty-Courtmacsherry branch railway line, for the carriage of sea-sand for manurial purposes, as this sand is of great value in increasing the yield of wheat and its carriage by road is so costly as to render its use uneconomic.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the fact that the fishermen from Hare Island, West Cork, and other fishermen engaged in lobster fishing, are required, by the nature of their avocation, to be away from home at sea for a period of three months, with only one call home in each such period, he will consider increasing the supplementary allowance of flour available to such fishermen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The fishermen referred to by the Deputy are eligible to receive supplementary allowances of flour or bread equivalent to 50 per cent. of the basic ration.  This is the standard rate being granted to workers in receipt of supplementary allowances, and I can hold out no prospect that it will be possible to increase the supplementary ration for any class of workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state if all turf workers employed by Bord na Móna and by local authorities are in receipt of the appropriate supplementary bread ration; and whether on occasions when such workers are on strike their bread ration is reduced to the normal scale.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Supplementary bread allowances are granted to full-time turf workers employed by Bord na Móna and by local authorities but I cannot say whether all such workers have applied.</P>
      <P>In the case of workers resident in Bord na Móna camps the supplementary rations are granted through authorisations issued to the bord.  In the case of other turf workers the supplementary allowance is provided by granting a supplementary registration page to the worker.  No action has been taken by my Department to withdraw supplementary rations of workers on strike.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not consider it reasonable then that those engaged in the private production of turf should be allocated a supplementary ration of bread?  They do not go on strike and, not only are they working full time, but overtime.  It is unfair that they would not be allowed an extra ration.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that a considerable amount of fruit was wasted last year because of the scarcity of sugar; and whether, in view of the increased quantities of sugar now available, he will make provision for the allocation of sugar to private householders for jam-making this year, thereby eliminating the fruit wastage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.  The supplies of sugar available are not sufficient to enable a special allocation to be granted for the purpose of making home-made jam.  Increased allowances of sugar are, however, being made this year, as in previous years, to jam manufacturers to enable them to use suitable home-grown fruit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the increased supplies of sugar now available, he will grant an allocation to caterers who carry on small catering businesses in rural towns, particularly on fair days and market days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to a similar question on the 7th November last.  I regret that the supplies of sugar now available do not permit of an increase in the present scale of allowances to any class of caterers, or of the grant of allowances to any of the caterers mentioned by the Deputy who may have no allowances at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that allocations have been made to proprietors of new dance halls and hotels, particularly those established by the Tourist Board.  Is it not very unfair that private caterers, those who cater for the people who are producing the food requirements of this country, will not be given an adequate allowance?  The people I have in mind are those who attend fairs and markets, who have to leave their homes in the early hours in order to attend fairs and markets. Some allowance of sugar should be made to people who carry on a catering business in rural towns in order to oblige these people with a meal on fair and market days.  It is unfair to the caterers and it is unfair to the food producers, members of the agricultural community.  It is not unreasonable, in my opinion, to make an application for such an allocation and I ask the Minister to consider it from the producers' viewpoint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for Local Government (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative.  The driver of a vehicle with a left-hand drive is under the same obligation as other drivers to give the prescribed signals either by hand or by a direction indicator of his intention to other traffic or to members of the Garda Síochána on traffic control duty and it is not considered necessary at the present time to add to the regulations on the subject of signals contained in the General By-Laws for the Control of Traffic, 1937.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that a lot of these vehicles have been in use in Northern Ireland or England&mdash;they are usually United States Army disposal vehicles&mdash;and a number of them have a warning notice printed or painted at the rear of the vehicle pointing out to any road user coming behind that the customary signal cannot be given by that vehicle?  I had it brought to my notice that there are a number of these <Col N="1662" /> vehicles around Dublin at the moment and certainly no signal of turning to the right can be given by them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Motorists can be convicted in court for not indicating their intention to turn to the right or to the left.  Arising from this question, if the driver with a left-hand drive is unable to signal his intention, he should provide some mechanical means of signalling. The matter lies entirely with the courts as to the interpretation of regulations, to which the Minister for Local Government gives consent only.</P>

Similar proposals have been received from several local authorities arising out of the general revision of the remuneration of employees of local authorities.  The opportunity afforded by this general revision is being availed of to coordinate, as far as possible, rates of pay of local officers and employees throughout the country.  This will take some time but it is expected that the cases raised in the Deputy's question will be dealt with at an early date.</P>

      <P>The reply to the first and second parts of the question is that since 1938 some 150 residents in County Leitrim have written to the Land Commission applying for transfer to other areas.

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (5) and substitute the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(5)  Regulations under this section may provide for and authorise the making of charges for the purposes of the regulations or for services performed <Col N="1667" /> thereunder and may provide for the recovery of such charges.</P>
    <P>This might be regarded as a drafting amendment.  We were rather confined in the charges that might be made but, as well, the sub-section which it is proposed to delete was rather badly worded.  It was not clear whether the cleansing and disinfection might not be held to be cleansing and disinfection of rats.  The wording of the proposed amendment is clearer and wider and I think it also covers the idea embodied in the next amendment by Deputy Cosgrave.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Regulations under this section may provide for and authorise the making of charges for the purpose of the regulations or for services performed thereunder and may provide for the recovery of such charges.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think it was pointed out yesterday that in a subsequent part of the Bill provision is made for the compulsory treatment or isolation of persons in connection with infectious diseases and, if the element of compulsion is brought into play, the full cost of treating them will be borne by the State.  I think it was Deputy Dr. O'Higgins who pointed out that if it is intended to make any charges in connection with the treatment of infectious diseases, and if the fact of raising an objection to being treated, will mean that the State or the local authority will have to provide for the whole cost of treatment, that will induce people to resist complying with regulations or the procedure that might ordinarily apply, in order to escape the known costs or even the unknown costs in which they might otherwise be involved. I submit, therefore, that either a little more explanation or a little more safeguarding of the position is required in connection with this amendment. Under this amendment it would be possible for the Minister to make regulations which would provide for the making of charges for any kind of work done or any kind of service performed in connection with the treatment of infectious disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I suggest that this amendment is too wide to warrant its inclusion in the section as it stands.  If it is intended to restrict it to the destruction of rats or the cleansing of premises or vessels, it is desirable that the amendment should be so worded as to restrict the possibility of making charges in other cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is rather a difficulty in laying down specifically where charges may be made.  While I say it is not intended to make any charges for personal treatment, if we have a person, on the other hand, who comes into a county hospital and wishes to get a bed in a private ward attached to that hospital, naturally there should be a charge.  It is difficult to define the cases in which a charge would be made.  That is why I think it might be better not to try to enumerate these cases.</P>

      <P>When we were on amendment No. 21, we were on the question of the medical treatment of children but I should like to ask the Minister, now that we have passed over to the question of infectious diseases, whether he does not see a case for saying that regulations made to deal with infectious diseases should be approved by the national health council.  I, therefore, move amendment No. 24:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>()  Regulations made under this section shall be subject to the approval of the national health council.</P>
      <P>It is quite true that the service in connection with which we have discussed this matter already has very wide ramifications, perhaps as wide as those of infectious diseases, but I should like to hear from the Minister what relation he expects the national health council to have with the direction or the advising of the work of himself and his Department in connection with the very wide ramifications of the matter covered by infectious diseases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I can only briefly reiterate what I said last night <Col N="1670" /> on a similar amendment.  I do intend to set up a health council and the principal purpose of that health council will be to advise me on the regulations that are made.  Generally speaking, the regulations would be sent to them and they would be given time to study them.  Then we would get their advice on the regulations and, if they make a case, they could be changed accordingly. But, as I said last night, sometimes you have to make an amendment to a regulation which might be a very short matter and perhaps rather urgently required and we could not expect the health council to come along and deal with it because it will be composed of men who are very busy in their own spheres and could hardly be expected to come along more than once every two months or maybe, in the beginning, once a month.  That is as far as they are concerned.</P>
      <P>On the other side, I said that in principle I think the Minister should be responsible for whatever is done.  He is responsible to the Dáil.  The regulations are laid before the Dáil and the Dáil can reject them.  But I think the Minister should take full responsibility and he should be in a position to disagree with the health council if he wants to take the responsibility of doing that.  I stated last night that in a long experience of consultative councils I never had to disagree with them and it is very unlikely that I ever should have to disagree but, if it comes to a contest between what I think, and their advice, I should be able to reject that advice.  I also made a point which, if you like, is not perhaps a very good point, that I would like in selecting a health council to select people who would be likely to be critical of anything I am doing but, if I am going to be bound by their decision, I might be inclined to select people who would be more amenable in their advice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned, in reference to charges for people who are treated for infectious disease, that an individual who might ask for a special room in an institution, should be charged.  I feel that if a man is asked to go into an institution for treatment, in the interest of public health, because he is suffering from an infectious disease, he ought to be entitled to ask for conditions analogous to the conditions in his own home.  I wonder whether the Minister has considered that aspect of the case or not because, in the ordinary way, he might desire to be treated at home but in the public interest he is asked to go to the institution.  He enjoys conditions in his own home that are somewhat above the average, possibly, and I think he is entitled to look for conditions analogous to those conditions and, in these circumstances, does the Minister suggest that he should be asked to pay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if Deputy Hughes were the medical officer in charge of the institution he would find it very difficult if we were to lay down that as a principle because most people will think that they are entitled to the best treatment the institution can give and that means most people would be looking for private rooms.  The only easy way, if you like, and perhaps the fairest was is that the head of the institution can say: &ldquo;You are entitled to free treatment if you take the same treatment as everybody else&rdquo;&mdash;which I hope will be very good treatment&mdash;&ldquo;but if you want special rooms, you will have to pay the extra cost.&rdquo;  Take the big fever hospitals in this city at the moment.  That is the rule, really, and it appears to work very well on the whole.  I should say, perhaps, that I think the person Deputy Hughes has in mind, who has a very good home, in certain cases may not have to go to hospital where the poor person would have to go.</P>

    <P>This section makes certain provisions for exemption from the requirements to submit to measures for protection and immunisation against infectious disease and it is intended by the amendment that where an adult person or the parent of a child is required to take any action under this section he shall at the same time as he is being so <Col N="1673" /> informed be provided with a copy of the prescribed terms in which, if he so desires, he may submit his objection. The section definitely makes provision by which there will be machinery for objecting and it is desirable that when a person is being told by the State or somebody acting for the State that he has to submit compulsorily to a particular type of treatment that if there is a way of objecting that he will be told quite clearly and simply the form which the objection has to take so that if he desires to object he will be able to do so in the proper way, without confusion.</P>

My proposal is that there will be added after that &ldquo;the consent of the patient having been obtained&rdquo;. If amendment No. 29 is passed, the patient will have to give his consent before the medical examination is carried out or before the taking from him of blood or other specimens for examination or test.  I submit that that is quite a reasonable amendment to insert and I would find it very difficult to understand the circumstances in which the Minister would insist that a patient would be medically treated contrary to his own willingness or that blood or other specimens would be taken from him contrary to his own consent.</P>

      <P>I can understand the Deputy's argument when he says that this power is hardly required.  That is medical examination, the taking of blood or other specimens for examination or test without the consent of the person concerned.  What we had in mind in putting in this was the clearing up of diseases.  We had some hopes that when this Bill was passed we might be able to deal with some of those people who are spreading venereal disease.  Such people are rather intractable and rather uncooperative when they are taken into <Col N="1677" /> hospital.  The only possibility of dealing with them in an effective and expeditious manner is to get blood tests.  Blood tests are absolutely essential in such cases where there is a suspicion of syphilis or other venereal disease.  I cannot see that a doctor will have to rely on that particular subparagraph in any particular case apart from that but I do think that it might be necessary in such a case.  A blood test is required also for some other diseases but it is very unlikely that resistance would be offered.  For instance in a case of suspected tuberculosis a blood test might be required. That also applies to typhus.  One of the tests for typhus is the Weil Felix test for which blood is required.  Of course, with regard to typhoid, blood culture is necessary.  For diphtheria swabs from the nose and throat are required.  Blood is necessary for testing purposes in three or four of those diseases.  I do not anticipate any trouble whatever, except in regard to venereal disease.  If we want to get the person's consent it is hardly necessary to put it in the Bill at all.</P>

      <P>As Deputies are aware, getting consent means getting the consent of the parent.  If amendment No. 29 or amendment No. 30 were accepted by the Dáil it would mean that the medical officer in charge of the institution would have to get the consent before taking a blood test or a specimen, or before immunising or inoculating. I do not think there would be much of a case against amendment No. 30 if it were dealing with adults. Let us suppose, however, that there was a very bad outbreak of diphtheria and that children were being brought into the hospital hourly.  In that situation the doctor knows that it is not a matter of hours but of minutes to give the necessary inoculation in order to try and cure the patient.  If he has to go through the formality of getting the parent's consent it may possibly mean the death of the child.  I mention these as some of the difficulties that we are up against.  Perhaps we could get an amendment that, in the case of a child, the parent's consent should be got if practicable.  Deputies, I am sure, will realise that it would be a terrible thing if a doctor were faced with the position that he had to let a child die because the parent's consent was not available.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 31:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), to delete paragraph (h).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1679" /> On the Second Reading I drew attention to paragraph (h) which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;no surgical treatment of the patient shall be carried out during his detention except with the consent of the appropriate person.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I said then that I would like Deputies to consider that paragraph and to help me, if possible, to get over certain difficulties that I foresaw.  First of all we must consider what we mean by consent. In the case of an adult we mean the consent of that person himself.  As far as this Bill is concerned, an adult person is any person over 16.  Consent, in the case of a child, would mean the consent of the parent or guardian, and in the case of a person of unsound mind, the consent of the parent or guardian.  There cannot be much objection to a section like this where you are dealing with adult people, but there would be a very strong objection where you are dealing with a person of unsound mind or a child.  I should have said, perhaps, that there would not be any strong objection if the adult person were conscious himself, but if he were unconscious another difficulty would arise.  In a bad diphtheria case, for example, it is sometimes necessary to do a tracheotomy to save a child from smothering, and that tracheotomy has to be done suddenly and rapidly when the time comes.  If the patient is an adult person over 16 and is practically unconscious at the time, you cannot properly get his consent.  You may assume his consent by indicating to him in some way that you are going to do a tracheotomy.  If he does not make any answer, you may go ahead. If, however, the patient is a person of unsound mind, or a child, you must under the Bill get the consent of the parent or guardian.  That may place the doctor in a difficult position because there is not time to get the consent.  In that connection, I would like Deputies to bear in mind that during the severe storms of last winter several parts of the country were isolated.  It would have been impossible to get in touch with the parents of children in hospitals from some counties for ten or 12 days, even though <Col N="1680" /> an operation for, say, appendicitis might have been urgently necessary. You could not wait for the parent's consent.</P>
    <P>Deputies will see that there are great difficulties in leaving the section in the Bill at all.  What I would urge on them is to rely on the law as it stands because I think it is all right.  I would like to tell Deputies what the law is at the moment.  First of all, a surgeon who performs an operation against a person's will commits an assault and is liable to an action for damages.  Therefore, if you allow the law to stand as it is an adult person is quite well protected because if he refuses to allow the surgeon to operate he is as well protected by the law as it is as he would be by the law we are passing now.  In the case of a child, or of a person of unsound mind, if a surgeon were to attempt to operate without getting the consent of the guardian or parent it would be equivalent to an assault.  In any case where an adult person is in a position to decide for himself, or in any case where the surgeon might reasonably look for the parent's or guardian's consent, he has no right to do the operation.  If he does an operation on a child in a case where he could have looked for the parent's consent, the parent can accuse him of an assault for doing the operation.</P>
    <P>The next point is that if a patient is incapable of exercising a discretion&mdash; that is where the patient is unconscious &mdash;and if he is an adult and an immediate operation is necessary to save his life, then the surgeon does not commit an assault if he performs the operation. The surgeon is guilty, or may be guilty, of malpractice in such a case if he operates where it is not necessary or essential.  Under the present law, therefore, where he is up against a proposition of that kind, he usually gets the opinion of another medical man so that if anything should go wrong with the operation he can be protected by having at least another medical man to corroborate his view that the operation was essential.  The same thing applies to the guardian of a young person as it does to an adult person in his own case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1681" /> The law is as I have given it, but we have very few recorded cases of actions.</P>
    <P>There was one case where a surgeon proposed to do an operation for goitre on a young person and he told the parents that he thought the operaction was necessary and said it could be done with a local anæsthetic.  The parents agreed to that, but while he was operating the child lost his nerve and got uncontrollable and they had to order a general anæsthetic before they could finish the operation and the child died.  The parents in that case did not allege any negligence, but took an action against the surgeon on the ground that they had consented only to an operation by a local anæsthetic and he had, as it were, broken his contract. In that particular case, the parents lost the action.</P>
    <P>I just wanted to state the law on the point and I would urge very strongly that we should leave the law as it is. I think that Deputies will agree that a person is very well protected.  As I have said, in the case of an adult person, no surgeon can operate upon him as the law stands, unless he wants to commit an assault, and no person can operate on a young person or on a person of unsound mind without the consent of the parent or guardian.  The present law has the advantage that, in a case of urgent necessity, the surgeon, after getting the opinion of another doctor if the other doctor is available, will perform the operation, if he thinks it is absolutely necessary, and only if he thinks it is absolutely necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept the Minister's argument as fairly sound.  This section deals with the treatment of people who have been declared to be a possible source of infection and ordered to subject themselves to detention and isolation.  We are dealing with things that may happen after this Bill has been put into operation.  I do not think we need introduce any additional regulations or safeguards in the ordinary way to protect the ordinary people against the medical profession.  The outline of the law position as it stands at the moment is, I take it, an outline of a state of affairs which has worked satisfactorily <Col N="1682" /> in regard to people who have their freedom.</P>
      <P>There is always a feeling that people who have been detained and isolated in a compulsory way may tend to be brought under a more rigorous system of treatment than people who are free. If the Minister's intention is to leave the position between the patient and the doctor or surgeon, even though the patient may be under detention or isolation, exactly as it is where there is no compulsory detention or isolation, then from the point of view of safeguarding the person and the will of the person concerned that should be regarded as satisfactory.</P>
      <P>The manner in which this point was originally presented has, perhaps, coloured people's minds with regard to things which might or might not happen, but I accept the Minister's statement now, that the intention is that the relationship in law between patient and doctor will stand under Section 34 as it would stand if they were ordinary patients of the doctor.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2) (j), provision is made for the making of an appeal for release to the Minister by a person detained and, in the subsequent paragraphs, there are arrangements for deciding such an appeal.  I want to appeal to the Minister to reconsider this, with a view to ensuring that such an appeal will come before the national health council for review.  I am not suggesting that each appeal should be decided by the council, but rather that the Minister should decide each appeal in consultation with the national health council.  That would mean only a minor alteration of sub-section (2) (m) to provide that the Minister should consult the council before taking a decision.</P>
      <P>The important thing to remember in connection with this section is that you will be dealing with people in a somewhat different class from those who have been detained because of infectious disease in the past.  You will be dealing with people suffering from tuberculosis who might be detained for, perhaps, years and there are many important issues to be considered.  For example, a person might claim that he would be in a position to safeguard his health and that of the community in his own home and there might be room for a wide divergence of opinion.  For that reason, it is desirable that a more independent body than the Minister should have an opportunity of considering such a claim.</P>

      <P>The objection I put forward some time ago to being compelled to put things to the health council applies all the more to the case now raised by the Deputy.  We can only expect the council to meet at regular intervals and we could hardly justify calling the council together to consider an appeal of this kind; but, in any case, I am afraid that, even if we did as the Deputy suggests, the council would be entirely guided by whatever report I submitted to it.  If I submitted a report that it was extremely dangerous to allow such and such a person <Col N="1686" /> out, what could the council do but say: &ldquo;Keep him in&rdquo;?  If I submitted a report stating that he should be let out, all they could say would be: &ldquo;Let him out.&rdquo;  Deputies need have no great fear in this matter, because, as they know, all our institutions are overcrowded at the moment and there is a desire on the part of medical men to get people out of these institutions as soon as they can.  There is no desire to keep them longer than is necessary. There is the further safeguard, in case there is any suggestion that the medical officer of health in a particular area might be over-cautious, that the medical inspector of the Minister would go down and try to keep things uniform in the various institutions.  I think it should be left at that.  I should like to refer again to what I said on Second Reading, that this section has been operating since 1940 in the form of an Emergency Powers Order.  There were 38 cases dealt with and we never had the slightest complaint from any of the people involved.  They all thought they were fairly well treated and that they had got out as they should have got out.</P>

      <P>I should like to stress again our concern in this matter, because, while we appreciate some of the difficulties which exist in the practical application of the law, we are concerned with a fundamental principle, the violation of the fundamental right of the individual, his absolute power over his own body and the danger of permitting the State to violate that right.  The Minister has pointed out certain difficulties in the case of persons unable to give their consent with regard to surgical treatment and certain difficulties under sub-section (2), paragraph (g) (iii), but, no matter what the difficulties are, I think the Minister ought to have amendments in connection with them very fully examined before Report Stage, because it is a very grave matter for an assembly of this sort to put into <Col N="1687" /> legislation sections which may violate these fundamental principles.  While practical difficulties must be met and solved, every effort should be made by the Minister and his Department to preserve these fundamental rights. With regard to sub-section (7), I should like to inquire what financial provision will be made.  The sub-section requires a local authority to finance the cost of the maintenance and treatment of persons under the section.  Does that mean that the local authority is to be called on to finance this treatment fully?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to impress on Deputies that I do not think there will be very much cost under this section. There are two diseases as to which I think Deputies will probably agree that very drastic action must be taken.  One of these is typhus, which is a very infectious disease.  You have to clean up a whole district.  You may have to remove people and sometimes burn their houses in order to get rid of the disease.  The same thing applies to small-pox.  You have other diseases where it may be necessary, such as tuberculosis and diphtheria and, possibly, infantile paralysis.  Then there is the other case, that of venereal disease, <Col N="1688" /> where it will be absolutely necessary if we want to clean up the disease. There is no chance, I am afraid, of cleaning up that disease except we get the prostitutes into some institution where they can be treated and that can only be dealt with under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind the Minister, on the question of cost, that it is not in the interest of a particular county you are doing it, but in the national interest.  Whatever expenditure is incurred is in the national interest so as to prevent the spread of infection outside the bounds of a county.  On that basis, I think the contribution ought to be greater than 50 per cent. from central funds.  When the Minister is throwing it back on a county, he is throwing it back mainly on a particular section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The contribution varies. In the case of tuberculosis, 50 per cent. is contributed by the State.  In the case of venereal disease, the State contributes 75 per cent.  As Deputies know, a White Paper has been promised, and I hope it will be possible to have it circulated in three or four weeks' time.  When that White Paper comes along, we will be able to get down to this question of the proper rational financing between local authorities and the State in connection with all these things.</P>

      <P>When the Minister speaks of typhus and small-pox as the principal diseases we may have to tackle, the question arises as to whether, when dealing with a particularly heavy piece of work in a rather localised area, 50 per cent. of the cost should fall on the local authorities. From the financial point of view, it is not a local problem related to the local <Col N="1689" /> position.  If the expense in connection with a serious epidemic of typhus was very great, it would be unfair to ask the local authorities to bear 50 per cent. of the cost.  Small-pox would be a matter of a crisis and it would be unfair to impose the cost of a crisis like that on the local authority. Venereal disease has a social stigma attaching to it.  When the Minister talks about facing up to the problem drastically, I doubt if it can be dealt with entirely on the basis of the local authority knowing 50 per cent. about the matter and the State knowing the other 50 per cent. and bearing the cost in that relation. If there is any kind of a serious problem with regard to venereal disease to be dealt with, I do not think it can be dealt with out of the local rates.  If it has to be brought out in the open, there will be simply concealment and avoidance and the Minister will fail to deal with any problem that may arise out of that diesease.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that our proposals are not quite ready yet for publication, but I think they will show anyway that the increased cost for health services will be divided between the State and the local authority. The result will be that there will be very little increase on the local authorities for all these new services; that the greater part of the expenditure will fall on the State as time goes on.</P>

There does not appear to be anything in this section with regard to the disposal of the clothing of persons who die from an infectious disease.  I am not sure if there is any provision in any other part of the Bill.  I think that in this section at least there should be some definite provision to ensure that the clothing of persons who die from an infectious disease is not allowed to fall into the hands of other people.  It is only two or three days ago that a case was brought to my notice of a perfectly healthy man who purchased a suit of clothing at a stand in a public fair and within three days he was down with infantile paralysis and subsequently died.  I did not get an opportunity to inquire into the full facts of the case and I do not know whether infantile paralysis can be conveyed by clothing or not.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to inquire, on Section 37, if the Minister will elaborate on the policy with reference to charging and the discretion given to the local authority. The discretion will be given to the county manager, and my experience is that some county managers are pressing rather unduly on people who find it difficult to pay for treatment in an institution.  The council have little or no discretion in the matter, and I think the Minister ought to have some definite policy.  It may look all right from one point of view that the county manager is pressing for contributions, but if you carry that to extremes it may become a hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section covers cases where a local authority, for some reason, must treat a person in his own home and provide a nurse; that is, when the person cannot be removed, being either too ill to be removed or for lack of accommodation in the hospital. Having provided the nurse, they can make a charge.  The Deputy's point is that the county manager will have too much discretion with regard to the charge.  I may say this whole matter will be fixed up in the White Paper.  It will deal with what will be the county organisation with regard to health and the proposals for that will be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Deputy feels is that somebody must have discretion to make a <Col N="1694" /> charge.  I do not know whether we should leave the discretion to the local authority or whether it should be covered by legislation, but there must be some discretion.  You cannot just say to the local authority: &ldquo;You must charge something&rdquo; or &ldquo;You need not charge anything&rdquo;.  There must be discretion.</P>
    <P>Question agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 44:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 24, after the word &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; to delete the brackets and words down to and including the word &ldquo;defendant&rdquo; in line 25.</P>
      <P>I think the provisions in this section are extremely undesirable.  It is a generally accepted maxim in criminal law that if a person is prosecuted the State must prove the charge before that person can be found guilty.  In civil proceedings if one individual takes an action against another he must prove whatever he alleges before he is entitled to sustain his action. Under this section if one person becomes infected as a result of contact with another and subsequently the infected person takes an action for damages against the other person for not taking adequate precautions to prevent people becoming infected, the responsibility of satisfying the court lies on the defendant.  I cannot think of any Act in which the onus is placed on the defendant, with the exception of certain stringent provisions in the Offences Against the State Act which, I think, is now being repealed.  In a criminal prosecution the onus always rests on the State and in a civil prosecution on the plaintiff.  In this case the onus is transferred to the defendant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite agree it would be undesirable that a person who infects another should be enabled, by reason of the phraseology of legislation, to get away without any penalty.  When a person has been infected as a result of another person's neglect, by reason of the fact that the other person omitted to take precautions, there should be some remedy for a grievance of that sort. The onus should be allowed to remain <Col N="1695" /> as it has always remained in normal circumstances, on the plaintiff.  If a person is taking adequate precautions and is in a position to say that he has not exposed himself to any risk of infection, then the onus of proving that the infection was due to the neglect of the defendant should lie on the plaintiff. I think the Minister should accept this amendment and I would like to hear strong reasons given before we can allow this section to remain as it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise, of course, that the Deputy makes a very strong case from the point of view of ordinary legal practice but I should like the Deputy to consider the person who has a grievance in these cases.  For instance, let us say that a landlord has a room to let in which there has been a case of typhus or small-pox&mdash;I am putting an extreme case.  He was informed that he should take every precaution to disinfect it but he took no precautions and let the room that night.  I do not think that that particular landlord deserves very much sympathy and we should not enable him to get off with some technical defence in court.  In other words, we should put the onus on him to prove that there is no neglect on his part.  I am told that there are other examples or provisions of this kind in the Transport Act but I do not want to argue the case on precedent.  I want to put it on its own merits.  I think that a person who is likely to give infection to another person should take every precaution to prevent that and if he does not take that precaution, well we should not have too much sympathy with him.  After all he may be endangering the life of another person by not taking precautions.  The trouble is that I am told that people have got off in the past on some such technical point, that after all the onus was on the prosecution to show whether they were responsible or not.  I do not think we would be going too far if we put the onus on the person who has been responsible for the particular infection.</P>

      <P>The only point about the extreme case is that once the case is brought to court the court will have no option even in cases where there is considerable doubt, but to decide it in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  It is perfectly true that if a person has a room which has been occupied by a person infected with typhoid or typhus, and if he subsequently lets that room without taking proper precautions, to another person who may become infected, the owner should not be allowed to escape responsibility for his neglect, but there is an alternative means of checking neglect and that is to have a penalty imposed on the person responsible. Again the person who became infected would have a good cause of action against the landlord in that particular case.  At the same time the Minister or the local authority could prosecute the landlord.  Certainly it would not alter the opportunity which an infected person would have of taking action and recovering damages against a landlord who is responsible for any lack of the necessary precautions.</P>

      <P>I have every sympathy with the section with which this amendment deals when it tries, I take it, to prevent infected people from infecting others.  I think in the past the law did not go into that matter very closely because I do not suppose that medical science, until quite recently, knew how people were infected with very many diseases. Medical scientists just knew people got diseases but they did not know how they got them.  Although I should like to see every effort made to prevent people from infecting others, I think the section would be strong enough without putting this onus on the person charged.  It seems to me that you might leave a citizen open to what the Americans call a frame-up.  This provision might make it rather easy for certain persons to pretend that they were infected in the hope that they might get some notoriety or damages <Col N="1697" /> out of it.  I sympathise very much with the efforts made to prevent people from infecting others but I think Deputy Cosgrave's amendment would leave the strong part of the section still there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether the section applies to infected persons only.  Must a person who becomes liable to these penalties have been infected himself?  Otherwise, the section would open a very wide door.  Take the case of a milk purveyor. He might possibly be charged with not taking the necessary precautions to prevent milk from becoming infected and spreading typhoid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>A cow keeper is compelled to take precautions to prevent his milk from becoming infected and becoming a possible source of typhoid.  If it can be proved afterwards that he did not take the necessary precautions, if it is found that his milk is infected, and that typhoid may be spread as a result, under this section he is left open without any prior knowledge on his part to action by persons who may become infected with typhoid.  I want to put that aspect of the case.  Is it only a person who has been infected with disease who must take precautions or can any member of the community who fails to take precautions in that respect, become liable under this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The point Deputy Allen has made is a good one.  In cases where vendors of milk are prosecuted, very often the vendor, a retailer or a wholesaler, may have got the milk from another supplier.  If you follow the passage of the milk from the byre to the ultimate seller, it may happen that the infection began a considerable distance from the person who is actually prosecuted.  In fact the usual case is that a person purchases milk which is found to be deficient in fats while that person may have treated it properly or may not have interfered with it in any way.  The milk was originally deficient.  In cases of this kind, <Col N="1698" /> it may well happen that action will be taken against a person who had himself taken adequate precautions but the milk might have been infected before it reached him.  I think the point Deputy Allen made is worthy of examination.  I cannot say that the same thing is likely to happen in the case of letting a room, but in the case of food it is quite likely that the particular commodity was affected by contact at a far earlier period than that at which it reached the individual against whom the action is taken or against whom proceedings might be taken subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>It must be remembered that this refers only to offences under this part of the Act&mdash;that is, against infectious diseases regulations.  Where a person is asked to take precautions and where he fails to take such precautions and another person suffers damages as a result, all these conditions must be fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the case Deputy Cosgrave raised, I would like to put it this way: If you like, it is a rather serious case I am taking.  I am taking the case of a man who has let a room having failed to take the precaution to disinfect after a case of typhus, or as might be more likely, after a case of tuberculosis, and the incoming tenant gets the disease.  The difference between us is this: under the present law that incoming tenant can take action against the landlord and can sue him for damages, but he must prove that he has suffered as a result of the neglect of the landlord.  He never succeds under the present law because, when the question is put to him: &ldquo;Could you not have got it elsewhere?&rdquo; he cannot say no; he must admit it is possible that he could have got it elsewhere.  He may say he is almost certain that he got it in that house.  That is not enough.  The court must dismiss the case because it is not conclusive.  I must say the landlord, in such a case, was very negligent in exposing people to great damage and I do not think it is too hard on him to say that the landlord must prove that he did not get it there.  In other words, instead of putting the question to the complainant, the court must put <Col N="1699" /> the question to the landlord: &ldquo;Can you show that he was likely to get it elsewhere?&rdquo; There is not much difference, but at least we are putting the onus on the landlord to argue that he may have got it elsewhere instead of making the complainant prove that he could not have got it elsewhere. There is not a lot of difference in fact, but there is a great deal of difference in a technical way as far as proving the case in court is concerned.</P>

He subsequently takes action against one of them because possibly he discovers that that individual is suffering from the infectious disease.  He could have contracted it from either or, possibly, from both.  In that particular case it might be impossible for the defendant to prove that he did not <Col N="1700" /> infect the person and, at the same time, it might well happen that the person had been infected as a result of the neglect of the other individual.</P>

      <P>() An Order under this section shall not be made where the Minister is satisfied that adequate precautions are taken in any institution to prevent persons suffering from an infectious disease infecting other persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Reading I mentioned that a number of hospitals&mdash;I think it is almost confined to teaching hospitals; certainly the point at issue affects teaching hospitals only&mdash;have different categories of patients in different wings or words.  If a person or persons are suffering from a particular type of <Col N="1703" /> infectious disease, invariably, I think, adequate precautions are taken to ensure that these patients do not infect or come in contact with other patients. The advantage of that segregation is that medical students are in a position to view patients in the hospital and to diagnose the various types and stages of diseases.  That experience helps them to diagnose rapidly particular diseases and to recognise the different stages of diseases and the various types of infection.</P>
    <P>It has been put to me that if, under the regulations which the Minister has power to make under Section 40, a person suffering, say, from tuberculosis is prohibited from admittance to one of these hospitals, while it might be possible for the student to see such patients in other hospitals and to gain considerable experience from the point of view of diagnosis and from comparison with other patients which ordinarily enables a student to diagnose a particular stage in a disease or a particular type of a disease, that experience may be lost if restrictions are enforced and regulations are made whereby only patients suffering from some ordinary illness, or at any rate not an infectious disease, are entitled to be admitted to particular hospitals. I put this amendment forward so that hospital authorities&mdash;I think it is reasonable to assume that the medical profession would be anxious to take all necessary precautions&mdash;will take these precautions to ensure that no other patients become infected, thus making it possible for permission to be received or granted by the Department whereby these hospitals may have as patients in the hospital people suffering from infectious diseases.</P>

      <P>It will be seen from the next amendment, amendment No. 50, that, possibly, Deputy Cosgrave and I had the same point in mind, although we may not have arrived at the same conclusion.  In amendment No. 50 the word &ldquo;institution&rdquo; includes a department of an institution.  I was rather anxious to meet the case made by Deputy Cosgrave, that is, that infectious diseases could be treated if no <Col N="1704" /> great danger existed in the institution and also the case made to me on behalf of some of the teaching hospitals. I thought the best way out of the difficulty would be to say that the word &ldquo;institution&rdquo; includes a department of an institution.  In other words, that we do not think infectious diseases should be included in a particular department, but that they might be included in some other deparment. My objection to Deputy Cosgrave's amendment is one of administration more than anything else.  It implies a good deal of inspection from time to time to see that there is no danger from infectious diseases being admitted. From the administrative point of view, my own amendment, which follows next, would be easier to work. We will say that there would be no objection in certain wards while there would be in other wards.</P>

      <P>There is a provision in this section that where a district medical officer of health becomes aware that a child residing in his district is verminous, he may serve in the prescribed manner notice on the parent of the child prohibiting the attendance of the child at any school until such district medical officer gives a certificate (for which no charge shall be made) that the child is fit to attend school.  I would ask the Minister to look into that sub-section and see that, in the issue of such a certificate no stigma is cast on the parent of that child.  If a doctor issues a certificate which, I suppose, would have to be presented to the teacher of the school in order to explain the absence of the child definitely stating that the child is verminous, the matter will be more or less public property.  In this connection I think a doctor would be unwilling to hurt the feelings of the person concerned.  If, under this Act, a doctor will be compelled to notify the teacher or all concerned that the child is verminous, I think that it should be sufficient to declare in the certificate that the child is a probable source of infection or infectious disease and thus avoid, in some way or other, the issue of a certificate stating that the child <Col N="1706" /> is verminous.  In my opinion that would be more agreeable even to the medical profession.</P>

In that case the authority could notify a manager that a child was verminous or was in a foul or filthy condition.  We though those words were rather strong and we put them in a milder form. Although the Act is there, I am sure no doctor ever issued a certificate in those words.</P>

      <P>I wonder, with regard to sub-section (1) if that sub-section has been very very carefully considered not only within the Department of Health but between the Department of Health and the Department of Education.  I know and agree with the Minister that we have remedies to our hand at the moment which clean up the particular condition referred to very very rapidly.  We are a long way from that knowledge being within the reach of everybody and of that material reaching everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the definition of &ldquo;verminous&rdquo; in this Bill, a very slight condition constitutes a case of vermin. In certain areas at periods of the year we have a tremendous percentage of such cases in every school.  If the section were to be applied in its fullness all over the country on Monday next, I do not think you would have a 5 per cent. attendance in most rural schools, certainly not until such time as the cleansing machinery had got going, with the medical authorities being made aware of the situation and with the necessary certificates of freedom being given to individuals.  The section may be well intentioned, but <Col N="1707" /> it is much too far-reaching.  There is ample information in the Minister's Department as to the percentage of school children affected with this particular condition and as to how slowly D.D.T. is getting into the homes of the people.  It will take a good two years of intensive propaganda before it becomes an article of ordinary use in the home like soap and water.  When we reach that point, then the number of verminous cases that we will have to deal with will be just 1 or 2 per cent. It would be reasonable to prohibit 1 or 2 per cent. from getting the benefits of education as long as they were suffering from that particular disability. It is not right, however, to prohibit 70 or 80 per cent. from getting such benefits.  We do not feel too comfortable when discussing a thing like this in public, but the percentage of it is terribly high.  If the section were to be implemented in a great number of areas at the present moment it would mean closing nearly all the schools.  I am not opposed to it, but I am asking that full consideration be given not only to what is desired but to the immediate results.</P>

      <P>To add at the end of the section, a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>() Where it appears to the authority or officer enforcing any provision of this Part of this Act or the regulations made thereunder that an offence has been committed in respect of which proceedings might be taken against some person but that such person could establish a defence under paragraph (d) of sub-section (1) of this section by proving that the offence complained of was due to an act or default of some other person, such authority or officer may take proceedings against that other <Col N="1710" /> person without taking proceedings against the first-mentioned person.</P>
    <P>Where a person selling food has a warranty, this will make it possible to take action against the original seller of the food, the wholesaler or the manufacturer as the case may be, instead of taking the action against the seller of the food, that is, the retailer.  It does not prevent the possibility of going back to the retailer if we find he has put us on a false errand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been great need for the introduction of this amendment, but I think it is unwise for the Minister to take power to deal with retailers at all in such cases.  We have had these cases up and down the country, particularly in connection with the infestation of certain foods by accri or mealmites and invariably the traders who got these containers were prosecuted.  While it is true that a notice could be served under the food and drugs code whereby the manufacturers could be prosecuted, there were many legal difficulties. When this matter can be traced to the manufacturers and when it is solely their fault, and when these packets go in sealed containers to the retailers, there should be no liability on the retailers, as they have no way of finding out whether the packets are up to the warranty or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what this amendment is intended to cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make this observation on the matter to which Deputy Moran so properly referred?  I do not know whether public health authorities all over the country have yet awakened to the dilemma in connection with the preparations to which Deputy Moran referred.  They are all preparations of the nature of custard powder or cornflour. The retailer and manufacturer is in this dilemma: you bring in corn starch from the Argentine, and there is no means known to science whereby any person, no matter how vigilant he may be, can discover infestation of that corn starch without the assistance of a microscope.  The mites are not of the character which ordinarily occur in other cereal products.  You may find mites in pig-meal and wheaten offals, <Col N="1711" /> which are tiny black objects easily perceivable, but the infestation of corn starch is by a creature which is truly microscopic.</P>
      <P>What is a manufacturer or shopkeeper to do?  The package of corn starch may on Monday be perfect and, without having broken the seal, without having interfered with the contents, a change takes place between Monday and Tuesday and if that sample is submitted to a public analyst and examined under a microscope it is found to be infested.  It is a very serious hardship on perfectly conscientious distributors to hold them up to the public odium of making them criminally responsible for offering to the public a commodity of that character, when there is no precaution they can take, short of sending a sample every day to a public analyst&mdash;and even if that extravagant plan were adopted, they would not get the report back for at least 48 hours and so it would not be in time to stop the sale.  Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that that problem is one deserving of very special consideration.</P>
      <P>I would be interested if he would indicate whether he knows of any means whereby that problem can be met by manufacturers and distributors; and, if he does, whether he would consider addressing a circular to public health authorities throughout the country describing the method whereby the particular evil to which Deputy Moran refers can be reasonably overcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section deals with all types of food and the amendment is put in to cover cases such as Deputies Moran and Dillon have in mind. Under the section as it stands, it would appear that public health authorities have to take action against whoever is selling the article.  Now they will not have to do that&mdash;if there is a warranty they can go beyond him to the wholesaler, agent or manufacturer and take action at that level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think it is a hardship to make something an offence which is not within the control of the person to be prosecuted? <Col N="1712" /> If he consults the chemical experts and the biological experts of the Department, they will tell him that a package of corn starch may be, from the laboratory point of view, perfect on Monday and, with the seal unbroken, on Tuesday may present all the characteristics of infestation.  Is it justice in these circumstances to hold that person criminally liable, when there is no possible precaution he can take which will avert that occasional occurrence?  I do not for a moment suggest that the public health authority should not be vested with power to require him to dispose of the article once infestation is established and not to offer it for sale, but to prosecute him for having offered it for sale when there was no conceivable possibility of his having a guilty knowledge, seems to be a very extreme hardship and one of which the Minister should take special cognisance.  Has the Minister had that particular problem brought to his attention before, in relation to corn starch?</P>

The difficulty about some of these substances like penicillin is that, if used too widely, they may have the effect of developing bacteria resistant to penicillin which would create a very serious situation. Deputies will agree that penicillin is one of the things which may have to be regulated and we think it wise to cut out these words as set out in the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 71:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (4) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>() Save in so far as is provided for in sub-section (3) of this section no restriction shall be placed on the sale of medical preparations or of substances with proprietary designations by way of confining their distribution to members of specified trades to the exclusion of other wholesale and retail distributors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment of very great importance to a large body of deserving persons in the country.  I refer to the retail merchants in rural Ireland.  To begin with, I want to make it perfectly clear that, so far as the average country shopkeeper is concerned, he has no desire to limit the discretion of the Minister in the making of any regulation designed to prevent the reckless distribution of dangerous therapeutic substances, such as poisons or rare substances which ought to be used with due economy and consideration, such as penicillin, and this amendment is not designed in any sense to place restrictions of that character upon the Minister.  On the contrary, it specifically provides that if a regulation is made by the Minister or with his approval, the retail shopkeeper is prepared to <Col N="1715" /> assume that it is done in the interests of the community at large and to accept it as such.</P>
    <P>The problem to be cured by this amendment has a history.  When the pharmaceutical chemists came to be recognised as a skilled body, a series of Acts of Parliament were passed from time to time giving to the person holding a diploma from the controlling body of the pharmaceutical chemists the right to dispense certain medicines and to deal in certain preparations, notably poisons, to the exclusion of the ordinary shopkeeper.  This arrangement was justified on the ground that people should not be afforded an opportunity generally of purchasing poisons which might be used for felonious purposes, without at least leaving after them a record of their purchase, which should include a reasonable account of what they intended to use the poison for, and so, in every chemist's shop, there is a poison register and if a person goes in to buy strychnine to poison rats or arsenic to poison something els&mdash;if a farmer wants to lay poison on his land for the protection of sheep or a householder to lay poison for the destruction of vermin&mdash;he must declare his purpose to the chemist who will record the quantity of the poisonous substances supplied and the person purchasing must sign that he received it.</P>
    <P>To these arrangements, no reasonable shopkeeper takes the slightest exception, but the original purpose of these arrangements was to ensure that people would not buy poisons for a felonious purpose, that is, to poison their neighbours.  Then the pharmaceutical chemists' association proceeded to introduce a new finesse, that there was a different reason behind this&mdash;not only the purpose of deterring criminals who wanted to poison their neighbours but to deter desperate people from buying it to poison themselves. The moment you could establish that reason for these precautions, a glorious vista opened up, because, if we were prepared to control the sale of certain things in order to deter desperate people from destroying themselves, it was only a short step to saying <Col N="1716" /> that many people, without destroying themselves, can do themselves considerable injury and therefore we ought to confine to pharmaceutical chemists every comestible which, if improperly used, might do the purchaser an injury, and from that position it was a very short step to the position of saying that every therapeutic substance being consumed to excess is capable of doing the person who consumes it an injury and therefore every therapeutic substance ought to be confined to the chemist shop.</P>
    <P>The chemists would defend it on the ground that aspirin, if you swallowed a bottle of it, would do you an injury. That is perfectly true, but when you come to examine the thing more closely, you discover that it was not primarily solicitude for the perils of the purchaser which was moving the pharmaceutical chemists, because the suggestion began to be made that things like cod liver oil should be confined to pharmaceutical chemists.  The pharmaceutical chemist charged 4/6 for a 20-oz. bottle of cod liver oil and the poor, old, despised country shopkeeper only asked 2/6 for it.  If you went in with a prescription to a chemist, when he compounded the prescription he put on the back of it a rubber stamp setting out the date and three or four little hieroglyphics, two of which gave him a reference in his prescription ledger, and two of which belonged to a code employed by every pharmaceutical chemist in the country which told any other chemist to whom that prescription might be brought how much the first fellow charged when he made it up.  So that if you brought in a prescription to a chemist and he charged 3/6, he put a rubber stamp on the back and he managed to put a little cipher on it which would tell the next chemist: &ldquo;Whatever else you do, do not charge this fellow less than 3/6 for the next bottle or you will scandalise me.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing very criminal in that.  They wanted to make their living.  All I am asking is that commodities such as aspirin, cod liver <Col N="1717" /> oil, tooth paste and a variety of other diagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic substances, such as Parish's Food, Angier's Emulsion, Scott's Emulsion and castor oil should continue to be available as the stock-in-trade of the general merchant throughout rural Ireland so that he can make an honest profit out of trading in these things&mdash; I am not pretending that the general merchant is a disinterested benefactor of the community&mdash;and so that the people who live in his neighbourhood, if they find the chemist is charging too much for a 4-ounce bottle of castor oil can go down to the grocer and compare the grocer's price for a 4-ounce bottle of castor oil with that demanded by the chemist, as well as aloes and a variety of other salubrious therapeutic substances of that kind, at which I have no doubt Deputy Dr. Brennan would sometimes be tempted to look down his nose as being somewhat crude.  But there are those in rural Ireland who find their constitution better provided for by a pennyworth of rhubarb and a halfpenny worth of aloes than they do by a bottle of Aliphan.  They can get one remedy for 1½d.; a bottle of Aliphan will cost about 5/6, and the results are virtually identical.  Glauber Salts and Epsom Salts are the stock-in-trade of thousands of shops throughout rural Ireland.  I want to ensure that no Orders will be made restricting their sale which are designed to serve the profit-interest of the pharmaceutical chemist and not the protection of ordinary people.  Therefore I move this amendment so as to ensure that no restrictions will be put upon the sale of these things with the Minister's approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may ask: &ldquo;How can they put a restriction on the sale of these things?  What power have they to make an order under the existing law?&rdquo; None whatever.  Like many a vested interest they have worked out a most subtle procedure in order to arrogate to themselves the power to make laws with no legal authority to do so.  The subtle procedure is this: they go to the wholesale chemist and they say: &ldquo;There are three therapeutic substances which are virtually interchangeable, the preparation, say, of <Col N="1718" /> Eli Lilly and Company, the preparation of Burroughs, Wellcome and Company, the preparation of Parke Davis and Company and the preparation of the United Drug Company.  Now you will either undertake to sell only to the pharmaceutical chemist or the pharmaceutical chemist will not take your preparation at all.&rdquo;  Suppose they go with that challenge to a toothpaste manufacturer and they say: &ldquo;There are Colloidal, Euthymol and Gibbs' Dentifrice.  Unless you agree to sell your dentifrice only to a pharmaceutical chemist, we will not touch it at all.  Therefore, if a person comes into us for toothpaste, we shall sell him Euthymol.  If he asks for Gibbs', we will win him away from Gibbs' and persuade him to take one of the two we stock.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Céad fáilte roimh an Teacht annseo, Deputy.  I am sure the Deputy from Clonmel who has just come in will confirm the tale I am telling now.  The pharmaceutical chemist will then succeed in establishing a monopoly in the sale of these particular commodities and ensure that no, what he would call, unreasonable competition will be set up against him by unskilled shopkeepers who surround him.  The justification advanced by the pharmaceutical chemists is this: that the poor ignoramuses, the common shopkeepers, have not undergone the long period of training the pharmaceutical chemist has undergone; that they are ignorant creatures fit to sell flour, meal and domestic commodities of that character, but when it comes to selling tooth paste, on which there is a 50 per cent. profit, when it comes to selling aspirin, on which there is a very comfortable profit; when it comes to selling anything that is to be found in the pharmaceutical chemist's shop, on which there is never less than 30 and, usually, up to 50 and 70 per cent. profit, it requires a highly skilled and trained operative to ensure the safety of the public in its distribution.  Where the profit is tuppence in 5/-, or a penny in the £, the common shopkeepers can handle that.  Well now, common shopkeepers, of whom I glory to be one, make no claim to act as the custodians of poison goods or other therapeutic <Col N="1719" /> substances, which manifestly should be distributed under the direction and control of the Minister for Health.  But they do expect their ready recognition of the necessity for that control will entitle them to protection from restrictive practices masquerading as control, but really designed to reserve to the aristocrats of the Pharmaceutical Society the most profitable lines which the general grocer in rural Ireland is in a position to sell.  I think that is a reasonable request and it is for that reason I put this amendment down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Pharmaceutical Society ever suggested that the ordinary shopkeeper is an ignoramus.  I never heard a pharmaceutical chemist suggest such a thing. The pharmaceutical chemist is merely asking that the sale of certain articles should be reserved to chemists who, undoubtedly, have to go through a long period of training, who have to attend courses of lectures and who have to pass examinations and obtain a certificate before they are entitled to keep open shop for the sale of these goods. If the ordinary shopkeeper wishes to embark on the sale of the goods which Deputy Dillon speaks of, he can form a limited company.  The only condition is that he should have as managing director a pharmaceutical chemist. There is no reason in the world why an ordinary shopkeeper cannot enter into the sale of these things, with that particular provision.</P>
      <P>The Pharmaceutical Society was founded many years ago.  It is a statutory body and it has certain rights and it is in the exercise of these rights that there is, perhaps, something in the nature of a monopoly.  But in order to have that, they have to go through a pretty rigorous course of training.  I do not think there is anything unreasonable in any craft asking that things pertaining to that craft should be reserved.  That is all the pharmaceutical chemists have asked.  Up to the present, there is no restriction on the sale of things like Aspirin or Aspro &mdash;these are two of the things I heard the Deputy mention.  Any shopkeeper in the country can sell them in competition with the chemist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1720" /> I am hoping that at some future date a Bill will be introduced which will restrict the sale of medicinal preparations to the people who have been trained to sell them.  I must confess I have not studied the amendment the Deputy has been talking to.  The only reason I rose is because Deputy Dillon said that the members of the Pharmaceutical Society who are, I think, in general, fairly decent people, are suggesting that ordinary shopkeepers are just the type of people who might be called ignoramuses.</P>

We might feel sick, just as if we ate too many cakes or too much bread, but Kepler's Malt Extract is in no sense a dangerous therapeutic substance.  Does it require three years' pharmaceutical training to permit a person to purchase a bottle of Cascara Evacuant?  It is the 50 per cent. profit that is worrying the Pharmaceutical Society.  Does it take three years' pharmaceutical training to qualify a man to sell a tin of Sister Laura's Food &mdash;baby food?  If it does, why is he free to sell Neave's Food, Benger's Food, Cow and Gate, and all the other baby foods?  Because the Pharmaceutical Society said to Sister Laura: &ldquo;If you confine it to us, we will push Sister Laura; if you scratch our back, we will scratch yours&rdquo;.

Such a thought never entered their heads! They are only interested because if the common shopkeepers were permitted to handle these goods they would not be distributed with the solicitous discretion which we may expect the pharmaceutical chemists to exercise, inspired solely by the anxiety to ensure that those who must get a dose of liquid paraffin would get it!</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He rose and said that certain things were not controlled.  I am reading a list of things that were controlled that manifestly should not have been controlled.  They were controlled under regulations and by agreements which were made not for the benefit of the community as a whole, but were made to facilitate the earning of excessive profits by a privileged coterie of persons who, in my submission, were using powers conferred on their executive for the purpose of preventing the promiscuous distribution of poisons and dangerous substances, to draw as grist to their own mill a wide variety of profitable articles of commerce, so that, on the one hand, they would have a monopoly of the sale of them and, on the other, as a result of an elaborate system of agreements between their registered members, there would be no undue competition between them which might be calculated to bring down the price which <Col N="1723" /> the consumer was required to pay for the particular commodities which the chemist sought to control.</P>
      <P>I find no particular fault with them. They are just another vested interest, subject to the same temptations and yielding to the same temptations as other vested interests.  I am happy to think that my representations are made on behalf of a body of persons in this country, too large, too miscellaneous, too varied, ever to become a vested interest&mdash;independent, competitive citizens who want no protection, no regulation other than regulations designed to protect the community at large, no subsidy, no privilege, nothing but the opportunity to earn their own living within the law, by legitimate trade procured from their neighbour, as a result of superior service and better value, offered on the hustings in competition with all-comers, on the clear understanding that the more competition there is the better pleased they are.  All they want is a fair field.  That is why I put down the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first place I should like to correct the statement of Deputy Dillon that the Pharmaceutical Society regulates in any way the profits of members of the society. The Pharmaceutical Society enters in no way into the business transactions of chemists as a whole.  There is an association called the Irish Drug Association which operates much in the same way as the Licensed Vintners' Association and which seeks to secure certain advantages for members and representations in regard to business matters are made through that society. I know that quite a number of trade associations arrange that goods can only be supplied to members of that association just as, in the same way, we shall say, as the bicycle people arrange that they will only sell bicycles to members of the Irish Cycle Retailers' Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the pharmaceutical manufacturing firms decide that they will sell goods only through pharmaceutical chemists, I do not think that there is anything unlawful or unjust about that arrangement. Quite a number of the articles <Col N="1724" /> which Deputy Dillon read out here this evening are manufactured by firms who have decided in the interests of these firms, perhaps in the interest of the public also, to sell goods which they manufacture through pharmaceutical chemists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>At the suggestion of whom?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course that is a very old idea.  I have been in business ever since 1910 and I knew of this arrangement when I first started as an apprentice in 1910.  It is nothing new, or as Deputy Dillon suggests, something which started during the last war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I agree it is an old story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned some articles including vaseline of which we secured a monopoly during the war.  Actually, so far as I can remember, I could not get any vaseline during the war.  We did get soft paraffin but for five or six years I did not see any vaseline until the war was over. It is on the market now again.  I admit that some of the commodities that he mentioned like Cascara Evacuant, Euthymol, and Hydrogen Peroxide solution are sold through chemists but again it is the firms who manufacture these commodities who decide that they will sell only through chemists. So far as our prices are concerned, the prices are arranged in conjunction with the prices section of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  If we get pretty substantial profits, taking into consideration the small turnover of the average chemist's shop, if the shop is to be there at all, it is necessary that these profits should be made.  I do not believe that a chemist's shop would be able to exist if it were confined to selling articles within a certain limited range and if it were compelled to sell them at a profit less than chemists are actually trying to secure at present.  It is news to me at any rate that the general public, for whom Deputy Dillon thinks he speaks, looks upon chemists as a class of people who are trying to secure an unfair monopoly.  I think they look upon chemists much in the same way <Col N="1725" /> as they look upon a carpenter who is carrying out his duties in such a manner as to ensure that he will get work that a carpenter should get.  In the same way, the chemist seeks to get the type of work which the chemist should get.  When I see stuffs that should properly be sold by chemists on sale in shops all over the country, I do not make an objection but I think we are perfectly entitled to fight to see that the sale of these goods should be confined to chemists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>One is constrained to admire the moderation and reasonableness of Deputy Loughman's approach, no matter how deeply I find myself at variance with him.  I put it to him, if we restrict to the pharmaceutical chemists the duty of compounding prescriptions, the distribution of poisons, dangerous and scarce therapeutic substances, surely these are that part of his work which is analogous to the craft of the carpenter.  I submit that these are to a pharmaceutical chemist what sugar, tea and jam are to a grocer and that there is then a wide variety of cosmetics, soap, and other articles which may with equal propriety be found in the shop of a pharmaceutical chemist, a general merchant, a cosmetician, a hairdresser.  The more people who are engaged in the distribution of these innocuous substances, the better it will be for the purchasing community in that the competition which will take place between this wide variety of merchants for the custom of their neighbours, will be calculated to bring down prices, to improve service and to increase the amenities to which the average consumer will have access. That is all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am 100 per cent. with Deputy Loughman&mdash;I do not think it would be right to allow the grocer to encroach on the specialist trade of the pharmaceutical chemist.  The difference that arises between Deputy Loughman and me is where should the line of delimitation be drawn.  I want to draw it as narrowly as possible so that, outside that line on the pharmaceutical chemist's side on the one hand and the grocer's on the other hand, there should be free competition for the <Col N="1726" /> innocuous substances which either or both of them may offer for sale.  It is because I feel that the Drug Association or the Pharmaceutical Society or whatever you may call it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In sub-section (5) (a), line 6, after the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;on his signifying his willingness in writing to the health authority.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1729" /> The position created by these sections of this Bill is rather peculiar and, in my opinion, rather unique.  The result of these sections is that a considerable number of officers in the public health service will have their present appointments terminated by a sub-section of this Act and will find themselves, the day after this Bill becomes an active law, in very different appointments carrying much greater responsibility, far more headaches and greatly increased duties.  I do not think the matter was fully considered by the Department, at least before they adopted the particular procedure they did adopt, that is, to insert this in a Bill, to bring it before Parliament, to pass it to the newspapers, and then let the officers affected learn about it through that machinery.  I think that aspect of the matter was never considered. I do not believe that with any form of agent or servant an employer would decide &ldquo;We are going to alter that person's title.  We are going to alter that person's duties.  We are going to give that person much greater responsibility, but we will not even discuss the matter with him and we will not even give him an opportunity of saying &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no&rdquo;&rsquo;.  I do not want to show any pique or anything of that kind but, to begin with, it was a thoroughly discourteous way in which to treat a large number of officers who deserve better.</P>
    <P>I do not believe, however, that the Department was fully aware of the gigantic change it was making in the responsibilities of the people we are discussing.  I do not believe that they adverted to the fact that without even discussion, without consent, they were changing the whole basis of contract between these particular officers and the various counties to which they had contracted their services.  I do not believe, even, that consideration or full consideration was given to the fact that the new officers we are creating here would, in very many cases, require a quite different type of official to carry out efficiently and successfully the new responsibilities which are being forced by law on these particular officers.  Let me explain the magnitude of the change made&mdash;the change made <Col N="1730" /> without consultation, notification, discussion or consent.  Each one of these officers referred to in this part of the Bill is a qualified medical practitioner. They specialised in public health&mdash;preventive medicine.  They went before the Appointments Commission and they received appointments through the Appointments Commission in the various administrative areas whether as county medical officers of health or assistant county medical officers of health.  The medical work in every administrative area was, in the past, inside two fields with a high fence between the two fields.  The smaller field was the field of public health&mdash; preventive medicine.  The functions of these men, up to the time this Bill becomes law, and their responsibilities, have been strictly confined within the field of public health.  Outside and beyond that there was the other far larger field&mdash;poor law institutions.  All the work of a multiplicity of dispensary districts and all of the medical institutions in the country was on the poor law side.</P>
    <P>In the field of public health the duties and responsibilities were, in the main, confined to preventive medicine, infectious diseases, cleanliness of food, Milk and Dairies Act, slaughterhouses, tuberculosis, the clinical diagnosis and clinical treatment of tuberculosis, plus certain supervisory duties with regard to the notification of births and marriages.  Housing also came within the field of public health. I would say that from about 20 to 25 per cent. of the medical work in the county fell into the public health zone. Seventy-five to 80 per cent. fell in the poor law medical zone.  By a line in one sub-section of an Act you make all the officers who were responsible purely for the limited field of public health take on responsibility for the whole field of medical work inside their administrative area.  Every bit of trouble, every bit of friction, every irregularity, every lack of attention, every complaint made inside any of the poor law medical institutions in a county will become the headache of the county medical officer of the future who used to be the county medical officer of health.  You make him by <Col N="1731" /> sub-section (1) of Section 64 responsible for advising the health authority generally in relation to health, etc., as well as for all duties assigned and functions of the health authority.  Under sub-section (3) you make him the chief medical officer for the county for the purposes of this Bill.</P>
    <P>This is not a matter, I think, about which there should be any controversy or disagreement.  To a certain extent, we can both appreciate the facts as we are up against them.  There should not be any dispute as to whether you are, or are not, altering to an immense extent the position of these officers as well as increasing their responsibilities to an immense extent.  The county medical officer of health is an officer on the staff of the county manager, and the latter has responsibility for all work in the county.  Let us take it that there is trouble or that there is work to be done, advice to be given or something to be investigated within the field of public health.  Up to the date that this Bill becomes law, the county manager's staff officer is the county medical officer of health and his assistant, but if there is any trouble in a medical institution, any adverse report, any complaints from patients, any suggestion of lack of proper supervision or of prompt attention, and if the county manager refers that to the county medical officer of health, he is, and always has been, within his rights in saying: &ldquo;That is the field of poor law medicine and I cannot encroach on that field&rdquo;.  Since the introduction of the managerial system, medical inspectors from the Minister's Department have visited the various districts.  They have called the county manager, the secretary for the county and the medical officers together and, in the presence of the county medical officers, they have warned the administrative side that they cannot, and must not, use the services of the county medical officers of health in relation to anything on the poor law side.</P>
    <P>That was the position up to the date of the introduction of this Bill.  By its introduction, and by knocking out the words &ldquo;of health&rdquo; the county medical officer is to be made responsible for <Col N="1732" /> all the medical work under this Bill as well as for all the institutions within his administrative area.  I think it is beyond argument that you are changing his appointment, that you are vastly increasing his responsibilities. His fitness for the new position is quite another matter.  It is purely one of opinion, but I think his right to be consulted before he is pitch-forked into this new office, should be unquestionable. The position that has arisen, and that will arise, is that all those people who are affected are going to find themselves faced with very much greater responsibilities than they ever had to carry before, with very many more headaches and more worries, doing a type of work that will, and must, if it is to be conscientiously carried out, lead to conflict between themselves and their medical colleagues within their administrative area.  The suggestion in the amendment is that that should only be done after they have signified their willingness, in writing, to take on these new duties.  The amendment, as it were, merely raises the whole question.  I do not think that, if the amendment were carried it would be the wisest course, because if nine or ten officers did not signify their willingness to take on the new duties imposed on them I do not know what the position would be.  It would mean that this Health Bill and the new services would break down completely, in their particular areas.  I do not think that, if such an amendment were inserted and if a person did not signify his willingness to take on the new duties, there would be any justification for dismissing him.  What would happen is that he would be paralysing the machine in his particular administrative area.  That would be an entirely unthinkable attitude and, as far as I know, would not be adopted by any of them.</P>
    <P>The alternative is to discuss with the officers in question their new responsibilities, their new functions and their greatly increased duties in order to induce them to face those new responsibilities with the same enthusiasm and willingness with which they faced their old duties.  I have heard it argued that no change is being made in the <Col N="1733" /> position of these men, and that we are not increasing their responsibilities or their duties.  That is one leg of the argument, but anybody who knows anything about medicine in the various administrative areas under the Department of Local Government knows that there is no foundation whatever for that particular argument.  The other leg of the argument is that it is a bad principle, one that could not be accepted, to increase the remuneration of a whole-time officer because of increased duties and responsibilities. That argument is equally untenable. It is an argument that would blast sky-high the Civil Service, the Army and all State services if you were to apply it to them.  The civil servant when he joins as a junior is a whole-time civil servant.  When the efficient man gets promotion, he gets increased responsibilities and against that he gets increased remuneration, but he is a whole-time State officer all the time. Where does the principle apply?  The principle of increased remuneration, with promotion, with increased responsibilities, with added duties and with added worries, is the soundest principle in the world and is one that makes for bringing out the best, one that makes for keenness, one that gives a person an ambition to succeed and the determination to get on.  But for the first time, as far as I know, in the legislation of this or any other country, the Minister and Parliament by law abolish the office held by a number of people, by law put them into a new office, without even informing them, without even consulting them, pile on immense new responsibilities and make no provision whatever for any compensation for the vastly increased duties.</P>
    <P>That is the principle contained in all these sections that I read out.  It is the same principle applied to different officers.  The amendment which is down here for the first is similar in form in all the other cases.  I would like to hear from the Minister some statements to the effect (1) that there was no intentional discourtesy, and (2) that it would not be the policy of his Department when dealing with the medical man, the civil servant, the engineer or the wage earner, to change his job, <Col N="1734" /> increase his responsibilities and increase his work without consulting him and, further, without any suggestion as to how it is proposed to remunerate or compensate him.</P>

      <P>First of all, I am afraid I will have to disagree with Deputy Dr. O'Higgins in his interpretation of the section.  Sub-section (1) is very little different&mdash;in fact, there may be some difference in words, but I think there is no difference in meaning&mdash;from Section 21 (6) of the Local Government Act, 1925.  In that Act it was laid down that a county medical officer of health will advise the council on any matter where expert advice is required on matters affecting the health of his county or district.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was not any difference in the meaning and it was not intended that there should be.  This section was brought in to codify what had gone before.  Changing the name does not make any material difference, as I am sure the Deputy will admit.  In regard to county medical officers of health, there is, first of all, a change of title.  As far as the other provisions in this section are concerned, they are merely consolidating and do not go further than that.  I do not think it can be contended that in this Bill the duties or responsibilities are increased.  It is a matter to be decided whether they will get extra duties or not.</P>
      <P>I certainly meant no discourtesy to the medical officers of health.  When this section was put before me&mdash;as it stands now; I do not think I suggested any amendment&mdash;the note I got with it was that it was merely a consolidatory section and made no change in the present law except in regard to change in title.  I can assure the Deputy that there was no intention of any discourtesy. What is more, I do not think I ever subscribed to the principle that, in the case of a medical officer, increased duties or responsibilities should not be accompanied in any circumstances by increased remuneration.</P>

      <P>That is a matter which should be considered.  I would make this appeal to the Deputy&mdash;this is not, perhaps, the place or the time to discuss this matter fully and we might only do harm if we were to argue the matter out in every detail here.  The intention in this Bill is that the county medical officer of health would take over the health services of the county. He will be responsible for these, as he was in the past.</P>

      <P>Public health services. As I pointed out on the Second Reading, whereas he had to do a good deal of the work in regard to inspection in the past, that will be done by district medical officers in the future and he will have the supervision.  It is a matter to be decided whether the duties and responsibilites are increased or not.  As regards institutions and so on, that is again a matter to be discussed and decided, whether the medical officer of health would be responsible for those institutions or not. These matters will come up for discussion when we get down to working out in detail the regulations under the Bill.</P>
      <P>To go back to the White Paper, when it comes to be put into its final form, some of these matters may come up for discussion with regard to the exact part the county medical officer of health will take in the county and what part will be played by the other medical men of the various grades and classes.  I do not think the Deputy is right in assuming that we have so far made any change.  If I am convinced by the medical officers of health that they are in fact getting more work to do, more duties to perform, more responsibility and so on, I would be quite willing to listen to the case for remuneration to suit the new duties and new responsibilities.  But we will have to wait until we see what those duties and responsibilities are going to be.  I do not think we can discuss that very minutely at this stage.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister in that.  I feel acutely uncomfortable in discussing this here and <Col N="1736" /> think it would be much better discussed elsewhere.  It is rather unfortunate that these discussions, and many of them, did not take place before the people concerned were faced with the sections we have before us.  I have been for practically 20 years a medical officer of health and have been watching the poor law administration alongside me and I can read, although not always understand, an Act of Parliament; and I know the meaning of simple English words.  Taking those things together, I see sub-section (3) here:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The county medical officer for a county shall be the chief medical officer for the county for the purposes of this Act.</P>
      <P>Managers are not medical men and are not specialists, and the people we are talking about are staff officers of the manager.  Medical worries are coming before them every day; institutional worries are coming before them every day, and complaints are coming before them, although not every day.  There are matters to be investigated in many institutions and many dispensary districts. The very minute this section goes through, what will any manager who knows his job do?  He will utilise his staff officer&mdash;I think that ought to be obvious to everybody&mdash;and the mere utilisation of his staff officer for the purposes of the Act means very increased worries and increased responsibilities on that staff officer or those staff officers&mdash;the kind of worry and responsibility that may lead to strained relations between himself and his professional colleagues under circumstances which may arise in any district at any time.  We can leave it at that.</P>

The Minister will agree that county surgeons and physicians are working under great disadvantages by reason of the fact that they have not got bacteriologists. I quite appreciate that it would be too expensive to have a bacteriologist for each county, but I was wondering if it would be possible to have one appointed for three counties combined such as Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon. As I say, physicians and surgeons are working under great disadvantages and I should like the Minister to indicate what he proposes to do in this connection.</P>

      <P>(1)  Where an enactment repealed by this Act (in this section called &ldquo;the repealed enactment&rdquo;) conferred powers and duties on a sanitary authority and corresponding powers and duties are conferred by this Act on a health authority, the following provisions shall have effect:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  every person who, immediately before the repeal of the repealed enactment, is the holder in a permanent capacity of an office under a sanitary authority the duties of which relate solely to the powers and duties conferred on such sanitary authority by such repealed enactment, shall become and be the holder of the same office under the health authority in whose functional area the district of such sanitary authority is situated,</P>
      <P>(b)  the said office under a sanitary authority shall, for the purposes of any enactment relating to superannuation, be deemed not to have been abolished.</P>
      <P>(c)  if any question arises as to whether the duties of a particular office under a sanitary authority relate solely to powers and duties conferred on such sanitary authority by the repealed enactment, such question shall be referred to the Minister whose decision shall be final.</P>
      <P>(2)  The following provisions shall apply in relation to every person who, immediately before the commencement of this section, held, in a permanent capacity, an office under the title of sanitary sub-officer under a sanitary authority:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  such person shall become and be the holder of an office under the <Col N="1739" /> same title under the health authority whose functional area includes the functional area of the sanitary authority,</P>
    <P>(b)  the said office under the sanitary authority shall, for the purposes of any enactment relating to superannuation, be deemed not to have been abolished,</P>
    <P>(c)  the holder of the office of sanitary sub-officer under a health authority shall (in addition to performing duties in relation to the functions of the health authority) perform such duties as may be assigned to him in relation to the functions of any sanitary authority in the functional area of such health authority and for that purpose the provisions of paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 10, and of Section 20 of the Act of 1941 relating to the duties of officers and of sub-section (2) of the said Section 10 relating to appeals by officers shall apply in relation to the said office as if it were also an office under the sanitary authority of every sanitary district in the functional area of such health authority.</P>
    <P>Holders of certain offices, including that of sanitary sub-officer, under sanitary authorities, will be transferred to similar offices under the health authorities. Sanitary sub-officers are concerned and nurses engaged on maternity and child welfare work, which is at present run by the sanitary authority.

      <P>In sub-section (1), to delete the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in line 17, and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The sub-section reads at present:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may by Order establish a council to be called &lsquo;The National Health Council&rsquo; to give to the Minister when so required by him advice on matters affecting or incidental to the health of the people.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision is mixed up with a general kind of suggestion that the Minister may, at any time he requires special advice, establish a special consultative council to give him advice or assistance on any particular matter.  In the first place, I think these two ideas should be separated entirely in the Bill. I think that the idea of a National Health Council, whether set up with statutory powers or merely for the purpose of being an advisory council to the Minister, should be completely separated from the general power that the Minister may wish to have to set up special consultative councils for some <i>ad hoc</i> purpose or some special idea.  I think that it degrades and minimises the idea of a National <Col N="1742" /> Health Council, even as an advisory council, to simply make it part of a section that gives additional and other powers.</P>
    <P>There are two amendments in my name.  The one which I am moving now is to make it obligatory on the Minister to have a National Health Council to advise him on certain matters.  The second amendment goes further.  It provides that the National Health Council will have constitutional powers, functions and duties established by law.  The Minister indicated that his view of a National Health Council is that they would be just an advisory body.  He would call them together and, from time to time, there would be matters that he would refer to them for their consideration and opinion; and from time to time perhaps they might assemble themselves and make representations to the Minister with regard to certain matters that they considered advisable to do or to consider.  The Minister has not given any indication as to what his final idea is with regard to either the constitution of the National Health Council or their powers, functions and duties.  He simply says that, as far as the powers, functions and duties are concerned, he will only regard them as an advisory body.  He has not indicated that they will be a body that can assemble on their own initiative and consider matters and, even though having no power of any kind, will still be in a position to advise the Minister or to make representations to him on any matter that they might decide on.</P>
    <P>I want the Bill amended in such a way that it shall be obligatory on the Minister to have a National Health Council.  The Minister may say that, except the council is to have some power, making it obligatory on the Minister to have a council would serve no particular purpose, because, if he did not want to be bothered with a genuine council he could assemble a bogus one, the members of which would give him a guarantee that they would not worry him in any way or say anything to him on any subject he did not ask them to consider.  I do not think that would be a sound argument to put up.  I think that if we laid down in our legislation that the Minister should <Col N="1743" /> have a National Health Council, no Minister could appoint a National Health Council that would not be truly and equitably representative of the profession in its various branches.  Therefore, I press on the House that, even if the Minister is only to regard the National Health Council as an advisory body, the section ought to make it obligatory that such a council will be set up.  I should like a decision on that point by itself.  We can then discuss the matter further on amendment No. 90.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that it might not be very easy to decide straightaway what powers, functions and duties we should give the National Health Council and to define them so precisely that we would be prepared to put them into a piece of legislation.  I appreciate that we are advancing in the matter when the Minister agrees <Col N="1744" /> to make it a statutory requirement on him to have a National Health Council. Having gone so far, I think it is desirable that we should discuss the matter a little more and try to see what exactly the Minister's outlook is on the matter and get as clear an idea from him as we can how it will be constituted and the kind of duties that he expects to give it.</P>
      <P>I think it is desirable in discussing the matter that we should refer to the recommendation made by the Commission on Vocational Organisation which was invited by the Government to review the whole of the social and economic organisations in the country and to suggest in what way the various vocations and the various sections of the community with specialist functions could give of their best to the work of the country as a whole.  It approached the examination in that particular way and it made certain recommendations as to how the professions could, in an organic way, develop their organisation so as to make them, in so far as their own sphere was concerned, self-governing to such an extent that they could give the best from their own experience to the nation.</P>
      <P>The commission approached this matter on the lines that that could and would be done, without reference to any particular kind of political organisation or society here.  In relation to the Council of Health, they gave general ideas as to how that council ought to be set up from the point of view of representation and from the point of view of function.  In paragraph 543, the commission recommended unanimously that a Council of Health be established and constituted more or less as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I.  Representatives of central and local authorities:</P>
      <P>One from Department of Local Government and Public Health.</P>
      <P>One from Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>One from the General Council of County Councils.</P>
      <P>One from the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland.</P>
      <P>II.  Representatives of medical profession, to be appointed by the Medical Professional Board:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1745" /> One from the Medical Research Council.</P>
    <P>One from the teaching bodies.</P>
    <P>One from the voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>One county medical officer of health.</P>
    <P>One dispensary doctor.</P>
    <P>One general medical practitioner in private practice.</P>
    <P>III.  Representatives of other professions, to be appointed by their respective professional boards:</P>
    <P>One dentist.</P>
    <P>One veterinary surgeon.</P>
    <P>One nurse.</P>
    <P>One engineer or architect.</P>
    <P>One chemist.</P>
    <P>One pharmacist.</P>
    <P>IV.  Representatives of other organisations:</P>
    <P>One from the National Health Insurance Society.</P>
    <P>One from the voluntary bodies, e.g., the Red Cross Society.</P>
    <P>One from the Council of Education.</P>
    <P>One from the National Conference of Agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That gives an idea of the scope of the representation that the commission considered was necessary on a Council of Health.  They then went on to discuss what the function of the council ought to be, and the report says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The function of the council should be to advise, to co-ordinate and to plan.</P>
    <P>It should serve first of all as a consultative body, possessed of specialised knowledge, information and experience, to which the Minister could look for technical advice on public health problems.  It should examine and report to the Oireachtas on proposed public health legislation. It should ensure that in housing schemes the requirements of public health in regard to drainage, sewerage, sanitation and hygiene are met.</P>
    <P>Its second function should be to co-ordinate the work of the many isolated and independent agencies interested in public health, to eliminate overlapping and to secure unified effort for agreed objectives.  It should <Col N="1746" /> be the organ to stimulate public interest and co-operation in health services and should be a sensitive interpreter of the needs and complaints of the public.  Thirdly, it should act as a planning body to draw up a long-term programme for the development of health services, stressing preventive rather than remedial measures.  It should encourage research in public health with a view towards constant improvement and progress along the latest scientific lines.  A positive constructive policy is most desirable in regard to dietetics and pure food, domestic and public hygiene, physical training and fitness.  Obviously, its plans must be practical in relation to the taxable capacity of the country, and our available resources.</P>
    <P>Among its more immediate tasks the council might make a survey of the present state of public health, the causes of death and the incidence of diseases; it might review the present &lsquo;red ticket&rsquo; service and dispensary system and consider how far adequate medical, dental, hospital and maternity services are provided at reasonable cost for persons of small or moderate means.</P>
    <P>Such a council would need a standing executive committee and a permanent secretariat and should have power to appoint its own full-time director who should not be a civil servant.  The amount and importance of its work would involve a number of meetings in each year and the appointment of sub-committees for special problems.  It should issue an annual report to be sent to the Oireachtas.  The expenses of the council should be borne by the State by means of a grant-in-aid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it well at this stage to call attention to the nature and scope of the recommendations made by the Commission on Vocational Organisation. The Minister, I admit, is taking a step which will, I am sure, have its effect in helping on the organic growth of a council of this kind, representative of the various bodies that are mentioned here.  But I would like to ask him whether he has considered the implications of the recommendations <Col N="1747" /> that are made here with regard to the unique position of the professional organisations connected with medicine and the fact that they have a unique and a specialised type of advice to give and I suggest that they ought not to be coerced into particular lines of policy that would not evolve naturally from their own lines of thought and that they ought not to be subjected to mere Departmental control either in dealing with matters that they consider should be dealt with, or restricting their views or their consideration of the problems that require to be considered.</P>
    <P>I think it is particularly important, while the Minister is taking the step that he is taking, that he would make it clear that the council of health that he is appointing will have power of initiative, will have initiative of its own in considering matters that affect either the public health or the general education and outlook of the people on their own health problems.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us what his attitude is to that type of initiative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The approach of the Vocational Organisation Commission is very interesting and exhaustive.  We can follow it to a great extent, and will naturally do so.  I suppose any persons thinking over these problems would be inclined to think in the same direction in looking for advice.  First of all, regarding the constitution of the organisation, I think many of the bodies suggested there would be asked to give us help.  Maybe I might be inclined to weight some of them more than others.  On the other hand, I do not think I would approve of having a representative from what is referred to there as the Department of Local Government and Public Health&mdash;I would not agree with that.  I think the council should be composed of people outside the Department entirely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards their work, when the Vocational Organisation Commission were considering this view they had in mind the building up of a vocational body from the bottom upwards, and they must have had in mind people who would be practically whole-time. <Col N="1748" /> I have in mind men who are very busy &mdash;good men are usually very busy&mdash;in their own professions.  I do not think I could expect that they would give more than ten or 12 days in the year. That would mean a meeting every month.  In fact, they may think it hard to give that much time and, therefore, it will be largely a matter of advice.</P>
    <P>It says here that the consultative body shall be composed of people with specialised knowledge, information and experience.  I agree with that, but unless we take them over completely, in what way can we avail of their services? We must remember that these people with knowledge and experience will have to make a living and, therefore, they can give only part of their time.  I do not think they would have very much more time than to examine the proposals and regulations that we put before them for an expression of their views.</P>
    <P>If you go on to the second function, to eliminate overlapping and secure unified effort for agreed objectives, we could not possibly ask that council to take the initiative in that respect.  I think it would be only fair that they would say: &ldquo;Well, let the Department provide a plan, put it before us and we will tell them what we think of it.&rdquo; Again, the commission say: &ldquo;It should act as a planning body to draw up a long-term programme for the development of health services.&rdquo;  You could not expect these people to do that. The Department will have to do that but that is the type of thing that would be put before the consultative council for their views when it is drawn up.  Again, they say: &ldquo;The council might make a survey of the present state of public health.&rdquo;  Let the Department make the survey and let them see the result of that.  I think that what will happen naturally will be, that the Department will do the investigation and the reporting and put its reports before the Health Council and get the Health Council's mind on it.</P>
    <P>It is true, of course, that the Vocational Organisation Commission suggests that they should have their own staff.  I would not agree with that.  I think that would only lead to confusion&mdash;that they should have a staff <Col N="1749" /> to make these investigations and reports which would be going at the same time into the Department of Health.  I think that on the whole if they are appointed as an advisory body&mdash;and I am quite sure they will give good advice&mdash;that we shall be going as far as we can at the moment.  I do not know how things may turn out in a few years' time; perhaps then we may look at it in a different way and be inclined to look further in the direction suggested by the Commission on Vocational Organisation.</P>

      <P>The second question is: will they be provided with some element of a secretariat?  There is financial provision for travelling expenses and for subsistence allowances of the members but there is no provision for a secretary to the chairman or to the council as a whole.  There is no provision to give the council as a whole a small nucleus, at any rate, of a secretariat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly would encourage members of the council to put down matters for discussion if they wish to do so.  Any member may send in a matter for the agenda and that will come up for discussion after the usual notice.  Some arrangement will also be made that if two or three members want to have a meeting, that meeting will be called.  As regards a secretariat, there will be an officer of the Department who will carry out the secretarial work at the meetings and he will be available, naturally, to send out any reports or any documents they may need.  If the chairman wants to send a special letter to the members, suggesting that a special meeting might be called for instance, of course that officer will be available for that purpose. I do not see what further secretariat would be required.  A secretary <Col N="1750" /> would be only required in connection with the meetings.</P>

      <P>(1)  A health authority may make arrangements for providing ambulances or other means of transport for the conveyance of patients from places in their functional area to places in or outside such area or from places outside their functional area to places in such area.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where a person makes use of an ambulance provided under this section, a health authority may, at their discretion but subject to any relevant regulations under Section 27 of this Act:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  make a charge for such use in accordance with regulations made by them, or</P>
      <P>(b)  make no charge therefor.</P>
      <P>(3)  A charge under sub-section (2) of this section for the use of an ambulance by any person may be recovered as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction from:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  such person, or, in case such person has died, his legal personal representative, or</P>

    <P>I was afraid on reconsideration that the section as it stood was hardly wide enough.  We suggest the new section instead because it is possible that it might be held that ambulances could only be used for the work of the health authority in connection with its own institutions.  It might be necessary for the health authority to send an ambulance to a voluntary hospital in some cases.  We are providing for a contingency of that kind in the amendment.</P>

I would like to ask the Minister whether it is his intention to have such consultations before the final passing of this Act with organised medical opinion in this country and whether he is on the other hand proposing to repeal the four Vaccination (Amendment) Acts here and whether he is going to wait for some time to consult medical opinion on the matter.</P>

      <P>In paragraph (5) provision may be made for the requiring of adult persons to remain away from specified places or the parents of children to keep the children away from specified places.  I assume the intention of that paragraph is to empower the Minister to make regulations prohibiting children who are suffering from infectious disease from going to school or church and to prohibit adults from going to any specified place to which the public have access.  I agree that in certain cases of very grave infectious disease it is right that this power should be in the Bill but it is necessary that in making the regulations steps should be taken to ensure that they are so framed that they will not prevent an adult person or child from attending Divine Service in case <Col N="1756" /> of infectious disease which is not very grave.  There are various forms of infectious disease, some grave and others not so grave.  Steps should be taken to ensure that this prohibition on persons attending Divine Service does not apply to minor forms of infectious disease.</P>

I raised that matter on another section and was told that it was covered by the Schedule.  I am anxious to know if this particular paragraph gives power to ensure that all second-hand clothing offered for sale to the public is subjected to inspection or disinfection or disinfestation. It is appalling to see second-hand clothing being hawked from one town to another and offered for sale when, as far as I know, there is no guarantee or assurance that any steps have been taken to disinfect or disinfest it.  That is a serious matter which would require to be dealt with under this or some similar regulation.</P>

      <P>The first question the Deputy raised was in connection with paragraph (5) of the Schedule with regard to people suffering from infectious disease being prohibited from going into any public place.  That, of course, again, is a rehash of a power already there under the Public Health Act, 1878.  I could not give any undertaking, of course, how that will be worked in any particular instance.  It may be necessary in certain cases to prohibit persons even going to church but I do not think medical officers of health will be restrictive unless they find it absolutely necessary.  We have power, as regards second-hand clothes, to disinfect and inspect, etc.  Generally speaking the regulations can be enlarged. If anything is left out we can come along and make it right.  The Schedule only gives an indication.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Scheme, 1947, prepared by the Minister for Defence, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, under the terms of the Defence Forces (Pensions) Act, 1932 (No. 26 of 1932), and the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Act, 1938 (No. 33 of 1938), and laid before the House on 28th May, 1947, be confirmed.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the explanation of the scheme, I wish to point out that the scheme as made by me and approved by the Minister for Finance differs in two respects from the copies of the scheme circulated to Deputies.</P>
      <P>In the scheme as made and approved the figure and letter 9 (a) appear in Article 14, sub-Article (1) (b) after the figure 9, and in Article 42, sub-Article (3) (b) the words &ldquo;and less than 21 years&rdquo; do not appear.</P>
      <P>Again, in the White Paper which has been circulated there are two obvious misprints which Deputies, no doubt, will have noticed for themselves.</P>
      <P>In the paragraph dealing with Article 7, the figures &ldquo;1924&rdquo; should read &ldquo;1934&rdquo; and in the paragraph dealing with Article 8 the figures &ldquo;1934&rdquo; should read &ldquo;1924&rdquo;.  There was a transposition of the figures.</P>
      <P>The principal features of this amendment to the Defence Forces Pensions Scheme, 1937, are briefly as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1758" /> 1.  To provide an increase of 30 per cent. for the pensions, technically known as retired pay, of officers retired or retiring on or after 2nd September, 1946.</P>
    <P>2.  To provide an increase in the basic pensions for other ranks and at the same time to provide for the first time an additional pension of 7/- a week for married soldiers discharged on or after 2nd September, 1946.</P>
    <P>3.  To provide increased rates of gratuity for soldiers.</P>
    <P>4.  To provide increased rates of pension for the Army nursing service.</P>
    <P>5.  To provide special gratuities for existing officers of the naval service.</P>
    <P>6.  To provide added notional years' service in certain circumstances for officers on retirement.</P>
    <P>7.  To remove certain restrictions imposed by the principal scheme.</P>
    <P>The 30 per cent. increase in the retired pay of officers is provided for in Article 14 (1) of this amending scheme. Deputies will note that the increase extends to every type of retirement covered by the scheme.  Broadly speaking, the scheme visualises three different types of retirement according as (a) an officer retires in the normal course either after 20 years' service or thereafter on reaching the age for retirement prescribed for his rank by Defence Force Regulation, or (b) he has to retire compulsorily in the interests of the service or on grounds of ill-health, or (c) he may of his own volition wish to retire after completing 12 but with less than 20 years' service. Each of these three types of retirement carries a different scale of pension, but the 30 per cent. increase applies to all without exception.</P>
    <P>The rates of pension for men discharged on or after 2nd September, 1946, with 21 years' service have also been increased.  The increase in the basic pension is about 12½ per cent. but as we are now, for the first time, providing for a married pension of 7/- a week, the over-all increase is more than 60 per cent.  The new rates of pension are provided in Article 22 (1) of the amending scheme and the married pension <Col N="1759" /> by Article 22 (3).  In the principal scheme no increase in rates was allowed if a man continued in service beyond 21 years, but Article 22 (2) now provides that for every year beyond 21, he will be entitled to an extra 1/- a week within a maximum of 10/- a week.  The increase in the basic rates as well as the additional married rates of pension will also operate in the case of soldiers who have 15 years' service or more but less than 21 years and who are discharged on grounds of disability. This is the effect of Article 24.</P>
    <P>As regards the new rates of gratuity for soldiers provided by Article 26, it will be seen that instead of the old flat rate of £1 a year for each year of service irrespective of rank, the new scheme discriminates between ranks and also provides different rates within these ranks for men with service up to seven years, seven to 13 years and 13 to less than 21 years' service.  Privates with up to seven years' service will be entitled to 30/- a year, corporals and sergeants to 40/- a year and higher non-commissioned ranks to 50/- a year for each year of service.  If they serve beyond seven years, the rates will be 60/-, 80/- and 100/- respectively, and if they serve beyond 13 years and do not qualify for a pension, the rates will be 90/-, 120/- and 150/- respectively.</P>
    <P>Articles 28 to 32, inclusive, and Article 40 of the amending scheme deal exclusively with the Army Nursing Service, and for the most part their effect is to redraft and amend in minor respects some defects in the principal scheme.  Article 40, however, has also the effect of increasing the rates of pension payable to the sisters of the service.  Under the principal scheme, a nurse was entitled after 20 years' qualifying service to one-sixtieth of her emoluments for each year of service, and her emoluments included her pay and allowances.  The latter were, however, fixed at a rather arbitrary figure of £64, but in future they will be related to the actual ration, uniform and accommodation allowances payable at the date of her retirement.  Further, after 20 years' service the retiring nurse will be entitled to a thirtieth instead of a sixtieth for each year of qualifying service served after 20 years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1760" /> Article 12 provides special gratuities for existing officers of the naval service who have been granted short-term commissions in that service.  During the next five years it is intended to reorganise the service completely, and at the end of that time it is hoped that we shall be able to man the vessels with officers and men who have been fully trained in the new equipment in the interval.  Meanwhile, we have asked the present officers to continue in the service for a period of five years in commissioned rank, with a special gratuity payable at the end of that period.</P>
    <P>The principal scheme already empowers the Minister to add to an officer's actual service a number of years' (within a maximum of five) notional service where the officer with 12 years or more but less than 20 years' service was compelled to retire for any cause other than age, misconduct, inefficiency or mental or physical incapacity. The principle, therefore, already exists of adding notional years' service in cases where officers are forced to retire in the interests of the service. The present amending scheme extends the principle in two directions.  Under Articles 6 and 35, the Minister can retire officers with 20 years' service or more, and add as many years (within a maximum of five) as will bring their service up to the service which they would have had on reaching the age prescribed for retirement in their ranks by Defence Force Regulations.  Again, Articles 7 and 36 give power to add ten years' service in the special case of those officers who were specially commissioned mainly as area administrative officers in the old Volunteer Force in December, 1933, and February, 1934.</P>
    <P>The principal scheme imposed certain restrictive conditions on the grant of both pensions and gratuities which experience has shown to be unnecessarily harsh in their application, and which, therefore, this amending scheme seeks to remove.  In the case of voluntary retirement, for instance, an officer above rank of captain, even though he had the necessary 12 years' qualifying service, could not receive a pension unless he was commissioned before 1st October, 1924.  No such restriction applied to junior ranks so that, in <Col N="1761" /> effect, they were in a privileged position regarding voluntary retirement. Articles 8 and 37 of the amending scheme remove the restriction, so that all officers are now, irrespective of rank, on the same level.</P>
    <P>Article 10 abolishes another restriction which appeared unreasonable in its application.  The principal scheme provides that a married officer on retirement with the necessary pensionable years' service is entitled to not only a pension or retired pay, but also to what is called a married officer's gratuity. This gratuity was looked upon as some form of resettlement grant, with the result that it was not payable where an officer died suddenly while serving, or where officers did not retire before death.  In order, therefore, to qualify for the gratuity, sick officers were forced to retire on their death beds, and when the necessary form was put into their hands to sign, it was in many cases the first indication to them that there was no hope of recovery.</P>

      <P>Married quarters.  It is clear that only a married officer can get the gratuity.  If the Deputy gets that clear, the matter is easily understood. To avoid such tragic episodes in future, the amending scheme provides that the officer or the officer's family will be entitled to the gratuity whether he dies before retirement or not.</P>
      <P>Another restriction abolished in certain cases is that which made the married officer's gratuity dependent on the officer being in receipt of lodging, fuel and light allowance for a period of not less than two years immediately prior to his retirement.  This condition hit harshly two classes of officers &mdash;those who through illness over a prolonged period, were obliged to go on half-pay without allowances, and those who were placed on the half-pay list when seconded for special duty to other Departments of Government or to a local authority.  The restriction, indeed, not only deprived the sick officer of the married officer's gratuity, but also in the event of his death deprived his widow and children of their pensions. This rather harsh restriction is now removed by Article 19 of the amending scheme.  Article 9 also deals with this subject of lodging, fuel and light allowance, and provides that in the case of married officers promoted from the ranks, marriage allowance in non-commissioned rank will count for the purpose of the gratuity.  It also gives the gratuity to two widower officers who had the allowance for many years but who lost it on the death of the first wife and after remarriage were retired before they had the necessary two years' qualification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an officer on retired pay succeeds in obtaining an appointment under the central or a local authority, then under the principal scheme, if the remuneration of the post equals or exceeds the amount of his Army pay at the date of his retirement, his retired pay ceases, and if it be less than that pay, he can only receive in retired pay the difference between his Army pay and his new remuneration.  An officer's pay is only a portion of his emoluments. Allowances such as ration allowance and lodging, fuel and light allowance also form a not inconsiderable part of <Col N="1763" /> these emoluments and it has, therefore, been represented that it is unfair to an officer filling such an appointment to have his retired pay cut by reference to his Army pay alone.  Hence, Article 15 of the amending scheme widens the meaning of the word &ldquo;pay&rdquo; so as to include allowances.</P>
    <P>The effect of Articles 18, 41 and 42 is also to remove existing restrictions and thus to broaden the basis of the pensions scheme.  Under the principal scheme originally, if an officer died while serving with less than 12 years' pensionable service, his widow was entitled to a gratuity calculated at the rate of 30 days' pay for each year of service; and if a soldier similarly died without the service required for pension, no gratuity was payable.  Under the 1940 amendment, a gratuity was payable in the case of a married soldier to his widow and children, but both the principal scheme and the amended scheme of 1940 made no provision for the payment of a gratuity to the dependents of an unmarried soldier who died in the service.  The present amendment abolishes all these restrictions. Article 18 provides a gratuity of 30 days' pay for each year of service for the widow or children of a married officer who dies while serving, even if he has less than five years' service. Under Article 41, if the officer had less than 12 years' service when he died, the gratuity will be payable not only to his widow or children but, in the case of a single man, to certain relatives; and under Article 42 any gratuity which a soldier has earned by virtue of his service will also be payable to the widow or children in the case of a married, or to certain relatives in the case of an unmarried soldier.</P>
    <P>A final restriction removed by this scheme is that which appertains to the service of non-commissioned ranks promoted to commissioned ranks.  Under the principal scheme, if a soldier be promoted to commissioned rank, then for pension purposes as an officer, he is entitled to only one-half of his service in non-commissioned rank.  This <Col N="1764" /> bears harshly on ranker officers, because many of them being old when promoted have not many years to serve before becoming due for retirement. Hence Article 34 (1) of the present scheme allows such officers to reckon all their service in non-commissioned rank for the purpose of retired pay.  Again, sub-article 34 (1) (b) allows the temporary officers newly appointed to commissioned rank in the forces to count for pension purposes any period served during the emergency and it also permits an officer who served in the Volunteer Force to count for pension purposes any period allowed to him in the matter of age limits when being appointed to commissioned rank in the forces.</P>
    <P>The remaining articles of the scheme are relatively unimportant and for the greater part simply redraft the original articles of the principal scheme.  Thus, Article 13 merely redrafts Article 13 of the principal scheme, which deals with the retired pay of specialist or technical officers, such as medical, legal and engineer officers.  The only difference, indeed, between the amended and the principal schemes is that legal officers appointed after the operative date of this scheme will receive 10 per cent. instead of 20 per cent. increase on retired pay.  The reason for the reduction is that the pay of newly appointed legal officers will henceforth be practically on the same basis as other officers who are entitled to only 10 per cent. increase on retired pay.  Again, Article 20 is for all practical purposes simply a redraft of Article 24 (2) of the principal scheme, which enumerates what periods of service&mdash;such as absence without leave, desertion, etc. &mdash;may not be included in reckoning pensionable service.  Finally, Articles 21 and 25 are drafting amendments necessitated by the introduction of this amended scheme; Articles 11, 16 and 39 deal with the hypothetical cases of officers on retirement entering the Civil Service or Garda Síochána; Article 17 provides for the new military commissioned rank of lieutenant-colonel; and Article 33 makes it clear that a public claim may be recovered from any gratuity or pension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The pensions and gratuities for officers, that is, the gratuities paid at the termination of the emergency and the pensions now proposed to be paid under this scheme, are satisfactory.  There are, however, a couple of observations I would like to make.  In comparison with the pension provision for other ranks, the pension provision for a member of the <Col N="1766" /> Council of Defence who has reached the rank of major-general or lieutenant-general is, I think, on the small side. If we take the responsibilities and the duties which a person serving on the Council of Defence has&mdash;in particular, a person who may be a chief of staff or may hold some other important position, such as adjutant-general or quartermaster-general&mdash;and if we consider the pensions paid to higher civil servants, I think the House will realise that a case can be made for more generous treatment.</P>
      <P>No matter how this question is examined, I think it is generally realised that holding of these ranks, and particularly in times of emergency, calls not merely for peculiar types of service and for close attention to duty but involves the acceptance of very considerable responsibilities.  For that reason, I think that, if anything, more generous treatment is merited.  There are certain improvements in the scheme which are welcome, and, in particular, the amendment which entitles the members of the family of an officer who, as the scheme formerly was phrased, had not signed his resignation certificate before he died, to receive a gratuity. As the Minister said, the placing before many officers who were seriously ill of a certificate in almost every case amounted to the officer's signing his own death warrant.  Probably up to that time, he did not realise that he was in a bad physical condition, and the fact that he is presented with this certificate, when possibly in a very low condition, not merely created considerable hardship for the officer concerned but rendered the task which fell to his brother officers far more difficult and unpleasant&mdash;and not merely for them but for the members of his family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These improvements are welcome, but there is one point in connection with gratuities for retired married officers to which I wish to refer.  These gratuities were fixed almost ten years ago and I presume they were fixed at that time upon the basis of a figure which would enable an officer to resettle himself in civilian life after retirement. Whatever sum was then fixed cannot in present circumstances be regarded as adequate.  The fact that that sum was fixed almost ten <Col N="1767" /> years ago and that there has been a steep increase in the cost of living, added to shortages of many commodities and supplies of one kind or another, makes it more difficult for an officer retiring now to find a suitable occupation in which to resettle himself. In general, the provision for officers is satisfactory.  I cannot say the same about the provision for men.</P>
    <P>The proposed increases in pensions under this scheme amount to 3d. per day or 1/9 per week.  I do not know how the Department came to the conclusion that an increase of 1/9 per week could be adequate in present circumstances. The increase granted to officers amounts to 30 per cent., and the increase for men to something around 12 per cent.  That increase, when one regards the cost of living as 70 per cent. above the 1939 cost, cannot be regarded as satisfactory and, in fact, cannot be regarded as anything but grossly unfair treatment of men who have retired, many of them after long years of service, much of it in troubled times and, in the more recent period, in times which might have constituted a serious emergency for the country and which in many respects was a serious emergency.  That the best treatment the Government and this country can offer to these men is an increase of 1/9 per week is, in my view, an insult.  It is an increase which is in no way adequate to meet the increased cost of living.</P>
    <P>It is true that increases granted to State servants and to many sections of the community have been in the region of 30 per cent., and it is equally true that far higher increases have been granted by the Labour Court and by many employers to different categories of workers.  Whatever may be said of the difficulties of the man who is at present employed and who was employed continuously during the emergency and who is now in a position possibly to secure better conditions, and whatever may be said about a 30 per cent. increase, or even a 40 or 50 per cent. increase not enabling that man, in view of the increase in the cost of living to live on the same standard as that on which he lived in <Col N="1768" /> 1939, he is, at any rate, still working, and possibly may expect further increases with a general improvement in conditions.  But when we consider soldiers who retire after many years' service, the majority of them advanced in years and certainly too far advanced in years to find it easy to secure alternative employment outside&mdash;it is extremely difficult for a person advanced in years to readapt himself to civilian conditions, to re-equip himself for industrial or other work or to remould his life to take his place in an entirely different sphere from that to which he has been accustomed during his Army career&mdash;nobody can pretend for a moment that 1/9 per week increase is adequate to enable that soldier to face the future with any confidence or to face the future in the knowledge that the Government has not merely recognised his services but has recognised them in a tangible way.</P>
    <P>I cannot imagine on what basis of calculation these increases were decided upon.  No matter how one looks at this matter&mdash;whether from the actuarial or mathematical point of view, or the ordinary point of view from which everyone must approach questions of this kind, it is obvious that 1/9 increase will not only not enable a soldier to provide the necessaries of life for himself but will not enable him to meet the domestic responsibilities which many of these men have.  In the future, it may be expected that soldiers will retire at an earlier age than heretofore.  Modern warfare and modern methods of military training call for greater physical exertion and stronger physical makeup than in the past, and it is generally realised that the retiring ages of serving officers and men tend to become lower.  It may be assumed then that if, in the future, a soldier enlists at any age from 18 to 20, after 21 years' service, unless he has been promoted to a higher rank&mdash;and while many may be promoted, they cannot all be promoted to non-commissioned or commissioned rank&mdash;he will find himself demobilised at anything from 41 to 45 years of age.  It is true that, under the terms of this scheme, a soldier may serve a maximum additional period of 10 years.  For each additional year of <Col N="1769" /> service he will get an increase of 1/- per week.</P>
    <P>Some soldiers may serve for these periods.  But the qualifications, restrictions and the discretion which the Minister has in allowing a soldier to serve over a period longer than 21 years are such that, in the majority of cases, the soldiers will only serve 21 years.  There may be exceptions in the case of some N.C.Os. and possibly a few men.  Therefore, in fact, while it is possible to serve for a maximum of 10 years longer and receive additional pay up to a maximum of 10/-, by and large these improved conditions will not be operative for the majority of soldiers.  That being so, we should consider how it is expected to recruit in future adequate numbers to meet our national needs.  Unless we can assure those who contemplate joining the Army that they will get fair treatment, not merely while in the Army, because the conditions are much improved, but when they retire, I think there will be no encouragement to join the Army as privates.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this question to which I should like to refer, and that is, the increase in pension for married soldiers of 7/- per week. I think the pension provision should be based on service.  While a case may be made for some increased allowances for soldiers who have family responsibilities, I think that anything less than £1 per week for a single man is inadequate in present circumstances if that man is to meet anything like his reasonable requirements or, in fact, anything like his necessary requirements. Certainly, anything less than 30/- per week would not be adequate for a married man.  While some case may be made for the responsibilities which a married soldier has, I think the entitlement of a soldier to a pension should be based upon his service rather than on family responsibilities. If it is deemed advisable to give married men further benefits over and above those given to a single soldier, then it might be considered on the basis of children rather than on the basis that a man was married.  At the same time, now that children's allowances are in operation, the married <Col N="1770" /> man, at any rate, has better conditions than he would have had formerly. Therefore, I think that in all cases the pension should be based on service.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer in connection with this whole pension scheme is, that, for some unknown reason, except that a date has to be decided upon, and last September was deemed to be the date most suitable from the Department's point of view, the increases are to operate from the 2nd September.  It is almost two years now since the emergency ceased.  At that time both officers and men were encouraged to retire.  In fact, in many cases they were facilitated in finding employment and in establishing themselves in civilian life.  It was reasonable to assume that many officers and men would avail of that encouragement.  A large number of them took the opportunities, such as they are, which offered and resettled themselves in civilian occupations or in their own business and in that way not merely lightened the burden on the Department but proved themselves good citizens.  They proved that they had not merely a sense of the responsibility which they owed to the community in times of emergency but an equally high sense of the responsibility which they deemed they owed to the community in times of peace.</P>
    <P>What did they find?  That from the 2nd September, a date unannounced in advance, certainly not with any reasonable degree of advanced knowledge which the members of the Defence Force might have expected, all serving officers and men received increased pensions.  It is true, of course, that some date had to be decided upon and that, no matter what date was decided upon, a number of officers and men might feel that they had a grievance. While that is so, any officer or man who retired between May, 1945, and September, 1946, with the altered living conditions, with the high cost of living, with the difficulty of securing a position in civilian life, with all the other attendant difficulties, such as securing housing accommodation in the case of married officers and men, received a lower pension than an officer or man <Col N="1771" /> who retired since September, 1946. While a date had to be decided upon and while grievances might be put forward no matter what date was decided upon, I think that, when we consider the very steep increase in the cost of living which took place over the emergency, added to the other difficulties which I have mentioned, no case can be made for allowing an officer or man who proceeded to resettle himself in life from May, 1945, to September, 1946, to retire at a lower rate of pension. As I said, whatever chance a person who is in continuous employment has of improving his position, of facing the present difficulties and the high cost of every commodity, a person who has retired and has to live on a fixed income, without the members of his family being in a position to contribute to the upkeep of the home as is the case with the majority of these people, is certainly faced with difficulties which it is hard for anyone not similarly circumstanced to imagine.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered most of the shortcomings in this scheme.  As I said, there are a number of improvements upon which I compliment the Minister and his Department.  Finally, I should like to say that it would be a help to those who have to try to interpret these schemes if we had one single Order embodying all the schemes.  As it is, we have the original scheme of 1937, the amending scheme of 1940 and the amending scheme of 1947.</P>
    <P>Finally&mdash;and this is a matter that was adverted to recently&mdash;this scheme has either to be confirmed or rejected. Nobody faced with these alternatives could oppose it.  It is not with any sense of satisfaction that I commend it. I think it might be improved, if we so altered the conditions of this scheme that it would be possible to move amendments.  Many amendments are desirable and I hope the Minister, if not immediately, will, in the future, ponder over the desirable and, in fact, the necessary amendments which could be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to certain anomalies <Col N="1772" /> in some cases that came to my notice.  I know of cases where men have had 23 years' service.  They joined up with a large number of others, who remained on in the Army and were offered higher pensions. These particular men followed the instructions issued by the Minister's Department in a White Paper in 1945 and looked for other employment.  I have in mind cases of N.C.O.s and ordinary privates.  A number of these men now find themselves in this position that, by following the Department's instructions in the White Paper to which I have referred, they were awarded only 19/3 as a pension, whereas if they remained on with their comrades who joined the Army at the same time they would have received much better financial treatment.  These men all joined the Army at the same time and they gave good and honourable service.  The men who have been awarded the better pensions were advised last year not to retire until after September, and after September their pensions would be increased.</P>
      <P>These other men have a grievance. By retiring when they did retire, and adopting the instructions issued by the Department, they find they are at a loss.  I appeal to the Minister, seeing that these men have given good service, to give them equal treatment with the men who remained on.</P>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister if any arrangement has been made to increase the pensions of the men who gave service from 1916 until 1927. All Parties in the House, I am sure, fully recognise the sacrifices these men made.  No Deputy would object to an increase of pension being granted to the men who served the country up to 1927.  Increases have been granted to all other sections of the community. These men should be the first concern of the State and we cannot be too generous to them no matter to what Party we may be attached.  I think the Minister should consider giving an increase to the men who gave service in that period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This scheme will be welcomed by a number of pensioners, but I think in the majority of cases there <Col N="1773" /> will be utter dissatisfaction because they will consider that some of the proposals embodied in the scheme are grossly unfair, especially to Army men who retired before 2nd September, 1946.  I am at a loss to know&mdash;and I do not think the Minister has referred to it&mdash;what special significance attaches to 2nd September, 1946.  For other purposes in the Army the 9th May, 1945, contained a certain significance in so far as it was the end of the emergency. I have in mind one case where a man who retired from the Army before that date could not count his years of service in the Army during the emergency period in order to qualify for a particular job in connection with which he had to appear before the Local Appointments Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this had been the date in the scheme rather than the 2nd September, 1946, I think it would have been more acceptable to the House and to the pensioners.  There were a lot of what we could term old stagers in 1939 who had visions of retiring and who were desirous of quitting the Army, but a call was made by every political Party and a special national appeal was issued and they stayed on for the period of the emergency.  They made a great sacrifice in swelling the ranks of the Army and giving the young recruits the benefit of their experience.  To a large extent this scheme will not be acceptable to them.  They will find grave objections to it.  In some cases people who had 15 or 16 years' service would ordinarily have had the necessary 21 years' service but, at the end of the emergency, on the advice of the Minister, they retired from the Army and tried to get jobs in civilian life.  As the last speaker said, they were encouraged by the Minister and his Department to retire because the Army lost its usefulness at the end of the emergency and there was no great need for a big Army.  These men tried to fix themselves up in jobs and big numbers were released from 9th May in the following 12 months.  To them this amended pension scheme will indeed be a big disappointment.  All these Army pensioners were looking forward, as most State pensioners were, to an increase, and they will think it peculiar that certain men are singled out for <Col N="1774" /> the increase while they are left with the old pensions.</P>
    <P>Another objectionable feature of the scheme is that the N.C.O.s and privates will get an increase of 1/9 per week, while for the officers there is an increase of 30 per cent.  It is grossly unfair that there should be such discrimination between the officers and the ordinary rank and file.  If the Minister will not consider giving these increases all round, irrespective of the date of retiral, he should have some consideration for the wives of those pensioners who will not benefit under the scheme.  I suggest that 7/- per week of an increase should go to the wives of those who, under this scheme, will not be entitled to increases.</P>
    <P>As regards the qualifying date, 2nd September, 1946, I should like to remind the Minister that recently there were increases in some of the social services&mdash;in unemployment assistance, widows' and orphans' pensions and other social welfare schemes&mdash;and there was no qualification in order that a person might be eligible to get those increases.  Irrespective of whether a man was drawing unemployment assistance or not, irrespective of whether a woman was in receipt of a widow's pension or not before the application of these increases, the increases were given all round, and I think it would not be unreasonable if the Minister were to reconsider his proposals in respect of the qualifying date in this instance and give increases to all who are in receipt of Army pensions at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like every other member of the House, have met men who served in the Army from the very beginning up to late in 1945 and who now complain that they are not getting the benefits of this new scheme.  When the men were paraded on the barrack squares in 1945, and encouraged, induced and inveigled into going out on pension at an early date, told to look for employment while the going was good and generally given the impression that they had served the full term of the required service and that the pensions they were getting would be the maximum pension, I want to know had the Minister any knowledge <Col N="1775" /> at that date that increased pensions were to be given in another six months' or 12 months' time?  Surely it must have been in the minds of some of the heads of the Department that when they got rid of the long-service men, they would bring in the scheme we have here to-night.  A number of the men who were induced, as I say, to leave the Army at that time, feel very much aggrieved over this matter.  I join with other Deputies in appealing to the Minister to see that the men who left the Army in 1944, 1945 and 1946 and who were encouraged to go in the circumstances I have described, should be given the benefit of this latest pension scheme.  I think it is time that the Government should make up its mind that the highest possible pension should be given to men who had 21 years' service, no matter at what date they retire.  Only to-day I met a man who is one of the victims of this latest scheme.  Had he waited another six months or another 12 months in the Army, himself and his family would have benefited by some 8/- or 9/- a week.  That is a considerable amount for a man who had to go out on about 19/- a week.  I join in the appeal to the Minister to remove the qualifying date so that the scheme can apply to every man who was encouraged by the Minister and his Department to leave the Army before the scheme was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is quite impossible to understand the Minister's attitude in providing a new set of pension rates beginning from the 2nd September, 1946.  As other Deputies who have spoken have indicated, men who had practically completed their service in the Army found themselves in 1939 called upon by the country to stand by the country in an emergency that contained unknown and incalculable dangers at the time. They, very patriotically, remained on. They were the men who made it possible to build the emergency Army, developing in it such a state of efficiency and such a morale that in spite of the fact that you had a very long period in which the Army was mobilised without active war conditions, you had no serious breakdown in morale.  On the <Col N="1776" /> contrary, the Army was exemplary in its morale, discipline and conduct.  The credit of all that is due to the men who stood by the Army in 1939, who instead of retiring from the Army service, and entering on the normal civil life that they might have expected, remained on in the Army.  Instead of leaving the Army and entering civil life in 1940 or 1941 when it was possible to find remunerative employment and when it was possible to get a home, they carried on until 1946 and 1947 when the possibilities of getting employment were very much smaller and when it became absolutely and utterly impossible to get a home in which they might settle down in civil life.  They made such sacrifices and were involved in such difficulties as a result of standing by the Army that only those closely in touch with them, and closely in touch with a number of them, so varied are the cases, can realise.</P>
      <P>I consider that it is a serious blot on the country's treatment of the Army that when the new pensions scheme was introduced, it was not brought into force from the date, say, of the establishment of the United States Army in France or the capitulation of Germany because these men remained on in the Army simply because they felt there was a danger confronting the country, and when the danger was past they retired from the Army straight away.  They helped the country by reducing the financial cost of the Army at the time and they were helping the country by doing their best to endeavour to get back into civil employment. By leaving the Army immediately after the Allied Forces had established themselves in France, particularly immediately after Germany had surrendered, these men were doing a double service to the State.  They were returning to serve the State in a civil capacity and they were making room in the Army to enable some of the younger men who had been trained under their instruction to remain on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very considerable amount of thoughtlessness in fixing the date of the coming into operation of the new pension schemes at the 2nd September, 1946.  Even this has entered into the minds of people who complain, particularly in the ordinary ranks of private, <Col N="1777" /> sergeant, corporal&mdash;and there is probably something in it&mdash;that the reason why the present proposed pensions for other ranks are so small is because the authorities did not want to put substantial pensions in juxta position with the smallness of the pensions for other ranks paid before the 2nd September, 1946.  What is the result?  How much ought an Irish soldier who had given his full service of 21 years in the Army get as a pension?  I would like Deputies to write down for themselves what they think a single man who had served 21 years as a soldier in the Irish Army, either beginning to-day or ending to-day, should get.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister proposing under this scheme to give him after serving 21 years as a private in the Army?&mdash;15/9 in 1947 money which is worth 7/10½ of pre-war money.  That is the scheme the Minister is bringing in here.  If that soldier was in the British Army he would get 24/10.  If he was a corporal having served four or five years as a corporal and was going out after 21 years' service in the army he would get 19/3 in 1947 money, or 9/7 in pre-war money.  If he was a sergeant, he would get 22/- pension or 11/- pre-war money. If we compare the private in the Irish Army with the private in the British Army and the corporal and the sergeant in the Irish Army with the corporal and the sergeant in the British Army we find that the private in the Irish Army is promised that he will get 15/9 as against 24/- in the British Army, the corporal 19/3 as against 26/6, and the sergeant 22/- as against 34/-.</P>
    <P>The question also arises, what does the Minister mean by the policy of discriminating between the single man and the married man in relation to pension? The pay that we give in the Irish Army is hardly calculated to induce a man while serving in the Army to take on the responsibility of a wife and family and I have yet to learn that it is the policy of the military authorities to encourage that their Army should be a married army.  I have not seen any evidence of it yet.  But, the single soldier is discriminated against by the system the Minister is now introducing of adding 7/- to the single man's pension to find out what the married man's pension should be.  It is a grotesque <Col N="1778" /> arrangement.  Whether you take the married man or the single man, the rates of pension, with perhaps the exception of the corporal, bear no relation at all to those paid in the British Army and, as between married and single men, they are grotesque and unconvincing and I do not know, as Deputy Cosgrave says, what effect they are likely to have on recruiting for the Army.</P>
    <P>With regard to officers I think there is something basically weak also in the Minister's approach to the position of pensions for officers.  In the first place it has to be realised that a lieutenant in the Irish Army will not be kept after he is 45 years of age, a captain after 48 years of age, a commandant after 51 years of age, a lieutenant-colonel after 54, a colonel after 57.  The scheme then is that the officers of the Irish Army are forced out into civil life at these ages and the pensions that have been fixed have been fixed by reference to an increase of 30 per cent. on the pre-war basis.  The highest pension of the lieutenant will be £210.</P>
    <P>When the Government were dealing with Civil Service increases, recently, if we look for comparable figures, the £239 scale, that is, basic salary plus bonus, of 1939 became £351&mdash;an increase of 47 per cent.  The increase on £210 of lieutenant's full pension, of 30 per cent., brings it to only £273.  There is a substantial discrepancy there in the treatment of a lieutenant who, pre-war, would have got £211 pension, and the treatment of an officer in the Civil Service with £239.  The civil servant is increased by 47 per cent.; the lieutenant is increased by 30 per cent.  If we take the captain who was expecting full pension pre-war of £230, he gets now an increase of 30 per cent. If he were a civil servant he would get an increase of 47 per cent.  A commandant who was expecting £290 pre-war is now going to get an increase of 30 per cent. on that, that is, £337, but the civil servant on £306 will get an increase of 40 per cent., bringing him to £440.  A lieutenant-colonel expecting pre-war payment of £340 per annum will get a 32 per cent. increase on that, or £442.  Civil servants with £369 per annum would be raised by <Col N="1779" /> 41 per cent. instead of 30 per cent. and will get £520, and so on.  There is that different treatment in the payments that have been made by way of pension of officers after a full period of service and civil servants whose income is of somewhat similar amounts. I can see no reason for it.  I do not understand it and I think it is a blot on the scheme.</P>
    <P>Then we take the question of the gratuity.  Before the war, lieutenants retiring after full service expected a gratuity of £350.  That is not being increased, so that men who are retiring in extraordinarily difficult circumstances in relation to resettlement, that is, finding a house, and finding equipment for a house, are only being offered gratuities of the same amount as they would have got if the war had never intervened and as if there never had been a rise in the cost of living. I think it is very shabby treatment of men retiring from the Army after a full period of service.  Every section of the people has received increases in the annual amounts or special amounts that are coming to them and that have a bearing on their maintaining themselves and their families properly.</P>
    <P>If the civil servant whose annual increase over his 1939 income is 40 per cent., 44 per cent., 47 per cent., or 53 per cent., as the case may be, retires to-day he will get his gratuity as well as his pension, his gratuity being a full year's salary.  He will, in addition, retire on the 50 per cent. increase, the 40 per cent. increase, or the 30 per cent. increase, as the case may be, and I challenge the Minister on that point. I challenge the Minister for any grounds of logic by which, say, a captain who, if he retired in 1939 or 1940 when he was due and entitled to retire, would have got a gratuity of £400 is being retired now with no increase in that amount in spite of the fact that he has made sacrifices to stay on in order to give additional service and who is retiring now when his rehabilitation will be much more costly than it would have been at that particular time.</P>
    <P>These are points that strike me in regard to this scheme.  The Minister <Col N="1780" /> has put together in the scheme a number of difficult cases which have been causing distress, the solution and remedial treatment of which will be welcomed by very many people.  However, we have here a basic pensions scheme which is intended to deal not only with men who have served in the Army but also with people who are going to serve in the Army in future.</P>
    <P>There is another point to which I think it would be appropriate to draw the Minister's attention.  Captains, commandants, lieutenants, lieutenant-colonels and colonels are retiring to-day after a full and complete service, including very valuable service rendered during the emergency, yet the scheme with regard to wages, etc., is so drafted that quite a number of them&mdash;men with the fullest possible service and first-class qualifications as to service, character and rank&mdash;are unable to get the full pension due to their rank.  It would want more than a slide-rule, it would want an electric one, to get a true picture of the very complicated position shown up here.  Deputy Cosgrave suggested that a pensions scheme in the ordinary, simple, straightforward way should be redrafted now.  It would be well to do it.  It is almost impossible to pick one's way through all the complexities of the scheme as at present presented.  However, when one does so one finds that officers of first-class calibre who are retiring after the fullest possible period of excellent service, are not able to get their full rate of pension as is scheduled in this order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to bring a few points, which most Deputies have overlooked, to the Minister's attention.  According to this scheme a man after 21 years service becomes entitled to a pension.  At the moment there are to be found, all over the country, young soldiers and old soldiers who served in the emergency and who have been discharged as medically unfit. I have particulars here of the case of a soldier who strained his right kidney.  He was discharged on that ground as medically unfit.  He made application to the Army Pensions Board for an award and he was informed as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It has not been established that the disability from which you suffer <Col N="1781" /> is due to injury attributable to your service in the Defence Forces or to your service in the forces during the emergency period.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In my own constituency I come across soldiers, discharged as medically unfit, who are drawing on the ratepayers, some of them on National Health Insurance, because they have no compensation in the way of pension.  That is very bad treatment for men who rallied to the cause in 1939 when an appeal was made for the defence of the country&mdash; men who to-day, because of their Army activity, manoeuvres, etc., have fallen into bad health, got tuberculosis or suffered, perhaps, only slight injury. That is the kind of reward they get when they apply under these Acts for compensation.  On paper all these Acts look well.</P>

      <P>I wonder why this White Paper and this scheme were brought in.  I wonder why the Minister did not think of these men. To-day, if a man has served 21 years, as Deputy General Mulcahy has said, he gets 15/9.  He gets that amount after having given the best part of his life to the service of his country.  It is an insult to a soldier.  We cannot expect to have a good standing Army if that is the kind of treatment a man will get after 21 years' service.  I think that the measure before the House is an insult to the officers and to the men in the Army.  A soldier is a disciplined man who has only a few hours a day for himself, yet, after all those years, he is entitled only to a miserable pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Everett referred to the men who served from 1916 to 1927.  Where do these men come under this Act? Twelve months ago there were great congratulations, and bouquets were thrown to the Minister.  For what? For giving a few pounds of a gratuity to these men so that he would have no more responsibility.  These men are on the labour exchange to-day because no work has been provided for them. <Col N="1782" /> The remainder of them had to leave the country and are now in the British coal mines.  Everything possible should be done to make the men in the Army contented.  They should have something to look forward to after serving for 21 years.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the date, 2nd September, 1946, in this scheme deprives the vast majority of the soldiers who served during the emergency from getting benefit under it.  I think the Minister ought to get his experts to examine the scheme again, because, as it is, it is only a half measure.  We provide pensions for civil servants and for officials of local authorities who have not given half the service that soldiers have given to the State.  A local authority official who had a salary of £6 or £8 a week while he was serving, gets a pension of a couple of pounds a week.  The man who serves for 21 years in the Army gets the miserable sum of 15/9.  To my mind this is not a pension scheme at all.  The British Government are giving higher pensions and we ought to do the same.  The country and the civilian population have to look to the Army for protection and security in the time of an emergency. Many of those who served during the emergency now find themselves on the scrap heap.  Those men should be getting 30/- a week because, as Deputy Mulcahy has said, 15/- a week is only worth half what it was. Something should be done, too, for the dependents of the 1916 men.  Many of them have passed away, and their widows now have to go to the home assistance officer for some charity.  The men who served in the Army are deserving of something better than this from this House.  When a soldier is serving in the Army his life is at stake, and he should be compensated for any service he gives.</P>

      <P>I am very satisfied with the generosity displayed by the various speakers on this scheme.  I should like to point out that practically everything contained in the scheme is not only an improvement but a considerable improvement on the present conditions.  In spite of that fact, the scheme, nevertheless, does not appear to satisfy the desires of Deputies.  I do <Col N="1783" /> not object to that.  I welcome all the references that have been made to the Army and to the reliance that must be placed on it, and from that point of view I, naturally, am rather pleased. At the same time, I want to say that a number of gross exaggerations have been made in the course of the discussion, but I hope to be able to clear up some of them before I conclude.</P>
      <P>The first thing I would like to say is that when we were demobilising the Army we were doing so, as I informed the House at the time, at the rate of 2,000 per month, but even that rate was far from meeting the demands of Army personnel.  Very many more than the 2,000 per month would have been not only prepared but very anxious to leave the Army.  I want to say that no man was forced to leave the Army, and when anybody makes a statement to the effect that men were forced out of the Army he is making a statement that contains no element of truth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is, as I have already said, no soldier was compelled to leave the Army if he desired to remain in it.  Quite a number of them did desire to remain in it, and they were allowed to remain until a given specified date.  If I have cleared up that exaggeration I shall be reasonably satisfied.</P>
      <P>I have been asked what was the significance of the &ldquo;2nd of September&rdquo;. The Deputy who has just interrupted made the innuendo that we were holding back the pay until such time as we could make the announcement and when, it was presumed, a number of people would have left the Army.  Of course, there is no truth whatever in that.  The fact of the matter is that the &ldquo;2nd September, 1946&rdquo;, was the date fixed for the increase in the pay. That is the significance of the date &ldquo;2nd September, 1946&rdquo;.  I want to draw the attention of the House further to this basic fact that pensions are paid on the pay received.  If a man is receiving a sum of money at one period that is less than the sum that is being paid at another period, his pension will be paid on that amount of pay, and there is nothing that I can do, and there is nothing that anybody else can do, to bring any individual into the increased rate of pension if he went out before the 2nd of September. Indeed, if we were to make any attempt at doing anything in respect to bringing these particular people in, the Government would be faced with the bringing in of large numbers of other services in the State; and every one of those other services would be just as entitled to the increased amount of pension as the people that the Deputies have been discussing here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>References were made to the difference between the amount of increase <Col N="1785" /> to officers and the amount of increase to men, and the suggestion was that the men were given a much less increase than the officers.  That, of course, is not so.  The total increase awarded to a man&mdash;as I said in my opening statement-amounts to 60 per cent., which is practically double that awarded to officers.  I did say, of course, that it represented 12½ per cent., but in the case of the married pensions it brought it to 60 per cent. I suppose everyone will more or less agree that every soldier who will have completed 21 years or more in the Army will have married by that time and, therefore, will have qualified for the greater amount.</P>
    <P>I have not asked for any bouquets to be thrown at me; and I do not know that any bouquets were thrown at me.  I do not think that even the White Paper satisfied the entire House; it may have satisfied the reasonable members of the House, but it was not generally accepted, nor did I expect that this Defence Forces scheme would be&mdash;although, as I said in the beginning, practically every article in the scheme is an improvement of the present position.  I am long enough here now to realise that Deputies do not throw bouquets and, if they do, they generally seem to have a brick concealed somewhere in them and, therefore, they do not count too much.  The fact of the matter is&mdash;and I want to emphasise this&mdash;that the scheme which I am asking the House to confirm is one which is providing better conditions generally for the rank and file of the Army.  I am pretty well satisfied that they will be welcomed by the Army.</P>
    <P>This need not necessarily be the last of the improvements.  I have no doubt that those who will follow me will be as anxious as I have been to improve the conditions.  I have done my part, as far as it was possible to do it.  I do not say that I have done everything I would like to have done and, as I say, whoever follows me, if he will follow the example which I have tried to give in my period as Minister for Defence, will, as a result, improve the conditions very much further.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1786" /> It is easy enough for Deputies who have not got the responsibilities to be very generous.  Perhaps I would be just as generous as they would be, but my entire recommendations may not always be accepted.  A large number of them have been accepted in this case and they have gone into this scheme, and I rather imagine that, in the main, they will be acceptable to the rank and file of the Army.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2).</P>
      <P>This proposes to delete the provision in this section that the President of the Circuit Court shall be an <i>ex officio</i> High Court judge.  During the course of the Second Reading debate on this measure, I gave in detail my reasons, which were reasons in principle, for my objection to the proposal to make the President of the Circuit Court a High Court judge.  It seems to me that the whole scheme of the courts of justice code is to keep the various divisions of the judicial system in separate compartments.  That scheme has its roots in and is derived from the Constitution itself&mdash;the 1922 Constitution, followed as it was by the present Constitution. I endeavoured, during the course of the remarks I made on the Second Reading, to make it perfectly clear that my objection was one in principle and not to any particular person who might or might not be appointed to the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is highly undesirable that the President of the Circuit Court should be in the position that he can be called upon to be a journeyman in the High Court.  I think he will have a position of dignity and influence as the president of the court to which he has been appointed, namely, the Circuit Court.  The system in this country, as I understand it, consists, under the Constitution, of courts which will have full original jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters. <Col N="1788" /> These courts are known as the High Court and I emphasise that the provisions in the Constitution from which this courts judicial system is derived speak of that court, which has full original jurisdiction, as the High Court.  It is one court&mdash;the High Court.  From that High Court, there is an appeal to the ultimate tribunal in this country, the final court of appeal, the Supreme Court.  It is again referred to as the Supreme Court, emphasising that it is one separate, self-contained judicial entity.</P>
    <P>The Constitution then provides that, in addition to these two divisions of the judicial system, two of the superior divisions of the courts, there shall be courts of local and limited jurisdiction. The Circuit Court is one of these courts of limited and local jurisdiction and the District Court is the other Again, it will be observed that the idea running through the whole system is carried into the Circuit Court, which is referred to as the Circuit Court.  It is not referred to as Circuit Courts&mdash;the Circuit Court of the City of Dublin, of the City of Cork or of this, that or the other.  It is the Circuit Court.  Similarly, the District Court, with justices sitting in various parts of the country, is referred to not as a series of courts but as one court.</P>
    <P>The whole fundamental idea traceable from the Constitution is that each of these tribunals should be one court &mdash;the Supreme Court, the High Court, the Circuit Court and the District Court.  It is, in my submission, contrary to principle, and, I would venture to say, contrary to what was envisaged in the Constitution, that there should be such a mongrel system, as is proposed in this Bill, that the head of the Circuit Court should be a member of the High Court.  These arguments are based upon a consideration of the judicial system as it exists to-day and the provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I adverted to some of the extraordinary consequences which might ensue from the present proposals.  I drew attention to the fact that this President of the Circuit Court, sitting as a journeyman High Court judge, would be entitled to hear appeals from his colleagues.  In accordance with the <Col N="1789" /> comity of the courts as given effect to in the past 22 years during which our own judicial system has been in operation, each of the Circuit Court judges followed any decision on similar facts or laying down the law given in a previous case by one of his colleagues. Now we will have the system that one of the circuit judges, the chief of the circuit judges, may find himself hearing an appeal from a judge of the Circuit Court who gave a judgment following a previous decision given by the President of the Circuit Court, and considering whether or not he will reverse the judgment he has given, and which has been followed by his own colleagues.</P>
    <P>It is fatuous and useless for the Minister to say, as he said in his reply on Second Reading, that this President of the Circuit Court will not be used to hear Circuit Court appeals. What authority has the Minister to say that?  What authority has the Minister to bind future judges in the conduct of their proceedings?  What right has he to say that the President of the High Court will not use this judge at any time in the future?  What control has he over him?  Maybe the Minister thinks he will not be used. The very fact that he says he will not be used is itself a condemnation of this proposal.</P>
    <P>I object, too, to the second so-called argument of the Minister in favour of this proposal, that it may happen that some of the High Court judges may become ill and that it would require legislation to appoint a substitute.  The system has been in operation for 23 years and no occasion has arisen for the appointment of a deputy High Court judge to deal with the case of a High Court judge being ill.  It is to be assumed, and I think it is a fact, that the High Court judges as constituted at the moment are capable of performing and do perform their duties, and that the business of the High Court is reasonably up-to-date, and can certainly be kept fully up-to-date by a little adjustment of certain sittings.  I find, therefore, on a perusal of the Minister's reply to the arguments I advanced on Second Reading, that he has given no justification whatever for <Col N="1790" /> this proposal.  I am perfectly prepared to accord and will accord during my professional time homage to the dignity of the position of President of the Circuit Court and to the person who holds that office, irrespective of who he may be, but I think it would be more in accordance with that dignity that he should be a colleague among colleagues, that he should be <i>primus inter pares</i> rather than a High Court judge masquerading as a circuit judge or a circuit judge masquerading as a High Court judge.</P>
    <P>I have been unable to find any reason in principle for this proposal. It was not without serious consideration that I made the objection I did make on Second Reading.  I felt that anything I would say in opposition to this proposal might be subject to serious misunderstanding, but I felt an impelling sense of duty to oppose the measure and to draw the Minister's attention to the consequences of the proposal.  Not having obtained any reason, and receiving no argument from the Minister as to why this proposal should be accepted, or as to why it was conceived, I felt compelled to put down this amendment to the section, in spite of my personal dislike of having to repeat the arguments I have had to repeat here to-night.  I urge upon those Deputies who have no particular knowledge of, or intimacy with, the working of the courts to ponder upon the arguments I have advanced. They are advanced in a mood of extreme seriousness and with every sense of responsibility.  I am unable now, after the lapse of time since the Second Reading debate, to see any reason in principle, or even in expediency, for the proposals contained in the Bill, and I urge the Minister to withdraw them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Reading of this Bill I stated that I agreed with my friend, Deputy Costello, on this matter of making the President of the Circuit Court an <i>ex officio</i> judge of the High Court, and I am still in agreement with him.  My reason was that I feared the President of the Circuit Court might be called upon too often by the judges of the High Court to help them in their work and that <Col N="1791" /> his duties in regard to the Circuit Court might be neglected accordingly. The main object of this Bill is to improve the working and administration of the Circuit Court.  The Minister and his officials have more experience of the working of the courts from the inside than anyone outside the Minister and his Department could possibly have.  I would prefer that the Minister would leave this provision out of the Bill, because I think that the President of the Circuit Court can be just as effective in regard to the Circuit Court without being an <i>ex officio</i> judge of the High Court.  I do not think it would be derogatory to the High Court if the provision is left in the Bill, but I would prefer to have it taken out.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is satisfied that, for the attainment of his purpose of improving the working of the Circuit Court, he should have this provision, then I would be prepared to withdraw my objection to it.  The Minister will take the responsibility.  None of these Acts are permanent, and, if any consequences ensue which are not desirable, the Minister can always come to the House with an amending Bill.  I do not think that the matter is of such grave importance as to justify a difference in the House and, accordingly, if the Minister still considers that it is desirable to have this provision I will be prepared to withdraw my objection to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to accept this amendment.  This provision was put in the Bill after considerable thought.  We were most anxious to uphold the prestige and status of the President of the Circuit Court.  We also had the matter looked into from the point of view of the Constitution. Somebody may have to decide whether it is in conflict with the Constitution, but I am advised that it is not in conflict, with it.  The Courts of First Instance are referred to in Article 34 (3) of the Constitution, which states that these courts shall include the High Court and, lower down, that they shall also include courts of local and limited jurisdiction with the right of appeal as determined by law.  They <Col N="1792" /> are linked together.  The appellate court has a special paragraph to itself which says that the Court of Final Appeal shall be called the Supreme Court.  In that way, it seems to me that there is just as much, and more, reason to mix the Courts of First Instance as there is for the present arrangement between the High Court and the Supreme Court.  As Deputy Costello is aware, appeals from High Court judges are heard by other High Court judges.  If it should happen that the President of the Circuit Court should hear an appeal from the Circuit Court, it would be no different from what is happening now when High Court judges hear appeals from another High Court judge.  The whole idea was to give status and prestige to this new office.</P>
      <P>It was not the intention, and it is not the intention now, that the President of the Circuit Court should sit regularly in the High Court.  Apparently there was an idea in the mind of the Deputy that we intended, as a sort of cheap arrangement, to send the President of the Circuit Court into the High Court and not fill the vacancy then existing. That was never the intention.  The fact is that he may be called on, but it is not anticipated that he will be called on very often.  The President of the High Court will use his own discretion as to how often he will ask the President of the Circuit Court to take part in the proceedings of the High Court. It is not anticipated, however, that it will happen often.  If it should happen that a High Court judge is ill for any length of time and arrears accumulate, it may be convenient to have the President of the Circuit Court available to assist.  The main object of this provision is to add to the status and the prestige of the President of the Circuit Court.  For that reason, I am not going, by accepting the amendment, to appear to lower that standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one or two observations on the Minister's so-called reply.  I am quite unable to understand even yet why the proposal has been inserted.  The only reason I could extract from the Minister's observations is that it is to improve the status of the President of the Circuit <Col N="1793" /> Court.  What is the necessity for that?  It does not require any additional improvement.  He is president of his own court and takes precedence of the other members of his court.  He has very wide powers under the Bill, which must be, in accordance with the law if this is enacted, carried out by his own fellow judges.  What is the necessity for putting anything extra by way of dignity upon him?  I fail to see why there should be any encroachment upon what has so far been the operative principles in connection with the judicial architecture.</P>
      <P>It is of no importance to the Minister or his Department that the Bar Council have expressed disapproval of this particular measure.  I was not present at the meeting, so that it cannot be said that I put it across them. That is at least an expression of opinion by those from whom the members of the Circuit Court are drawn that it is not proper that there should be this connection or any relationship between the Circuit Court and the High Court.  So far as I know, there was no consultation between the Bar Council and the Department of Justice, or between the Incorporated Law Society and the Department of Justice. I do not know where the proposal came from.  I fail to see how it adds any dignity or prestige to the office.  I fail to see that there is any analogy with the case where, in very exceptional circumstances, a member of the High Court has occasionally to sit in the Supreme Court, because a Supreme Court judge is ill or happens to have some personal interest in the subject matter of the litigation before the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was stated by some Deputy on the last occasion that the President of the High Court is a member of the Supreme Court, that he is second in precedence in the judicial system of the Supreme Court and the High Court. That was probably due to a false analogy with the old system when there was a Lord Chancellor and a Lord Chief Justice, the Lord Chancellor being first in precedence and the Lord Chief Justice second.  It now appears that the only reason for this proposal is that there should be some enhanced prestige given to the President of the <Col N="1794" /> Circuit Court.  I refuse to accept that as the reason, and I believe we are not getting the proper reason for this proposal.  If it is the proper reason, then it is not a good reason.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connor supported my objections during the Second Reading of this Bill and gave as one of his reasons that the President of the Circuit Court might be brought into the High Court too often.  He stated he would withdraw his objection if the Minister assured him that the idea behind the proposal was to secure the better working of the Circuit Court.  The Minister has not given him that assurance. There is nothing necessarily involved in the President of the Circuit Court being a High Court judge and seeing that the work of the Circuit Court is properly carried out.  I based none of my objections to this proposal on the Second Reading on the suggestion that the vacancy which then existed in the High Court would not be filled.  I had no such reason at the back of my mind, nor did I state it specifically, so far as I recollect it, as part of my objection to this proposal. I believed that vacancy would be filled and I would certainly be surprised if I had made any suggestion, expressly or by implication, that that was one of the reasons for this proposal.

      <P>I would urge the Minister for Justice favourably to consider this matter.  The Bill sets out that the President of the Circuit Court will have certain functions to perform; it does not require that he should be made a High Court judge.

      <P>In connection with this section, I want to express regret that the Minister has not seen his way to include within the scope of the Bill those district justices who retired within the past few years.  The position, as I understand it, at the moment is that there are not more than three district justices who retired within recent years.  Their pensions were, of course, fixed on the salaries which were then in existence and they will not get the benefit of the increases in salaries which it is proposed to give to district justices under this Bill.</P>
      <P>We all know and appreciate the reasons, while perhaps not agreeing with them&mdash;sometimes very definitely disagreeing with them&mdash;why, in the past six or seven years, no increases were allowed to meet the cost of living in various positions.  For reasons which appear now to be adequate, it is felt by the Government that the salaries of district justices should be increased fairly substantially.  But those district justices, who had the misfortune to have retired some short time before this Bill comes into operation, will have to live the rest of their lives, be it long or short, on a wholly inadequate pension; inadequate, having regard to the salaries of district justices now proposed, and wholly inadequate to meet the rise in the cost of living.  I earnestly urge upon the Minister to endeavour to meet those cases.  The actual cost would be negligible.  The length of time during which that cost will be borne by the taxpayers will not be very long.  These district justices have reached an age at which it was deemed they should retire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all human probability they will not draw their pensions for any period such as would impose any great hardship on <Col N="1797" /> the taxpayer.  At all events there are, I think, only three cases, and I do respectfully urge on the Minister for Justice that they should be brought in some way within the scope of this measure. It will be appreciated that it was not possible for a private Deputy to put down anything by way of an amendment to this Bill to raise that point.  I can raise it only on the section, but I do ask for the support of all Deputies in the House for the claims of these three persons on the grounds of ordinary justice and fair play.  I do think that the Minister should use his influence with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to meet those few cases.  The cost will be negligible, but if their claims are ignored that injustice will continue for the rest of their lives to the detriment of themselves and their families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to support Deputy Costello's plea.  I think there have been some cases of considerable hardship in regard to district justices who retired shortly before the amending regulations in regard to pensions were brought in.  The same applies to county registrars.  There is only a very limited number.  They have gone a few years over the age for retirement, so that the burden on the State would be very slight.  I suggest that the Minister might consider these cases and treat them in the same way as he proposes to treat a case in which the district justice has passed away, where he is giving the benefit of the increased allowance to the personal representative.</P>

      <P>This section makes provision to give pensions to district justices on the same basis as to county registrars.  We have also made provision for two deceased justices who elected for the judicial terms.  The matter raised by Deputy Costello, in which he was supported by Deputy O'Connor, is a different matter altogether. If the Minister for Finance proposes to do anything for other public servants who have retired during the emergency, I shall ask him if he can do anything in the matter of the district justices.  That, however, would <Col N="1798" /> have to apply to every class.  I do not think we could segregate one class from the others.  What he will do I cannot say, but it would not be a matter for this Bill.  If it is going to be done it will have to be done in connection with the more general question. I think the matter is under consideration at the moment in connection with the claims of civil servants and other public servants who retired during the emergency.  I cannot make any promise.  The only thing I can do is to ask the Minister for Finance to look into the claims of these men.  I think we have treated the justices fairly well in this particular section.</P>

      <P>It is no consolation to the people who are not being brought within the scope of the Bill to know that the widow of a deceased colleague, one person, is being given a measure of justice. I think there is only one so far&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly two.  The Minister knows more about it than I do.  It was felt that in the case of a district justice who dies, an amendment of the Bill should be made, so as to enable his widow to get a year's salary where her husband had died in office.  I see no reason why a similar measure of justice should not be given to those justices who have survived and whose pensions are based on salaries which were not increased.  It is no consolation to them to know that at some future time the Minister for Finance may introduce a Bill dealing with the claims of somebody else.  It is highly probable that they will be dead before that time, but on this occasion the Minister has an opportunity to do justice by these people.  To the best of my knowledge&mdash; the Minister can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;there is in existence at the present time only one Circuit Court judge who has retired and who gets the benefit of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a very peculiar thing to find bracketed with Post Office employees and other people of that kind, provisions relating to deceased judges and retired members of the Bench.  This is the time to do it; this is the appropriate occasion. If there is a provision in the Bill giving a year's salary to the widow of a deceased district justice, the same measure of justice should be given to the widow of a Chief Justice, if it is thought appropriate.  Whether that may be so or not, I am only asking that justice should be given to the three or four justices&mdash;I think on consideration there are four district justices&mdash;who have retired recently.  The outside number that would be affected by the proposal I make is four.  The amount involved would be very small indeed and the expenditure will last for only a very short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that between now and the Report Stage of the Bill the Minister ought to consider the proposals I make to him.  May I mention that I should have spoken on an earlier section of the Bill on which I intended to ask the Minister to reconsider the proposal regarding the salaries of district justices generally?  It is a matter I intend to raise on the Report Stage. At present I ask for a measure of justice for these four men, who because of the accidental circumstance that they retired a short time before this Bill comes into operation, get a smaller pension than they would otherwise get while a particular judge, who in fact retired before this Bill, is brought within the scope of the Bill by a special section.  I do not think there is any reason in fairness for that distinction. I approve of the proposal that the judge who retired before the Bill was introduced should get the benefit of the Bill but if one ex-judge gets it, I think these four other puisne judges, or district justices, who did Protean work in the early days of this State should get the same treatment.  These were men who blazed the trail in the early days of the State, who inspired into the <Col N="1800" /> hearts of the people an affection for the Irish courts which the State set up in 1924, and who created respect for the law administered by these courts. These are men who have been in the service since 1924 and it would be a terrible injustice that they should be excluded from the provisions of this Bill which proposes that a judge who retired some months ago should get the benefit of the new salary arrangements for pensions purposes.  I heartily approve of that proposal but there is no reason why these four men should not also be given the benefit of the proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for this amendment was that there were about 22 cases of district justices dealt with in Section 18 some of whom opted for judicial terms and we are giving them the right now to postpone their election until they are about to retire.  It was because two justices died while in office and were not provided for in this section that I brought in the amendment. So, although the amendment deals with only two cases, I would like Deputies to bear in mind that there are about 22 dealt with under this section.  I want to make that clear.</P>

I am putting it to the Minister now that he is actually considering reviewing the pensions of officers and members of the Garda who retired during the emergency and that he has at least a precedent to go on for the inclusion in this measure of the four gentlemen who have retired.  I want to say, in regard to these four gentlemen, that they are men who gave very long service in the office of district justice.  I have known some of these gentlemen in the very early days of the Garda to spend their nights and their leisure time in the various Garda stations in the area coaching the members of the Garda in police duties.  I have found these men everywhere devoting themselves to the work of training our police when we had to <Col N="1803" /> send police raw and untrained out into the country and I would ask, in virtue of their long and faithful service, that the Minister would now see fit to include them.  I think it is unfair to ask them to await the general review of the position of State servants who may have retired during the emergency. The opportunity is there now for the Minister and I would urge him to avail of it.</P>

If the Minister would put that to the Minister for Finance before the Report Stage to cover up what I may call the sole remaining blot in this Bill in reference to pensioning district justices, I think his hand would be greatly strengthened with the Minister for Finance in a small case of this kind where no precedent is created, where, as Deputy Coogan has said, there is a precedent and where justice will be done at very small expense to the taxpayer, such small expense as to be completely negligible &mdash;a couple of hundred a year.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before the Schedule, but in existing Part V, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) Every pension granted under the Acts to a justice of the District Court and every award under the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1946, granted, by virtue of the Acts, to or in respect of a justice of the District Court shall be charged on and payable out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof.</P>
      <P>(2) In this section, the expression &ldquo;the Acts&rdquo; means the Courts of Justice Acts, 1924 to 1946, and this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is to consolidate and clarify the existing statutory position in relation to the charge on the Central Fund of district justices' pensions or any award, pension or gratuity made <Col N="1805" /> under the Superannuation Acts to justices or their legal personal representatives.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before the Schedule, but in existing Part V, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) a justice (including an assistant justice) of the District Court, who held office at the date of the passing of the Act of 1936, did not exercise the election provided by sub-section (3) of Section 48 of the Act of 1936, and</P>
      <P>(b) such justice died before the passing of this Act while holding office,</P>
      <P>the Minister for Finance may pay to the legal personal representatives of such justice a gratuity equal to the amount of his annual salary at the date of his death.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every gratuity payable under this section shall be charged on and payable out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof.</P>
      <P>This is the amendment that makes provision for representatives of the two justices who died, who opted for the judicial terms and who, if they had survived would be in the same position as these other 22.  We are making provision that their personal representatives may be paid the money they would have got&mdash;a year's salary in each case.  There are two cases.</P>

      <P>This amendment goes with amendment No. 8&mdash;to delete in Part II of the Schedule the whole of the entry relating to the Courts of Justice Act, 1924. The two amendments are merely drafting amendments the purpose of which is to correct an error in the text of the Bill as it stands.</P>

      <P>The entry to the Schedule.  Look at Part II of the Schedule.  As a corollary to Section 13 of the Bill, which gives the Government power to make an Order altering the composition of the circuits of the Circuit Court, it is proposed to repeal that portion of Section 37 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, which empowers the Minister for Justice, with the consent of the Chief Justice and the circuit judges concerned, to transfer a county from one circuit to another or otherwise to alter the areas of the circuits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 13 is contained in Part IV, which will come into operation on the <Col N="1807" /> passing of the Act, and the appropriate place, therefore, for the repeal of the relevant portion of Section 37 of the 1924 Act is Part I of the Schedule.  The effect of the two amendments is to transfer the relevant entry from Part II to Part I of the Schedule.</P>
