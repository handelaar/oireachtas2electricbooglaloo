      <P>My duty this morning is to bring before the Minister the position of the factory in Wexford that is famous for the production of agricultural machinery.  To-day that factory is closed down because of the shortage of coke and, as a result, over 500 people are unemployed.  I have not heard that anything is being done in regard to that particular industry. When the people of Dublin were threatened with a shortage of gas, there was a great deal of activity.  In the case of an industry producing machinery for the farmers of this country and other countries, the Minister should take some action.  The Minister and members of his staff went to England and the people of the country had great hope that the Minister would bring back good news and that coal would be made available.  The people were dismayed when no public <Col N="930" /> statement was made in regard to that matter.  Subsequently, certain Deputies, including Deputy Norton and Deputy Larkin, went to England to interview British Ministers.  Again, no public statement was made as to the result of the talks.  We are still depending solely on the few tons we can get from America or England.</P>
      <P>I understand that in the coal valley of Arigna boring operations were carried out 30 years ago.  They were carried out on top of the mountain. Every schoolboy in that area knows that there is plenty of coal in the area.  The mistake was that they started boring at the top of the mountain instead of in the valley.  I would like the Minister, when replying to the debate, to tell us is it because there was a coal-and-cattle-pact between the Irish Government and the British Government that no further development of the coal mines in this country is taking place?  Last night Deputy Beirne, of the Farmers' Party, gave the House information with regard to coal that he is personally aware of.  If there is coal in this country that is not being developed, then the Government are failing in their duty.  What has the Minister done since he came into office in the matter of providing housing accommodation for miners in the Kilkenny, Castlecomer and Wolfhill districts so that miners may be retained in those areas?</P>
      <P>The Minister has referred to a changeover to fuel oil.  He indicated that we would be able to maintain the tea and petrol ration.  We have to depend on outside sources for these commodities and, if another war should break out, shipping will again be menaced and our position will be worse than it has been.  The Government and the Minister in charge of Industry and Commerce should see to it, therefore, that any minerals that there may be in this country are developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here a cutting, the heading of which says, &ldquo;Old Folk Have a Coal Secret.  What could be the biggest coalfield in the British Isles may be revealed by a new survey of Ireland's mineral deposits based partly on `oldest inhabitant's evidence'.  Country people tell of huge deposits of coal marked by secret signs like fairy raths <Col N="931" /> to prevent the old-time British authorities from discovering them.  These stories, handed down from generation to generation, will now be officially investigated. One of the secret coalfields is said to run through Counties Clare, Kerry, Limerick and Cork which will make it bigger than any in Britain.&rdquo;  If these things were here years ago and through certain foreign influence were closed up&mdash;you can go to the country and you can see an old mine which was used centuries ago&mdash; surely the Irish Minister to-day should leave no stone unturned but get his experts to go out and see whether these minerals the people are talking about and which, no doubt, are coal exist in this country the very same as they do in Britain.  There are mines in Wicklow, in Leitrim and in Roscommon about which Deputy Beirne spoke last night.  &ldquo;Another coalfield nearly 20 miles long and 15 miles broad is reported from the Leitrim and Roscommon area.&rdquo;  If those stories which have been handed down in history from generation to generation about the existence of these minerals are true they must be there yet.</P>
    <P>Another very important matter which I want to mention and which concerns the rural people is the question of coal for blacksmiths.  From now on until the end of the harvest they will be doing the repairs for the farmers in their forges and they are held up to-day because they cannot get coal.  I know some of them who had to draw next month's coal in order to keep going with the result that when they go to the merchants they cannot get coal as they have already drawn their supply.  That will hamper very much this year's work because, with the manufacturing industry for new machinery for agriculture closed, if the blacksmith cannot get coal for the repairs of harrows, ploughs and all the rest of the machinery which farmers use there will be big delays.  All this is the result of the fact that the Minister and his Department did not take action when they should have taken action&mdash;they should have got in all the coal they could during the emergency.</P>
    <P>Did not we all know that the countries which were overrun by Germany <Col N="932" /> and the other armies would have gone out of production and would have to be looked to after the war?  Of course the coal situation in Britain is not as serious as we are told, but they have to give coal to their colonies and they have to build up their reserves for the navy in case of another attack.  But there was no foresight.  This country &mdash;one of the greatest countries of its size for agriculture and for its produce &mdash;is in the position that whereas formerly we had thousands to export, to-day we have not enough for a staggering, small population.  Half the country to-day is staggering on no rations at all and other people with two ounces of butter.  Talk about the cure of tuberculosis&mdash;the poor man has nothing but bread, butter and tea&mdash;that is his principal food.  I see chocolates from Holland piled up in every store throughout the length and breadth of the country and the city.  Yet we have no sugar ration.  We are promised an extra ration in June but we had sugar to give to these people who are now supplying Éire with chocolates.  They could not have been as badly off as we were told when we sent the sugar there because they can supply us now with chocolates.  The Minister says that the sugar ration will be raised at the end of June.  Why not come along and raise it now?  Is he again providing for all the tourists who will come here in July, August and September or for all the people who come down from the North of Ireland to eat up every bit that is around?</P>
    <P>We want to see supplies of fuel for the coming winter and we would like to see the people who are going to produce that fuel well kept with a decent standard of wages.  That was the thing that let the British down. They never paid the coal miners for the work they did and the turf worker should get as good wages for the work he performs as industrial workers in a protected and sheltered industry. Then we would not have any stoppages. Unofficial strikes are very bad.  No one wants an unofficial strike.  What causes an unofficial strike?  In some cases it is because an employer will not meet the representatives of the union and in other cases it occurs because workers think that their unions are not <Col N="933" /> working quickly enough for them with the result that they take strike action to get something done.</P>
    <P>At the moment no one in this House believes that a man can live and support a family on 44/- a week.  Bacon is out of the question.  A farm labourer now salutes a pig because he has never seen bacon since 1939.  If he sees it he cannot buy it because it is 3/-a lb.  The price of butter is again increased. The people throughout the country are now wondering what is going to come out of the Budget and if it will be anything like the British Budget with regard to cigarettes.  God help the poor old age pensioner with the increase of a half-crown.  He can give up smoking and so also can the young men.  I often have to write to the Department on behalf of people looking for extra coal.  I am asked down the country where is the coal coming from or how is it that new hotels which were not in business in 1939 or 1940 can get it.  That is the burning question with the people in business, the small shops, and I think that it is not fair to the people who are trying to carry on throughout the country with their little, small businesses. They are just kept down to what they got in 1939 or 1940.  At the same time, the luxury hotels can get what they like.  I think there is very low, mean administration under the Minister's Department in relation to the labour exchanges.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will do something for the industries that have been forced to close down. It is his job, anyhow, to try to get coal. He should go over again and look for coke for the foundries.  There is one big foundry in Dublin, the Hammond Lane Foundry.  There was nothing done about the industries, although there was about the gas.  As regards electricity, we were told we would have it in every farmer's house.  Now, if you use electricity for any length of time, there is a danger that your supply will be cut off.  There is no improvement in that respect.  We were relying on that to help us after the war; every house was going to be lighted by electricity, and the cows were to be milked by electricity.  The war is long over, but electricity is still rationed.</P>
      <P>I should like to emphasise the points made with regard to the bread ration. I do not think the section of the people to whom I am about to refer has yet been mentioned.  I refer to those engaged in the fishing industry.  The men who fish for salmon on the Slaney between Wexford and Enniscorthy are entitled to an extra bread ration.  They have to be on the banks of the river for 18 or 24 hours each day, because otherwise they might miss the run of fish.  That industry brings a lot of money to this country and the salmon fishers are industrious men.  The season lasts only a few months, and I appeal to the Minister to give them an extra bread ration.  I know many of them and they do not all live near the banks of the river; some have to walk miles to where the nets are.  They have to cross the river in turn and if they are not there they might lose a haul.  Some have to cross five or six fields to their houses and others have to walk three or four miles, or perhaps further.  I think I have covered all the ground I have been asked to cover by my constituents. When a Deputy comes here he does not speak his own mind; he speaks for the people he represents.</P>

      <P>That is my view, anyhow. We are sent here to present facts before the responsible Ministers who listen to the debate.  It is our duty to bring the grievances and the worries of the people we represent before this House.  Some persons, of course, do not worry much only with regard to certain individuals.  It is up to every Deputy to present to the Minister the views of the people in different portions of his constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in his introductory remarks yesterday, gave the House a very comprehensive survey of our economic position and I think the House appreciates that that survey shows how difficult the position is.  I suppose we can say the Minister was fairly honest about that.  He painted a gloomy picture and the survey was very disappointing to the country. While we can agree with a lot of what he said, there are certain things in his statement that could be definitely challenged.</P>
      <P>Our big problem is foreign exchange. I suppose there is something to be thankful for in that the Minister is at last beginning to appreciate the importance of an export trade.  Having contributed to the destruction of a large volume of our agricultural export trade, the Minister is now trying to develop an export trade in manufactured goods.  I feel he is rather optimistic in that respect and that an elementary knowledge of economics should at least make him appreciate that there is no hope of any real progress for industrial development until we have a prosperous and expanding agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave us figures with regard to imports and exports.  Our imports for the last 12 months amounted to £71,834,000 against an export figure of £38,756,000.  That shows an adverse trade balance of £33,000,000.  He gave us a figure for our invisible income&mdash;our investments abroad, and emigrants' remittances&mdash; and it came to £29,373,000 for 1945.  He believes the figure for 1946 is larger, <Col N="936" /> but it still leaves an adverse balance that has to be met out of capital.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that the present arrangement with regard to the conversion of sterling into hard currency ends next July, and the terms of the Washington agreement provide that the British will undertake to convert into dollars sterling arising out of current trade.  The Minister expressed the view that, even taking it that sterling would be converted <i>in toto,</i> we still might not have sufficient for our requirements.</P>
    <P>The House must appreciate that the capital goods required here, when those goods are available, must be very substantial for some years to come; they must represent a substantial increase over our pre-war requirements, because little or no capital formation has occurred for years during the emergency.  There is quite a number of replacements necessary in capital goods.</P>
    <P>I think this is a problem that should deeply concern this House and that the Deputies ought to have some appreciation of what is necessary in order to meet our difficulties in that regard.  It is true that no financial discussion has taken place between Great Britain and ourselves.  While discussions of that sort have taken place with some of the other sterling countries, nothing has been done here.  I think the Minister felt that, so far as our accumulated assets are concerned, there might be a substantial limitation placed on the use of these assets in future.  I do not think it is necessary to anticipate that for the moment.  I presume the best possible deal will be made in the circumstances. The Minister went on to stress the importance of our export trade.  He said that there were two ways to meet this problem, either to reduce our consumption of imported goods or to expand our export trade. Obviously the most desirable method of meeting the situation is to increase our exports.  We must appreciate that so far as Great Britain is concerned&mdash; and practically all our exports are to Great Britain&mdash;the British Government, in order to meet the situation, are asking their people to deny themselves <Col N="937" /> of certain goods of a luxury character and to increase their exports.</P>
    <P>I suppose we can hardly expect Britain to provide us with facilities which they have to deny to their own people.  While the dollar pool was in operation I think we got a substantial amount out of that pool.  As a matter of fact we got far more than we put into the pool.  I think the figure stands at something like 90,000,000 dollars, while we contributed only something like 5,000,000.</P>
    <P>So far as the question of dollars that will accrue to us from the conversion of sterling through current trade is concerned, the Minister did not make the position quite clear.  He talked about tourist development and about the tourist trade as an export business being second only in importance to agriculture.  We should like some information as to whether in fact the tourist trade would be classed as representing sterling that would accrue to us through current transactions, in other words, whether the tourist trade would be classed as current transactions and to what extent our invisible re-exports are involved so far as remittances from Great Britain are concerned.  Personally I am doubtful whether the tourist trade could, or would be, classed as representing sterling that would accrue to us from current transactions and subject to conversion under the Washington agreement.</P>
    <P>One thing certain is that if we are to maintain even pre-war standards in this country, if we hope to provide decent standards for our people, we must increase our export trade.  I feel that this is a very big problem which calls for a tremendous amount of organisation on the part of the responsible Ministers.  I do not think the country, as a whole, appreciates the exchange problem.  The action of Mr. Dalton, in increasing the tax on tobacco, emphasises the dollar difficulties so far as Great Britain is concerned. In recent weeks Mr. Strachey, the Minister for Food, has been warned by the British Treasury that he is buying too much in the dollar area.  Even <Col N="938" /> with the meagre ration of meat that obtains there, Britain is buying 30 per cent. of her requirements in the dollar area.  All that difficulty, in my opinion, gives us an opportunity for development in certain lines of business.</P>
    <P>I think the House in considering this matter must consider what can be developed, what extension can take place for export purposes.  So far as agriculture is concerned, much of our agricultural exports has completely disappeared. Take even our main item, live stock.  Before the economic war, we exported 800,000 animals from this country.  To-day we are exporting 450,000 animals.  That means that our export in live-stock animals has been reduced by 50 per cent.  At the same time, we exported something like £4,000,000 worth of butter after having provided for our own requirements. To-day we are in the position that we can allow our people only a two-ounce ration.  As regards bacon, 15 years ago we exported 500,000 cwts. of bacon and 500,000 live pigs as well.  Even before the war our consumption of bacon had fallen and our live-pig exports disappeared. However, we were still exporting 500,000 cwts. of bacon before the war.  We were formerly exporting over £3,000,000 worth of eggs but even before the war the value of that trade had fallen to something like £1,000,000. To-day Great Britain is importing £35,000,000 worth of powdered eggs and we are doing nothing to capture that trade.  As a matter of fact, I think we are not going to reach the target fixed at the London conference of last autumn.</P>
    <P>I think it is time that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, instead of promising the country a rapid development in the export of manufactured goods, should concentrate upon what is definitely there and try to develop the trade that was there in the past, a trade that can be captured again.  In my opinion the Minister for Industry and Commerce can do a lot to assist the development of agriculture.  I have no doubt that the Minister appreciates that even so far as the raw material for industry is concerned, agriculture provides that raw material, inasmuch as agriculture provides the <Col N="939" /> foreign exchange and the purchasing power for the raw materials of industry.</P>
    <P>So far as the internal purchasing power for manufactured goods is concerned, that, again, must be provided mainly through agriculture, so that it is merely elementary, as I suggest, that it should be fully appreciated that the first pre-requisite of industrial development here is a prosperous agriculture.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister can be very helpful in relation to the development of agriculture.  The efficiency in industry about which the Minister talks can be very helpful to agriculture, and I hope the Minister is not merely paying lip-service in that respect but that he is determined to ensure that secondary industry will be efficient.  If agriculture is to buy industrial goods which are costly and of poor quality, it merely means throwing back a burden on agriculture which is bound to keep it depressed.  Cheap raw material for agriculture is essential and the Minister can help in that respect.  Equipment&mdash;machinery and tools&mdash;which is efficient and of the right kind and at the right price is essential if we are to have agricultural development, and in this respect, too, the Minister can help.</P>
    <P>While we are making practically all our agricultural tools here and the tariff on imports was lifted for a short while recently, the tools, while improved in quality, are still inferior to the imported article.  Take forks, sprongs and shovels&mdash;even the handles are of very poor quality.  At times, one finds beech handles in agricultural tools, which is absurd, because the beech cracks off like a carrot.  I recently bought two sprongs, for which I paid 10/9 each, for the purpose of carting out manure to a field.  I was putting a number of fellows on the job, but I had to bring them back because the prongs were like pieces of wire which could be twisted quite easily.</P>
    <P>One finds that the steel is either too hard and flies off, or too soft and bends like a piece of wire.  I remember when one could buy a good sprong for 1/6.  Now we are paying 10/9 for them and they are of very poor quality.  In appearance, they have improved substantially, <Col N="940" /> but they still do not stand up to the test, and when we are giving a high measure of protection to industry, there is a responsibility on the Minister to ensure that industry produces a good article at the right price.  If that is not done, it will eventually have its repercussions on agricultural production.</P>
    <P>The same applies to whatever agricultural machinery is made in the country.  In the case of artificial manure distributors&mdash;and it is essential that artificial manure should be evenly distributed over the land&mdash;the design of machine made here has been completely obsolete for years and still the manufacturers stick to that design.  If the Minister's Department is to supervise the production of machinery&mdash;I do not know whether he has an expert on agricultural machinery in his Department or not, but I presume he has&mdash; and to ensure that we get machinery of the right design at a reasonable price, that supervision ought to be efficient, and the man in charge ought to have a thorough knowledge of machinery and of what is required in modern conditions.  In a competitive world, we cannot hope to compete with other countries, if their equipment is far better than ours.</P>
    <P>We want lower overheads in agriculture, too, and the Minister, in his capacity as a member of the Government and Tánaiste, can ensure that less money is spent on non-essential schemes, on hare-brained schemes of one sort or another, that money spent will be spent on essential development. The bulk of our money ought to be applied to the development of real production, and where the Minister can and must help very substantially in agricultural development is in the provision of essential transport services at the right price.  No one can say that we have either efficient transport services provided by the monopoly company, Córas Iompair Eireann, or transport services at the right price.</P>
    <P>I will give the Minister an example of the sort of charges he has sanctioned. I wonder what examination has been given to the charges which have been sanctioned by the Minister. Take the transport provided during the present emergency for the transport of <Col N="941" /> live stock from fairs, for the transport of a commodity which represents the bulk of our exports, and the Minister is very concerned about increasing our exports as the country ought to be very concerned about it.  I was at a fair in Tullow last Monday.  Tullow is less than 50 miles from the city and the transport provided by Córas Iompair Éireann was a number of lorries which arrived very late at the fair and the charges for which were £7 12/- each. Private transport was able to make three runs without any difficulty to Dublin from Tullow, but on the basis of Córas Iompair Éireann doing only two runs, a very ordinary day's work&mdash; as a matter of fact, the lorries made only one run&mdash;the charge for the lorries was on the basis of £7 12/- per lorry, which means that that State company expects a lorry to earn £15 5/- per day. If that is the sort of transport provided, it is neither efficient nor at the right price.</P>
    <P>We have been mudding long enough with regard to transport services, and some day the House must look for an opportunity of having a full and frank discussion on the whole question of national transport.  The charges in operation for Córas Iompair Éireann transport are a disgrace and the greatest disgrace of all is that the charges have been sanctioned by the Minister's Department.  We were told, when we passed the Act relating to this company, that, because it was a national transport company, its primary motive would be the provision of national transport, that it would not have so much a profit-making motive as the motive of providing an efficient transport service.  If live stock can only be transported to Dublin from fairs less than 50 miles from the city at a charge of £1 per animal, the service is anything but efficient.</P>
    <P>There are any number of private people who are prepared to provide transport at a far lower charge, because they are prepared to make double and treble the number of runs the railway company make at present, and I want the Minister to give particular attention to this point, because, if the primary industry is burdened with a costly and inefficient transport <Col N="942" /> service, there is no hope of development and no hope of the exports the Minister talks about, and the Minister is merely paying lip service in respect to a matter which is vital to the country. Exports are essential for this country from now on.  It is a question of goods for goods, as the Minister knows very well.  He knows also that it is so much humbug to talk about a rapid expansion in the production of manufactured goods until we get agriculture going.  The only real hope of salvation for this country is attention to the primary industry, for every Department of State to be helpful so that we may get back to where we were some 15 years ago so far as our export trade is concerned.  Some of us have some little appreciation of the exchange difficulties with which Great Britain is confronted, particularly her dollar problem.  She is simply existing on the Washington loan and she will, probably, have to seek a further loan. We have to keep on our toes and, while I agree with what the Minister said yesterday regarding our external trade, I hope he is not going to leave the matter with that expression of opinion.  The difficulties regarding our primary industry must be removed. Agriculture requires a good deal of encouragement and organisation.  The Minister cannot dissociate himself from that.  He can be helpful in a variety of ways and he ought to be helpful.  He should be thinking of agricultural goods rather than of the possibilities regarding the export of manufactured goods.  We must remember that the volume of goods we are getting for the figure of £72,000,000 mentioned by the Minister is not very great.  We are paying very high prices for many of the commodities imported, especially clothes and soft goods.</P>
    <P>We get no share of the austerity goods provided for the British people. We are really getting the luxury goods which are being sold at high prices. The prices have been increased to help to provide cheaper clothes for their own people and that makes the problem more difficult, because we are not getting good value in some lines of imports.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="943" /> I should like to refer, in passing, to the cost of living and to an experience I had.  A draper down the country who employs a first-class tailor and who does a good deal of work on his own premises showed me overcoats produced by himself and overcoats manufactured and supplied to him for sale in his shop.  Manufactured overcoats, with lined shoulders and sleeves, were priced at £9 9s. 0d.  He told me that the manufacturers could buy the cloth at cost, less 15 per cent., less 2½ per cent.  He buys the same cloth less only 5 per cent.  He employs a tailor at good wages and lines the coat completely.  He is able to sell the same coat at £6 6s. 0d.  The manufacturer has the advantage of mass production. Nevertheless, the cost of his coat is 50 per cent. higher than that for a coat produced by the draper on his own premises.  That is an aspect of the problem which should have the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated what he proposed to do in connection with the rationing of butter and asked the House to express a view upon it.  I think that his proposal is cock-eyed and absurd.  He suggested that rations of four ounces and six ounces of butter should be provided for the country and that in those counties where a good deal of farmers' butter is produced the lower ration should be allowed.  He told us that 540,000 cwts. of creamery butter were produced and that our production had fallen by 60,000 cwts.  The Minister for Agriculture has stated that the price of milk will be increased by 4d. per gallon, that that will not be passed on to the consumer but that the subsidy will be increased to over £2,000,000.  The present subsidy is £950,000&mdash;£50,000 short of £1,000,000. The figure for farmers' butter for last year has been given at 471,000 cwts. Creamery production, as the Minister told the House, is 540,000 cwts.  There is not so big a difference between the two figures and very little of that farmers' butter is going into the pool for the purpose of rationing.  The Government have made no effort to bring it into the pool.  Evidently, no such effort is to be made, because the Minister proposes to provide a low ration <Col N="944" /> in those counties where farmers' butter is produced.</P>
    <P>Butter is sold at present at 2/4 per lb., and creamery butter gets a subsidy of almost £1,000,000.  Those people who are producing butter on their own account are expected to do so at the same price as the creameries without the help of any subsidy.  The price of butter is to be stepped up by 4d. per lb. and a margin of 5d. will be provided by the State by way of subsidy. Evidently, people producing butter on the farm will not get any benefit from the 5d., just as they are now getting no benefit from the 4d. provided by way of subsidy.  Therefore, farmers producing butter privately&mdash;in the aggregate they are producing little short of what is produced by the creameries&mdash;are expected to do so at something over 9d. per lb.  If some attempt is not made to increase the price for farmers' butter over 2/8, the result will be that every pound of that butter will be driven into the black market.  The Minister knows very well that a very substantial quantity of farmers' butter has already been driven into the black market.  Such butter is being sold at 4/-, 5/- and 5/6 in this city and all over the country.  That is all due to the fact that no attempt is made to do justice to every section of the producing community and that the State subsidy is provided to keep prices down to the consumer and not to help the producer.  The price of milk in Northern Ireland is 3/2 per gallon.  The new prices here are to be 1/2 and 1/4.  No provision whatever is made to help those engaged in private production.  While the subsidy margin is to be more than doubled, the private producer is ignored.  Is there not a very substantial potential there for expansion of butter production if the private producer is treated fairly?  What is to prevent the Minister licensing a number of people to buy farmers' butter at 3/1 and to sell that butter at 2/8, the State to provide the difference by way of a subsidy of 5d.?  I am asking merely that people who are producing butter privately should be treated on the same basis as those who are supplying milk to creameries.  I am asking the Minister to do even less for the people producing butter <Col N="945" /> privately than for the others because I am making no reference to the 4d. already provided by way of subsidy in the £950,000 which the House voted last year.</P>
    <P>Surely, at this stage, if the Minister wants to ensure that whatever supplies of butter are produced in this country will be available to all the people and that it is not merely the wealthy people, who can go into the black market and buy butter, who will have butter on the table, and if the Minister is at all concerned with the problem, there is an easy solution to it.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the butter can be brought into the pool by inducement, but not by compulsion.  The only way to induce it into the pool and make it available for rationing purposes is by treating the producers fairly and justly.  There is a moral aspect of this problem as well.  It is absurd to suggest that butter can be produced at that figure, but we are ignoring that fact.  Here we are merely playing fast and loose with a very substantial quantity of butter and the Minister is prepared to let it go wherever it will. The suggestion the Minister made was a cock-eyed one, that he was going to reduce the ration in the counties where farmers' butter was produced.  What effect would that have?  The unfortunate farmer would still have to do with the lower ration and the butter would still go into the black market.  It would mean a lower ration for the poor man, but the fellow who could buy would buy in the black market.</P>
    <P>We want an assurance from the Minister that he is going to handle this question in an efficient and business-like way and do justice to that section of the community.  On the merits of the price, it does not concern the Minister and I am not going to express my views.  I want the Minister to appreciate that fact, that we must offer a fair price to those people who are making the effort to provide the butter we want for the public.  They can be helped by way of subsidy, but also you can induce that butter into the pool by a fair price and have it available for the whole country.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us about the wheat position, that we had a representation <Col N="946" /> before the International Wheat Conference and that he was asking for a figure of 405,000 tons.  I think it is time he appreciated our problem.  Last year, he went to London himself and the representations he made there conveyed to the people at that wheat conference that we were practically independent of world supplies, that we imported at one time 700,000 tons of cereals and that, because of Government policy, we could now do with 200,000 tons and that, for the end of the particular cereal year, 30,000 tons would do.  Of course, we were great fellows then and we were a food-exporting country; but what we are exporting to-day is negligible and for that reason we are not prepared to make a trade deal with anyone.  Since the quantity is negligible, no one outside cares anything about it.  It is time the Government and the Minister were a bit realistic about the situation. The Minister has woken up to elementary principles when they are forced on him by the world situation, that we have to export or almost die.  If we do not export, we will have a very much lower standard of living.  The Minister is concerned now about that. Let him express that concern, not merely in this House but in his Department and in the other Departments of State as well.  He has gone almost from one extreme to the other. On the basis of 65,000 sacks of wheat per week, our requirements are something like 425,000 tons per annum and we are asking for 405,000 tons of wheat.  However, it is well to be on the safe side.  We were certainly on the wrong side last year.  The Minister's acreage anticipation was wrong by 20,000 acres; his estimate of our yield was wrong by over 60,000 tons; and the result of all the miscalculation and optimism is that we are having a very difficult time in regard to imports of wheat.</P>
    <P>After some pressure here, the Minister agreed to provide supplementary allowances of bread for certain categories of people&mdash;road workers, dock workers and, lastly, after a good deal of pressure, agricultural workers of a certain class, men who were more than two miles from home and who had to bring a midday meal to work.  I have <Col N="947" /> had several cases where there seems to be a good deal of confusion in the administration of that supplementary allowance.  I know two brothers working in the same job; one of them got it but the other was refused and told he did not qualify.  The Department was informed that he was working on the same job as the other man who had it but it did not seem to impress them. There is another case of a county council worker working with a gang on the Barrow drainage.  Every other man in the gang gets the allowance, but this individual has been refused.  I wrote to the Department about him and got a reply saying that he is not entitled to the supplementary allowance and that the supply position does not warrant providing him with it.  If his colleagues are all entitled to it, surely he is entitled as well?</P>
    <P>Other speakers have mentioned the complaints from blacksmiths about coal.  I made representations to the Department of Agriculture about a blacksmith who does work in a very big way in Kildare and who got 10 cwts. of coal.  That is a very small quantity for a man in a very big way, catering for a very big area.  There is a lot of work to be done on agricultural implements at the present time. While I want to qualify my remarks by saying that I appreciate that the problem is a difficult one, nevertheless it is of vital importance to food production that blacksmiths be provided with a sufficient allocation of coal to effect the necessary repairs to agricultural machinery.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that the subsidy for the airports would be further increased. We are asked to provide a very substantial sum, £1,435,480, for Aviation and Meteorological Services. It is mainly for aviation purposes, I presume, as meteorology is getting very little out of it.  The Appropriations-in-Aid show receipts in respect of landing fees at airports, £150,000, total Appropriations-in-Aid, £180,000.  I presume that this country, for an expenditure of practically £1,500,000, is getting a return of £180,000.  We are advertising ourselves abroad and increasing our prestige in other countries. <Col N="948" /> I do not know whether that can be expressed in terms of money or not, but it is rather a big advertising fee.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to give some information about the charges. The details say: landing fees, £150,000. I want to know the landing charges at Rineanna and the actual cost of landing, when worked out and taking into account the capital costs over a period of years.  What are the landing charges here and what does it cost the country to provide these landing facilities?  I am informed, too, that owing to the increase in the weight of the planes arriving here, the runways at Rineanna are not sufficiently strong to carry some of the heavy planes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They may be strong enough to carry those that will be coming here in five years' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  Is it a fact that they have to be strengthened and improved and, possibly, ripped up, and that we have to lay heavier runways? I want to know from the Minister, what are our landing charges, and what is the cost to the country of providing that service?  When we talk about our difficult economic position and the expenditure of money to increase the standard of living for our people&mdash;to provide better conditions for them&mdash;I am inclined to question very much the advisability of spending huge sums of money like this on air services that are of a very doubtful value for the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not give the House any information about the conference held recently in London or as to what decisions were taken there.  I think that, when replying, the Minister might give the House any information that is available.  We were told some time ago by the Taoiseach that the information would be forthcoming on this Vote, and that Vote would be taken early to provide the Minister with the opportunity of giving the House information as to what occurred at that conference.  The matters that were discussed at that conference, and the decisions taken there, are of great importance to the country. It is only right and proper that this House and the people as a whole <Col N="949" /> should be made conversant with the particular policy that was adopted by our representatives at the conference.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Minister in conclusion that I feel the country as a whole has some appreciation of our difficulties at the present time: of our internal difficulties such as the shortage of essential supplies, but that it has less appreciation of our exchange difficulties and of the problems that have to be tackled in removing them.  If we are to increase our essential imports of consumer goods and capital goods, I feel that our capacity to do that must come from agriculture.  I am satisfied that the Minister for Industry and Commerce can do a lot to help in the development and expansion of agriculture by removing some of the burdens placed on it by secondary industries. I have directed his attention to these problems, and I hope that he is going to pay some attention to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with very great care to the two hours' review by the Minister not merely of the work of his Department but of the national economic position as he sees it.  At the end of that informative speech, I was convinced that it was probably the most sombre review of our economic position that we have heard from him for many a year.  I think it was a realistic speech.  I think the Minister has faced up very candidly to the difficulties which face us to-day, and which will tend to crowd in on us in still greater force unless we bestir ourselves and grapple with them.  One thing I could not help feeling while the Minister was speaking.  It was that his speech was in striking contrast with some of the pictures of El Dorado which were painted by his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, during the by-elections of last year when we were being told that the only real danger this country stood in was the danger that it would be submerged in a flow of milk and honey. The Minister's realism to-day has in any case given us one assurance, that whatever our ultimate economic destiny may be, whatever the standard of life of our people may be, or however long the Celt may live, in any case his exit from this world is not going to <Col N="950" /> be drowned in a flood of milk and honey.</P>
      <P>The war in Europe is now over for a period of approximately two years. I imagine that when everybody heard the glad news in 1945 that the war in Europe had ended, they visualised that in a short period we would be well on the high road towards national reconstruction and industrial and agricultural expansion.  I venture to suggest that in May, 1945, very few people in this House, or throughout the country, realised that our difficulties two years after the conclusion of the war would be even greater than were the difficulties we experienced during the war. How far we are away from national reconstruction and from industrial and agricultural expansion is clearly indicated in the speech which the Minister made yesterday, a speech which indicates that our hopes in that respect have been seriously impeded, and that instead of looking towards the bright future which we visualised two years ago, it will require the exercise of all our energies, all our resources and all our abilities to prevent our economic position deteriorating much more seriously than it has already deteriorated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are about to embark on a policy of economic regeneration that policy ought to show itself in two directions: (1), in expanding employment in all our national activities, and (2) in the provision of a better standard of living for our people.  High living costs, which tend to get even higher, have prevented the attainment of anything like a decent standard of living, and if prices continue to rise, as is evidenced by movements during the past few weeks, then it may not even be possible to maintain the existing standard of living for the masses of our people.  When we look for expanding employment a most doleful picture confronts us.  Emigration is still draining the country of its manhood and womanhood.  The most striking aspect of the problem of emigration is that although the war in Europe is over for two years, and although we ought now be setting about the task of reconstruction, and the tasks of economic and agricultural expansion, the fact remains that we are still exporting from <Col N="951" /> the country men and women on a scale comparable to, and in some instances greater than, the rate of exportation during the war period.  In 1944, we sent 7,500 men to Britain for employment and while the war was at its highest in 1945 we sent 13,000.  In 1946 we sent 10,000, and in the first three months of this year which are not regarded as good export periods for man-power because of the fact that the Christmas period and the post-Christmas period intervene we sent to Britain 2,850 men.  If you multiply that figure by four, you will find that we have beaten the 1944 figure of exports of men, that we have beaten the 1946 figure of exports of men, and that we are approaching the 1945 figure, which was 13,000, of exports of men to Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Consider the position in regard to women.  In 1944 we exported 5,700 women; in 1945, 10,500; in 1946, 18,900, but in the three months of this year, January, February, March, we have already exported 5,300 women to Britain.  So that at the present time we are sending women to Britain at a greater rate than at any time during the war period.</P>
    <P>If this were a country that was crowded for living space, one would see less danger in a situation of that kind. If this were a country whose resources were developed to the fullest and were incapable of providing a better standard of living, one might be less concerned about a problem of that kind but, where you have an under-populated country, a relatively undeveloped economy, with many of our industrial and agricultural possibilities barely scratched, we cannot contemplate with equanimity the export of the most virile of our manhood and womanhood. The merest tyro in economics can easily calculate the ultimate economic loss to the nation involved in permitting mass emigration on that scale to continue. Two years after the war ended, instead of being engaged in a policy of reconstruction in the agricultural, industrial and commercial fields, instead of being able to offer abundance of employment, instead of trying to harness to the nation's advantage the brains <Col N="952" /> and brawn of our manhood and womanhood, we are settling down to a policy of exporting them to Britain at a rate greater than during the war years.</P>
    <P>I do not blame these unfortunate people for seeking employment in Britain.  It is their only alternative to the workhouse or to beggarly pittances. They have been driven there by economic conditions.  No sense of love of work in Britain induces them to go; no sense of love for British food standards, no sense of affection for a different concept of life.  They go for one reason only, that employment there is a passport to the means of sustaining themselves and providing for their families at home.</P>
    <P>Our inability to plan our national life is responsible for this mass emigration.  If that situation is not grappled with at an early date on a comprehensive basis I venture to say that in the remaining months of this year, next year and the succeeding year there will be a continuous drift of the most virile of our population to Britain, simply because we are too lazy to plan the national economy which would provide them with employment at home.  Obviously, we cannot provide them with employment at home by relying on the methods which have produced such unsatisfactory results in the past.  It cannot be done on the basis of planning our national life by rule of thumb methods.  It cannot be done merely by hoping that the difficulties which threaten us will not materialise and that by some accidental happening in another country we may escape the blizzard that assuredly is blowing our way.</P>
    <P>If we are to plan a national life which will keep our people at home and attract others to return we must create some competent planning authority, something in the nature of an economic council such as Fianna Fáil in its opposition days used to favour, something in the nature of a competent planning committee composed of people of goodwill, knowledge, sagacity and experience, people with drive and fervent enthusiasm, to harness the national resources in brain power and brawn to the tasks which require to be done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="953" /> I think the Minister was stating the truth yesterday, and the merest truth, when he said that our biggest problem at home is the problem of production. Of course, our biggest problem is the problem of production.  It is the problem which affects every activity of our national life.  Production in this country, as in every other country, determines the standard of living.  Where you have low production, you have a low standard of living.  Where you have sluggish, inefficient production, you have a low standard of living and a constant threat to economic security. It must be realised here that it is only by stepping up production that we can distribute more and that it is only by the creation of wealth in the form of increased production, not in the form of imported bank-notes, that we can provide a decent standard of living. That basic and unassailable truth cannot be emphasised too often, but I fear that too little attention is being paid to it in the whole economic set-up in this country.  Its acceptance as a basis of our national life is for us a guarantee that we at last see the road which will lead to a better standard of living for our people.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the Minister's speech to which I should like to make a brief reference.  I think the Minister was unduly optimistic, or I fear that events will show him to be unduly optimistic, in respect of turf production. I do not think it is possible for the county councils to reach a 600,000-ton target this year.  I see nothing wrong in endeavouring to gear them up to that target, if it is possible to do so. But there is one thing I am definitely doubtful about, that is, the ability of the turf camps to produce the 200,000 tons suggested by the Minister.  I venture to say that if the Minister makes inquiries he will find that there are fewer people in the turf camps this year than there were last year and that many of those who have come to the camps have already started to leave them, that in the camps there is a feeling that the present wage of 56/- per week is inadequate for the hard work of turf production.</P>
    <P>Conditions in the camp do not help to produce stability of employment. <Col N="954" /> Out of the wage of 56/- a week, there is a charge of £1 a week for the food that is supplied in the camp.  When a man is not working, such as on wet days, he gets no wages whatever.  For the week he does no work and cannot work because of wet weather he gets nothing whatever in wages but is liable to pay £1 in respect of food.  That is chalked up against him as a debt and is deducted out of the next full week's wages that he gets.  If you have a situation in which employment for one or two weeks is punctuated by a week's idleness due to wet weather, the result so far as the turf worker is concerned is that his credit balance at the end of a period punctuated by bad weather, is so small that there is no inducement to him to remain in the camp.  I think turf production is one of the most vital problems confronting us.  I would like to see the turf camps filled to capacity, the workers there working with enthusiasm to produce turf, and I would suggest to the Minister that he ought to take a hand in the task of bringing into the turf camps that measure of satisfaction without which, I feel sure, workers will not be attracted to the turf camps&mdash;and will not stay even if we can manage to get some of them there&mdash;and without which they will not work with the enthusiasm which is necessary in order to produce the maximum quantity of turf.  I would suggest, therefore, to the Minister that the problem of the wages and the conditions of turf camp workers ought to be tackled quickly while the season is yet young and while we can still plan a comprehensive turf programme in respect of the camps. Every effort ought to be made to arrive at an agreement with the workers which will give them a reasonable rate of wages and good conditions and in that way endeavour to harness their enthusiasm to the task of winning the maximum quantity of turf which the nation requires.</P>
    <P>In his speech yesterday the Minister made reference to our sterling assets. I think he might have made a more detailed reference to the position and might have told us in more detail the Government's views in respect of the assets which have accumulated in Britain.  In the main, our sterling <Col N="955" /> assets have been built up during two war periods&mdash;during two periods when we exported to Britain more goods than we got from her&mdash;and these assets represent, in the main, the measure of deficiency in goods which we ought to have received on a trading basis with Great Britain.  But these are definitely our assets.  They represent, so far as we are concerned, a loss of capital goods or equipment here or a loss of consumer goods which ought to have been available to us on a parity trading basis with Great Britain.  If we did not take from Great Britain the equivalent quantity of goods which she gave us and, instead, preferred to accumulate sterling assets or were compelled to accumulate them because of the inability of Great Britain to supply us with the goods we need, that is no reason why these assets should not be available to us for trade in circumstances in which these assets can be used.  These assets should, and must be, available to us to finance imports and to purchase equipment and capital goods and I hope the Government here have made it clear to the British Government that our right to use these assets is in no way diminished and that we consider we have a perfect right to draw on assets now in Britain for the purpose of financing our trade with Britain, or, where existing arrangements permit, utilising these assets to finance imports from other countries.  I hope no time will be lost in making that problem clear to the British because, as the Minister knows, Britain has financial entanglements elsewhere and in order to extricate herself from the most difficult portions of these entanglements may well be inclined to make promises in respect of her sterling liabilities which may as a result impede the use by us of sterling assets which are urgently needed to finance our trading activities and especially needed in view of the picture of trade given to us by the Minister yesterday.</P>
    <P>I propose, therefore, that no time should be lost in making that problem clear to the British.  If these assets were to continue to be frozen, if they were not to be available for financing our export and import trade, then a <Col N="956" /> very serious situation would confront us and that situation would be particularly serious for us in view of the figures given by the Minister yesterday when he indicated that the total value of our imports was £71,000,000 and our exports £38,000,000.  The difference will have to be paid for, therefore, by our sterling assets which have accumulated abroad.  There is little likelihood apparently that they can be paid for in stepped-up production judging by the difficulties revealed by the Minister in his speech yesterday.</P>
    <P>In the course of his statement yesterday the Minister made reference to the fuel position.  He made reference to the Government's intention to sell the Slieveardagh coal-field to private interests. That aspect of the matter has been dealt with by Deputy Davin and I do not desire to travel over that ground again, but I observe from what the Minister said that it was proposed to ask the Mining Exploration Company to undertake exploration work. In that connection I would like to say to the Minister that there is a widespread belief based on geological and other reports which have been submitted from time to time that there is abundance of coal in this country.  A person recently writing the history of Carlow records that about 100 years ago it was a common sight to see 1,000 carts loaded with coal coming away from a coal-field situated a short distance outside Carlow town, and he records the fact that a very considerable volume of trade was done in respect of that coal-field.  Statements of that kind and reports made by persons who have some authority to regard themselves as eminent in the mineral field have created an impression in this country that coal is available but that somehow or other we are not prepared to mine the coal.</P>
    <P>So long as we do not bore for coal and so long as we do not endeavour to ascertain in the only practicable way in which we can ascertain whether coal is available, mainly by boring, a belief that this country abounds in coal will still persist.  I would suggest to the Minister that 25 years after the establishment of an Irish Government it is time we commenced in a comprehensive <Col N="957" /> way to ascertain the extent of our coal deposits: to find out once and for all if we have coal or not: to find out whether, if we have coal, it is of a kind which it would pay us to mine and if we have not coal then let us, for all time, bury that illusion and plan other ways.  So long as we do not try to ascertain the extent of our coal deposits the people will persist in their belief that there is an abundance of coal and that there is some authority which is preventing its mining.  I want at all events to see that hare chased until such time as it is caught. If there is coal there by all means let us get it out of the earth but let us at all events bore to see what is there and let us with the realism of knowledge based on boring experience tell the nation whether or not we have coal and if so to what extent and whether it would pay us to try to make the coal merchantable.  At all events, it should be tried, and some effort ought to be made to clear up that mineral mystery and see whether Ireland has or has not coal.</P>
    <P>The mention of coal in that connection brings me to our own difficulties in respect of imported coal.  It is perfectly true that with a very limited output of coal at home, we have to depend on coal imports.  One has only to examine the world picture in respect of coal production to realise that the only place from which we are likely to get coal in any quantity is from Great Britain.  Because of the unprecedented difficulties encountered by Great Britain following the recent abnormal weather, it was necessary for Britain to look to her own requirements first and that resulted in a closing down of coal exports to this country, a situation which caused very serious conditions to arise here.  We have just staggered out of these difficulties, but we have no more than staggered out of them, and, whilst Britain is now making coal available, the quantity is very limited and the quality is particularly bad.  I am assured, by authorities competent to judge coal, that the last consignment which we got was particularly bad; it is almost impossible to distinguish some of it from slate.</P>
    <P>That probably is one of the inevitable <Col N="958" /> consequences of Britain being immersed in coal difficulties, but I am perfectly satisfied, in fact, I am as certain as that I am standing here, that Britain has seen the last of her real coal difficulties and that she is leaving her worst problems behind.  I have been assured by representatives of the National Union of Mine Workers of Great Britain that, through the medium of 705,000 members of that organisation, they believe they will not only be able to reach the British Government's target of 200,000,000 tons of coal by December, but that they hope to be able to pass that target.  At all events, amongst those in a position to judge, there is a confident belief that coal production will go up and up and that, with new people coming into the mines, there will be an increase in the number not merely in the mines, but at the coal face, which is the most important part of mining activity; there will be an improvement to such an extent that Britain's coal difficulties will have disappeared by the end of this year and will be substantially alleviated from now onwards.</P>
    <P>With Britain in that position, we have a strong claim to an adequate allowance of her coal.  Firstly, we are Britain's oldest and best customer in respect of coal.  We have had a long and uninterrupted trade in coal with Britain.  We have always paid Britain for any coal we got and we have never been in the position with Britain, as other European countries are to-day, of trying to get coal without being able to pay for it in goods or in cash.  Apart from these considerations, during the war we gave Britain more goods than she gave us and, in addition, we have supplied, and have continued to supply her with many essential commodities which she needs for the feeding of her own people.  Then, again, there are thousands, in fact tens of thousands, of miners of Irish birth or Irish extraction working in the British coalfields, and it is not unnatural that, if we send portion of our population to mine coal in Britain we have, apart from trade and business considerations altogether, a moral lien on some of the coal produced by those who have left this country for the purpose of aiding coal production in Britain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="959" /> Marshalled together, I think these arguments constitute a formidable claim for a reasonable allocation of coal from Great Britain and I do not think the British Government will attempt to challenge the moral basis on which a claim for coal, fortified by these arguments, stands.  The only objection that could be offered would be a scarcity of supplies, but I am satisfied the scarcity of supplies so far as coal is concerned will be a diminishing problem and that we will be able to approach the British Government in the future with the knowledge that our arguments are stronger than ever as their resources in coal are better than they have been and these resources tend to become more abundant as the weeks and the months pass by.</P>
    <P>I suggest, therefore, that as there is an abundance of goodwill towards Ireland in Britain amongst those who produce and distribute the coal, and in British governmental circles, we ought not to neglect the opportunity of availing of that goodwill for the purpose of securing coal imports, which are such a dire necessity in our present circumstances. I will make this suggestion to the Minister, that as his recent visit to Britain was made while she was still immersed in very serious coal difficulties, the position is easing from day to day and week to week, and that he might again find an opportunity of going to Britain and discussing with the British Minister for Fuel and Power and with other members of the British Cabinet the question of putting our coal imports on a basis which will enable us to know, in a given month or quarter or a given year, what quantity of coal we are likely to get so that, fortified by that knowledge, it would be possible for us to plan our industrial development and ration coal among our heavy industries in such a manner as to maintain maximum employment for our people and the maximum output for the nation.</P>
    <P>I think we can make a good deal with the British Government in respect of coal, notwithstanding their difficulties. We were, in a world in which coal production was normal, a very valuable market for British coal.  I think <Col N="960" /> Britain wants to retain this market for coal and will be prepared to recognise that an old, reliable and solvent customer like Ireland is a customer whose claims ought to be respected, and I feel sure that a visit by the Minister in a month's time for the purpose of negotiating a coal settlement with Britain will be a fruitful mission so far as the Minister and the nation are concerned.</P>
    <P>That takes me to the point as to our general trading position <i>vis-a-vis</i> Britain's trading position.  I have never regarded trade as a matter of nationality nor have I ever been able to see trade through the spectacles of nationality.  I do not see why trade should in any way be allied to politics or to the political complexion of any Government.  Trade is purely a matter of living, a matter of surviving.  It is one of those things that you have got to engage in, if you are to have good national housekeeping.  I, therefore, regard trade purely as a matter of business. I think, on that basis, we ought to trade with the person or the country with whom we are likely to get the most satisfactory agreement from our point of view.  If we want to trade with a particular country we can do so; nobody is compelling us to do so.  If we do not like to trade with that particular country we need not trade with it but I am convinced that we have got to trade with some country, with a country that can supply our wants more comprehensively than any other.  I think we have got to realise that an agreement of that kind must not only be comprehensive but it must have a durability to enable us to plan our own national life.  In this country, whether we like it or not, our economy is closely integrated with Britain's economy. We have a large number of firms which have been established very largely out of the activities of parent companies in Britain, which are getting their raw materials through the parent companies in Britain, which are in part financed by the parent companies in Britain or which rely very largely for technical guidance on parent companies in Britain. In the past and at present that type of industrial activity is an important factor in our whole industrial set-up. Even apart from that point, we <Col N="961" /> here are tied to sterling, tied even to parity with sterling, even though we might even break from parity with sterling if we so desired.  Whether we like it or not we cannot at present get away from sterling or from parity with sterling. We have got to remain with sterling. Our destiny is ultimately bound up with sterling as a medium of exchange.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Aside from the consideration which I have just mentioned, we export to Britain practically our whole exportable surplus.  The position in respect to our exports to other countries is that, in 1946, we got from other countries £34,000,000 worth of goods and we were able to export to these countries only £3,000,000 worth of goods, clearly indicating that Britain takes the bulk of our exports and that we get from Britain a very large measure of our imports.  Now, we need essential supplies.  Britain has many of the essential supplies which we need.  Britain needs agricultural produce from this country.  We have not as much to give as we would wish to give her but, at all events, we can plan to make availble our surplus agricultural produce which can be utilised for the purpose of trading with Britain in exchange for the goods which Britain has and which we need.  Again looking at this matter from a business point of view and from no other point of view&mdash;I am not concerned with the external political relations of Britain, I am not concerned with the British Commonwealth; I am looking at this matter purely as a business transaction &mdash;we have got goods which Britain wants and Britain has goods which we want.  Having regard to the trading relations between the two countries for generations, to our proximity to Britain and the inter-relation between our trade and her trade, does it not <Col N="962" /> seem a good proposition, a purely business proposition, to make a trade agreement with a country which wants what we have and from whom we want what she has?</P>
      <P>Britain at the moment is casting her eyes round to make trade agreements wherever she thinks it best to make such agreements.  Many of the trade agreements which she may make, in the absence of a trade agreement with us, might have very harmful consequences so far as our future trade with Britain is concerned.  In Britain, in respect to coal, there is good will and understanding of our point of view. Tens of thousands of our people are in Britain.  Tens of thousands of our people are good and estimable citizens there.</P>
      <P>Many of the people who cross from Britain to this country go back with sympathy and understanding of this country.  I would suggest to the Minister, therefore, that we ought without further delay, examine from a purely business point of view, whether it would not pay us at the earliest opportunity to open talks with the British Government with the object of making a trade agreement, the purpose of which would be to give her our surplus exports in return for what we need from her.  That put on the basis of a formal agreement to last for a period of years during which we would know what our export commitments are and what imports we must pay for, would enable us to plan here to produce goods to finance the imports which it is necessary for us to purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look at what we have to export, the picture is by no means a happy one.  In many respects it is most dismal but I do not think it is so dismal or so bleak as to be incapable of improvement. Frankly, I do not think that we shall ever have, except perhaps in the case of one or two industries or perhaps at most a half-dozen industries, manufactured goods to export to Great Britain.  Britain is a highly industrialised country.  If you look at the range of our manufactures and at the range of manufactures in Britain, you will find that it is only in a very limited direction that we can hope to export manufactured goods to Britain.  Can <Col N="963" /> you send to Britain any type of metalware? Of course not, except the odd thing that might be in short supply in Britain temporarily.  In the whole range of secondary industries, there is nothing that you can sell to Britain. They might take some stuff that we have to export if they could get it at their price but if their price were lower than ours, we could sell to them only under the cost of production.</P>
    <P>But there is a field in which we can find exports.  I think we can find exports on a planned basis in respect of textiles.  I think we can find exports on a planned basis, not to-morrow or next week or next month&mdash;perhaps not even next year&mdash;in dairy produce.  We can find exports in canned meat and fresh meat, in bacon, eggs and poultry and activities of that kind.  We can, by starting to plan now, by building up now, by putting drive and enthusiasm behind the plan, create in the course of time an agricultural economy which will enable us to exchange our exportable agricultural surplus for the import of goods which we cannot produce here.  Agriculture, however, in our circumstances, in which 55 out of every 100 persons employed in the country get a livelihood, is the best source of products for export, and if we are ever to get away from the stagnant agricultural position which we have had for the past 25 years, the stagnant position we have had notwithstanding all the artificial pressure towards the stimulation of production during the past six years, we can only do so by planning for agriculture, by stimulating production and by making available to agriculture the most modern methods of agricultural production that it is possible to introduce.</P>
    <P>I frankly do not think that we can ever get an agricultural surplus by spade labour, nor do I see a great agricultural surplus ever being made available by a horse pulling a plough.  If we are ever to get an agricultural surplus, we can get it only by utilising the land to the fullest, by fertilising it as much as possible, by giving the farmer all the financial assistance within our resources, by giving loans free of interest or almost free of interest to credit-worthy farmers to stock <Col N="964" /> their lands, to fertilise their lands, to buy agricultural equipment to exploit their lands, by giving them a fair price for agricultural produce and by letting them know in advance what they are to produce and what price they will get for that produce, and in that way gear them up to a programme which they can feel sure will not be interrupted either in price levels or volume by any accidental circumstance which may spell bankruptey for the farmer.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that it is only in respect of agriculture that we will have any valuable exportable surplus.  While the Minister is not specially charged with energising our agricultural possibilities, I suggest to him, as a live and active member of the Cabinet, that he ought to try to gear the Cabinet up to a realisation that, if we have to pay for imports, agriculture looks the best field in which to get the goods to pay for those imports.  I see, however, no evidence of any plan to stimulate agricultural production.  What we have seen during the past six years, even under the artificial stimulus of an emergency, has been a recession in agriculture rather than a stimulation of production, and I am afraid that that tendency will continue, because I see at present none of the factors necessary to produce the enthusiasm for increased agricultural production which must be there, if we are ever to expand agricultural production.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I am convinced of one thing, and I am more convinced of it than ever, having listened to the Minister's speech yesterday.  It is that if we are to avoid the worst evils which are calculated to flow from a situation in which we import £71,000,000 worth of goods and export only £38,000,000 worth, we can only do so on the basis of making a firm and comprehensive trade agreement by which we can swap goods on a £ for £ basis.  That will not only finance our imports but will maintain our home production, and, at the same time, give us the essential commodities which we cannot produce here and on the importation of which we have to rely.  I suggest to the Minister that, in present circumstances, he has an excellent opportunity of making a satisfactory and comprehensive trade agreement.  He has the ability to do <Col N="965" /> it and the energy to do it.  He knows that the situation at home demands that it should be done, and I want to conclude by suggesting that the Minister ought to give very serious thought to the possibility, in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, of opening talks for a comprehensive trade agreement which would avoid some of the worst evils which, I fear, will flow from the Minister's realistic review of our economic position, unless these evils are circumvented by means of an economy based on a pound's worth of imports for every pound's worth of exports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to a few matters affecting my constituency of South Kerry. The Minister has said that it is the intention of Bord na Móna to take over the cutting of turf now carried on by the Kerry County Council, and I should like to get an assurance from him that, in the future, the board will continue to cut turf in South Kerry to the same extent as that to which it has been cut up to the present.  The turf scheme has been a great benefit to the small farmers and labourers in Kerry, and it would be a great hardship on the community if it were to be discontinued. I have the fear that in the future the board will discontinue the cutting of turf in isolated localities, that they will tell us that the cost of production is too high and will point to the difficulties of transport; but I can assure the Minister that we are most anxious that this scheme should be continued.  Because of our geographical situation, it is hard to expect anyone to set up small factories in places in South Kerry, but we do not want these small factories, if we have the turf scheme.  In my opinion, it is the most valuable industry we have in that area.  We have the fishing industry there, but I must admit that the turf scheme has brought far more money into that area than the fishing industry. The Minister must bear in mind that, during the emergency and up to date, the farmers of Kerry have done their utmost to provide turf for the people, and I hope he will remember that if a situation does arise in which the abandonment of South Kerry as a turf producing area is contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="966" /> When the county council first took over turf production, their officials and engineers were not familiar with the business and knew very little about it. They neglected to consult the local people who knew the secrets of turf production, and mistakes were made. The officials, of course, learned from these mistakes, and it must be admitted to their credit that, in the past few years, they have carried out the turf production scheme in a very efficient manner.</P>
    <P>I nevertheless consider that the county council officials are still making mistakes.  Farmers constantly point out to me the errors which continue to be made and I suggest that, when the board take over these schemes, they should be prepared to discuss these matters with the local people and get their views on them.  Local knowledge is very useful.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the necessity for erecting shelters in bogs.  The Minister is aware that in the turf-producing areas in Kerry the workmen are carried by lorry long distances.  I know a case where they have to be carried upward of 20 miles.  These workmen are let down in the bogs, the lorries go away and, if the day is wet, the workmen have to stay out all day in the open.  I need not say that that is a great hardship. These men have constantly asked me to make representations on the matter. If the board are not prepared to erect substantial shelters in these bogs, they should, at least, put up shelters of a temporary nature.  I believe that the workmen would be satisfied if a few army huts were erected in the bogs so that they could shelter in them in wet weather.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The huts might go down a bog hole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister should see that inspectors are present at the loading of turf at railway stations.  One man at each railway station would be quite sufficient because, if a person is familiar with turf production, he will see at a glance whether the turf is of good quality or not.  If inferior turf is to be rejected it <Col N="967" /> should be rejected at the source and not at its destination and thus save valuable wagon space, which is at present occasionally used for wet turf.</P>
      <P>The people of South Kerry undergo great hardships in getting to Dublin at present.  No buses are running south of Tralee or Killarney.  I admit that there is a goods train leaving Cahirciveen but that leaves about three o'clock in the evening and those travelling by it do not get to Dublin until nine o'clock in the morning.  I suggest to the Minister that, on a few days per week, he should arrange for buses to travel from Tralee and Killarney to Cahirciveen and thus facilitate people in getting the connection to Dublin.  I know that there are difficulties in the way.  I may be told that the road is too narrow in certain places.  But these difficulties could be overcome.</P>
      <P>A number of hackney people have made representations to me concerning refusal to grant them increased allowances of petrol.  Those people had formerly small hackney cars.  Recently, they purchased larger cars, thinking they would get an increase in the petrol ration for them.  In view of the exceptional transport position in Kerry, I ask the Minister to make an exception in these cases and to grant an increased allowance of petrol to the people to whom I refer.</P>
      <P>On several occasions recently, I have drawn the Minister's attention to the necessity for giving an extra allowance of bread to fishermen&mdash;particularly inshore fishermen.  The fishermen have, I think, a very good case.  As everybody knows, fishermen engaged in the mackerel and herring industry leave their homes about four o'clock in the evening and do not return from the fishing grounds until between seven o'clock and nine o'clock the following morning.  If the boats have fish to land, the men will not be able to get to their homes until about 12 o'clock. In these boats, there are small cabins in which the fishermen at night prepare a cup of tea for themselves.  I think that the Minister should give an increased ration of bread to these men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention is the <Col N="968" /> bad transport service provided by Córas Iompair Éireann for the fishing industry since 1946.  The service is unsatisfactory.  Up to a few years ago, Córas Iompair Éireann were in a position to supply a good service but, during 1946, the fish reached the English market 24 hours later than they did under the service given in other years. That is a serious matter for the industry, because the English fishermen are in a position to supply large quantities of fish to their own market and, if our industry is to prosper, we must see to it that the railway company gives a cheap and efficient service, so that our fish will reach the English market with the least possible delay.  The Minister realises that, if we are to have prosperity, we must export.</P>
    <P>There is a rumour in circulation in Kerry that it is the intention of Córas Iompair Éireann not to open up a number of branch lines.  There is a fear that the Dingle branch line will not be opened up.  If that line is discontinued, I can assure the Minister that it will cause great hardship to the people who reside on the Dingle peninsula.  The Minister must be aware that large quantities of mackerel are landed on that peninsula at certain periods of the year.  It is impossible for Córas Iompair Éireann to provide a proper road service for the transport of fish.  The fishing industry is a very difficult industry from that point of view.  It is very hard to make plans in advance or to say when heavy quantities of fish will be landed.  To provide an efficient transport service by road would mean that Córas Iompair Éireann would have to keep five or six lorries in Dingle week after week so that they would be in position and available when the fish would be landed.  I need not point out to the Minister that Córas Iompair Éireann would not adopt this procedure. We should probably find that a large quantity of fish would be landed on a particular date when Córas Iompair Éireann would not have sufficient lorries available.  I assure the Minister that it is absolutely vital to the fishing industry in West Kerry that the Dingle line be kept open.</P>
    <P>Another matter of which the fishermen and fish merchants of South and West Kerry complain is as regards the <Col N="969" /> freight on fish.  Up to recently, Córas Iompair Éireann were prepared to accept a small box of fish, making allowance for the ice.  Now they have adopted the extraordinary attitude that they are entitled to charge freight on the actual weight, which includes the ice, which melts in a short time. The company, by adopting this method, are charging on unjust freight.  In addition to charging on actual weight, they are now increasing their freight rate by 20 per cent.  This increase means that it will cost 2/- extra to send a box of fish from West or South Kerry to the London market.  I am of opinion that the mackerel industry cannot stand such an increase.  It means that fish merchants who were formerly in a position to pay 16/- per long hundred to fishermen will not be able to pay more than about 10/- per long hundred, which would not be sufficient remuneration to the fishermen.  It must be remembered, too, that boats, oil and gear are dear.  Unless the Minister interests himself in this matter, I cannot see any hope for the mackerel industry of South Kerry.  I am not exaggerating. I have constantly taken the matter up with Córas Iompair Éireann officials but they are, evidently, determined to get this increase and they say, further, that it is not their business to subsidise the fishing industry.  I do not agree with subsidies.  I do not believe that subsidies of this nature would help the fishing industry but, owing to the fact that the fishermen's price will be reduced by 6/- per long hundred, I am afraid the Government has no alternative but to bring in subsidies to keep down the freight on fish from West Kerry to the London market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been a source of refreshment to me to hear so much economic orthodoxy proclaimed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and by Deputy Norton.  I have endured so much abuse and rage and fury, in saying so many of those things that the Minister and Deputy Norton said to-day, for the last 15 years that it intrigues me to discover that my labours were not in vain and that the two converts, although belated, are to be counted amongst the fruits of my labour.  However, it is very important, <Col N="970" /> in view of the extremely critical situation revealed by the Minister's statement, first, to consider for a moment certain fundamental facts and, secondly, to make such contribution as one can to the solution of the problems that lie ahead.  We are going to experience great difficulty in financing the purchase abroad of things our people want.  The strange thing is that Great Britain is having exactly the same difficulty at the present moment. The British people at this moment are hungry, they are very shabby, thousands and thousands of them will have to give up cigarettes and tobacco, because Great Britain has not got dollars to buy the goods.  A great people, who have borne the heat and burden of the day for seven years, sometimes alone, in the struggle to preserve human liberty in the world, are now shabby, down at heel and hungry, because they have not got dollars.</P>
      <P>It often amazes me that men and women all over the world resolutely close their eyes to the simple fact that if to-morrow the Commonwealth of Nations and the United States of America would proclaim free passage for men, money and goods over their respective territories, all the embarrassment that we suffer from, that Great Britain suffers from and that threatens in America by way of industrial dislocation consequent on the drying up of her foreign markets, would vanish overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of practical people are inclined to say: &ldquo;Oh, that is visionary, that is not practical politics.&rdquo;  Maybe it is not.  It is none the less the truth. There is nothing to prevent it; it involves no infringement of national sovereignty, no interference by any one State in the affairs of its neighbour. It simply takes a group of people on the face of the world whose fundamental beliefs closely approximate, who feel in very much the same way about the things that matter, and says to them: &ldquo;Over the territory that we occupy, men, money and goods may move freely, without let or hindrance.&rdquo; In one hour, the hunger, the shabbiness and the gloom is dissipated over England, the microscopic problems that confront us are at once solved, American <Col N="971" /> industry, instead of being faced with a recession, finds itself confronted with a challenge to greater production, and all the primary producers of the American continent have before them the problem for their lifetime of having their ingenuity taxed to fill the requirements of those who are ready, willing, anxious and able to buy and pay for the foodstuffs those primary producers could produce.</P>
    <P>All that is denied to us by an elaborate international, financial set-up which says that we must have dollars and we must have pounds and unless a manifestly unobtainable balance is established between the purchases of Great Britain in one place and of the United States in another, an endless struggle must go on for that equation, which can never be attained, and the sanctions devised to create the undesirable and unattainable quality are poverty, hunger and gloom for a large part of the human race.  God only knows why: I do not.</P>
    <P>I have never met, in any international gathering that I attended, a rational legislator who was prepared to defend that in private and I have rarely met one who was prepared to attack it in public.  Some day, people will come to realise the curse this whole loathsome structure of tariffs, currency restrictions and restrictions on the free passage of men over the face of the earth constitute.  Then they will be swept away; but, in the meantime, I suppose we must go on labouring under them, hoping that, if we do not live to see the day of their abolition, our children or children's children may.</P>
    <P>We have to deal with the facts that confront us now.  I read with interest that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has made our case to the International Food Council for 405,000 tons of wheat per annum for several years ahead, and that he has accompanied that request with an undertaking to accept that quantity and pay for it in each year that they are prepared to concede it.  I could not resist, when I met Deputy Allen, of Wexford, downstairs in the Lobby, pausing to congratulate him on this great day, when the wheat scheme had finally gone up <Col N="972" /> the spout.  Now, 405,000 tons of wheat represent 3,000,000 barrels; 3,000,000 barrels of wheat at 90 per cent. extraction represent 2,700,000 sacks of flour per annum; and that is the total consumption of flour of our people&mdash;one sack per head, including women and children.  The Minister is perfectly right in deciding that our contribution to the cereal output of agricultural land can best be made&mdash;and will be made most gladly&mdash;in those forms of cereal products which are just as badly needed in other parts of the world as wheat is wanted here.  Our land, our husbandry, is capable of contributing to the world pool of food requirements a far more substantial contribution, provided our agricultural industry is not forced into the strait-jacket of an attempted wheat production which it is quite incapable efficiently to perform.</P>
    <P>He also spoke of coal.  I agree with Deputy Norton that the coal target fixed by the British Government is substantially below that which they confidently anticipate to reach.  I think that when Deputy Norton talks about going over and making bargains he is talking through his hat, and he knows it.  We have nothing to bargain with at the present time, except our reliance on the knowledge that the people who live in the island next door to us are a reasonable people, and that the people who inhabit the United States of America are bound to us by many ties of family and blood.  That is the only thing that we have got at the present time.  It may be that by careful organisation in the years that lie ahead we may be able to offer goods with which to bargain.  I do not take so pessimistic a view as Deputy Norton did in connection with wheat and coal. I want to say this, that I was not aware until the kept newspaper of the Government announced it in a sub-leader yesterday that my person was made to correspond with that of Mr. Henry Wallace and Mr. Churchill in foreign countries during the war.  In the words of that paper:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;During the war, it suited the British and American Press to represent Mr. James Dillon as an influential Irish statesman, with the result that <Col N="973" /> he is still suffering from a mistaken idea of his own importance.  There is no excuse for Mr. Dillon, for, unlike the British War leader and the former American vice-President, he has never held or seemed likely to hold any post of responsibility in his own country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Well, if during the war years I was represented as speaking for a far larger section of our people than, in fact, I did, it may have been no harm that that voice which, in the darkest days, protested friendship for Great Britain and the United States of America was made to sound louder than perhaps it should.  If, in fact, it was, this is the first information that I have on it.  Perhaps it could be turned to good purpose now because if it did, and if that voice resounds for Ireland again to tell our friends in Great Britain and America who listened then to listen now and believe that when the Minister for Industry and Commerce bespeaks wheat and coal for our people he does it for no ulterior purpose and with no primary desire to derive riches or wealth from either of these products, but for the fundamental purpose of feeding the people and of preserving essential services, of keeping from cold and misery tens of thousands of our people in the cities who will be cold unless coal is made available, and are fated to suffer most acutely in the winter that lies ahead no matter how energetic our efforts may be in the meantime to provide alternative fuel in the form of turf&mdash;if the kept organ of the Government will use its machinery for promoting the resonance of my voice now, it may serve some useful purpose.</P>
    <P>We have travelled a long way down the road since Deputy Aiken, the Minister for Finance, was wishing to God that all the ships that sailed the seven seas might be sunk in the bottom of the ocean so that Ireland, at last alone in self-sufficiency, would really know the happiness of abundance.  Deputies remember that passionate proclamation. It is gratifying to know now that we realise that, if our people are to live in this country, we must export.  Remember this, that all our people will not die in Ireland.  There are going to be for the next ten years powerful inducements <Col N="974" /> to most of our people to leave Ireland and go to Great Britain if standards of living fall too low in Ireland.  We will see in our day the greatest exodus of the Irish people that history has ever witnessed.  Mind you, for the last five years we have seen the greatest emigration since the Famine. It is nothing to what we will see in the next ten years unless requisite measures are taken to ensure that a tolerable standard of living will be maintained in this island, and it is going to take us all our time to do it. We have the materials which we can export, and we have got to make up our minds that we intend to export them.  We have got to export them at a profit.  There is no use exporting goods if we have to pay the British people to consume them.  Our exports, the ones that we can make money on, are the perishable products of the agricultural industry delivered in the British market in a fresh condition&mdash; Guinness's porter, Jacob's biscuits, men's suitings and, Deputy Norton notwithstanding, such branches of the metal industry, the ready-made clothing industry, the chemical industry, the value content of which is measured more in skill and specialisation than in the methods of mass production. It is quite a mistake to say that living in the lee of Great Britain there are no industrial products which we can hope to export to England.  The very fact that England is a wealthy, industrial country makes it a great potential market for the kind of industrial products this country might very well produce, given the right atmosphere and a realisation of what is truly necessary.</P>
    <P>England would not be the only customer.  I know of one manufacturer at the present moment who could bring from New York to this city the buyer of the most exclusive fashion house on Fifth Avenue and constrain her to admit that, in the particular specialised line of ladies' wear which he was manufacturing, he could put garments before her superior in finish and in material to anything that she had seen in Paris or London.  The material was made in County Dublin and the garments were made by Irish men and women in this city.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> But they were made painstakingly. They were expensive.  The more that experienced buyer examined them and the more she tore open the seams to find out what went on inside, the more deeply impressed was she as to what a really good Irish industry could produce when it went the right way about it.  It suddenly dawned on her that here in the City of Dublin there might be something produced of that character where skill and care and high standard rule, which would match anything produced anywhere all over the world.  If you had asked her to come to Dublin to compare some so-called mass production article here with what she could buy in the great industrial centres of the world, she would not have bothered to waste her time or money in making the expedition.</P>
    <P>We should concentrate now on the production of cattle, sheep, pigs, bacon, eggs, pasteurised cheese, baby foods, vegetables and all the perishable products of the agricultural industry in order to get a surplus of them which will be exportable to Great Britain, and exportable at a profit.  Let us get this into our minds now: If you are serious about that, you have got to take the taxes, the tariffs and the restrictions off the raw materials of the agricultural industry.  Remember the Danish pig and the Irish pig.  If you put a tariff on Indian meal and raise its cost by 2/6 a cwt. and it takes 7 cwts. of meal to feed a pig, the Irish pig will cost 17/6 more than the Danish pig.  When the Irish pig is exported to London it must be sold in competition with the Danish pig.  The Dane may be well pleased to get 10/- profit on his pig and, if he is, and the Irishman has to sell his pig at a price which will yield the Dane 10/-, the Irishman is going to lose 7/6 on every pig he sells&mdash;lose 7/6. Unless this House, this Government and this country are prepared to face that fact, we are done for, and that is as certain as I am standing here.</P>
    <P>And remember, in the same statement in which the Minister has drawn this gloomy picture of our plight, in which he has told us that our only hope of salvation is to export and that he sees no substantial volume of exports except from the agricultural industry, <Col N="976" /> he has announced his intention of preventing the import of sulphate of ammonia&mdash;an essential source of nitrogen for the land&mdash;and of sulphate of copper&mdash;without which the potato crop, which is the raw material of the pig industry in this country, cannot be grown.  If he persists in that, he is mad, stark, staring mad.  If he persists in keeping the price of artificial manure up by tariffs and restrictions, if he continues to keep the price of feeding stuffs up by tariffs and restrictions, if he intends to keep the price of sulphate of copper up by tariffs and restrictions, if he intends to keep the price of all farm implements at the fantastic prices which rule for them, by tariffs and restrictions, he is cutting the throat of the one industry which he himself admits is the country's only hope of surviving the present crisis.</P>
    <P>Is it conceivably possible that Deputies, to whom these facts must be as clear as day, are going to permit him to get away with that fantastic contradiction&mdash;while exhorting the agricultural community of this country to save us by their extra exertions, simultaneously to pile upon them burdens which make it certain that it will be impossible for them to earn a profit on their labour?</P>
    <P>Subsidies, regulations, plans, are largely &ldquo;cod&rdquo;.  There is one thing that will extract from the land of this country the maximum production for consumption at home and export abroad, and that is, the assurance that the man who labours to produce will get a profit on his work.  You can plan till the cows come home but if by your industrial plans you create a situation in which the man who lives upon the land, the individual farmer, discovers that at his local fair or market he is not getting a profit on the things he produces, your plans will all go up the spout because the small farmers of this country will not produce if they cannot make a profit, and why should they? But give them the opportunity of earning a profit upon what they produce and&mdash;they will want no instruction from the Minister for Industry and Commerce or from anybody else&mdash;production will go up and continue to go up, because our people are not afraid of work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> I was astonished to hear Deputy Norton speak of stagnation in the agricultural industry for the last 20 years. Stagnation and regression there have been in the last 15, but, in the first ten years of the existence of this State, look at the agricultural statistics, look at the price commanded by Irish produce on the British market.  See how we began under the obligation of accepting 10 to 15 per cent. less than the Dane could get in London and how, in 1931, no Danish product could command one penny-piece higher than a similar product bearing the Irish trade mark.</P>
    <P>Look at the vast expansion in eggs and pigs going to England&mdash;all swept away, vanished, gone and, in its place, the fraudulent misrepresentation that we were producing our own requirements, which is largely responsible for the fact that we have been denied supplies during the last three months, and which is wholly responsible for the fact that our people have been called upon to eat the wet dirt, masquerading as bread, which they have had to consume because there was nothing else to consume in this country for the last two months.  We cannot remedy all that overnight but, given two years, I would undertake to set up the agricultural industry of this country on the road to surplus exports that would put us back very near to where we used to be.  On the crest of that wave of energy and industry our people were able to forge forward to many remarkable achievements, secure in the knowledge that the fundamental industry of the country was making profit as a whole and, at the same time, that the individuals engaged in that industry were getting a decent living out of it, that they were not being reduced to the fantastic position in which we now are in which butter is being produced in this country at 2/11 a pound and, on that, all we have of it is two ounces per head per week.  The subsidies necessary to procure it for our people at the price they can pay in Ireland constitute an appalling burden on the Exchequer.  In Ireland, as we stand at this moment, bacon is scarce and in Ireland it is not impossible that in the winter that lies ahead, unless we can prevail on countries abroad to send us food, our people may be hungry.  Is it any wonder that <Col N="978" /> the Minister for Industry and Commerce slumps in his seat&mdash;that he is afraid to raise his head?</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the Minister has been frank with the House on the subject of external assets.  No sane man believes that when the international arrangement we are under came into operation sterling was to become freely exchangeable for dollars and that we would be able to go over to England and convert the £200,000,000 we had there into dollars and spend them in the United States of America the following morning.  I believe that while Great Britain is prepared to give us dollars for current burdens she would be prepared to liquidate in instalments, by arrangement, what she owes us in respect of past transactions.  Is not that a fair proposal?  Who would go to an old and respected customer who is temporarily embarrassed and take her by the throat and say: &ldquo;Pay us now and pay us all or you are a robber&rdquo;? Is not it fair to go to her and say: &ldquo;Well, if you are in a jam at the present time, to whom have you a greater right to look to for accommodation than to us and we are glad to be able to do it and we are prepared to wait for our money?  Why not?  You have never reneged on your bargain yet and we do not expect you to do it now.&rdquo; They are an honest people.  They have been that for generations and I would sooner have their note than the note of any other nation on the earth.  Even if they cannot pay it now they will pay it some time and this is no time to challenge them with their temporary embarrassments.  It is a time rather to approach them, equal to equal, telling them that we understand their difficulties and asking them to realise ours. I have never tried to do business with an Englishman yet on that basis that I could not arrive at a reasonable arrangement.  They are not a people who take kindly to being told where they get off.  They are not a people, when they are in a tight corner, to take kindly to being unduly pressed, and what people in the world who are worthy of their salt would take kindly to it?</P>
    <P>I do not believe that it is any of our people's intention or desire to press them in their temporary embarrassment <Col N="979" /> or to be the first to say that we resent their inability to meet their obligations on the nail.  I am convinced that if negotiations are opened with the British Government on that basis a <i>modus vivendi</i> will be arrived at which will permit us to get our essential requirements in the future as in the past.  Let us not forget, when talking about plans and bargains and deeds, Mr. Ziff, the Zionist Communist, notwithstanding, that it was Great Britain who provided the dollars all during the war far in excess of our legitimate claim of honour for the essential requirements that we wanted from America and she more than honoured her bond all through a time when it was hard for her to do it.  She is in trouble now.  I do not believe she has any reason to fear a foray from this side of the Channel.  I do not believe that in the long run we have any more reason to apprehend a double-cross from the people of Great Britain than any other nation trading with her has had reason to deplore in the years that have gone by.  I believe the Minister for Industry and Commerce is perfectly right to continue working to the end of promoting that kind of industry in this country which can compete with any industry in the world.  I believe he is perfectly right to go on seeking opportunities to promote in this country industries which will produce products which will reflect credit on this country no matter what market they may be offered in.  He must realise, however, that there is proceeding in this country, under the shelter of tariffs and quotas, a great deal of detestable fraud by lazy, inefficient, slovenly parasites who simply, because they have sky-high tariffs and quotas, produce anything they like and foist them on the public, in the knowledge that so long as the quota functions they can put what they like on the market.</P>
    <P>I know of no means of controlling that except by taking off the quota, and that is what I would do.  I know the Minister is reluctant to take that course, but if he is, I suggest to him that some kind of tariff commission ought to be established as a permanent feature of his system, before which interested parties who, in their daily trade, see the quality of protected <Col N="980" /> materials steadily deteriorating, would have a right to go and complain that the product that was being offered from the Irish source was no substitute for what could be obtained abroad and that the Irish source should pull up its socks and produce something usable or else the kind of protection they enjoyed should be altered or abolished.</P>
    <P>It is monstrous to see an industry, guaranteed its market, starting off with a great flourish of trumpets and, after two or three years, confining itself to an antediluvian product that is not comparable with what that industry was putting out.  It is a monstrous thing that the agricultural industry of this country should have foisted on it a great many of the implements at present being foisted on it, implements of antediluvian design which no industry in the world outside this country is producing.  Look at the manures that are being manufactured here; look at any of the implements of higher grade than a plough and compare them with up-to-date products from the British and American manufacturers.</P>
    <P>I know the difficulties here.  The market is not large enough to permit of complete retooling of your factory when modern improvements emerge, but look at the consequences to the unfortunate farmer who sees across the Border from Monaghan his prototype with the very latest machinery while he himself is struggling with the kind of implement that was rejected in all modern equipment years and years ago. Irish industry of the right type&mdash; Guinness's, Jacob's and the other industries to which I have referred, such as ready-made clothing, textiles, certain branches of the chemical industry &mdash;all these could make a good contribution to the trade balance of our people.</P>
    <P>How the Minister, who says, in his opening speech, that it is folly to compete in branches of industry which are completely overshadowed by the dominant industries of Great Britain, can at the same time be proclaiming, as a triumphant achievement, that he is expanding the cotton-spinning industry and the cotton-weaving industry in Athlone, is a mystery to me.  Does he not regard the cotton-spinning and <Col N="981" /> weaving industry of Great Britain as one of the industries which overshadows every other industrial unit in that particular branch?  Does he not realise the purchase of raw cotton with which to spin in Athlone means the use of dollars, whereas the purchase of cotton textiles and thread could be financed out of sterling?  How can we ever hope to get anywhere if, in respect of every problem, there are four different policies pulling in four opposite directions?  Either we want to save dollars and eschew these branches of industry where we are going to compete with immense units in Great Britain or the United States of America, or we do not.  But, if we do want to save dollars and avoid competition, if there is one industry that we should not be bothered about it is the cotton-spinning and weaving industry which (1) involves the expenditure of dollars and (2) goes into competition with the whole of Lancashire.</P>
    <P>How in the name of common sense can we go to Great Britain and ask her to deal with us on a reasonable basis of mutual help if, at the same time, we announce one of our primary objects is to strike as hard as it is in our power to hit at one of her most vulnerable industries, to wit, the Lancashire cotton industry?  How much more sensible would it be to say: &ldquo;Look here, every penny in the pockets of our people is going to find itself in Lancashire and Yorkshire. They buy calico, prints, cotton of every kind and description, and it is from you we want to buy them.  Help us to produce the stuff and the prosperity created in Ireland will react on Lancashire and you.&rdquo;  The English are not fools.</P>
    <P>If we go to them with that tale they will say: &ldquo;Very well, that is what you say, but there is not a single traveller in the cotton industry now who bothers to go to Ireland.  There is no sale for calico, long-cloth or union, all the bread-and-butter stuff in the trade. You have pushed us out.  We know you will take the high grade prints that you cannot produce yourself; we know you will take the fine prints, but they are not our bread and butter and they are not the things upon which Lancashire was built.  Every enemy we <Col N="982" /> have has struck at the calico, the sheeting, the union and the long-cloth and now you do the same thing.  Why? Surely to God, in the whole range of industry you could have found something to do in Athlone without cutting in on the bread and butter of our trade?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to sound a note of warning about Rineanna.  I remember the day the Minister announced the agreement his officers had negotiated in Chicago whereunder every United States aeroplane proceeding across this territory towards Europe undertook to land at Rineanna.  On the strength of that we were called upon to provide unlimited funds.  I was the only Deputy&mdash;and I was sternly rebuked by Deputy Morrissey for sounding a discordant note &mdash;who warned this House that we were making a very great mistake and we were securing an utterly illusory advantage. We made an agreement with the Americans in which there were several provisos.  They have the right to give a year's notice to terminate that agreement at their own sweet will. There was no fixed period of ten or 20 years.  Has that notice been given? Has the United States Government asked our Government to accept a year's notice of a proposal to review the air agreement made in Chicago whereby American aeroplanes going across our territory are required to land at Rineanna?  I await with interest the Minister's reply to that inquiry. I think that notice has come or is coming.  The agreement was never worth very much and shortly it will be worth nothing at all.</P>
    <P>If we are to be left with Rineanna and Foynes on our hands, we are making a praiseworthy effort to rescue something out of the wreck by the establishment of a free airport, which will be mainly composed of Foynes seaport, so the derelict hotel may yet come into its own.  In my opinion, it would be much better to spend the most of our future appropriations on the development of air traffic at Collinstown. Whatever future this country may have as a centre of air navigation, it will be near Collinstown and we may just as well make up our minds that, with the development of the modern aeroplane, it can easily proceed from <Col N="983" /> New York to London or Paris without stretching its capacity.</P>
    <P>Ireland as an intermediate stage upon the world traffic lanes is a thing of the past.  It will be with the greatest difficulty that we shall remain on the aerial map at all.  As a point of junction for world routes, I think it highly unlikely that Ireland will be used at all ten years from now.  I have no doubt that to say that at this stage will be regarded by some people as something like high treason: &ldquo;Is it not an awful thing to say?  He does not want Ireland to be on the map at all.&rdquo;  To tell the truth, I do not give a fiddle-de-dee.  I do not see what advantage it is to this country to have Gaby Deslys or Patricia Pott stepping off an aeroplane at Rineanna, flicking her eyes at the photographers and telling the admiring crowd how she would like to live in Ireland, skipping round on her high-heeled shoes and clambering back into the plane again.  I do not see any advantage to this country in traffic of that kind.  Mr. Rockefeller's only contribution to the prosperity of this country when he called there was to refuse to pay the price demanded for Irish handkerchiefs.  He clambered into his plane again and bought all his requirements at a haberdashery counter in New York when he arrived there.  Nor can I see what benefit is conferred on this country if a gentleman like Mr. Bullit steps off an aeroplane and says: &ldquo;Tell my old friend, Mr. de Valera, that I was asking for him&rdquo;, and clambers back into the plane again.</P>
    <P>Goodness knows if you heard the observations about the fellows who do get off and stay in Ennis or some of those other places it would frighten you.  They certainly constitute no advertisement for such visitors.  If it comes to pass that Rineanna ceases to be a junction on the main traffic-ways of the world, I should regret that so much money was spent on it, but I do not think it is something that we should look upon in a tragic light.  I do not think we shall have lost anything of material substance.  If we are able to build up Collinstown as an aerial terminus and erect a few local aerodromes at places like Cork and Sligo, it will mean much more to our people. <Col N="984" /> It would mean a great deal more to me if I could fly down home within an hour after Dáil Eireann had adjourned than know that Patricia Pott or Mr. Bullit stepped off a plane at Rineanna.  If we could provide facilities by which the simple people of our own country could take a trip down to Mayo or Clare whenever they felt like doing so, our people would feel that they were getting more value for the public money expended on airports.  I think it would be a very sensible thing to consider whether we should not expend at least some of this money in providing internal air services that would enable our people to move rapidly round the country and enjoy short periods of leisure with their friends in distant parts.</P>
    <P>The last matter to which I want to refer is one of immense importance of which Deputy Morrissey spoke but with great circumspection.  He spoke of the unauthorised strike.  It is an odd thing that when anyone refers to Communists in this country they at once get mealy-mouthed.  I was in Glasgow recently and spoke at a meeting at which a resolution was carried condemning the imprisonment of Archbishop Stepinac.  I said there, and I want to repeat it here, that Communists are never going to try to get control of the Parliament in England or of Dáil Eireann for the very simple reason that they have not the slightest hope of converting the majority of the British people or of the Irish people to the philosophy of Communism.</P>
    <P>If you reflect for a moment, you will realise that no country in the world ever became Nazi or Communist.  They were made Nazi or they were made Communist by a resolute, small minority which carefully undermined the existing institutions and precipitated social chaos.  Then, being the only group left in the community that knew what it wanted and was organised to take it, they grabbed power and held the remainder of the population in servitude.  I declared that I believed it to be the studied purpose of the Communist Party in Great Britain and this country to infiltrate, not into Parliament, but into the trade unions and to use their power in the trade unions for a dual purpose of which, I think, <Col N="985" /> trade unionists very often lose sight. One purpose is to precipitate sporadic strikes in essential industries for the purpose of embarrassing the Government of the day, just like the turf strike, the sugar strike or any strike that will cause the maximum inconvenience for the community at large with resultant indignation against the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>The second purpose is more subtle, more deadly.  They go into the Amalgamated Transport Workers' Union in England or into the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, the Workers' Union, or any of the other unions you care to name and they get a cell established in some particular branch.  When the time is ripe, they will start an unauthorised strike.  Possibly the Minister for Industry and Commerce will then get into touch with the union headquarters on the 'phone and say: &ldquo;What is this?  I understood there was an agreement registered between the union and the employers which provided for arbitration machinery in the event of a dispute. Why have we this strike now?&rdquo; The union will reply: &ldquo;Oh, the general secretary is going down there to insist on the men returning to work and getting the arbitration machinery into operation.&rdquo;  Down goes the general secretary and when he goes down there the members of his own union throw him out on his ear as they did to Mr. Deakin this year in London and made a public show of him.</P>
    <P>When this happens five or six times, people begin to say: &ldquo;What is the use of making agreements with unions? You deliver your share of the bargain but when it comes to their delivering their share, they are not able to do it.&rdquo; We do not blame them; it is just that they are not able.  They do not control the members of the union any longer.  The fellow who represents the union, the chairman or the general secretary, has no more control over the union than a crossing sweeper.  The union is taken out of their hands, and so you see under your eyes the destruction of what is a very precious asset of a free democratic society, that is, a legitimate, honest trade union movement. Nothing can be more precious <Col N="986" /> in a well ordered democracy and the Communists know that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey seemed to suggest here that it was the Minister's duty to grapple with this conspiracy.  It is not; he has neither the capacity nor the means to grapple with it.  The Labour Party and the trade union movement must do it.  There is nobody who can clean up the trade union movement but the members of it.  God forbid that we should ever see in this country the Government moving into the trade union movement to reorganise it and put it under proper discipline. If the members of the trade union movement are not going to recognise that peril themselves and clean up their own house, nobody on God's earth can do it for them, and so vital a part are they of a free democracy that I dare to say this: if the trade unions betray their own trust and allow Communists who want to tear down this State to get at the State through the trade unions the curse of God will fall on them because nobody else can do the job which the members of the trade union movement can do, and if responsible men stand up and allow our people in the trade unions to be used by the Communists for the purpose of tearing down the State, it is the men in the trade unions, who understand the peril but who are too cowardly to face it, who will be responsible before God in the long run. There is nothing I can do; there is nothing the Minister can do; there is nothing anybody can do but the men in the unions themselves.</P>
    <P>I said that in Glasgow from a public platform and I was approached, when the meeting was over, by a very prominent trade unionist in Scotland, who said: &ldquo;Mr. Dillon, you were perfectly right.  We know that is going on, but it does not suit us to say so.&rdquo;  It is astonishing the number of prominent trade unionists who, in their hearts, know that it is going on, but who find that it does not suit them to say so.  If they play with that ball much longer, they will find that they have sold the pass, and there is no more despicable crime than people who accept responsibility in the office of trustee selling out on that trust because they have not <Col N="987" /> got the courage to do what their obligations demand they should do.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister can meet that peril by Government action.  I think he would probably do more harm than good if he tried, but I do say: &ldquo;Do not let us, in our desire to circumvent the Communist conspiracy, which, though small, is formidable&mdash;the Communist Party is never a big Party; do not judge its power by its size&mdash;be betrayed into destroying our liberties in an effort to control them.&rdquo;  The Communists require one remedy&mdash;the light of day.  That is a thing they cannot stand; that is a thing they hate to face. I have learned that.  There are a couple of them knocking about the public life of this country&mdash;I think there are&mdash;and I am waiting to make sure.  When I am sure, I intend to name them in their presence and to invite them to reconcile their protestations of innocence with the record of their conduct.  That is all that we who stand outside the trade union movement can do&mdash;let in the light of day.  I suggest to the Minister that he should concern himself with that task and leave the rest of it to the trade unionists themselves.</P>
    <P>I am not pessimistic with regard to the various problems which confront us.  I think we will get the coal; I think we will get the wheat; and, if <Col N="988" /> we do not put impossible burdens on the agricultural community, we can produce the exports.  If we meet with disaster, we shall have nobody to blame but ourselves.  I am certain that a Party drawn from this side of the House could run this country along lines in the next two years that would carry us through and that would involve no lamentations, shivering or terrors about the future.  I am apprehensive that we will stumble into disaster under a Fianna Fáil Government. Unless there is a more realistic approach than the contradictory remedies advocated in the Minister's opening statement, I am sure we will.  I am not without hope that this debate may have achieved something, that the Minister may come to realise this fundamental economic fact&mdash;and let us finish on it, so that we may all remember it&mdash;that if you want agriculture to produce the exports, you must ensure that those who work in it will earn a profit, and, to do that, you must take the taxes and restrictions off the raw materials of the agricultural industry.</P>
