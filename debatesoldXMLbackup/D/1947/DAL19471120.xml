      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  It is understood that the following nonmembers of the United Nations were also invited to the conference: Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Finland, Hungary, Italy, Pakistan, Portugal, Rumania, Switzerland, Transjordan and the Yemen.  Since the invitations were issued, however, Pakistan and the Yemen have become members of the United Nations Organisation.</P>

      <P>Following further consultations with representatives of the bakery trade I have decided not to revoke the Emergency Powers (Fresh Bread and Prohibition of Returns) Order, 1946, for the present.  I have indicated to the trade, however, that <Col N="2083" /> the Order will, at a stage, cease to have effect, and that I can hold out no prospect that it will be perpetuated by legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I met representatives of the master bakers and the trade unions concerned and they convinced me that very considerable dislocation would be caused if the Order were repealed now. I brought to their notice the fact that the Order would cease to have effect when the temporary legislation came to an end and that they would have to make such internal arrangements in their trade as to obviate the difficulties they foresee before that happens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, having regard to the fact that Irish book publishing has been at a standstill since 1st January, 1947, arising from the operation of British import orders and also having regard to the considerable loss to Irish authors of royalties on sales in Great Britain, he is now in a position to give a report on the negotiations which have been in progress for the lifting of the embargo; and also, whether his Department have formulated, or is formulating, any interim measures to rectify the present position whereby the majority of the books stocked in Irish bookshops are of British manufacture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that the people residing in the town of Ballindine, County Mayo, are at a serious disadvantage because of an inadequate water supply; and if he will state what steps have been taken to provide proper water facilities for the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary must be aware that about 15 years ago a scheme was suggested by the county council for the town of Ballindine and about ten years ago a complaint was made by the local doctor with regard to the water and sewerage facilities there.  Surely it is about time that something should be done because the Parliamentary Secretary must be further aware that in this locality within the past three months there have been one or two outbreaks of infantile paralysis and two or three outbreaks of fever.  These outbreaks are caused by bad water supplies and sewerage and it is well time that the matter should be looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>A scheme for Ballindine was listed No. 7 in order of priority for emergency water supplies and it was agreed that it could not be included in the list of priorities for permanent works.  The Minister for Local Government nevertheless would not object if it were listed above No. 7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary knows that the outbreaks to which I have referred have occurred within the past three months and that this is one of the first schemes that should be looked into.  I suppose it will be sent back to the county council and perhaps back to the Department again before any steps are taken to implement it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he will state: (a) if the yacht, &ldquo;Gracie Blue,&rdquo; was arrested by the Garda authorities; (b)  if its departure from Castletownberehaven was illegal; (c) who is Nicholson and what are his present whereabouts; and (d) whether the Minister is satisfied that no illegal purpose was served by the movements of this yacht and its owners while in Irish jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>(a) At the time of its departure from Castletownbere on the 28th October, 1947, the yacht &ldquo;Gracie Blue&rdquo; was not under arrest by the Gardaí.  After it had left, however, a warrant was issued for the arrest of its apparent owner, William L. Nicholson, on a charge of obtaining goods from a local shopkeeper by means of a worthless cheque.  (b) So far as I am aware, the departure was not illegal.  (c) I have no information regarding Nicholson or his present whereabouts additional to what is contained in the Press reports, but police inquiries are being pursued in connection with the execution of the warrant of arrest.  (d) As a warrant has been issued for the arrest of Nicholson I think it would be undesirable for me to say anything in reply to this part of the question.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that a considerable doubt exists in the minds of citizens in relation to the goods that may be sent to Great Britain without being tariffed, taxed or forfeited? In view of that fact, I would like the Minister to publish what he regards as the classes and quantities of various foodstuffs that may be posted to Great Britain by residents in Ireland.  The second portion Deputy Byrne's question deals with that.  I am not asking this question in any parochial spirit.  I am aware that losses have been incurred by many citizens. Anybody who reads the daily papers will see that in the offices at the Custom House there is a lot of goods and I believe 99.9 per cent. of these goods were bought under a misapprehension and those people are the innocent victims of the want of advertising properly the goods that may be sent to relatives on the other side of the channel.  Will the Minister undertake to investigate this matter and see that notices are posted up in the various post offices?</P>

I indicated yesterday that we were anxious to facilitate the Government to get through business of importance before the dissolution, but the first indication was only given this morning that it was proposed to move this Bill to the front of the discussion.  I have no objection to hearing the Minister speak on this Bill to-day, but no one expected that it would be advanced in this particular way.  I may be asking for facilities to get a reasoned amendment to the Second Reading and to have a motion discussed, something to the effect that the Dáil wishes to postpone the Second Reading of this Bill for a period of 12 months.

Let me emphasise that this is a purely artificial procedure which does not indicate my opposition to the Bill, but I am opposing it in order to enable Deputies to elicit information from the Minister.  I would like to ask the Minister whether the Bill, as envisaged, will make any provision for the widows of Gardaí in respect of pensions, or whether it is intended to cover their case by this measure, in view of the fact that the statutes dealing with national health insurance and widows' pensions and the Garda establishment combine to exclude the Gardaí from the national health insurance scheme, with the result that their widows may not draw contributory pensions.  That eventuality, therefore, was not contemplated when the Gardaí were first excluded from the national health insurance scheme and a situation obtains now in which the rates of pension prescribed for Gardaí widows unsupported by contributory pensions, as their husbands were not allowed to contribute to the national health insurance, are grossly inadequate.  A Bill should be brought before the House to deal with this.</P>

      <P>In regard to the talks that took place in London dealing with trade relations as presented to us, many Deputies were inclined to find fault with the Government because we did not get a long-term agreement.

The emergency conditions here, and the war conditions in England and elsewhere, made it utterly impossible for any Government here or there to arrive at prices while such unstable conditions exist.  The people appreciate the fact that the talks were carried out in a pleasant and friendly atmosphere which is a clear indication of the fact that the Government here and the Government across the Channel are quite willing to go further <Col N="2096" /> in the making of agreements which will be in the interests of both countries.  The unfortunate point is that we have not the materials.  We have not the store cattle nor the fat cattle in quantity to meet the demands of the people who are quite willing to negotiate with us and who are quite willing through negotiations to establish in the future facilities in that market for which over a long period the people have been crying out. We have not the live stock and that is principally due to the fact that in recent years the source of supply has been very considerably reduced. Yesterday, when speaking in connection with this settlement, the Minister for Agriculture stated that he was surprised to see that the number of dairy cows had decreased over a period of years.  That is true.  The number has decreased, in my opinion, because there has not been sufficient inducement for the people who are engaged in the dairying industry to carry on.  The dangers that might arise due to the decline in the dairy cow population were pointed out to the Minister long ago. When there is a decline in the dairy cow population there is bound to be a decline in the live-stock population.  Consequently there will be a decline or scarcity in the number of live stock at our disposal.  Cattle do not grow on trees.  They do not bloom.  They have to be produced by breeding and the only way to breed store cattle or young cattle is through the medium of the dairy stocks.  The cow population must be kept up if we want to have live stock.  I attribute the failure in this connection to the present Minister for Agriculture and to his predecessor.  I do not want to offer undue criticism because I am satisfied that the Government is going a long way to meet the situation as regards our external relations.  With regard to our domestic policy I believe that over the past four or five years the Minister for Agriculture did not realise the dangers that would face the country due to the fact that he was not prepared to give that encouragement to the people engaged in the industry.  I raised that matter in this House long ago, when people were selling milk at <Col N="2097" /> a very low price, much under the cost of production.  We know very well the difficulties the country people have to contend with.  We are aware of their early hours in the morning, their long hours during the day and their late hours in the evenings in their efforts to provide milk and dairy products and live stock.  I went as far as to say on one occasion to Dr. Ryan that the day would come when milk would even be scarce for the tea.  I was not far wrong. That condition now obtains in our rural towns, not to mention the cities. Of course, the city may be safeguarded to the extent that they can get milk from the creameries, but in the small rural towns, where the people live in the midst of an agricultural community, they find it difficult even to get supplies of milk for their tea.  That is no exaggeration.  Other Deputies in this House know that to be true.  A courageous attempt must be made by the Department to encourage the people engaged in the industry to improve or to expand that industry. The only way to do so is to give some encouragement by way of price or by putting more money into that particular industry.  I am sorry to have to refer to the slaughter of calves.  I do not want to offer that as a criticism because of the steps taken some years ago by the Government.  I consider, however, that it was wrong to destroy a God-given production.  I am afraid that as a result of our policy at that time, and as a result of its continuation by some people who are inclined even to-day to slaughter calves, apart altogether from the Government's idea, our best stocks will be destroyed in their infancy.  The Government would be wise to take steps to stamp out that practice or, at least, the slaughter of heifer calves, which is going on throughout the country.  The young heifer calf of to-day will be the dairy cow of to-morrow.  It will be the source of our economic wealth.  She will produce our milk, our butter and our live stock for export.  Unless we have an export trade to pay for our purchases of raw materials essential for our industries at home we cannot hope to exist.  If the future post-war policy of <Col N="2098" /> the Government is to encourage the production of live stock, bacon and poultry, the matter must be approached in a courageous manner.  If we are to benefit by the agreement that has been arrived at now, and if we are to benefit by the talks that are likely to be held by the two Governments in the future, we must have something to export which will be the subject under discussion at a future date.  How are we to do that? Money is the source of it all.  Unless more money is put into agriculture through channels other than those available to-day for the people you will not and you cannot revive agriculture. Money is the source of all our troubles.  We find that the well-off people in the country to-day are almost the only people who are in a position to acquire loans.  There is established the Agricultural Credit Corporation. You must satisfy the Agricultural Credit Corporation as regards title, and as regards your actual position with your own bank before you are in a position to acquire a loan.  It is well known to Deputies on both sides of the House that very few people have complete title to their land.  For different reasons, extending way back for years&mdash;certain agreements that were attached to their holdings, and families hanging on&mdash;many people have not a clear title to their land.  They do not know how to get that clear title to their land.  I often tried to put before the House the necessity there is for the introduction by the Department of Justice of some method by which it would be easy for people to get clear title to their land who, for some reason or another, have not got that clear title.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation is a profit-making concern.  Being a profit-making concern, it has ample provision to ensure that that profit will be forthcoming at the end of the year.  I have often been criticised both inside and outside the House for my agitation in connection with co-operative societies throughout the country.  I do believe in cooperation and I believe in co-operative societies provided that they operate within certain limits.  I believe that they could be a more than adequate <Col N="2099" /> source of financial accommodation for the farming community throughout the country.  A co-operative society has certain advantages over the ordinary banking system inasmuch as the members of the society are familiar with each other's holdings, live stock and general farming economy.  I think it would be the best way in which to make loans available to the agricultural community.  I think, too, that that is the way in which co-operative societies ought to work instead of undertaking pursuits which would normally be carried on by shopkeepers. Again, they would prove beneficial in helping to speed up production by making agricultural machinery available to groups of farmers.  In a society of that kind where you have a collective association of people greater facilities are afforded for examining into the merits of applicants for loans or for accommodation of any kind.  Through the co-operative societies it should be possible to speed up production throughout the country.</P>
      <P>During the emergency when the Minister for Agriculture visited the rural areas during the tillage drive, I pointed out to him on every occasion the importance of making provision for the direct supply of feeding stuffs to the farming community.  I maintain that the offals from wheat should go back to the original producer in the same way as does the beet pulp.  He should have the first claim to any offal for the production of milk, live stock, bacon and poultry.  That is the type of provision that the Department of Agriculture ought to make so far as feeding stuffs are concerned.  Because of lack of feeding stuffs at the present time farmers are compelled to sell their live stock in an unfinished condition.  I met a neighbour of mine in Lismore recently who told me that he could not get even a bag of bran to feed his pigs.  Is it fair that other people should have priority over the farmer who is, after all, the primary and most important producer in the country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to make the point in regard to the production of feeding stuffs.  With all due respect for your ruling, I want to point out that the feeding stuffs coming directly from the millers and the factories should find their way to the production of bacon, milk, poultry and live stock. Any farmer who is not in a position to take back all the offals offered to him should be allowed to dispose of them himself at their price value and he will always have a customer for the particular commodity.</P>
      <P>I come now to the matter of fertilisers.  Fertilisers are urgently needed at the present moment to bring back fertility to the soil.  The land has been recropped over a number of years now without sufficient quantities of fertilisers being available.  I do not blame the Government for that. The Government did its best to provide fertilisers and it is doing its best to provide them now.  I am inclined to think, however, that the effort to build up the fertility of our soil must be helped in another direction.  The Minister for Agriculture stated yesterday that he was bringing in a scheme to reduce the price of lime with a view to encouraging farmers to use more lime on the land.  That is very welcome. I wonder would it be possible to include fertilisers under that scheme in order to encourage the farmers to use more fertilisers and thereby increase their productive output.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the yield from our wheat was very low.  I believe that manure would play an effective part in increasing yields.  I know that the wet spring and the cold weather, coupled with the worn-out condition of our seed, were responsible to a great extent for the low yield last year.  I am not blaming the Government for that.  They have no responsibility for weather conditions. The people should be encouraged in every way to apply more elaborate dressings of fertilisers to the land.  As regards the quantity of seed, the amount of seed is, I suppose, the <Col N="2101" /> best the Government could do. Definitely they had in mind the welfare of the seed grower and the wheat grower.  The Minister for Agriculture promised us that he would do all in his power to ensure that adequate supplies of wheat would be available during the coming year.  It is a pity the Government were not able to arrange for a larger quantity than 50,000 cwts.  That will only represent an area of 25,000 acres.  I hope that if further talks take place the Government will keep before its mind the fact that seed is a most important factor here.  I will not go further than that, because the Government are as anxious as I am and as every Deputy is to procure seeds for farmers.</P>
    <P>With regard to sheep and lambs, to which reference was also made, I doubt if we shall have any for export in the coming year.  Owing to the bad weather last winter, I am afraid our exports of these will be very small indeed.  I should like, however, to point out that greater protection should be forthcoming for the sheep owners and breeders with regard to the production and sale of wool.  Three years ago one woollen manufacturer told me that his quota was 1,250,000 lbs., and that for every lb. of wool he paid 2/6, while the average price paid to the producer was from 1/4 to 1/6, giving a clear profit of 1/- per lb. or £65,000, to the wool dealers, a sum of money which was denied to the farmers and producers who suffered great losses in trying to maintain sheep stocks.  The mountainy sheep owners, who are the biggest sheep owners and producers, are always exposed to weather conditions and better protection should be afforded to these people.  I think the co-operative societies should engage in handling such a commodity and processing it and putting it on the market in a fit state for the production of blankets, etc.</P>
    <P>I live in a big sheep area which includes the Knockmealdown and Galtee Mountains, and I think some co-operative societies should engage in the processing of wool there.  It would be a good thing if the Government would take a note of that matter <Col N="2102" /> so that a factory of that type would be established on the banks of the Blackwater at Lismore which would give suitable employment to numbers of people who are quitting the local countryside to seek employment elsewhere. When the wool dealers can get a sum of £65,000 out of the quota allocated to one factory, I think these are things to be taken note of.  People are asking why such a state of affairs should continue and why licences should be given to the chosen few at the expense of the many.  I should like the Department of Industry and Commerce to take note of the representations made for the establishment of such a factory to cater for the producers in the area.</P>
    <P>As to the question of turkeys, I am glad the British have seen fit to put our turkeys on the same level as turkeys produced in England, namely 3/2 per lb.  I should like to know what steps the Government will take to protect the interests of the producers.  We know that turkey production is a very valuable asset to the small type of farmer.  We know that there is great difficulty in rearing turkeys and that it is only people with a lot of time at their disposal who can engage in their production. In order that protection may be afforded them, I should like to know if the Government will fix a price for producers so that they will not be exploited by the exporters of turkeys. Every encouragement should be given to the producers and a reasonable margin of profit given to the people engaged in the exportation of the turkeys.  I hope there will be a fixed price for the producers, as well as a reasonable margin of profit for the exporters.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture stated that he intends bringing before the House shortly a scheme for the improvement of farm buildings, such as outhouses for stock, machinery, etc.  In that connection, I hope the Minister will bear in mind that Deputies have been making representations over a long period for the installation of proper water supplies on farms.  There is no good talking about greater production of live stock, poultry, bacon, etc., unless you have an adequate <Col N="2103" /> supply of water available to the farming community.  I hope that when that scheme is brought in provision will be made for water supplies and that at least the scheme will go a certain way towards providing the cost of sinking pumps on farmsteads in order to speed up production.  If that is not included in the scheme, I hope the Taoiseach will ensure that the Department of Lands will make provision for some such scheme under which the cost may be spread over the period of years for which the annuities have to run.  I have made representations to the Minister for Lands and to the Department in regard to that matter.  The farmers will be prepared to pay for such a water supply if the cost is added to the annuities payable over a period of years.  If that were done, it would be very much appreciated by the people in the country districts.  If it is not provided for by the Department of Agriculture, I hope the Taoiseach will discuss the matter with the Department of Lands.</P>
    <P>The only thing I have to say about the dollars is that we have not enough of them.  I hope the Government will accede to the suggestions I made for improving conditions generally so that we will have sufficient dollars in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the speeches made in regard to this agreement could have been just as appropriately directed to a vote for agriculture.  As a non-agriculturist, I intend to confine my remarks to one or two aspects of the agreement.  On an occasion such as this, as agriculture is our main industry, it is only right and proper that other Deputies should make way for those who are conducting that great industry.  I want to get some information from the Taoiseach, if he has any information to impart.  I am aware of the delicacy of the whole position. Since our last sitting here, I have made many contacts with agriculturists and those engaged in industries ancillary to agriculture.  Farmers, cattle dealers, and those engaged in industries ancillary to agriculture endorse fully the agreement reached by the Taoiseach and those who accompanied him to London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2104" /> I think undue criticism has been levelled at the Taoiseach and those associated with him in these discussions. After all, we had question after question on the Order Paper from time to time suggesting that Ministers themselves should cross over and discuss with the appropriate Ministers on the other side of the Channel the various problems that have arisen as a result of the last war.  We all know that these are delicate negotiations and that it requires a good deal of prudence to get what one can regard as a reasonable agreement.  So far as I have had contact with the interests concerned, agriculturists and others, they have all expressed their pleasure at the result of these discussions. There are, however, one or two matters on which I think some further information is necessary.  Whilst I feel that all that could be done has been done, I qualify that statement by three or four words&mdash;under present circumstances.  In discussing this agreement we should always have regard to these three or four words&mdash; under present circumstances.</P>
    <P>In relation to the coal for cattle pact, I personally am not too sanguine at all, knowing something, as I do, of the coal position across Channel.  We know that production in the mines over there at present is scarcely sufficient to satisfy the demands of British consumers.  We know that there is a target fixed of some millions of tons of coal for export with the object of relieving the dollar position in the same way as we are trying to alleviate our position here by encouraging exports.  As I say, I am not too sanguine in regard to the promised coal supply but the Taoiseach should be in a position to enlighten us on that matter.  I have the feeling that whilst the United States has been sending us coal for which we have to pay in dollars, the change over to British coal would be a welcome one but I am not too sanguine that the British can afford to send us coal in the quantities which we would require, particularly having regard to the fact that coal production has fallen by many hundreds of thousands of tons owing to strikes.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know if, as a <Col N="2105" /> result of the agreement, our position in relation to the supply of building materials could be eased.  We have heard several Deputies talk about the lack of housing facilities in rural areas and the same problem presents itself in the cities.  Building costs at the moment are enormous and I wonder if the Taoiseach could hold out any hope that our position in regard to the supply of building materials is likely to be improved as a result of this agreement.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has stated that, as an alternative, he had given some thought to this country becoming a member of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  I should like if the Taoiseach in replying to the debate would amplify that statement and if he would let us know what are the implications, if any, of this country becoming a member of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  The names of so many of these organisations appear in the Press of late years with their initials only, that one becomes quite confused.  I suppose in time the names of these institutions will appear in the Press as I.M.F. and I.B.F.R.D., we have got so used to these abbreviations. I want to be informed for the benefit of all those engaged in industry and commerce what the implications of our becoming members of these institutions are likely to be.  I was present the other evening at a meeting of the Cork Chamber of Commerce at which the Taoiseach and his Ministers were congratulated on this agreement.  I think it is only fair that these things should be mentioned.  I want the Taoiseach when he is replying to tell me, for the benefit of those who are not agriculturists, what are the advantages, if any, of our becoming a member of the International Monetary Fund and also what are the commitments, if any.  I do not want to occupy the time of the House further than to have these one or two points explained. I should like to have further information particularly in relation to our future coal supplies and the likelihood of our getting building materials across Channel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>The trade agreement which has been discussed here for the last few days has naturally been looked forward to with great expectations all over the country.  No matter on what side of the House one sits, we can all agree that trade between two countries helps employment and industry of the countries concerned.  Whilst we may not have an immensity of love for our next-door neighbours, nevertheless we must admit that if we can trade with her, she being our nearest neighbour, it may be more beneficial to us than to her and it may help us out of the difficulties in which we have been placed as a result of the war.  Everybody welcomed the fact that the Taoiseach and his Ministers went to London to discuss trade with Great Britain and everybody, of course, expected that this country would benefit in one way or another as a result of these talks. Whether the people will be disappointed or not within the coming year is something which we will have to wait and find out.</P>
      <P>Even though we may be critical of Government policy&mdash;and I can assure the Taoiseach that very little that he or his Government has done was worthy of any support or encouragement from this Party&mdash;nevertheless the trade agreement will, I believe, carry a certain amount of benefit for one side while, perhaps, for the other side it may not be so beneficial at all.  The most important thing after all is that we are going to get an increased supply of coal but again the statement in regard to that matter is very vague. We are told that the British Government have undertaken to provide a substantial additional quantity of reasonable quality in the calendar year 1948. We are given no idea as to what the price of that coal will be; we can only hope that it will be as cheap or even cheaper than the American coal.  The arrangement has the advantage at least that we will be able to pay for it in sterling and so conserve our meagre supply of dollars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are also told that we shall receive improved supplies of agricultural machinery within the coming year but again we are not told what the price <Col N="2107" /> will be to the purchaser in this country We have no idea as to whether the prices demanded for agricultural machinery will be within the reach of the ordinary farmer nor do we know the amount of agricultural machinery we are going to get.  There again we find ourselves very much in a fog.  The statement that we are to receive 25,000 tons of sulphate of ammonia and 15,000 tons of superphosphates is also very welcome but here again no prices are quoted.  We have no idea whether this superphosphate and ammonia, which will be used by the farmers over their lands, will be at such a price as will make it profitable for farmers to increase production.</P>
    <P>We know very well that the land has been worn out in many districts during the past four or five years because of intensive cropping and the fact that we cannot rotate crops on the smaller farms, as can be done on the larger ones.  We are aware that the intensive cropping which we have experienced has brought down the fertility of the soil.  We realise that soil fertility is a very important factor.  If the cost of putting artificial manures into the land is prohibitive and if our agricultural efforts will not show a dividend at the end of the year, then the lot of the farming community is to be deplored. It is very hard to expect the farmer, our main producer, to purchase fertilisers and distribute them if he finds at the end of the year that the amount charged for the fertilisers will not be covered by the increased output in his crop.  I would prefer if we had quoted to us by the British Government the amount per ton of fertilisers.  If we had that information, we would know where we stand.</P>
    <P>As regards everything we have to sell to Britain, the price is set out for us. We have a list of the prices for our fat cattle, our dressed meat, our eggs and turkeys.  All these prices have been fixed in this wonderful trade agreement. It is strange that we know the prices we are to get but we do not know the prices we are to pay.  It is a sort of Hobson's choice so far as we are concerned.  If we do not take the British articles at the price that will be asked for them by the British Government, <Col N="2108" /> if we do not take their agricultural machinery and fertilisers, we can do without them; but they know perfectly well that we will have to send our store cattle, dressed meat and eggs to England because we have made an agreement with them.</P>
    <P>We all realise that when there is a demand for more production we have to look the one way for it, and that is to the agriculturist.  We have to look to the land of this country, from which we derive the biggest amount for export. We have from this side of the House besieged the Government time and again with requests to help the agriculturist and bring agriculture into its proper place in this country.  We find here a futile effort made by the Taoiseach to put the agricultural producer on his feet.  Side by side with that we have the flight from the land. As well as a flight from the country, there is also a flight from the land by young farmers and agricultural labourers who are seeking employment in the towns and cities of this little island.  Everybody knows&mdash;the Taoiseach perhaps better than any other Deputy&mdash;the old saying that there can be no prosperity in a country where the fields are devoted to cattle and the towns are filled with men.  The Taoiseach knows well that there is an attraction in the towns and the young countryman can get higher wages there as a builder's labourer or a corporation labourer.  In these circumstances young men will not stay on the land or give adequate attention to the production that is so essential at the moment.</P>
    <P>There is a call for increased production, but let us take a look at our farms and homesteads.  We have 20,000 farms from one to five acres in extent; 32,842 farms from five to ten acres in extent; 32,029 farms from ten to 15 acres in extent and 89,311 farms from 15 to 30 acres in extent.  Working at his full capacity, what can the farmer with five to 15 acres produce? He cannot grow wheat to any great extent and he cannot produce cattle to any great extent.  The two things that always have been and that always will be his backbone are pigs and poultry. The fact that we have had such a decline in both pigs and poultry during <Col N="2109" /> the past ten or 12 years is proof of the way in which the small farmer has been neglected.</P>
    <P>As regards the 50 to 100-acre farmer, who has room on his land for proper rotation and can rear fat cattle, we find that until the emergency he made no effort to till. The rancher element would not till one acre were it not that the Department's inspectors were on their heels and compelled them to till.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that to have increased production we must give the producers room to produce.  It is futile, non-sensical, and, as I see it, sheer humbug, to ask the people to produce more when they have no ground whatsoever with which to produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back, Sir, again to where things are really produced&mdash;the pigs at home in the pigsties, the cattle in the farmer's yard, the wheat in the field&mdash; are we going to have any improvement in the store cattle trade which is so important to so many people in the country?  It is all very fine to see the figures on paper.  It is all very fine to see this summary of an agreement between two Governments, but the real proof is to go down to the fairs in the country and see the prices at which store cattle are sold.  I can assure the Taoiseach, or any man, of this as I have first class information, having attended three fairs in the past week.  The price of store cattle has fallen by almost £1 a head since the agreement was talked of by the two Governments.  From that alone, the average man in the country wonders what benefit he will derive from the agreement.  We may have more level <Col N="2110" /> prices throughout the whole year, but there is a certain time of the year, during spring, when the small or middle-class farmer has to look to the few cattle he has to sell for his greatest profits.  We find the fact that continental buyers are going to be cut out in the new year when the agreement will be made.</P>

      <P>Then I would be very glad if the Taoiseach would make it clear that continental buyers will be allowed to compete for the cattle and, if they can offer higher prices than Britain, that they will get all the cattle they want.  Competition is the life of trade and if one Government is prepared to pay higher prices than another, then it is to our benefit that the purchaser with the highest prices to offer should be allowed to buy.  The Taoiseach has argued&mdash;and I would grant him that much&mdash;that we may not get goods from the Continent as essential as the goods which we are able to get from Britain, such as coal and agricultural machinery.  I would be in agreement with him, even if it brought about a slight decrease in the price of store or fat cattle, to grade down the amount of cattle allowed to the Continent.  Still, I can assure him that up to date, the agreement has brought a reduction of almost £1 a head for store cattle.</P>

    <P>We find, Sir, another item which we must treat with a certain amount of <Col N="2111" /> suspicion.  That is the question of seed potatoes.  Of course a market for seed potatoes abroad is very welcome, but in the present year the crop of potatoes in this country is not good and it is very doubtful whether, having satisfied our own needs&mdash;for we must have an increased supply of potatoes if we are to have an increase in bacon and poultry&mdash;we can have many seed potatoes to export.  In regard to the price which is being offered, approximately £15 a ton, I can assure the Taoiseach that in my part of the country, where we are very good potato-producing farmers, he will not get seed potatoes at the present moment at £15 a ton.  The crop is not so good this year as other years due to the lack of fertilisers.</P>

      <P>Irish Champions and Arran Banners.  We have a demand and an outcry for increased production, but I maintain that to have increased production you must have increased population in this country, and yet when we see that our biggest export within the past ten or 12 years has been our manpower, who should be producing and employed in this country, it is very foolish, I think, to expect that we can increase our output any further.  We can try; we can do our best; we can all try to pull our weight as well as we can, but when we see our life blood being drained away to the towns and in emigration, and when we see a section of our small farmers being denied the ground on which they would gladly produce, we can look forward to the coming year and the Taoiseach's trade agreement with a certain amount of suspicion, due simply and solely to the Government's policy of failing to provide the necessaries of life which would give to our people the chance of helping out this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not anything more to say in regard to this agreement except that, after all, the people of Ireland are wondering why, after 15 years, when this famous British market was gone and gone forever, that it should now <Col N="2112" /> be so welcomed, and that we should walk into it so happily.</P>
    <P>I think that our friends across the Channel have got the best side of the agreement due to the fact that they have quoted to us the price which they will pay for our goods and we have not quoted in return the prices for the goods which they send us.</P>

      <P>I had no intention, a Chinn Comhairle, of taking part in this debate at all, but when I listened to statements from Deputies such as Deputy Commons, who appeared to know nothing of what they were talking about, I felt forced to intervene. Deputy Commons told us that since the agreement came into operation the price of store cattle had dropped.  If he knew anything about fairs or markets or was interested in buying produce, he would know that this was due to something entirely different.  He was interested in addressing public meetings and making all the misrepresentations at those meetings which he could make.  The price of store cattle has dropped, not because of the agreement, but because all the fields within miles of Dublin were packed with cattle brought there by dealers who wanted to wait for the agreement and held their cattle before shipping them across.  This fact was made pretty clear by Deputies from the Fine Gael Benches and by Deputy Fagan who knows something of cattle markets. The price dropped because the purchasers could not go down the country to buy any more, but that is all over now and the price of cattle is not down.</P>

When I asked him what type of potatoes he produced, he replied Irish Champions, but they are not exported.

      <P>The varieties of potatoes exported from this country are varieties such as &ldquo;Arran Banners&rdquo; which would not be consumed by our people.  They are used in this country for animal feeding more than for anything else.  They are not used at all for table consumption.  Some of us use &ldquo;Champions&rdquo; and the vast majority use &ldquo;Kerr Pinks.&rdquo;  I welcome this agreement on behalf of the farmers of the country.  The only complaints I have heard about it have come from the shopkeeper element.  Some of them have said: &ldquo;What are we getting out of this?&rdquo; They forget that the day we improve the lot of the farmer their lot is automatically improved also.  I am sick listening to the type of stuff that we hear year in and year out.  I have to face out every winter on a campaign to try to get the farmers to produce beet for the Tuam beet factory.  For a number of years many of the shopkeepers in that particular town, which is as wealthy a town as there is in Ireland, did not realise the importance of that industry.  They only realised it when the industry almost slipped from them overnight.  They then discovered that if the factory left Tuam the town might as well shift along with it.  Deputies should not make statements which are silly and detrimental. It is very annoying to have to listen to them saying that our farmers are paupers and that they are starving.  There is no truth in it.</P>

      <P>It is a pity a lot of people were not left in gaol breaking stones.  They would be doing better work there than they are doing outside. <Col N="2114" /> I deplore this type of political propaganda. We hear talk about no employment being available on the land.  I know farmers who cannot get labour at any price and if Deputy Commons knows where we can get it I know a number of people who would be glad to employ it.  I welcome this agreement from the farmer's point of view.  I am quite satisfied that it is a good agreement.  The type of talk to which we have listened for the last day or two is not helpful, either internally or externally.  If we had an agreement binding us to something for five or ten years I do not think I would be satisfied about it, but we are not bound for any particular length of time.  Deputy Commons in his platform fair-meeting style comes along to misrepresent this agreement in many other aspects in addition to those to which I have referred.  If we were a little more honest with ourselves and with the people we represent they would think a lot more about us.  That type of false propaganda is not going to get us anywhere.  Deputy Commons pointed out that we can sell our stuff to other countries.  As far as I understand, the agreement is only with Great Britain.  If any other country comes along to-morrow morning we are quite prepared to negotiate and discuss that with them on the basis of equality.  Deputy Commons also said that we were flinging away the British market because we think so little about it.  None of us thinks little of it.  What most of us fought for was equalitythat we would be able to meet them at a future date on equal terms, and that we would be able to sell and buy and make a bargain on that particular basis.  We have now arrived at that stage and we should be very thankful to find ourselves in that position.  With the world as it is at the moment we should not use that type of propaganda. It is misleading not only to our own people here, but to people in other countries also.  The sooner we get down to brass tacks the better for all concerned.</P>

      <P>Very little can be said in connection with this trade agreement because there is very little in it.  There is nothing definite with regard to prices <Col N="2115" /> except a slight improvement in cattle prices.  There is nothing definite in regard to the quantity of supplies on either side.  In the main, it is merely a collection of pious hopes and wishes.  I would not have intervened in this debate were it not for the speech made yesterday by the Minister for Agriculture in regard to this agreement.  It is upon our exportable surplus of agriculture we have got to depend for the dollars and for the sterling that we require to enable us to import.  Since that is true, anything that tends to expand the output of agriculture and encourage that industry to develop is first and foremost in the national interest.  One would expect in this critical period of our history from the Minister for Agriculture, therefore, an inspiring lead to the agricultural community in this State.  But what did we get from the Minister for Agriculture yesterday?  A promise of a few miserable sops, garnished with a few crude, brutal threats.  The speech of the Minister for Agriculture would not impress anybody except a depraved or half-drunken lout. It was not the speech that one would expect from a Minister for Agriculture appealing to an important and intelligent section of the community.</P>

      <P>The farmers are an intelligent and patriotic body of citizens.  They are nationally minded. They have a good tradition of independence and self-respect behind them. Given a lead, the farmers are prepared to put everything they have into their work so as to pull this country safely through the difficulties that face us. All we got from the Minister for Agriculture yesterday were dire threats. We were told the farmer is not tilling <Col N="2116" /> the best of his land.  What does that mean?  It means that an army of inspectors will be sent down to the farmer to point out to him what particular field he is to till and what particular field he is not to till.  That is not the approach that was made by the British Government at the outset of their emergency.  That is not their approach at the present time.  There they appealed to the patriotism of the people.  They had at the same time a clear realisation of the difficulties the agricultural producer had to face.  So many useful and effective measures were adopted by the British Government to meet the special difficulties of the situation in connection with agricultural production that they were crowned by a tremendous measure of success and brought about a natural expansion of the agricultural industry. Here we have a narrow, shallow approach to the problems of the farming community.  I maintain that the farmer is the one man who can be induced by a few small sops to do almost anything.  Threats only make him angry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was the approach made by the British Government to the problem of getting the old pastures ploughed up? They told the farmer that if he was prepared to plough his old pasture which had been under grass for generations past the Government would provide an acreage payment to compensate him for the sacrifice he was making.  That was a reasoned and a reasonable approach to that difficult problem.  By that means, the Government got the goodwill of the farmer right from the beginning.  There was no question of dictation and no question of sending an army of inspectors through the country to seize the farmer by the neck and compel him to carry out certain orders.  I mentioned a similar scheme some years ago in this House and I suggested that it ought to be introduced into this country.  It was turned down by the Government and they had neither the commonsense nor the courtesy to express any opinion as to the merits or demerits of the scheme.  While our Government, in their wisdom, turned down any idea of acreage payments the British Government have continued the scheme to the <Col N="2117" /> present day and are extending it in the present year clearly indicating that, in the light of their experience, the scheme has been successful.</P>
    <P>Yesterday Deputy MacBride talked about subsidising agricultural prices so as to enable the consumer to get his agricultural produce at a reasonable price.  If there is to be any question of subsidy I think that subsidy should be paid directly to the producer in the manner I have indicated&mdash;that is, by means of acreage payments.  Yesterday the Minister for Agriculture deplored the fact that there was a falling off in the acreage under potatoes in the current year.  He forgot to mention that last year when the farmer had potatoes to sell the price was rigidly controlled so that the farmer was unable to get even the cost of production.  Everybody knows that.  Last year the potato crop was an expensive one to grow; it was expensive to harvest and it was even more expensive to save because of weather conditions.  You cannot have production unless you are prepared to give the producer a reasonable sum to cover the cost of production. It does not matter how many inspectors you have, or how many Emergency Powers Orders you bring in, or what totalitarian system you adopt you will get no return unless the producer has some guarantee that he will not work at a loss.  We know within the current year the potato crop has been to a great extent a failure.  The output will not average more than 50 per cent. of the normal yield.  That is a serious position and it will affect the acreage put under potatoes next year.  So far the price for potatoes has been fairly good and it has not yet been restricted by our paternal Government, but the output is so low that it represents a substantial loss to the producer.  The British Government are paying a subsidy of £10 on every statute acre under potatoes.  That enables the British farmer to obtain the necessary fertilisers in order to grow the crop efficiently and it gives him some encouragement to put the largest possible acreage under potatoes.  That encouragement has resulted in a tremendous expansion in Great Britain.  Here we seem to be content to blunder along under Emergency Powers Orders and the dictation of an army of inspectors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2118" /> The Deputy who spoke last referred to the British market.  He said that his Party were never opposed to the British market.  If they were never opposed to the British market, then for many years they must have been talking in their sleep.  Whatever their internal feelings were, they did openly express contempt for the British market. In the report which has been given to the House of the discussions in London, nothing has been mentioned as to whether our Ministers informed the British Ministers that they had whipped John Bull in the past and were prepared to whip him again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>A specific agreement for the preservation of a British market that was supposed to be dead and cold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether the farmers will welcome this agreement or not it does seek to establish the normal relations that should exist between two civilised nations.  The Deputy who spoke last said that we could now at least deal with the British on terms of equality. At any time during the past 25 years we could have dealt with the British on terms of equality, but there was a time seemingly when it did not suit us to deal with them at all.  It was good Party policy to pretend that the British were deadly enemies and that the Government was fighting Britain with all the resources at its disposal. In the course of that fight we sacrificed the fertility of our soil.  We sacrificed the production of butter.  We sacrificed the production of bacon.  We sacrificed our entire agricultural industry <Col N="2119" /> so that the Fianna Fáil Party might pose as sea-green patriots fighting against the old enemy&mdash;Britain. Having made all those sacrifices to keep Fianna Fáil in office for 15 years, we are told now that it is a marvellous achievement because we have made a trade agreement that gives us less for our cattle than the British farmer is getting and that provides that British experts will come over to help the hens in this country to lay more eggs. In addition to that, it expresses a few pious hopes and prayers in regard to the things that are not available now for export.</P>
    <P>From published statistics it appears that five pigs were exported to Britain in 1946.  I do not know who are the lucky people who bought those pigs. Probably they were bought by collectors looking for rare specimens, or by the British Zoological Society looking for samples of the Irish pig to exhibit in their various institutions.  That is the condition to which 15 years of Fianna Fáil policy has reduced agriculture, and that is a condition which the Minister for Agriculture claims can only be solved by brutal coercion of the farmers, by sending down inspectors to point out what particular field he is to till and what particular field he is not to till.</P>
    <P>There is one particular form of export which was very extensive during the past ten years, and I wonder if it was the subject of discussion when our Ministers were talking to the British Ministers.  Did our Ministers ask the British Ministers what were they going to pay for the 250,000 men and women that we have sent over to build up the British nation?  Did that matter come up for discussion?  While our cattle may be good for the British people, and while our poultry products may be very desirable, I think there is nothing we have given to Great Britain that is of such immense value as the young men and women we have exported to that country during the past ten years.  Did our Ministers say to British Ministers: &ldquo;If you do not give us something in exchange for this valuable export we will put an embargo on that export trade?&rdquo; Did they use <Col N="2120" /> the fact that we were giving Great Britain such a valuable export as a bargaining factor?  If that was not used, our Ministers did not know their business when they went to negotiate, because, while the British may find it hard to do without our cattle and our poultry products, I do not think they could manage without the human exports that we send over in such large numbers.</P>
    <P>As I said, we expected a very inspiring lead from the Minister for Agriculture. We expected him to indicate what measures will be adopted during the next two or three years to bring about an expansion in agriculture, to divert to agriculture the young men and the young women who are being exported and to put them working so as to increase the output of that industry. It is foolish to suggest that nothing can be done to get our people working on the land.  Nothing will be done as long as there is a higher standard of wage and income for those who fly from the land.  Let nobody say that I am boosting the wages paid on the other side of the water.  Even in our own country we know that the man who works in a factory, the man who works in any of our secondary industries, has a far higher income than the man who works in our primary industry.  As long as you have that state of affairs prevailing, the intelligent young people, farmers' sons and daughters, will seek to get away from the land.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the fundamental basis of increased agricultural output is to ensure that there is an income for each individual worker on the land higher than the income that any citizen can obtain in any other industry.  That is not an impossible ideal.  It is nothing wild or extreme; it is simple common sense.  It may mean an almost revolutionary change in the standard of remuneration of those engaged in agriculture. It may mean very revolutionary changes in regard to the methods that may be necessary to finance such a scheme.  But, until that matter is tackled vigorously and with sincerity, nothing will prevent our young people from getting out of the agricultural industry.  It is not alone a question of getting out of this country; it is a question of getting into any <Col N="2121" /> secondary industry, getting into a garage, or getting into some of the sheltered public appointments.</P>
    <P>I have met dozens of young people who have asked me if there is any way by which they can get to be attendants in mental hospitals or work of that kind.  Imagine a young man of brains and ability who has been reared on the land hungering to get into a mental hospital to care for the insane.  Why is that?  Simply because employment in a mental hospital is more highly paid and more secure than employment on the land.  If that fundamental matter is tackled, everything will straighten itself out by degrees.</P>
    <P>There are small progressive countries in Europe who have succeeded to an extraordinary extent in maintaining their population on the land and in developing the resources of the land.  In Denmark and Holland the number of people employed on the land is much higher than here, and the output per acre is infinitely higher than we have here, simply because, over a long term of years, there has been pursued a proagricultural policy, a policy directed towards making agriculture the foundation on which the whole economic system is built.  Such a policy inevitably means, not only the advancement of agriculture but a more substantial measure of advancement for all secondary industries because, with a healthy, prosperous agriculture, other industries tend to grow up around it. That has happened in some of the progressive European countries.  If the failure with which our Ministers have met in London&mdash;because it is a failure, and it is a failure, not because the men they met were unreasonable but because we have nothing worth while to offer&mdash; brings home to our Government the fundamental importance of developing agriculture to the fullest extent and giving the workers in agriculture a real inducement to work, the meeting between our Ministers and the British Ministers will not have been in vain.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that we have ranged all over the world, perhaps we could get back once more to the agreement. When I made the statement giving the terms of this agreement, I <Col N="2122" /> indicated to the House what the circumstances were which led to our meeting with British Ministers.  We had a communication, I pointed out, indicating that the free convertibility of sterling had to be limited.  We also have an interest in sterling, because it is in sterling what I might call our national savings are placed.  We have built up, by the surplus of exports over imports over a period, a certain amount of external assets which are in sterling. These assets are important to us.  Our current transactions being mainly in sterling, it is also important that we should be able to use these assets to buy the things we require.  Consequently we have a very important interest in maintaining confidence in sterling and in seeing that a position is maintained in which we can use our sterling assets to buy goods anywhere, not merely in dollars but in other currencies as well.  The ultimate transferability of sterling, therefore, is of tremendous importance to us.  We realised that, but we realised also that the most important contribution towards remedying the present situation was increased production in every one of the countries in the sterling area&mdash;production here as well as in other parts of that area, particularly from our point of view.</P>
      <P>Self-help&mdash;I repeat the phrase which I used in introducing this statement&mdash; and mutual help as regards all these countries in the sterling area were of primary importance, self-help by getting the utmost production we could, here at home, and mutual help, in so far as one country could give to another things which otherwise it would have to get outside the sterling area.  Britain and ourselves were particularly well situated for that arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been, traditionally, supplying Britain with a number of things which the British want and of which they are in need at the present time. They on the other hand traditionally supplied us with the things that we required and that we require at the present time very urgently.  We, therefore, proposed to the British Government that we should have a talk on this matter, to see how far it was possible for them to give us the things <Col N="2123" /> which we wanted and for us, by increased production, to give them a greater amount of the things which they want.</P>
    <P>Our production depended on a number of things.  As our principal export was agricultural produce, it was obvious that it was of vital importance for us to get the things needed by our agricultural industry in the first instance.  We needed fertilisers.  Could they give them to us?  Now, it is suggested that only a paltry quantity of fertilisers is coming to us, but there is a scarcity over the whole world and Britain wants fertilisers for herself. She wants, naturally, to increase her agricultural production, and it is out of a very limited quantity that we have to try to get our share.  We were allotted about 25,000 tons by the international control body.  We are getting the quota due to us and there is no use in people saying that we want more.  Of course we want more, but the question in this position of scarcity is: can we get more?  We would take all that we could get, and we would be prepared to pay a reasonable price for it, but when things, such as fertilisers, are scarce you have to put up with your share.  We are not saying that the whole position with regard to fertilisers is now settled because we have got 25,000 tons of sulphate of ammonia or 15,000 tons of superphosphate, or because there is a possibility that we may get basic slag.  We know we could use very much more than this quantity, but there is a world scarcity of these things.  We pointed out that an increase in our production would be a very important factor in dealing with this situation, but that is all they could give us, and if anybody can get more from them, I will say good luck to him.</P>
    <P>We also want agricultural machinery. To what extent can we get that?  My information is that it is coming in, and that the prospect of getting a considerable quantity of agricultural machinery in this coming year is very good.  They have promised to do their best to let us have agricultural machines so that they will be available here to increase our production.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2124" /> As regards seed, of course we are not getting all the seed we would take, but seed for wheat or for any other purpose is a scarce commodity, and all you can hope for is to get an understanding with regard to these things.  Everything they are giving to us they are, to a certain extent, taking from themselves. They could use them, too.  When you are pressing people to give things they could use themselves, you are not in a situation where they had a surplus and it was a question of disposing of a surplus.  When we are dealing with them we are in this position, that the things they are asking from us are mainly things of which we have a surplus.  They will say: &ldquo;These things are surplus to your own needs and we are not asking you to make any great sacrifices in giving them.&rdquo;  But we have to ask them to make certain sacrifices, and the positions of the two peoples trying to get mutual help are not quite the same.  We would take very much more than they are able to give us.</P>
    <P>We do not pretend for one moment that these temporary arrangements&mdash; because they are only short period arrangements&mdash;will solve the position of scarcity which exists here, as it exists throughout the world.  We will get 50,000 cwts. of seed wheat.  That is not a tremendous amount, seeing what is needed, but every ton of seed wheat, or any other seed, is hard to get from any other country outside.  We say that the 50,000 cwts. will be of some value.</P>
    <P>With regard to agriculture, then, we have come to this point, that they thoroughly understand and agree that increased production here is of value in regard to dealing with the present financial situation.  The more we produce the more the position of sterling is strengthened.</P>
    <P>We come now to the question of prices.  Obviously another way of stimulating production is to give improved prices.  Speakers have tried to make little of the fact that we have got 5d. per lb. over the existing price for the dressed carcase&mdash;that is, dead weight.  That 5d. per lb. represents 25/- a hundredweight on a beast killing out at, say, 53 per cent., and we are coolly told that prices have gone down as a result of increasing the price by <Col N="2125" /> 5d. per lb. or 25/- per cwt.  We are told that, as a result of that, the price of store cattle has gone down.  I wonder would it have gone up if, instead of putting 5d. per lb. on, you took 5d. per lb. off?  How increasing the price by 25/- per cwt. will decrease the price is something beyond me.  It is the sort of reasoning that Deputy Cogan is evidently quite adept at, but it is beyond me.</P>
    <P>We have got for fat cattle an additional 5d. per lb. for a period of the year.  It is 4d. after the 1st March unless there is an agreement to have it higher.  We are asked why it is not 5d. for the whole year.  The answer is we could not get it.  If we could get 5d. instead of 4d.  I assure you we would be very glad to take it.  If you are able to get 5d. for the most important period of the year, is it not better to accept that and to have 4d. for the rest of the year than to have 4d. all the year round?  The important thing there is that it enables us to get rid of the older cattle off the land, cattle that were damming up the ordinary process of cattle rearing.  That is being stopped.  It was interfering with the natural flow of our economy and that has been got rid of; that is the principal effect.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of store cattle.  There is a differential of 7/6 between those that are Irish-bred and kept for a couple of months on British pasture and those that are British-bred. That has been reduced to 5/-.  We are told that there should be no differential. Of course we would like to have no differential.  I assure every Deputy there is nobody could have put up better arguments than were put up by us against that differential.  We do not want the differential; we think it is bad even from the British point of view, but their answer is: &ldquo;We give that as a special bonus from the point of view of capital development, because we want to put our agricultural industry on a new footing and that is the sum we are prepared to pay in order to get that done.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We know that no matter how it is done, its effect comes along the line and we get a certain benefit from it, but it would be much better from many <Col N="2126" /> points of view if that differential did not exist.  We fought very hard against it and at least it has been cut down by 2/6.  I suppose Deputy Cogan's type of reasoning is that that is a loss, just as the 25/- additional in the case of fat cattle will be a loss.  Somebody said that we would get less in the markets now, that the prices have gone down, so I suppose if the differential is cut down by 2/6 it can be argued that we are worse off.</P>
    <P>With regard to eggs, the Minister for Agriculture mentioned long ago that one of the exports from this country that promised best, that there was great hope for and that would mean a most valuable export trade, was the egg trade.  We realise that.  The British are naturally anxious to get the greatest quantity they can and they are prepared to pay on a sliding scale according as the quantities increase. The result of this agreement will definitely be a step forward, and we will get the same price we have hitherto got for a smaller quantity.  We are anxious for the development of the egg trade; we are anxious to increase its volume.  We want to have here a scheme which will induce people to have as large a number of poultry as possible, and as large a production of eggs as possible.  We want to have such a development scheme worked out.</P>
    <P>The British Government were not prepared to pay any more for the eggs than the price indicated, and we could get no advance on that price.  But as they were anxious, and we were anxious, to increase the quantity, they said that if we had a development scheme and spent money on developing the egg industry, they were prepared to come in on it since they would benefit.  They said that they would contribute a portion of the cost. Naturally, if you are going to contribute to anything you want to be satisfied with it, and they propose to come over here, not to teach us how to develop our egg industry, but so that they can be satisfied if they are going to contribute to the cost of a development scheme.</P>
    <P>In other words, if they are not satisfied they will not pay, and they are <Col N="2127" /> right, naturally.  If we were going to pay for the development of some scheme in Britain, do you not think that we would like to have some assurance that it was a scheme of a kind for which we would be prepared to pay money?  Nonsense has been talked: &ldquo;We can only do this after the British come over.&rdquo;  This is absurd talk.  This is the absurd talk that people go on with when they do not care to speak reasonably or logically.</P>
    <P>Before I leave this question I will read again the relevant part of the summary of the agreement, so that Deputies will understand the position.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In addition, the Ministry of Food propose to pay in the form of an extra price per long 100 for a period to be agreed, a proportion of the cost incurred by the Irish Government in promoting an agreed scheme for the development of the Irish poultry industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I have said, if they are going to pay a portion of the cost, it is not unreasonable that they should be satisfied.  It was agreed, therefore, that the details of such a scheme and the extent of the Ministry of Food's contribution, should be discussed at a conference in Dublin between representatives of the Department of Agriculture and of the British Ministry of Food.  What is wrong with that? What objection can any reasonable person make to it?  They are prepared to make a contribution to a development scheme provided that they are satisfied with the details of the scheme.  They are paying for increased production and it is only reasonable that they should be satisfied with the results of what they are paying for.  We would do the same.</P>
    <P>The other matter is this.  In regard to the cattle, the summary of the agreement states that the total number of cattle to be exported from Ireland to continental countries as from 1st February, 1948, will be the subject of consultation between the Department of Agriculture and the British Ministry of Food.  The fact that there is going to be a consultation does not necessarily mean that we are not going to send any <Col N="2128" /> cattle to the Continent or that we are going to cut out the continental market.  I would ask those Deputies who mentioned the matter to read the relevant paragraph.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the purpose of the consultation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly what is stated, and to see whether or not there could be an agreement as to whether or not the number of cattle we are sending to the Continent is too great. Suppose, for instance, that the British were prepared to give us extra prices in order to get an extra supply and we had to decide whether we should send 1,000 head extra to the Continent. Should we not examine whether it would be better for the country to reduce the supply to the Continent, if by doing so we could get better prices for cattle sent to Britain?  Nobody in this House is more attached to having a market other than Britain than I am, and I do not believe in putting all our eggs in one basket, but I am not such a fool that, if by reducing the amount sent to the Continent by 1,000 head we could improve the prices on 500,000 or 600,000, I would not consider the proposition. Therefore, the point of the consultation is that, if matters of that sort should arise, the gains and the losses could be considered.  Why should we not have consultation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told that we did not approach this from the right fundamental point of view at all.  It was approached, as I have said, with a view to present world conditions.  Many of the people who talk on these matters take very good care to avoid reference to world conditions.  They try to persuade our people, who have been largely sheltered from the effects of the recent war, that there has been no war.  We said, when the physical conflict was taking place, that its immediate effects were only a portion of the consequences, and that the postwar period would bring with it, as far as this country is concerned, much more severe and critical problems than we had to deal with during the war. Anybody with the slightest idea of what was happening in the world would know that it would be like that. <Col N="2129" /> Hundreds of millions of people were taken from production and put into destructive activities, and wealth which had been created over centuries was destroyed.  Was anybody so foolish as to think that, the moment those people got back into production and controls were relaxed, we should not have problems of the vastest kinds to deal with? We have a world scarcity at the present time due to the fact that for five or six years hundreds of millions of people, who had been engaged in producing the things that were needed to carry on life on the standard on which it was carried on, were taken away and put into destructive operations, and as a result not merely of the negative taking away from production, but of the positive destruction, we have now to face the situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>The land used in production has suffered and is famished for want of ordinary fertilisers.  It has been overcropped. Agricultural and other machinery necessary for production is lacking.  Factories necessary for producing the thousand and one things we need have been destroyed.  Houses necessary to give homes to the people have been destroyed.  There is, therefore, a lack in the world to-day of practically every one of those things that went to make life comfortable, in so far as it was comfortable before the war began.  These are the conditions which we should face and understand if we want to find a remedy.</P>
    <P>We have approached this matter from the fundamental point of view, from the point of view of trying to get, as far as we can, the utmost production here.  This is the most important immediate contribution we can make to improving the situation.  We are told: &ldquo;Oh, you have learned very late to go and meet the British.&rdquo;  Of course, that is just more of the same kind of criticism.  It reminds me of the saying that if you repeat a falsehood three times it is true.  If you have people repeating, repeating and repeating, they repeat in order to get other people to believe what they say is true, but in the end they themselves believe it to be true.  When I hear statements such as those to which I have been listening <Col N="2130" /> for the last day or two I ask myself whether the people who have made them have convinced themselves that the statements are true.  As far as the economic situation and most of the other problems, with the one outstanding problem of Partition, were concerned, we had settled our economic difficulties with Great Britain in 1938. The war came on.  Then, because we were neutral and they were not, the immediate contacts between the Governments which had existed up to then were, naturally, suspended.</P>
    <P>Since that time, and even during a good deal of that time so far as Departments were concerned&mdash;the Department of Agriculture and so forth&mdash; there were contacts.  But since that period there has been closer contact between these Departments than there was during the war.  It is not, however, merely a question of contacts between Departments.  About May, 1940, Dr. Ryan, the Minister for Agriculture, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce were in Britain.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce was there in the autumn of 1945.  Both Ministers happened to be in London in the spring of 1946 in connection with other matters and they were able to meet British representatives.  Again, early this year the Minister for Industry and Commerce was in London and had discussions with British Ministers.  Why this nonsense of pretending that there have not been contacts between our Ministers and the British Ministers?  There are people who think you can do nothing unless you are going across the water every day.  What is our representative in London for?  What is the British representative here for?  What is the telephone for, if not for communications? At any time when there was important work to be done in the interests of this country we were ready.  There are times, however, when you can do things and times when you cannot.  One of the things people have to learn in life, if they want to do things well, is that sometimes they have to have patience and that they should not attempt at a wrong time to do a thing which there is hope of doing in the future at the right moment.  On this occasion we went over because there was a chance of doing business. <Col N="2131" /> If there had been a chance of business on previous occasions we would have gone.  There was a chance now of a proper understanding, and that understanding has been arrived at fundamentally, not merely by means of these arrangements which we are discussing here, which are only details.  There is a fundamental understanding that under the present conditions in the world, and until present conditions change, it is important for Britain, as it is for us, that Britain and ourselves and every other country in the sterling area should produce as much as possible and help each other to produce as much as possible.</P>
    <P>Two or three things are accepted at the present time&mdash;the first is that our production here is of tremendous importance. That is a very important point.  It is also understood that our national programme, as we have defined it, is going to stand and that any co-operation that exists must be on the basis that our programme is the one which we determine for ourselves, for our interests, just as they determine theirs for their interests.  The point is that each should know what the other is doing in order that they can see to what extent each can help the other in the doing of it&mdash;not that we should stop, for instance, our industrial development.  We would not barter our industrial development for any of the things that might be offered to us in exchange for it.  We are going on with our industrial development just as we are going on with our agriculcultural development, I hope, because the only safety and security for this country and the only way to keep our people here is to build up our manufacturing industries as well as our agriculture. It is understood, and it is a splendid thing that it is understood, that, as far as Britain and ourselves in the future are concerned, the main things we will be asking for are the things we cannot reasonably produce for ourselves.  We want capital goods and a number of other things which we have not got or which it would be most uneconomic for us to produce.  These Britain can supply to us in payment for the things we send to her.  Another thing has been understood, and it is a <Col N="2132" /> great thing that it should be understood, that is, that the employment of Irishmen in Ireland is more valuable than the employment of Irishmen anywhere else.  That is something that is worth having understood.</P>

We have farmers crying out: &ldquo;Why is there not a ban on people leaving the country?  There is work for them here.&rdquo;  One of the first people to speak in this House on that matter was Deputy Cogan.  I remember it well.  It was early in the war period. He was the first to say: &ldquo;Here is a young man, who is a splendid ploughman, leaving the country.&rdquo;  He had good wages at the time.  He asked him why he was leaving.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Just as I came from the country, for the same reason these people left the country&mdash;because they wanted to do something else.  They had other ideas in their minds.  A good deal of psychological matter&mdash;it is not solely narrow economic matters &mdash;is responsible.  We know well that if you have a small farm on which there are four or five children, only one boy can remain on the farm.  If you cut up all the land that is available in this country into economic holdings of, say, 25 to 50 acres, you will not have more than about 400,000 households.  If there is a normal family in each of these 400,000 households there will be three or four children who will have to go off that land and find employment somewhere else&mdash;either emigrate or come to the towns and work in industry. The whole purpose of our policy was by building up industries here to give such people employment in their own country.  There has been a long, long story of emigration in this country.  Our people have gone out. Unfortunately, it is those who do well who are held up as the examples.  They are the people who attract others to follow them.  The number of people who fail abroad are never heard of again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main attraction is supplied because a relatively small percentage of those who go abroad reach high places, and they are held out as examples to the rest of us.  I do not say that the wages paid to agricultural labourers in this country are the same as wages paid under the very special circumstances existing in England at the present moment, to the agricultural labourers there.  They are not the same.  I am told that smaller wages are paid in the country than are paid in the town.  That is quite true.  But things must balance, and it is no use holding up for any inspection one side of the account and ignoring the other.  When you compare the two sides of the account you will find that the balance is a fairly accurate <Col N="2134" /> one on the whole.  You must take into consideration what the income is, but you must also take into consideration what the outlay is and the conditions of life under which the people are required to live.  There is a good deal to be said for people staying in the country where they can lead a decent, good, clean life.  But these things cannot be measured in pounds, shillings and pence.  I have given an example many times; I will repeat it once more. A certain man lived in the city here and he was paying a rent of £120 a year for his house.  He was in receipt of a salary of £10 a week.  He went down to the country and there he saw a man living on what appeared to him to be a big estate.  The city man had not enough room in his back yard to keep a hen.  I suppose not even a man with a 200-acre farm would pay £120 a year in annuities.  But the man in the country was impressed by the city man who was in receipt of £l0 a week.  He regarded him as a millionaire.  He told himself that he would be a long time working on his farm before he could make £500 a year, as if the £500 the city man earned was a completely free income.</P>
    <P>The farmer overlooked the fact that the man in the city had to pay for all the services he got and for all the food he consumed.  It is not possible to make a just comparison between town and country unless one is presented with both sides of the account; and when you balance out that account you will find there is not much difference. I am willing to bet that the domestic servant who is employed in a decent household in this country is very much better off than her colleague in England, no matter what wages her colleague in England gets.  I am perfectly certain of that.  The domestic servant in Ireland can live decently, and she will never be exposed to the dangers to which she might be exposed away from her own people.  But there are some people who will only look at one side of the account without ever bothering to examine the other.  They do it purely for political reasons and they try to hold the Government responsible for tendencies for which they can have no responsibility.  They blame the Government <Col N="2135" /> because people are attracted away from the country.  In the last two or three years I have met here people who have been all over the world&mdash;Europe, America, Canada and elsewhere.  I have met considerable numbers of them, and the one thing they all say, whether they are here for a week or for a month, is that we do not understand or appreciate how very fortunate we are in this country.  Instead of telling the people that that is the position, there are some amongst us who, for purely political reasons, go out and try to give the impression that it is the Government which is forcing the people away from their homeland. They never tell them that they are better off here at home than they will ever be abroad.</P>
    <P>Just as there were some people in the past who were attracted away from their homeland, so in the future there will be some people who will leave us for other lands.  But it must be remembered that the wages paid here to-day in many trades are as high as the wages paid elsewhere, especially when one takes into consideration the fact that the outgoings are considerably less.  A Minister in the Six Counties recently referred to the higher social services they have there.  He took care at the same time not to advert to the very much higher taxation they have there&mdash;almost twice the taxation per head that we have here.  If we doubled our taxation here, we too could have higher social services.  If the people here are prepared to bear the burden of double taxation, then we will provide them with higher social services.  Again, there are people who go about urging increased social services without at the same time explaining that such services will mean increased taxation and that that taxation will have to be borne by the people themselves.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;austerity&rdquo; has been used extensively throughout this debate. Certain austerities have been imposed upon every country in the world because of certain scarcities.  That is entirely outside our power.  Only to a limited extent can we supply the things that are lacking.  If we are wise we will supply the things we <Col N="2136" /> need so far as we can ourselves.  If our farmers are wise they will go out now and sow the wheat that is necessary, because I doubt very much if we will get sufficient wheat from anywhere else.  The only remedy for us is to increase our output.  We can increase our output by harder work, longer hours and better machinery and equipment. That is one way.  That is the best way.  It is only natural that, in addition, if it is possible for us to obtain goods from outside, we should make every effort to obtain them.</P>
    <P>I have indicated the amount of dollars we think necessary in order to get the essentials.  We believe that the amount allocated will enable us to get these essentials.  In a time of scarcity we must make up our minds that, if there is to be a choice between what is essential and what is less essential or, perhaps, not essential at all, our first aim must be to secure the absolute essentials.  These dollars will be used in the main to secure for us those things which we consider essential.</P>

      <P>We shall secure the things that are essential.  We shall secure lorries, for instance, for road transport, before motor-cars.  We shall consider first those things that are necessary and our first call upon these dollars will be for the things that are essential.  If capital equipment is required&mdash;such as electrical equipment to keep our industries going&mdash;we shall take steps to procure it.  But we must always keep before our minds the need for increasing production in every direction.  As far as we are concerned, that is the way in which to meet any threatened scarcity.  If there are things which will enable us to produce more we will be able, with the amount that has been allocated to us, to obtain those essentials if they are obtainable. All these things are very scarce and hard to get.  But we believe that we can, within the amount, get the things that are essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned other possible sources from which we might get help if, for instance, we found that there were some essential things that we needed and that the amount of dollars we had was not sufficient.  One was the International <Col N="2137" /> Monetary Fund.  We are not members of that fund at the moment. We want to see the obligations and to see it all round.  We are considering seeking membership of that fund.  It is a fund which was intended to meet situations, more or less like the present, in which there were temporary deficits.  In certain circumstances it might be necessary for us to resort to that fund to get temporary accommodation in dollars.</P>

Then there is the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  I am not sure to what extent that is available to meet a situation like the present, where, for instance, we might want capital equipment. I would prefer, however, not to go into detail about these things, because they are under examination at the moment and the decision to join or not to join will be taken fairly soon.</P>

      <P>The doubt in my mind is whether that was intended primarily for war reconstruction, reconstruction of places which had been affected directly by the war, such as the restoration of factories that were destroyed and things of that sort.  At the moment, my information is that it could be used for capital development.  For instance, if there was some machinery we wanted, say, for a power station, we might be able to resort to the International Bank.  I do not want to commit ourselves to availing of these sources, but they are there and will, I think, be available in case they are needed.  But nobody wants to borrow if he can get on without borrowing. <Col N="2138" /> If our resources will enable us to get on without it, it is natural that we should incline in that direction rather than in the other.  The whole position will be examined from the point of view of our interests.</P>
      <P>As I have already said, if persons repeat a falsehood three times they think that people will believe that it must necessarily be true.  One of the suggestions I dealt with was that we had to be driven over to meet the British.  We were prepared to meet the British at all times and there have been certain communications all the time.  It is not only now that such questions as prices have been discussed. The point was that, as we were invited to deal with another matter, we felt that the matter had to be dealt with in a proper way.  That might have been done without our going over, just as well as by our going over.  I do not want to say that there was no advantage in our going over.  I believe there was.  I believe that there is always an advantage, when people have dealings with each other, in their meeting and knowing each other as far as possible. You lose nothing by it if you keep your head.</P>
      <P>It has also been stated that we have changed our policy; that we have suddenly run away from that situation which Deputy Dillon is so fond of trying to picture us in.  We have never been in the situation which Deputy Dillon tried to picture us as occupying. We have never said that we should not have an export market, if we could have it.  What we have said is that it was of vital importance for the people of this country not to neglect the home market but to look after it in the first instance because it was a safe market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Away back in the years 1929 to 1931, prices were tumbling down.  You would imagine that it was only when Fianna Fáil got into office that agricultural prices tumbled.  They were already steeply on the decline before we came into office.  I remember that, between 1928 and 1931, our exports of butter declined from £4,000,000 to £2,000,000 in value.  I forget whether the quantities were the same, but I think they were.  A situation came about then when butter that was 176/- per cwt. <Col N="2139" /> in 1928 and 1929 tumbled down to about 67/-.  In order to save the dairying industry we had to come to the rescue and give double what butter was fetching in a foreign market.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not.  They were tumbling down.  Like the suggestion that we are responsible for the ills of the world, the Deputy would like the people to think that we were responsible for the agricultural slump that began in 1929 all over the world and caused prices to tumble down.  I have given one example of that.  Our export of butter which amounted to £4,000,000 in value came tumbling to half of that, and butter which was sold at 176/- tumbled down until it was only about 67/-.  There was a world depression.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>By the conditions of the world.  The fact was that you had production of primary agricultural products to such an extent that, compared with secondary production, these products were only able to command a very low price.  We had to compete in a world market in Great Britain.  It was in the world market that they tumbled down.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy likes to interrupt like that, and there is no common sense or logical reason behind what he is talking about.  We asked the people of the country to realise that we were importing into this country goods which could be produced here and that it was a safer policy for the farmer to have a home market which could be protected and in which he could be given a reasonable price, while in the British market he had to compete against New Zealand, Australia, Denmark, Holland and other countries. We stand by that policy to-day as firmly as ever we stood by it&mdash;that the home market for the Irish farmer is the first market.  People think that all we <Col N="2140" /> do is to rear cattle and send them to Great Britain.  I think about 36 per cent. of our fat cattle are used in this country.  We have a home market for beef and for a number of other things. We are told that butter production has gone down, and that is true.  What is not recognised is that our home consumption has gone up tremendously in all these things.</P>
      <P>We have got to the stage at which we have got for the Irish farmer a home market and got it almost exclusively, so far as the products which he is able to produce are concerned, and in which he has also got reasonable prices.  During the whole of the war period, if you look at the figures, you will find that the farmers' produce has gone up in value and that, as far as prices are concerned, he has got more compensation in fact than other sections of the community have got.  The people who have suffered most during all this time are those who have fixed salaries or wages.  They have got no compensation, and they have to pay dearly for everything. For instance, we will take one of the cases mentioned here recently.  I wish we could deal with it, but we cannot because it is merely one of several types.  Take the case of a person awarded a pension of say £50 20 or 30 years ago.  With great care, he was able to live on that pound per week. Now it is worth only half what it was worth when it was first awarded to him, if it is worth that.  I should like to help people who are in that situation because these are the people who are hit most but, if you attempt to deal with any one section, you will find that there are several other sections in a similar position who would demand equal treatment.  There may be others who have an income of say £50 each out of shares.  They have received no increase in their incomes. If you tried to deal with these cases, you would find that the bill that would be presented would be enormous and would be entirely beyond our resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our policy, then, has not changed. It is the same policy all the time. First of all, so far as the farmers are <Col N="2141" /> concerned, give the farmer an opportunity to supply our home needs; give him that assured market and, over and above that, let us try to have as much exportable produce as possible in order that we may be able by our exports to buy the things we have to buy from outside and which we cannot produce ourselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to be brief. I was simply replying to the suggestion that there was a change of policy. I was simply reiterating what our <Col N="2143" /> policy was and asserting that there was no change in it.  I believed 20, 25 or 30 years ago, that this was the best policy for the country.  We have been working to get it into operation and I am more convinced than ever that it is a right and a safe policy for this country. I believe, furthermore, that the majority of the people are convinced of that.  I was saying that the first point in it was to get the farmers assured of the home market to the utmost extent, and that over and above that we should try to get from our agricultural industry such a volume of exports&mdash;it must be surplus to our own needs naturally &mdash;to purchase for us the things we must necessarily get in and which we can only continue to purchase by exports of that sort.  We have certain assets.  Speaking of these assets, it was suggested by a Deputy in the debate&mdash; one of the usual suggestions that we hear on occasions of this kind&mdash;that there must be some secret agreement again.  We heard a lot of talk of that kind when the ports were taken over. Whenever anything is done that seems to be reasonable and satisfactory, the suggestion is made that, of course, it can only have been done by some betrayal.</P>
      <P>So far as our external assets are concerned, no question of a reduction of them has been discussed.  These assets were created in the ordinary way of trade.  They are not of the type of some other assets to which reference was made.  These are ordinary assets and there has been no question of interfering with them.  We have used them in excess of our current earnings in the last year, and if it is necessary that we should use them in the future, they can be so used.  The only way in which they can be repatriated is in the form of goods and services which are rendered in exchange for these credits.  There is no use in suggesting to the Irish people that there have been secret agreements made behind their backs.  As I have said, it is suggested that when there is nothing in the visible line, then there must be something invisible that has been done wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were also told about the Spanish <Col N="2144" /> agreement, that here again we were guilty of another type of betrayal.  We were told we signed an agreement and that then we set out to break it.  This Government is not built like that.  We made an agreement with Spain to make available certain seed potatoes up to a certain amount.  That agreement is being fulfilled.  They wanted a certain type, but over and above the type which the Spaniards wanted and for which they were prepared to give potash and other things in exchange, there were other varieties which would be taken by Britain if they were available, and the prices, in so far as they are available, are the prices indicated there.  I do not want to say that I am satisfied with the prices, but if everybody who went with some commodity to sell could get the price he wanted, everything would be grand and sunny. As a rule there are two sides to these things.  If you have something to sell, you will have to have some agreement as to what the other person is prepared to give in exchange.</P>
    <P>Our policy with regard to agriculture, first of all, is to make the home market available, to produce at home, to a reasonable extent, the things that are required, and to have an export surplus. Then our policy is to give employment outside the agricultural industry, because that is essential if our people are to stay here.  We must build up our industries.  Our policy is to build up industries so as to give employment and produce for ourselves, again to a reasonable extent.  In the matter of farming I do not expect that we are going to grow bananas, as was suggested by Deputy Dillon, or, as others suggested, that we are going to produce tea.</P>
    <P>We can produce wheat and we can produce beet and, so far as fuel is concerned, we can produce turf.  In the case of our industries we are anxious to build them up to supply us with other things and to give employment. If to-morrow the whole country were divided into 50-acre or 25-acre farms, and that was the smallest economic unit we could have, and if we had on each holding a family with five children, of necessity three would have to get off the land.  There is no keeping <Col N="2145" /> them on the land, once they grow up and want to work for themselves.  They have to get employment when they are off the land, and to meet that situation we are anxious to build up our industries.</P>
    <P>There has been no change whatever in our policy.  The conditions in which we are to-day are not the same as the conditions we had 15 or 20 years ago. Certain modifications would naturally take place with the changing conditions. To-morrow, if the scarcity period blows over, there will be slight modifications. It might, for instance, be better not to produce the full amount of wheat but to produce such a quantity as would enable us to get to the full amount if we wanted it.  If we are to build up the pig industry, it is obvious that we will have to import foodstuffs such as maize.  If we want the pig industry at its former level, we will have to import a large quantity of foodstuffs, unless we are to change our economy completely.</P>
    <P>I am anxious about the position of the dairying industry&mdash;I say that quite frankly.  As regards the dry cattle industry, the present position seems to be all right, but the dairying industry is one that has given me a considerable amount of anxiety.  I know a little more about dairying than I do about other branches of agriculture.  In that way I have a keen appreciation of the part it plays in the whole of our economy.</P>
    <P>There is nothing abnormal in our making these arrangements with the British Government.  They are temporary arrangements and, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce pointed out, the effort was to reach an understanding on the fundamentals of our situation.  It is important for us to know what the British agricultural policy will be&mdash;very important.  An understanding by each of the other's position is of tremendous importance. That does not mean that there is to be any subordination of our interests to theirs.  It was a question of seeing to what extent, each nation pursuing a definite policy for the benefit of its own people, the two could be of mutual assistance.</P>

      <P>This Bill has originated in the need to give effect to the recommendations of the Joint Committee which was set up by the Dáil and Seanad to report on the method of panel elections and the electorate for such elections.  As the House will no doubt remember a motion was put down in the names of Deputies O'Higgins and McGilligan asking for the appointment of such a committee. The motion was agreed to by the House in October, 1945, and the Taoiseach's consequential motion proposing the constitution of the joint committee was agreed to in the following month.</P>
      <P>It may, perhaps, be no harm to put on record here the terms of reference which were given to the joint committee embodying the terms of that motion.  The motion, which was, as I have said, in the name of the Taoiseach, proposed:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That it is expedient that a joint committee of the Dáil and the Seanad be set up to consider and make recommendations on the method of regulating elections of those elected members of Seanad Éireann who are required by the Constitution to be elected from panels of candidates and the definition of the electorate for such elections;</P>
      <P>That 15 Deputies (exclusive of the chairman of the committee) represent the Dáil and seven Senators represent the Seanad on the said joint committee; and that the Ceann Comhairle be chairman of the committee.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To that motion an amendment was proposed by Dr. O'Higgins to delete all <Col N="2147" /> the words after the word &ldquo;expedient&rdquo; and to substitute the following &ldquo;that a commission be set up to consider making recommendations for the selection of the Seanad, to be nominated by the Government after consultation with the Leaders of the Opposition Parties and to consist of nine persons of whom not more than four should be members of the committee&rdquo;.  That amendment was, by leave of the House, withdrawn, and the main motion standing in the name of the Taoiseach was agreed to on the 14th of November, 1945.</P>

      <P>It may be noticed, Sir, that Deputy Davin's persuasive powers have not been able to augment the strength of the Labour Party by one single Deputy.  Apparently he is an outcast.</P>
      <P>I have referred to the fact that on the 14th November, 1945, the Dáil, without division, agreed to the motion put down in the name of the Taoiseach to set up a joint committee, the result of whose labours are embodied in this Bill.  I think it is essential that that fact should be brought to the mind of the House in view of the terms of the amendment put down by the Leader of the present Opposition Party.  Not only did the Dáil accept the motion of the Taoiseach in relation to the election of the Seanad but the Seanad concurred in this proposal.</P>
      <P>The joint committee of 15 met for the first time in February, 1946, and the following were appointed to be members of the committee under the chairmanship of the Ceann Comhairle:&mdash;The Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Health (then Minister for Agriculture), the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government; Deputies Bartley, B. Brady, P. Cogan, E. Coogan, Dillon, Everett, McCann, McCarthy, McGilligan, D. Morrissey, Norton and O'Connor; Senators Counihan, Duffy, Hayes, Hearne, Magennis, Moore and O'Dea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April, 1946, owing to the <Col N="2148" /> lamented death of Senator Magennis, Senator Quirke replaced him.</P>
    <P>The committee met 15 times and on five of these occasions deliberated in committee on the chairman's draft report.</P>
    <P>The subject, therefore, was very fully examined by an all-Party body, which issued an agreed report in May of this year.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise this, that the joint committee was composed of all Parties of both Houses and its report was an agreed report arrived at unanimously without division after a very full discussion of all the problems involved in this question.</P>
    <P>The embodiment of its findings, in legislative form will, I am sure, be accepted by the House without opposition. The House has had of course full opportunity of considering the terms of the report before it was ordered by the Dáil to be printed on the 13th May last, more than seven months ago.</P>
    <P>In the course of drafting the Bill it was decided that it was desirable to repeal the existing Acts of 1937 and 1940, and re-enact them in the new measure, and this has accordingly been done.  This course has the advantage of consolidating a very intricate body of law and presenting it in a convenient and compact form, though it has in present circumstances the disadvantage from the point of view of the Legislature of greatly increasing the bulk of the measure to be dealt with. This is, however, rather a notional than a concrete objection, since I assume that the Oireachtas will not desire to consider or to make any changes in the existing law beyond those which have been recommended by the joint committee. These changes have been summarised by the joint committee under ten heads and will be found in pages XXIV to XXVI of its report.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself, which contains 84 sections, is arranged in six parts, with three schedules, and I propose to summarise as tersely as possible the main provisions of these parts so that the House may have a comprehensive picture of the proposed procedure for electing future Seanads.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2149" /> In Part I the panels are defined in the terms of the Constitution and the professional interests for the purpose of the cultural and educational panel which were set out in the 1937 Act are here re-enacted.</P>
    <P>Under the permanent provisions of the measure the Clerk of the Seanad will be the returning officer and his expenses will be a charge on the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>These expenses have been nominal in the past and will continue to be nominal in the future.</P>
    <P>Part II directs that a register of nominating bodies shall be established and maintained.</P>
    <P>The qualifications which nominating bodies are required to have are set out in sub-section (2) of Section 8.</P>
    <P>This section will afford the returning officer a positive rule in determining the eligibility of a body that may apply for registration.</P>
    <P>It will empower him to reject a body that has only an ephemeral existence or which has no standing of any account.</P>
    <P>With such qualifications as a standard it does not now appear to be necessary to limit the number of nominating bodies on the register.</P>
    <P>A decision of the returning officer on an application is subject to appeal and the board will consist of a chairman who will be a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court.</P>
    <P>A fee of £20 must be lodged with an appeal and it will be returned if the appeal is allowed.</P>
    <P>So far, therefore, as is practicable, having regard to the present development of the several vocational bodies which are ultimately to become nominating bodies, every care has been taken to ensure that these will be real bodies serving a definite purpose and representing a true vocational interest. It will be more difficult than it has been, perhaps, heretofore for mushroom bodies to secure registration because the returning officer will have before him definite standards with which these bodies must comply.  It may be anticipated that in the course of future developments the standard will be raised and the general characteristics of the <Col N="2150" /> nomination bodies take a more concrete form.  In this matter we must proceed gradually and we must take into consideration the existing state of affairs.  Part III will provide for the formation and maintenance of nominating committees.  This is a new proposal based upon the recommendation of the joint committee.</P>
    <P>Each nominating body will be entitled to nominate five of its members to a nomination committee for the panel for which the body has been registered.  Such members must be nominated at an annual meeting of the body and will hold office until the day before the next annual meeting of the body.</P>
    <P>The functions of the nominating committees are set out in detail in Part IV, Chapter II, and Part V, Chapter II of the Bill.  Their functions may be summarised briefly as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>At a general election they are to review the proposals for nominations made by nominating bodies to the nominating bodies sub-panels and are to select from them what may be described as a short or final list of the candidates to be nominated as representing vocational interests and submit it to the electorate.</P>
    <P>At a by-election necessitated by a casual vacancy they will directly elect a candidate to fill it.  The nomination committee for any panel, therefore, may fairly be described as the coordinating organisation of the nominating bodies for that panel.</P>
    <P>It enables the nominating bodies to ascertain and crystallise the general point of view of the broad vocational interest of which they are individual components, and it enables them to make a collective nomination which will be truly representative of that interest and which in view of the provisions of Section 51 of the Bill must be electorally effective.</P>
    <P>Since the nominating committees and the nominating bodies which they represent are vocational in character, this new procedure should definitely intensify the vocational character of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill sets out the <Col N="2151" /> general procedure to be followed at a Seanad general election.</P>
    <P>The proceedings are initiated by an Order of the Minister for Local Government, to be made under Section 24, fixing times and dates for the various steps to be taken.  This Order must be made within seven days after a dissolution of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The last day upon which nominating bodies may make proposals for nomination must not be less than four weeks after the dissolution.  I might introduce an amendment on the Committee Stage to reduce this minimum period to three weeks.  The last day for nominations by members of the Oireachtas, however, must naturally be later than that fixed for nominations of the nominating bodies and, if practicable, should be fixed a day after the date fixed for the reassembly of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Chapter II sets out the procedure for forming the panels and ruling on the validity of the nominations.  Briefly the nominating bodies will propose for the consideration of the appropriate nomination committees the names of persons whom they would recommend for nomination.  The nomination committees will consider these and definitely determine which of them are to be ultimately nominated and selected for election.</P>
    <P>Section 26 fixes the number of candidates that a nominating body may propose.</P>
    <P>I propose to submit an amendment on the Committee Stage to the actual terms of the sub-section as included in the Bill.  This amendment will, however, have the same purpose as the original sub-section, which is to permit nominating bodies to propose a sufficiency of candidates to ensure that the nomination committee will have full scope to make a representative nomination. It may happen that the same person may be proposed by more than one body, but if the total number of persons proposed is less than the minimum prescribed, the Taoiseach, under Section 28 (4), must propose such number as will make up the deficiency.</P>
    <P>Sections 32, 33 and 34 provide that <Col N="2152" /> the proposals for nomination by nominating bodies will be considered at a meeting of the nomination committee for the panel to which they relate.  At this meeting a poll will be taken to select from the persons proposed by the nominating bodies the candidates who will stand nominated to the appropriate sub-panel, subject to the nominations being valid and the candidates qualified.  The poll will be taken and the result will be ascertained according to the system of single-transferable vote.</P>
    <P>The nomination of candidates who stand nominated will be reviewed at a sitting called in the Bill the completion of the panels.  Any decision of the returning officer is subject to appeal to the judicial referee who is the President of the High Court for some other judge of the High Court nominated by him.  The referee will be present at the sitting and will then and there finally determine any question submitted to him. If as the result of the completion of the panels there is a deficiency in the number of candidates who stand nominated, the Taoiseach will nominate candidates to supply the deficiency.</P>
    <P>Members of the Oireachtas&mdash;for the purposes of the Bill this means the members of the Dáil and Seanad&mdash;may nominate candidates, but the nomination must be by not less than four members and a member of the Oireachtas may not join in the nomination of more than one candidate.</P>
    <P>Chapter III of Part IV describes the electorate and the method of taking the ballot.  The electorate will be the members of the Dáil and Seanad and the members of every county and county borough council, or, where the members of a particular council have been removed from office, the former members.</P>
    <P>There are two such councils whose members have been removed from office&mdash;the County Council of Kerry and the County Council of Dublin.  In relation to the former members of the Dublin County Council, I took the view that, because of the lapse of time since they have been removed, they cannot be considered to have retained their representative capacity, and I propose <Col N="2153" /> to move an amendment excepting them in Committee.  The members in question were first elected to the Dublin County Council in the year 1934.</P>
    <P>Copies of the panels of the candidates who stand nominated will, of course, be issued to the electors.  The Committee have recommended that there will be a separate ballot paper for each panel and the sub-panel to which the candidate was nominated will be stated thereon.  This proposal is, of course, embodied in the Bill and all the proposals relating to the issue of the ballot papers are as recommended by the joint committee.</P>
    <P>The Constitution requires that the voting at the Seanad election be by secret postal ballot and I have been advised that the constitutionality of the present provisions which have been included in the Bill to give effect to the precise recommendations of the joint committee in this connection is open to doubt.  It will be necessary, therefore, to reconsider the scheme for the issue and return of the votes and an alternative proposal will be submitted for consideration on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The existing allocation of members to the several panels is continuing, that is, that there shall be five elected to the Cultural and Educational Panel, 11 to the Agricultural Panel, 11 to the Labour Panel, nine to the Industrial and Commercial Panel and seven to the Administrative Panel.</P>
    <P>The existing law allocates a fixed number of candidates to be elected from each sub-panel as well.  This provision could result in a candidate being elected without any votes being credited to him.  It is proposed instead in Section 51 that a minimum number to be elected from each sub-panel be fixed and that, subject to that minimum, the election be determined according to the voting alone.  The fixing of a minimum number for each sub-panel has the natural consequential effect of fixing a maximum for that sub-panel as well.</P>
    <P>Section 52 of the Bill requires that the votes be counted in accordance with the rules in the Second Schedule. The rules set forth in that Schedule are the rules which apply to the counting <Col N="2154" /> of the votes under the Act of 1937 with the modifications necessary by reasons of the provisions of Section 51.  The returning officers, as I have already mentioned, cannot elect more than the maximum number of candidates on any sub-panel nor less than the minimum prescribed number.</P>
    <P>Part V deals with the filling of casual vacancies.  This part re-enacts in the main the existing law with the following important modification, that is to say, where the vacancy arises in respect of the nominating bodies sub-panel, the vacancy will be filled directly by the nomination committee voting by proportional representation.  Where the vacancy occurs in respect of an Oireachtas sub-panel, the electors will be the members of the Dáil and Seanad voting together.</P>
    <P>Part VI contains certain miscellaneous conditions.  A member of the Seanad, for instance, elected under the Act may resign by notice in writing addressed to the Chairman of the Seanad and the resignation will take effect on the announcement of the resignation to the Seanad.  If a person is elected as a university member and as a panel member, he must declare in accordance with Section 80 in which capacity he will sit.  If he fails to do this within one month after the first meeting he will be deemed to be a university member.</P>
    <P>The elections will, of course, be governed by the ordinary rules for the preservation of the secrecy of the ballot.</P>
    <P>Section 84 contains a transitory provision to the effect that the existing law will continue in force until the Act comes into operation on the day appointed under Section 7, that is, a day not later than the 31st December, 1949.  By this provision it was intended that the Act should come into force as soon as the new nominating bodies register had been prepared and the nomination committee appointed.  I propose, however, to introduce an amendment to which I shall refer later dealing with the present exceptional position in this regard.</P>
    <P>The First Schedule contains a provision for the issue and receipt of the ballot papers.  They are the existing <Col N="2155" /> rules with the modifications necessary to give effect to the report of the joint committee.  The rules for the issue of ballot papers require amendment consequential on the amendment which I propose to introduce and to which I have referred in Part III of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Second Schedule contains rules for counting the votes, These rules will be found to eliminate any element of chance whatever in the election. Each vote will be transferred, in the case of a surplus, to the candidate indicated as the next preference at a value which is ascertained by dividing the total value of the votes credited to the candidate minus the quota by the number of transferable papers in the parcel or sub-parcel from which the candidate derived the surplus value.</P>

      <P>The Third Schedule contains the rules for the receipt and issue of ballot papers in the case of an Oireachtas sub-panel casual vacancy.  These rules are a re-enactment of the rules of the Act of 1940.</P>
      <P>So far I have given a general account of the main provisions of the Bill.  It might be desirable, however, to refer the House to those sections of it which originated directly from the joint committee's report.  The principal recommendations of the committee have been summarised in paragraph 35 of the report.  They are, as I have mentioned, ten in number.  The first is:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That a new register of nominating bodies be established on a somewhat broader basis than the present.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The detailed proposals of the joint committee in this regard are set out in paragraphs 4 to 11, inclusive, of the <Col N="2156" /> report and these are embodied in Sections 8 to 11 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The second recommendation of the committee is that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...in lieu of the appealed committee as at present constituted to consider appeals in connection with the annual revision of the register an appeal board be established consisting of the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of each House, together with a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This recommendation is set out in detail in paragraphs 12 and 13 of the report, and it is proposed to implement it by Section 12 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The third recommendation is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the system of nomination of candidates by registered nominating bodies be continued subject to final selection of candidates by nominating committees for election by the electorate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The full statement of the joint committee's recommendations in this regard is contained in paragraphs 14 to 20, inclusive, and will be implemented by Sections 26 and 32-34 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 21 the joint committee makes its fourth recommendation, viz: &ldquo;That members of both Houses of the Oireachtas be entitled to nominate candidates.&rdquo;  This recommendation is embodied in Section 25 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A fifth recommendation will be found in paragraph 23, viz.:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the present division of each panel into two sub-panels be continued subject to provision being made for a like fixed minimum number of members of Seanad Eireann to be elected from each sub-panel of a panel.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is proposed to give effect to this by Sections 43 and 51 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 28 it is recommended that there be a separate election and a separate vote in respect of each panel.  Provisions designed to implement this recommendation will be found in the First Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Again, in paragraph 29 the joint committee recommend that the present provisions for postal voting be replaced <Col N="2157" /> by a system under which the elector shall attend before a local returning officer to receive his several ballot papers and, forthwith, in the presence of the said returning officer shall mark them and post them in the postal box specially provided for the purpose; Deputy and Senator electors being permitted, on notice, either to mark their ballot papers as above or in the presence of the Seanad returning officer at his office.  The First Schedule of the Bill is designed to give effect to those recommendations also.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 30 the joint committee recommend that the electorate be increased to include the members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and all the members of the council of each county and county borough.  Provision is made in Section 44 of the Bill to give effect to this.</P>
    <P>The joint committee's remaining recommendations are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Paragraph 31 (ix): That a casual vacancy caused by the death, etc., of a nominee of a nominating body shall be filled by direct election of the appropriate nominating committee; and that such a vacancy arising among the Oireachtas nominees shall be filled by direct election of the members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 32 (x): That the Clerk of the Seanad be the Seanad Returning Officer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are given effect to in Part V and Section 4 of the Bill, respectively.</P>
    <P>I should have thought that, in view of the manner in which these proposals originated, in view of the public attention that was directed some considerable time ago to certain occurrences associated with the election of the last Seanad, there would have been a general desire to have the next election for the Seanad held on the revised basis proposed in the Bill.  I still believe that is the general desire of the House.  It is certainly, I am sure, the general desire of the people.  For this reason I would ask the House to treat this measure as an urgent one and to help in securing its enactment with the least possible delay.  The fact that the report which gave rise to it was the work of an all-Party committee <Col N="2158" /> which was agreed upon all its findings should enable the House to do so with an easy mind.</P>
    <P>The urgency which the Bill so recently acquired leads to two other matters. One is that, no matter how speedily it becomes law, it will not be feasible to operate the new system in its entirety for the next election.  In particular, it would be impossible to have the new register of nominating bodies prepared in time, while it would also be unwise to ask the new Seanad Returning Officer to take charge of so complicated a task with little or no preparation for it. These are matters, however, which can be dealt with conveniently and easily by way of transitory provisions designed solely for the next election.</P>
    <P>The use of the existing register of nominating bodies and the retention of the present returning officer for one more election will not vitiate the improved method of election recommended by the committee in any vital respect.  These nominating bodies were formed for the purpose of the elections of the Seanad which have taken place since 1937.  They have all received certain statutory recognition.  It is not necessary for us to await the preparation of a fresh register of nominating bodies and we can quite readily allow the bodies on the existing register to set up the nomination committees in accordance with the terms of the Bill and with the recommendations of the joint committee.  I propose, therefore, to move on the Committee Stage two amendments covering, first of all, the position of the existing nominating bodies and, secondly, the position of the Seanad Returning Officer for the next election.</P>
    <P>The remaining question which should be dealt with is that of postal voting. I am advised that, in order to avoid the slightest doubt that the new method of election would in any way conflict with the Constitution's requirement in regard to postal voting, it would be safer, while preserving the spirit of the committee's recommendations in this regard which are directed primarily to preserving the secrecy of the ballot, to introduce an alternative system designed to serve the same end, while at the same time preserving the essential <Col N="2159" /> characteristic of the postal vote. Deputies will agree that in a matter so important as the constitution of one of the Houses of the Legislature the greatest care should be taken to avoid even the smallest uncertainty.</P>
    <P>My proposals in this regard would normally appear in the Bill as published before Second Reading, but the circumstances which have made the introduction of the measure urgent did not permit of this.  I will, as I have said, introduce those proposals by way of amendment on the Committee Stage. They will not conflict in any way with the spirit of the recommendation or the purpose of the recommendation made by the joint committee.  They will only ensure that, not only will the requirements of the Constitution in regard to the secrecy of the ballot be complied with, but also that the essential character of the method of voting by post be preserved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete the word &ldquo;now&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;this day six months&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I should like to make it clear that we stand for having a Seanad, that we stand for having a good Seanad, and that we stand for a manner of electing that Seanad that will free it from any charge of corruption or bribery in its election.  This Dáil is under sentence of dissolution and my amendment to the Minister's motion arises out of that fact.  On the 21st October, the Taoiseach announced that he proposed to dissolve this Dáil at the earliest possible moment and to have an early general election.  There is nothing preventing the dissolution of the present Dáil except any urgent business that, in the public interest, the Government consider ought to be got through. From the point of view of common sense, from the point of view of Parliamentary dignity, and from the point of view of democratic practice, I feel that a Parliament which is under sentence of dissolution should not be asked to consider and decide upon radical changes in the manner of election or in the representation of either one or the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no desire to discuss the <Col N="2160" /> details of this measure.  The Minister indicated that the need was to pass into legislation the recommendations of the joint committee.  I submit that is not the need at all.  The joint committee was set up to examine a particular question and to report so that that report could be discussed in all its details in each of the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister drew the attention of the House to the genesis of this measure, that it arose out of a motion originally proposed in this House by Deputies Dr. O'Higgins and McGilligan.  He rather glossed over the circumstances.  The motion to which the Minister refers and which was passed unanimously, was discussed on the 10th October, 1945.  Introducing that motion Dr. O'Higgins said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This motion has been on the Order Paper since&mdash;one Parliament after another&mdash;but only on one occasion was it reached in the Order of Business here and on that occasion some prosecutions were taking place in the courts with regard to election to the Seanad and, of course, it would be entirely improper to discuss it under such circumstances.  Now, at the end of nearly four years, I move the motion that we should have some system of electing a Seanad other than the existing one and that a committee be appointed to make recommendations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>No wonder he would add in column 124: &ldquo;I do not think we can be accused of any impatience with regard to this particular motion.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In column 129 the motivating influences leading to the motion which Deputy Dr. O'Higgins and Deputy McGilligan put down is explained in some detail.  Deputy Dr. O'Higgins said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It should not be necessary to argue whether it is a good or a bad Seanad, whether it is a vocational Seanad or otherwise.  All that should be necessary in a House of representative people, each one having more or less general knowledge of the <Col N="2161" /> whole country and that peculiar knowledge of his own constituents, would be to ask them honestly to search their own minds as to the activities that are the accompaniment of every Seanad election and the amount of corruption, bribery and illegality.  That is the kind of weapon that has been forged to break down the morale of the representatives of the people.  The temptation is there and it has grown with every single Seanad election from the first to the fourth, until, finally, we have reached the point that a man who is straightforward and honourable with regard to his vote, who has regard for it, is regarded as a man who does not appreciate the asset that is put into his hand, while the man who `cashes in', who uses his cheque book, is regarded as a business man.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When Deputy O'Higgins referred to the first and the fourth Seanad election, he referred to the first and the fourth Seanad election under the present Seanad system which is the system perpetuated in this country by this present Government and the foundations of which were laid in the Constitution. Therefore, let the Minister not endeavour to ride away on the pretence that he is now presenting to the House a proposal which is completely accepted by all Parties.  He is putting before the House in legislative form the recommendations made unanimously, no doubt, by a joint committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas, and produced to some extent under restrictions under which they worked.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted paragraph 35 of the Report but paragraph 34 said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It should also be mentioned that some members of the joint committee wished to raise matters relating to a radical reconstitution of the Seanad as a whole but the chairman ruled that the committee were precluded by the terms of reference from considering such matters.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We ask the Minister, and if the Minister perseveres in his rather persistent attitude to-day we appeal over his head to the Government, that a Dáil that is under sentence of dissolution <Col N="2162" /> should not be asked to sit down and consider in detail the proposals that are contained in this measure. We make this suggestion to the Government.  The Minister has suggested that one of the main proposals in this Bill intended to prevent corruption in the election of Senators is, as it stands in the Bill, not in accordance with the Constitution.  At any rate, he cannot be quite sure that the proposals with regard to postal voting would stand examination from the Constitutional point of view.  He proposes, therefore, to make new proposals for so arranging the machinery for postal voting for the Seanad that, while it will be within the requirements of the Constitution, will be such as may help to safeguard against bribery and corruption in the election of Senators.  I suggest to the Minister and to the Government that what we do want and what we could undertake to pass in 24 hours is a measure embodying these new proposals so that the Seanad which will be elected after the next general election will be elected under the legislation existing at the present moment but amended in respect to postal voting so as to eliminate whatever kind of bribery and corruption can be eliminated by an improvement of the secret element in the voting.</P>
    <P>I do not think that a House that is under sentence of dissolution should be asked to do anything but that. When the Minister made his introductory speech he indicated quite a large number of amendments that even now would have to be inserted in this measure.  I ask Deputies to look at the measure.  Section 84 of the Bill reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  This Act shall not apply in relation to any Seanad general election occasioned by a dissolution of Dáil Eireann occurring during the transitional period, and such election shall accordingly be held under the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act, 1937 (No. 43 of 1937).</P>
    <P>(2)  This Act shall not apply in relation to any Seanad by-election which is to fill a casual vacancy occurring during the transitional period and such election shall <Col N="2163" /> accordingly be held under the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) (By-Elections) Act, 1940 (No. 20 of 1940).</P>
    <P>(3)  In this section, the expression `the transitional period' means the period beginning on the day on which this Act is passed and ending on the day before the day on which Section 7 of this Act comes into operation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is Section 84 of the Bill.  Now, Section 7 of the Bill reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  This section shall come into operation on such day not being later than the 31st day of December, 1949, as the Minister shall appoint by Order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When this measure was drafted it was contemplated that we might have a transitional period running for two years and that inside that transitional period any Seanad by-election that might take place would take place under the legislation as it now stands. Somewhat hurriedly the Minister brings forward entirely different proposals.</P>
    <P>On 31st October this year the Taoiseach intimated that he proposed to dissolve the Dáil at the earliest opportunity, when he had got rid of certain urgent measures.  It was not until 7th November that the Minister for Local Government asked permission to introduce this measure.  It was not until Friday last that this measure was actually issued for anybody to look at. Most Deputies got this measure to read some time about midday on Monday last and quite unexpectedly to-day we were asked to take the Second Reading of it here.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Government are being most inconsiderate in this matter.  It is quite impossible to understand that any reasonable Government would ask the House, in the existing state of affairs, when a very serious economic situation exists to be thought over and examined, when the electorate generally are notified that they must proceed with the election of a new Parliament immediately after the New Year opens, and when members of both Houses are naturally concerned with the economic and political situation, to <Col N="2164" /> discuss the varied and intricate details contained in this measure.  It is put to us that this measure embodies the unanimous proposals of a joint committee of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not unanimous &mdash;that is certain.  I was a member of the committee and I never signed a report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Minister put to us.  I have pointed out the implications of Section 34. Whether they were unanimous or not, whether they were restricted in the ground they were able to cover in their discussions or not, the report that comes from the joint committee of the Oireachtas is intended for detailed discussion both by the Dáil and by the Seanad.  To ask us in this hurried way to receive this Bill this week, to read, digest and discuss it in the Dáil, then to pass it to the Seanad and have it fully discussed there is, in my opinion, an outrage on Parliamentary commonsense and an outrage on the democratic method of dealing with these things.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should approach this matter in the calm way in which apparently he was approaching it before the excitement of the general election came on top of him.  He was not here when I made the suggestion that he should take the proposal which he says he now intends to introduce by way of amendment to improve the secrecy of the postal vote and introduce that as a separate amending Bill, to become part of the existing legislation, and that in the next Seanad that shall be elected in accordance with the existing legisation, together with the improvement in the matter of secrecy for the purpose of trying to eliminate corruption and bribery, his proposals for the new postal voting system will prevail.  I suggest that it is very important that the consideration of the details of this Bill should be postponed for six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a member of this committee which was charged with the task of reviewing the constitution of the Seanad and when I started work on it I assumed we were expected to do an intelligent and competent job, but I early discovered that we were <Col N="2165" /> hamstrung in our terms of reference by a proviso that we were bound by the Heath Robinson machinery of the Constitution, and all the codology and abracadabra of the panels was riveted upon us before we began our deliberations, all of us well knowing that respectable publicans were appearing on the Labour panel on the ground that they used to chase a hen around the backyard every now and again and that pugilists were appearing on the arts and crafts and culture panels because they used to whistle <i>Cathleen Mavourneen</i> between the rounds of a boxing match.</P>
      <P>I exhorted the committee to face the fact that the whole system of the panels was an absurdity and that if we could not get over the preposterous device of panels which had been incorporated in the Constitution, what we should do was to allow anybody who wanted to put himself forward as an artist, to put himself forward as an artist, and let the electors determine, when they came to consider his claim to the Senatorial office, whether he would do as an artistic Senator or not. In place of that, the most laughable machinery has been devised by the joint wisdom of the committee, stipulating a series of examinations.  We very nearly reached the stage of requiring a Senator to possess a competent knowledge of Irish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

But by machinery which occurred to the mind of the Fianna Fáil Party, one can be a Senator on the Cultural Panel without a competent knowledge of Irish, but one cannot be a charwoman in the Agricultural Credit Corporation without a competent knowledge of Irish.</P>
      <P>As a result, we have this Bill with 84 sections and it is to be recorded on the Statute Book of this country as an instrument devised to limit bribery and corruption in the public life of our country.  Now is that not a nice piece of legislation?  Is it not a glorious confession for a Committee of this Oireachtas to record for posterity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had two proposals for that committee, <Col N="2166" /> but as it was abundantly clear that neither would be considered by the committee, my interest in its proceedings ceased.  The first proposal was that if we had to retain the panel system&mdash;and apparently we had to retain it as it was in the Constitution &mdash;we should allow any nominee to have himself put forward for the panel of his choice and have the members of Dáil Eireann then vote on those candidates, elect the Seanad and answer to the country for the quality of the Seanad that they elected.  If the members of this House are fit to rule the country, to make the people's laws and protect their liberties and if it is the purpose of the measure to get a Seanad drawn from a series of panels representing culture, industry and agriculture and so forth, I cannot see how you can get a better body to choose the Seanad than the elected representatives of the people.</P>
    <P>I am more firmly wedded to that proposal by the realisation of the fact that in the event of an unworthy Seanad being chosen, responsibility could be clearly fixed on the members of Dáil Eireann for failing in their duty.  If, for ulterior motives, we chose unworthy persons to act in the advisory capacity in which it is the Seanad's duty to act, the blame for any bad advice we might hereafter get would rest squarely on our own shoulders.  I felt that under that spur it was highly likely that Dáil Eireann, bad and all as it is&mdash;and I think it compares favourably with any deliberative Assembly in the world, though it is not so highly esteemed in many parts of the country, to judge from what one reads&mdash;would do its duty conscientiously and reasonably. I think that, as a result of the choice it would make, we would get a workmanlike Seanad, as far as the Heath Robinson abracadabra offspring of the Taoiseach's mind incorporated in the Constitution permits anybody to choose a satisfactory Seanad.</P>
    <P>I would direct the attention of the House to the fact that this proposal would allow anyone to be nominated to any panel for which he and his nominators thought him suitable, that it would result in making the panel system nugatory and of no effect and <Col N="2167" /> would restore to the electors the power to determine whether a man was eligible to be elected.  I think that in the constitutional position in which we are, the House would have no alternative but to amend the Constitution if that course were to be adopted.  If it were adopted, I feel that we would have a desirable kind of Seanad, a Seanad composed of two Senators from each county in Ireland, quite probably including two Senators from each of the counties of Northern Ireland, giving in all 64 Senators.  They would be chosen in the Twenty-six Counties within the jurisdiction of this Parliament by the heads of households, because it so happens at this time that we have at our disposal a register of the heads of households.</P>
    <P>At other times it might be a very difficult thing to compose such a register owing to the conflicting claims that might arise in certain mixed households as to who the head truly was. We might, I think, with perfect equity have declared that those persons in the State who held a ration book with two red stripes on it should be deemed, for the purpose of the Act, to be the heads of households eligible to vote in the Seanad election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The truth of this trying person's interruptions is that at a very early stage of the committee's deliberations I desired permission to bring these proposals before it and was <Col N="2168" /> informer by the chairman of the committee, guided by his experts, that, inasmuch as the terms of reference did not envisage any change in the Constitution, the committee might not address its attention to any proposals which would involve an amendment of the Constitution.  For this reason I realised that no useful purpose could be served by getting them to listen to me when I knew that they were not free on their terms of reference to listen to any such proposals on their merits.</P>
      <P>If we had a Seanad drawn from the persons who would be described as the heads of households&mdash;for I envisaged that only the heads of households would be eligible for nomination by a body of voters consisting exclusively of heads of households&mdash;we would have had a Seanad initially composed of 52 Senators and&mdash;though I was not sure of this&mdash;I felt that we might possibly have examined whether it might not be desirable, for the time being, to vest in those 52 members the power to co-opt 12 members from Northern Ireland, two of whom would represent each of the Six Counties, until such time as circumstances would permit the holding of a proper election in the Six Counties under the jurisdiction of the Parliament proper to administer the Six Counties, which is, of course, the Oireachtas sitting here in Leinster House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mind you I think there could be powerful arguments to which I would listen with respect against that course. If it were advanced that such a gesture would cut across a general policy designed to promote reconciliation between this part of the country and the people in Northern Ireland I would be very favourably inclined to waive what would appear to me a right on our part to summon representatives to the Irish Seanad from the Six Counties in order to promote the cause of conciliation.  But on the other hand if it seemed that no legitimate offence could be taken it would have given me gratification to feel that, without exciting internecine slaughter or ill-will between ourselves and our fellow-countrymen in Northern Ireland, we would have 12 <Col N="2169" /> Senators to give us the benefit of their advice and counsel in matters affecting the whole State.  I would be glad to see it&mdash;possibly only as a shadow foretelling coming events, but none the less a visible and enduring token of what everybody in this country some day hopes to see.</P>
    <P>The House will note that my proposal involved an electorate from the senior elements of our community and a candidate drawn from the senior element of our community.  That purpose I had in mind because, while I believe that for a variety of constitutional reasons which it is not necessary to go into detail about now, it is desirable to have universal suffrage for the sovereign body of Parliament which in this State unquestionably is Dáil Eireann whose will must in the event of conflict ultimately prevail it is no harm, in an advisory way, on a body whose primary function is to advise, to remonstrate, to call for second thoughts, to have representatives of the maturer sections of the community, representatives of those sections of the community who have acquired that quality of wisdom which comes only in the school of experience and which simply cannot be acquired by the young, however ardent and desirous they are of serving the public need.  The more one looks around the world in which we at present live the more manifest are the bloody evils of violent revolution and upheaval.  The more one looks around the world the more one realises how rarely substantial benefit is conferred upon mankind by action begotten of hasty thought. The more one looks about the world the more one realises how ill-used is the contention that the dictator who acts vigorously, promptly, without hesitation gets results whereas the dilatory democracy comes only trotting after, the difference being that while the dictator gets results and lives a moment in pomp and glory by the mercy of God's providence he dies in the cellar of a burning building, while democracies proceeding more slowly continue their tedious deliberations to arrive by slow stages at decisions that carry consent and at institutions that endure.</P>
    <P>We live in a world where there are still gentlemen who hope by incisive, <Col N="2170" /> rapid and efficient action to settle all the problems of mankind.  By God's providence they also will die in the cellars of burning buildings and at the hands of democracies slowly and reluctantly taking the measures requisite to encompass that end for them. That the democracies of the future will have the capacity to do these things will depend largely on how far these democracies are prepared to listen, albeit not always to accept, to the advice of those who have acquired wisdom by experience.  Mark clearly the qualification I make&mdash;&ldquo;their readiness to listen to, albeit not always to accept.&rdquo;  In some characters middle age gives rise to petulance, almost feminine petulance; in others to a reluctance to undertake enterprise; in others to an excess of caution.  These middle-aged failings of which I am conscious in my own person require the correction of the ardour of the enthusiasm of youth and in the rising generation's hand must ultimately rest the final decision as to what the future will provide.  But even the petulance, the feminine petulance, the reluctance to act has a useful purpose provided it claims no more than the right to be heard.  Such a Seanad as I had in mind would have room for the petulant, the indecisive, the cautious.  In that Chamber they might have their say. Here in the Dáil, in regard to the toleration of petulance of which perhaps I have not always shown the best example, inspiring that respect I should.  I take this occasion to say to the Minister for Local Government that if, perhaps on recent occasions, I have used language which has been stronger and more incisive than any grievance under which I suffer would have justified, in so far as I had hurt his feelings by going beyond the limits of what he thought fair, I offer him my apologies.  Here we have a mixture of many temperaments and of many ages. We are what the people choose to send. Such as we are, we must take final responsibility for the deeds we do.  I am not afraid of that responsibility.  Taken by and large, I think we have given a very good account of ourselves in the last 25 years&mdash;better than that given by any other democratic Parliament that I know of and very often under greater <Col N="2171" /> difficulties than any other democratic Parliament in the world has had to handle.  Those are my proposals.  It is because they were outside the terms of reference laid down for the committee that at a very early stage of that committee's deliberations I determined the best service I could give was to absent myself from it, and I acted on that.  I take this first opportunity of reporting to the House the infrequence of my attendance on that committee and the reasons for it and offering to the House, within the wider terms of reference permitted here, the proposals I would gladly have made to the committee to which the House appointed me as a representative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in some difficulty in relation to this Bill because I find myself in complete disagreement with the Bill and in complete disagreement with the legislation this Bill is intended to implement.  The position which the Bill was intended to remedy was a position under which candidates for the Seanad purchased votes and under which electors to the Seanad sold their votes.  In other words, it was intended to prevent public corruption in the election of members to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I have only had this Bill a very short time in my possession.  But, knowing that the intention of the Bill was to prevent the buying and selling of votes, I looked through the Bill to find out if there were any provisions which specifically precluded public corruption.  I find none.  Possibly the Minister may consider the advisability of the incorporation in this Bill of certain sections making it a penal offence for any electors to the Seanad to seek support or votes for their candidature by means of direct or indirect bribes.  Possibly the Minister might also make it a penal offence for any of the electors to the Seanad to receive direct or indirect bribes.  I know that there is ordinary legislation to deal with bribery and corruption but I would suggest that something more is needed here.  That ordinary legislation and that ordinary penal code does not stop the buying and selling of votes in this very building. It is obvious, therefore, that something more stringent is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2172" /> I would like to endorse what the Leader of the Opposition said when he complained of the shortness of the time available to us to consider this Bill before its Second Reading.  Possibly I can complain in this regard with greater force because the other members of this House were in on the discussion that occurred some years ago in relation to rectifying the method of election to the Seanad.  The Bill provides for an enlargement of the electorate. It provides that members of both Houses of the Oireachtas will be entitled to nominate candidates for the Seanad.  I do not think that is a good idea.  The tendency may well be that members of the Dáil will tend to nominate possible rivals in their own constituency by way of a <i>quid pro quo</i> in an election campaign.  I would urge upon the Minister to reconsider the advisability of that proposal.</P>
    <P>The electorate has been enlarged to include the members of the Oireachtas, members of every county and county borough council&mdash;that is, the members of every county council in the country. Though great care may be taken to ensure that the ballot paper is placed by the voter into a box, what care has been taken to ensure that no influence of an improper nature will not have been brought to bear upon members of the electorate?  It is tragic that we in this House should have to talk in such terms, but we must face realities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the suggestion made by Deputy Dillon in regard to the possibility of making provision for representatives from the Six Counties in the Seanad.  The suggestion might well have come from the other side of the House in the first instance, but I think it will carry more weight because it came from Deputy Dillon.  I would urge upon the Government the advisability of making specific provision for the inclusion of some members of the Seanad to represent the interests of the people in the Six Counties.  It is regrettable that the power of nomination so far exercised in relation to the Seanad has never been exercised in relation to the people of the Six Counties. It is regrettable that in our present Seanad there are no representatives from Belfast or Derry or any part of the Six Counties.  That <Col N="2173" /> could have been done.  The powers of nomination exercised by the Taoiseach could have been exercised with that in view.  I would urge upon the Government, before coming back to this House for the next reading, to bring forward a proposal for the inclusion of some machinery aimed at securing in the new Seanad definite representation from the Six Counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had made it clear in introducing this Bill that it did no more than propose to give effect to the recommendations which were made by the joint committee set up in pursuance of the resolutions which were passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That, naturally and inevitably, ruled out of consideration the suggestion which was first made by Deputy Dillon and which has since been repeated by Deputy MacBride, that we should propose to go outside the Constitution of this State in relation to its effective area and find a new basis for constituting the Second House of the Oireachtas.  Quite clearly, a change of that sort is so momentous that it could not be decided upon either by a joint committee or by this or both Houses of the Oireachtas without submitting it to the people.  The committee was precluded from consideration of an amendment to the Constitution, and so is this House.  Therefore, as Deputy Dillon is an experienced Deputy and Deputy MacBride is an experienced lawyer with some knowledge of the Constitution, I find it hard to convince myself that either of these Deputies intended that proposal to be taken seriously.</P>

      <P>That is a matter that neither he nor I can determine.  It can only be determined when a Bill proposing to do that has been submitted to the Supreme Court.  For the moment, at any rate, I think that we can assume that, if there were not in present circumstances insuperable objections to the course which has been suggested, it would have been adopted long ago.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether it was intended by Deputy Dillon that I should take him very seriously.  The main purpose of his speech seemed to be to put before the House a proposal which he submitted to the committee and which the committee, having deliberated upon it, decided could not be adopted within their terms of reference.</P>
      <P>I do not know what point Deputy Dillon wants to make when he states that he was informed by the chairman of the committee that his proposal would be <i>ultra vires</i> the powers of the joint committee because, after all, Deputy Dillon knew what the terms of reference of the committee were, knew the limits which the Oireachtas had imposed upon its deliberations.  With full knowledge of these facts, he elected to become a member of the committee. He allowed himself to be chosen by the committee of selection to be a member of this joint committee.  He went in to sit on that committee with his eyes open and, I presume, with his mind alert and his faculties active.  If, therefore, he did put before the committee a proposal which it was incapacitated from considering, what purpose had he in view?  It could not have been to assist the committee in its deliberations.  It may have been to give to himself an excuse for withdrawing from the deliberations of the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These deliberations were long and arduous and those members of the Oireachtas who addressed themselves to the work of the committee had to sacrifice a great deal of their time, a great deal of their leisure and, perhaps, a great deal of their business interests. I am not suggesting that Deputy Dillon is a man who is not prepared to sacrifice <Col N="2175" /> a great deal of his own private interests in the public service But, in general, when he makes that sacrifice, he wishes to be requited by claiming more than his due share of the limelight.  Deputy Dillon is a grand performer before the footlights, but a very poor operator when it comes to the drudgery of committee.</P>

I think it is essential that this House and the public should be made aware of these facts.</P>

Now Deputy Dillon, not having attended the committee, not having withdrawn from the committee and having continued to sit nominally on the committee, is bound by the committee's report in exactly the same way as every other member of that committee is bound by it, whether he attended it or did not.</P>

They were able to come to agreement about the terms of all the recommendations and in particular&mdash;and it applies not only to Deputy Dillon with whom Deputy Mulcahy the Leader of the Opposition is apparently so much concerned&mdash;but it applies to other members of the Dáil as well&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Deputy quoted the statement of Deputy O'Higgins that the motion had been on the Order Paper for four years and that it was only after the last general election it had been reached.  Of course, the Deputy quite conveniently forgot that it had not been on the Order Paper for four years.  He forgot that there had been a general election in 1943 and that all motions that were not disposed of prior to the general election of 1943 disappeared and that they had to be moved afresh or reinstated on the Order Paper after the election of 1943.

      <P>I did hear the Deputy say before I withdrew for a few moments from the House that Deputy O'Higgins, in moving this motion in October, 1945, complained that it had been on the Order Paper for four years.  By repeating Deputy O'Higgins's statement and basing his arguments in support of the amendment on that, the Deputy has reinstated, as I have said, that particular point and his argument in this debate is a relevant consideration.  I was pointing out that in fact Deputy O'Higgins's observations in that regard were ill-founded by reason of the fact that there had been a general election in 1943 and that any motion which had appeared on the Order Paper prior to the date of the general election, fell immediately to the ground.</P>
      <P>By reason of the fact that there was a general election in 1944, those motions, which had been put down prior to that general election, likewise disappeared and, therefore, the motion which Deputy O'Higgins moved in October, 1945, was a motion, at that date, of comparatively recent origin.  It was a motion which was made of major importance by reason of a certain occurrence which directed the attention of the Government, members of the Oireachtas and members of the general public to the need for reforming the existing method of election to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>What was the argument which Deputy O'Higgins used in support of his motion?  He really used two arguments. He stated, first of all, as will be seen in column 125 of the Parliamentary Debates, volume 98&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion Deputy O'Higgins moved was to this effect:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil disapproves of <Col N="2180" /> the present method of electing the Seanad and calls for the appointment of a committee to make recommendations on the subject.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Out of that motion, and in consequence of the Taoiseach's acceptance of the principle that we should have a committee, there followed a motion under which the joint committee was set up and that motion read:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That it is expedient that a joint committee of the Dáil and Seanad be set up to consider and make recommendations on the method of regulating elections of those elected members of Seanad Éireann who are required by the Constitution to be elected from panels of candidates and the definition of the electorate for such elections.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That motion was agreed to in both Houses without a division.  In moving the motion which gave rise to it, Deputy O'Higgins said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Anyone... will see at a glance that the vocational side of the present Seanad is a mere sham and humbug&mdash;just a false dummy in the window.  We have a Seanad far more politically concentrated than is this Dáil itself.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He also suggested that corruption had grown so continuously that candidates who bribed had come to be regarded as &ldquo;business&rdquo; men.  It was on these two grounds that the House decided that we should have this committee, in order to devise machinery, first of all to prevent corruption&mdash;to make it more difficult, if we could not prevent it&mdash;and, secondly, to try to improve the vocational characteristics of the Seanad.  Those were the two purposes for which this joint committee was set up.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas first moved in this matter in November, 1945.  It is true that we are putting the legislative proposals to deal with these problems before the Oireachtas two years later, on the eve of a general election, but the recommendations of this committee, the recommendations which are embodied in this Bill, were submitted to Dáil Eireann on the 6th May of this year and were ordered by Dáil Eireann and Seanad Eireann to be printed on <Col N="2181" /> the 13th May of this year.  Every Deputy and Senator was furnished with a copy of the joint committee's report and every Deputy and Senator is bound by the obligations attaching to his position as a member of the Oireachtas to have made himself familiar with that report, so that we are not considering this legislation hurriedly or without having full cognisance of what it is proposed to do.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening speech, the proposals in particular governing nomination to the vocational sub-panels by nominating bodies will undoubtedly strengthen the vocational character of the Seanad.  We know that one of the greatest difficulties which we have had in regard to that matter has been the fact that we had a great number of nominating bodies each entitled to nominate at least two, some of them even entitled to nominate many more than two members to their respective panels, so that we had a superfluity of nominees, many of them very worthy persons in their own narrow sphere of vocational interest, but a great many of them, worthy and all as they were, completely obscure so far as the general body of the electorate was concerned and, therefore, people with very little chance under any system of election of securing election no matter how important the vocational interests they represented might be.</P>
    <P>The first problem the joint committee had to consider was, how persons could be got who would be broadly representative of particular vocations.  It is quite obvious we could not have a legislative chamber in which every trade and occupation in this country would have direct representation.  You could not have, for instance, a chamber in which you would have bootmakers, tailors, cotton spinners, ironmongers, or machinists with direct representation. You could not have a chamber in which every learned profession in this country, as well as every other profession, such as the pharmaceutical chemist and so on, would be represented. Besides, such a body would be enormous and its very size would prevent it from ever becoming a deliberative Assembly.  The first problem which this committee had to face, <Col N="2182" /> therefore, was how, from this plethora of candidates put forward from nominating bodies, there was to be got a compact and rational panel of such a convenient size as to allow the electorate to consider it rationally.  The panel would need not only to be of a convenient size but also to be sufficiently large to be broadly representative of the vocational interests to which they were to give representation, that is, industry and commerce on one side, agriculture on another, administrative interests on a third, labour on a fourth, and cultural and educational interests on a fifth.  That was the problem, to winnow or narrow down the wide range of nominations which, election after election, had been made by the nominating bodies, so as to have a ballot paper and panel which the electorate could consider intelligently and which would, at the same time, be broadly representative of the main vocational interests concerned. The measure, which the committee adopted in order to secure that, was to allow the nominating bodies for a particular panel to make proposals to a nomination committee, a nomination committee which would be representative of all the nominating bodies on the register for that panel.  Take the case of industry and commerce. All the nominating bodies on the panel &mdash;I think they are some 15 or 16&mdash;can submit proposals for nomination to a nomination committee, which is then constituted, to a nomination committee to which they send five designated persons who will be selected each year at the general meeting of the nominating bodies.  The nomination committee will consider all the names submitted to them and then select for actual nomination and submission to the electorate the appropriate number of names as set out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The first thing which that does is to solve the problem of securing vocational representation within the narrow limits of a deliberative Assembly.</P>
    <P>The next thing was to try to secure that the abuse made manifest in one instance subsequent to the last general election should not recur.  It is all very well to talk about corruption: it is all very well to impugn <Col N="2183" /> the honour of public men, but in this particular instance, however, we must remember that not merely the honour of the candidates for the Seanad in general was impugned, but the honour of every member of a county council or of the council of a county borough who had the power to select members of the quota of seven which went forward as component members of the electoral college.  It was the honour of every man who gave service to the people on these county councils and county borough councils which was being impugned, and, in so far as these people were representative of the voters and ratepayers who elected them, it was the honour of the voters and ratepayers of the counties and cities which was impugned.  In fact it was the honour of the Irish nation.</P>
    <P>I wish that those people, who talk about corruption in the light and easy way in which they do talk, would remember that it is not the few specific individuals who sit in the Dáil or the Seanad or even on the county councils who are being attacked and assailed, but the honour of the Irish nation.</P>
    <P>In every country and in every community we will get black sheep and it is not to be wondered at that we get them in public life in this country, as elsewhere, but, as Deputy Dillon said, our standards here are as high as anywhere else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Our country and our public life are a great deal freer from corruption than we may suspect it to be elsewhere, but we do not hear Englishmen, or any man with any regard for the reputation of his country, flinging charges of corruption broadcast without having a scintilla of solid evidence to go upon.  Because one instance emerged we are not justified in believing that everyone is corrupt.  It is just as when one murderer is discovered, we are not justified in believing that every man who lives in the same street as the murderer is a murderer, or a potential murderer.  So, because one instance was discovered, we are not justified in <Col N="2184" /> believing that corruption was general, or even that it occurred in more than one case.  But because of that case which occurred, we were bound to take what steps we could to ensure, and to secure, as far as we could secure it, that it would not occur again.  It was with full knowledge of that fact and with that aim, purpose and intention that the Oireachtas set up the Joint Committee.</P>
      <P>The first thing which became clear when they began to consider was this. The smaller the electorate the easier it is for dishonest and corrupt persons to try to seek out electors as dishonest and corrupt as themselves.  I think that the occurrence to which I have referred should make us all realise, that if we were going to continue to have an electorate in which the quota required to secure election would be as small as it has hitherto been, it would continue to be to that extent so much easier to be guilty of corrupt and improper practices.  It was decided, therefore, in order to make corruption more difficult, that the first thing to do was to enlarge the electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could not, however, proceed very far on that basis because we could not have the Second House drawing its mandate from exactly the same source as the Dáil.  At least from the point of view of the working of the Constitution and from the point of view of practical purposes it would be very undesirable that both Chambers of the Legislature should draw their mandates from exactly the same persons, when, in fact, the two Chambers have radically different functions.  If ever there was a conflict of powers or if a conflict arose between them as to what was right or proper for one or the other Assembly to do, and both were entitled to refer back to exactly the same source of authority, you might quite easily have the beginning of a civil war and the Constitution could be made completely unworkable.  Since this House represents the people of Ireland&mdash;and that is based on the adult manhood and womanhood of the country&mdash;we had to find some other basis of election for the selection of the Second House.  We wanted it at the same time, to be in one sense representative <Col N="2185" /> of the people and we decided that the best thing, perhaps, since it was impossible that they should be elected directly by the people, that they should be representative of the people at least one remove, so we decided that the best thing to do was to try to base the election of the Second House upon an electorate consisting of the elected representatives of the people as a whole.  We took as the basis for that electorate the members of the Oireachtas who had already been elected, ourselves immediately, the Oireachtas at a further remove, and with them proposed to incorporate in an electoral college the members of the county councils.  There were some practical considerations why we should confine the electorate to these three classes of persons&mdash; members of the Dáil, members of the Seanad and members of the county councils&mdash;because if we had gone outside the county councils and had taken the wider range of local authorities we could not have got any basis of election which would have been equitable as between one part of the country and one interest in the country and another.  Therefore we confined the enlarged electorate to these bodies. But the Electoral College will now number about 977 or 980 persons.</P>
    <P>In order, again, to ensure that the quota required for election would be sufficiently large to make an attempt at corruption difficult, and not only difficult but dangerous, we decided that there should be separate panels for each vocational interest and that every member of the electorate would have a separate vote in respect of each of these panels.  There has been a great deal of misunderstanding about this in the Press.  Some newspapers have said that under the new system of election the quota will be 20 for some of the panels.  In no case will the quota be less than 81 or 82.  In the case of the Cultural and Educational Panel, the quota to secure election will be 163 plus.  In the case of the Labour Panel, the quota will be 81 plus.  In the case of the Agricultural Panel, the quota will be 81 plus.  In the case of the Industrial Panel, the quota will be 98 plus.  In the case of the Administrative Panel, the quota will be 125 plus. <Col N="2186" /> These quotas are sufficiently large and the electorate is sufficiently widespread throughout this country to make it very difficult and certainly very dangerous for any person to go out and try to secure election to the Seanad by corrupt means.</P>
    <P>We have thus the dual purpose for which the committee was set up fulfilled. We have devised a machinery which will strengthen the vocational character of the Seanad and which, I believe, will make it very difficult and very dangerous for any person to endeavour to secure election to the Seanad by corrupt means.  What justification is there for deferring for a moment longer than is necessary putting this new system of election into operation?  We know that one instance of corruption, of improper conduct, occurred in connection with the last Seanad election.  The attempt to buy votes was not successful, but it was tried.  Do all those Deputies who have been posing here as the protectors of honesty in public life want the next Seanad election to be conducted upon the same basis as the last Seanad election, knowing now full well what the dangers associated with that system are?  They have been telling us that they want to purge, to clear up, public life.  That is what we have been told by every Party in opposition.  They are pretending that there is a mass of corruption here to be cleaned out.  Yet, when the Government comes along with proposals that are designed to prevent corruption and to make any attempt at it more dangerous and more difficult, these are the very people who oppose it.  I should have thought that in view of the professions made when Deputy Dr. O'Higgins moved his motion in 1945, in view of the professions which they made when the Taoiseach moved his motion to which the House agreed in November, 1945, these proposals would have had an unopposed passage through this House.</P>
    <P>Of course, I do not believe Deputy Mulcahy's amendment is meant seriously.  I have been told that one of the reasons why it has been put down is that, if this Bill goes through, the character of the next Seanad may <Col N="2187" /> be changed: that it will become so much more strongly vocational that a number of old political friends of his may find themselves in the wilderness. Deputy Dr. O'Higgins has professed to condemn the present Seanad because it is too political.  If that is the case why does he not welcome this Bill and these proposals which will make the Seanad definitely less political and definitely more vocational? That is what they have been asking for.  Yet when we propose to give it to them it is the very thing they want the House to reject.  I suggest that we ought to accept this Bill.  It is based upon the recommendations of a joint committee.  Many members of the Seanad and of the Dáil attended that committee.  They gave a great deal of consideration and a great deal of their time to the analysis of this problem and to securing a remedy against the evil which became manifest last year.  I do not think those who asked that the joint committee should be set up, I do not think any member who was placed by the Committee of Selection upon that committee, I do not think, in fact, that any person who is concerned to improve the institutions of our country will defer or is justified in asking the Dáil to defer the enactment of this measure one day longer than is necessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Deputy for having raised that point and with the permission of the Chair I would like to deal with it.  Deputy MacBride said there is no specific provision in this Bill to make corruption a penal offence.  It is not necessary to put it in this Bill because there is a special enactment which deals with the prevention of electoral abuses.  The Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, passed in 1923, makes bribery, or an attempt at bribery, or the receiving of bribes a penal offence subject to very severe punishment.  I may say in that connection, it is not always easy.  A mere enactment of a law will not prevent the breaking of that law.  All we can strive to do is to make it more difficult to break the law and inflict condign punishment when the law is broken.  The Act of 1923 does inflict condign punishment.  We are going to make it less easy and more difficult to infringe the law or the provisions of that Act by the proposals which are embodied in this Bill.</P>

Will the Minister think over that?</P>

      <P>I submit that it is futile to ask a Parliament that is under sentence of dissolution to receive a Bill of this nature on Monday last and to expect it, particularly after the elaborate description of the details given by the Minister and the elaborate outline of the amendments, constitutional and otherwise, that he is to make in it, to deal with this matter on Wednesday next.

I made the point that it is absurd that an Oireachtas that is under sentence of dissolution should radically change the whole position with regard to one of the Houses.  The Government should take the responsibility for what they are doing.  They are patching up a Seanad which is their own creation and which was built to their specification. They are doing that in a way which will in no way improve it so far as I can see, and doing it under circumstances <Col N="2191" /> in which neither House could give it any consideration of any kind, or indeed the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  It has been clear for a long time that the law relating to merchant shipping contained in the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 and some 20 other related enactments was only partially adaptable to the circumstances of this country.  The main Act, which is an Imperial statute in the widest sense, was intended to cater for the merchant shipping position of all parts of the British Empire in 1894 and it does not fit in with the concept of an independent Irish service.  There are, however, many problems involved in the revision of the merchant shipping code.  It is a very big task.  A beginning has been made, but some considerable time must elapse before a comprehensive measure can be introduced.  I think it is desirable that we should have a comprehensive measure and I hope that the new Dáil will have such a Bill before it during its life-time.  The Bill which I am introducing is an interim measure designed to deal with certain matters which cannot conveniently be held over pending the completion and introduction of a comprehensive Bill.  In fact, Sections 2 to 4 and 8 to 10, inclusive, of this Bill are required to give permanent effect to the provisions of certain Orders which were made under the Emergency Powers Act and which it is desired to continue in permanent form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to 1939, the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Acts required Irish ships to hoist the British red ensign. A Bill which was designed to remedy that anomaly was ready for introduction at the outbreak of the war, but the need for a distinctive Irish flag for our merchant fleet then became a matter of such urgency that, in September, 1939, shortly after the war began, the Government made an Order requiring every Irish ship, other than a fishing boat, to hoist the national tricolour on entering or leaving a port outside the State and, in the case of a vessel of 50 tons gross, or upwards, on entering or leaving any home port.  The hoisting of any other national colours <Col N="2193" /> on an Irish ship was prohibited.  These provisions, now in force under Emergency Powers Orders, are incorporated in Sections 2 and 3 of the Bill, so as to make them permanent legislation.</P>
    <P>It is the practice in other countries for yacht clubs to have a distinctive club flag instead of the merchant flag and power is being taken in the Bill to authorise the use by members of such clubs of a variation of the national flag.  Before deciding that the tricolour should be the flag for the merchant fleet, the Government considered the practice prevailing in other countries. In some countries, including Great Britain, there is a distinctive flag for the merchant fleet.  In other countries such as the United States, France and Portugal the national colours are used. The Government thought it best to prescribe the tricolour as the Irish merchant flag.  The tricolour is now flown on Irish ships and has become well-known in many ports throughout the world.</P>
    <P>During the emergency, power was taken by an Order under the Emergency Powers Act to enable a foreign ship taken on charter by an approved Irish charterer to be registered as an Irish ship.  It is proposed to continue that power so that a ship taken on charter may be registered temporarily as an Irish ship, thus becoming entitled to the protection of the Irish flag. Registration as an Irish ship is an entitlement to the protection of the Irish flag.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill empowers the Minister for Industry and Commerce at his discretion to refuse registration to any ship or any class of ships.  It is not anticipated that this power will be frequently invoked but occasion may arise on which it would be advisable to refuse registration&mdash;for instance if a ship owner is seeking Irish registration merely as a means of evading less favourable conditions elsewhere or if there are grounds for suspecting that an owner might use the Irish flag as a cover for illegal or undesirable activities.</P>
    <P>In 1939 it also became necessary to control the transfer of registry and the sale or mortgage of Irish ships.  In practice, licences were refused only in <Col N="2194" /> cases where it was proposed to sell or mortgage a ship to a person outside the State.  Licences are not at present being granted where it is proposed to sell or mortgage a ship outside the State, except where the vessel concerned is a small pleasure craft or an obsolete ship which the owners have replaced by a more modern vessel. Restrictions of a similar nature are at present enforced in other countries. Irish owners of vessels which are registered at ports outside this State are still unable to effect the transfer of registry to this country.  When the tonnage position improves, I hope these restrictions can be materially eased. On that account, Sections 9 and 10 are framed so as to allow these matters to be dealt with by regulations made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce from time to time.</P>
    <P>Foreign going ships are required by law to carry masters and navigating and engineer officers with appropriate certificates of competency.  Up to the present, such certificates are not being issued here.  The Government have decided to set up an independent system of examination and to issue Irish certificates of competency as soon as circumstances permit.  For some years to come, however, most of the officers of Irish ships will be men who have already obtained their certificates as a result of examinations conducted by other States.  Section 7 of the Bill provides that the Government may recognise for service on Irish ships, certificates of competency issued by other Governments where the Minister for Industry and Commerce is satisfied that they represent adequate qualifications.  When Irish certificates are issued it is hoped that arrangements can be made with other countries for the recognition of certificates of competency on a reciprocal basis.</P>
    <P>The Merchant Shipping Acts require the master of a foreign going ship or a home trade ship over a certain tonnage to enter into agreement with members of their crew in an approved form.  It became a common practice to include in such agreements a clause permitting the master to dispense with <Col N="2195" /> the services of a member of the crew at a home port without notice.  A member of the crew on his part could give 24 hours' notice.  In a recent High Court case, it was held that this clause in agreements was void as it purported to deprive the seaman of his right to compensation if dismissed within a month.  The Merchant Shipping Act provides that no agreement may operate to deprive a seaman of any remedy for the recovery of wages to which he would be entitled in the absence of the agreement.  I understand that both the ship owners and the Seamen's Trade Union favour a clause in agreements permitting 24 hours' notice on either side.  On the masters' side this is provided for in Section 5 of the Bill.  It is not necessary to have a similar provision on the workers' side as such a provision in the agreement in respect of a seaman is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>From time to time despite the best efforts of the representatives of both the shipping owners and the men, the sailing of a ship will be delayed by the failure of one or two members of the crew to join before the time fixed for sailing.  With the shortage of shipping such delays should be avoided, quite apart from the additional expense to which ship owners are put.  The delays may be protracted if a tide is missed. The penalty for absence without leave is forfeiture of a sum not exceeding two days' pay from a seaman's wages. A seaman who fails to join his ship may have no wages due to him and he may escape penalty altogether.  The proposal in this Bill is to change the existing provision to a fine not exceeding £10.</P>
    <P>The Merchant Shipping Acts require safety precautions to be taken in the case of the larger type of passenger vessel.  Small boats plying for hire between the mainland and islands off the coast in coastal waters and in rivers and lakes have been exempt from control except in a few cases where by-laws have been made by local authorities who have no expert staff to enforce them.  It is proposed in Section 11 that small craft carrying passengers <Col N="2196" /> for reward be obliged to comply with minimum safety requirements.  The Government took the decision to legislate in this matter following a disaster off the west coast of Ireland.</P>
    <P>This country was represented by a delegation at the Maritime Session of the International Labour Office held last year in Seattle.  The report of the Government members of the delegation and the text of the instruments which were adopted there were presented to the Oireachtas last June. The main purpose of the conference was to secure agreement on certain standards in respect of the conditions for seafarers.  The conditions for seamen on Irish ships are in most respects better than the agreed minimum international standards.  There have been consultations between my Department and representatives of shipowners and seamen's trade unions in regard to the standards agreed upon and I hope that Ireland will be one of the first countries to ratify most of the conventions which were adopted at that conference.  One of the reasons why I am anxious to get this Bill passed this Session is to enable us to be one of the first States to ratify some of these conventions.</P>
    <P>Power is given under Section 12 to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make regulations for promoting the welfare of seamen on Irish ships or at Irish ports.  This provision will enable effect to be given to the conventions adopted at the International Labour Office conference.  The conventions adopted at that conference are listed in the First Schedule of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill deals with bills of lading.  Bills of lading are documents given by shipowners or charterers to consignors acknowledging the receipt of goods and setting out the terms upon which they are to be shipped and delivered.  An International Maritime Conference, held in Brussels, in 1922, agreed on certain standard rules for inclusion in bills of lading with a view to the enactment of uniform legislation by all maritime countries.  Such legislation has been passed by many important maritime countries, including the United States <Col N="2197" /> of America, Britain, France, Canada and Australia.  The development of an Irish mercantile marine renders it desirable for this country to fall into line, and provision is being made in the Bill for the adoption of the uniform rules relating to bills of lading which are set out in the Second Schedule of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The rules define the responsibilities and liabilities, as well as the rights and immunities, of sea carriers and will, if this Bill is enacted, become part of all contracts for the carriage of goods by sea evidenced by bills of lading issued in this country.</P>
    <P>Parties to whom bills of lading are transferred for value in the course of business will be assured that they impose legal irreducible obligations on shipowners.  The bills will, therefore, become a better security and in that way international commerce will be facilitated.  In the absence of these provisions, shipowners are free to limit their liabilities by special conditions in the bill of lading and shippers and endorsees of bills of lading may find that they have no legal remedy in the event of loss or damage to the goods.</P>
    <P>Bills of lading are not ordinarily used in the coastal trade, which is accordingly excluded from the scope of these provisions.  Trade with Britain is also excluded, as a reciprocal provision is contained in the British Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1924, in regard to trade with this country.</P>
    <P>These are the provisions of the Bill. They relate to a number of matters affecting merchant shipping, all of which it is desirable to enact in legislation in advance of the preparation, introduction and enactment of a comprehensive Merchant Shipping Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>With the principle that we should have our own merchant shipping code, I think all Deputies will be in complete agreement.  The idea of a Merchant Shipping Act of our own originated at a very early stage in the history of this State and, during the Imperial Conference, discussions proceeded in an endeavour to square up our notions of an independent merchant <Col N="2198" /> shipping code with the system that existed under the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894.</P>
      <P>The only doubt I have about this Bill, which we have no objection to give to the Government, is as to whether it will not result in practice in a further postponement of a comprehensive Merchant Shipping Bill.  We all know the practice of Departments. It has been the aim for many years to have a Merchant Shipping Act.  There are hundreds of sections in the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 and some amending statutes.  It is a most complicated code, not merely complicated in law, but complicated by reason of the interaction between the ideas in connection with principles that should guide matters relating to loading, load lines and safety provisions for preventing collisions at sea, and a host of other matters and difficulties in connection with reconciling the views of various nations in connection with their merchant fleets.</P>
      <P>If this Bill is passed&mdash;and we have no objection to it&mdash;I fear it will lead to putting on the long finger the enactment of a comprehensive merchant shipping code.  It will give the breathing space necessary and it is to be hoped, whatever Minister for Industry and Commerce will be in existence after Christmas, he will tackle that problem energetically and will also take account of the fact that we in this country, whatever our constitutional status may be, have certain associations with the other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and while we are all in agreement that there ought to be a Merchant Shipping Act, nevertheless that ought to be so framed as to be in principle and practice as far as possible in accord with the views that have been found to be desirable in practice and from experience in connection with the principles embodied in the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill has a two-fold object, namely:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  to increase to £2 the annual fee paid to the Incorporated Law Society by every solicitor on the issue to him of a practising certificate, and</P>
      <P>(2)  to provide for the repeal of the provision of the Solicitors Amendment Act of 1923 under which the admission of English and Scottish solicitors to practise here is very much facilitated.</P>
      <P>Under the Solicitors (Ireland) Act, 1898, every practising solicitor has to take out in January of every year a certificate which is called a practising certificate.  This is a certificate to the just = "right" li = "1" ri = "2"&gt;&mdash;effect that his name is for the time being on the Roll of Solicitors which is kept by the secretary of the Incorporated Law Society in his capacity as registrar under the Act.  The fee payable originally under the Act of 1898 on the issue of a practising certificate was 5/-.  This was increased to £1 by an amending Act passed in 1923.  It is now proposed to increase the fee to £2.  This is being done solely at the instance of the Incorporated Law Society, the council of which some time ago requested that legislation should be promoted to enable the increased fee to be charged next January when the practising certificates of all solicitors come up for renewal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second provision of the Bill, namely, the repeal of paragraph (b) of Section 1 of the Amending Act of 1923, has also been expressly requested by the Incorporated Law Society.  Under <Col N="2202" /> the provision of the 1923 Act an English or Scottish solicitor, with a minimum of three years' practice in his own country, is entitled to be admitted a solicitor here without service or examination upon complying with the regulations and paying the fees for the time being prescribed by the Incorporated Law Society.  It is understood that the clause in the 1923 Act was enacted on the prospect of reciprocal facilities in favour of our solicitors being forthcoming from the other side.  In practice, such reciprocity has never materialised and it might be said that the repeal of the 1923 Act provision is long overdue.  It is relevant to recall in this connection that our Statute Law has diverged considerably from British Statute Law in the course of the last 25 years, so that whatever case there may have been in 1923 for facilitating the admission to practise here of solicitors who had qualified in England or Scotland, that case cannot certainly be made now and, quite apart from any other considerations, it is reasonable to suggest that an English or Scottish solicitor could not, in reason, expect to be admitted to practise here without being required to furnish some evidence of up-to-date knowledge and acquaintance with Irish law and practice.</P>
    <P>Since the Bill was published, it has come to notice that there is at least one case pending in which a solicitor who had qualified in England had taken the steps prescribed in the Incorporated Law Society's Regulations to secure admission here under the provision of the 1923 Act.  It will probably be agreed that the present Bill, if enacted, should not be allowed to prejudice such a case and it is proposed, accordingly, to introduce an amendment on the Committee Stage which will provide for the insertion of a suitably framed saving clause.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This Bill deals with arrangements to print and publish statutory instruments, otherwise known as statutory rules and Orders and it will replace the Rules Publication Act, 1893.  Successive law officers have advised that the Act of 1893, although technically continued in force by the Constitution, was not fully adapted for application in this State and that it has therefore been merely of imperfect obligation. While efforts have been made to secure adherence to the procedure laid down in the Act of 1893, the results have not been satisfactory or uniform in that some statutory Orders have been published outside the official, numbered series, and on the other hand instruments of relatively minor importance have been included.</P>
      <P>The existing arrangements have been the subject of discussion in both Houses of the Oireachtas and have been adversely commented on in the courts.  In order to end the unsatisfactory position the Statutory Instruments Bill has been prepared in consultation with the various Departments. It proposes to establish a simple, uniform and reasonably flexible procedure by ensuring that when statutory instruments are made, notices to that effect will be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and the instruments themselves printed and published in the official, numbered series and made readily available to the public.</P>

    <P>Having regard to the volume and variety of statutory instruments, it is not proposed to insist on the publication of all in the official series.  Provision is accordingly being made empowering the Attorney-General to exempt from inclusion in the official, numbered series those statutory instruments which because of their merely local or personal application, temporary operation or limited effect, or for any other sufficient reason, should not be published in the official series. To avoid multiplicity of references by the rule-making authorities, the Attorney-General <Col N="2204" /> is further empowered to exempt not merely individual instruments but classes of instruments.  An example of &ldquo;any other reason&rdquo; which might weigh with the Attorney-General in deciding on exemption would be a statutory instrument of a confidential nature, such as some of the Defence Force regulations, or an instrument which received adequate alternative publicity, e.g., the numerous regulations issued by the Civil Service Commission regarding competitions for vacancies in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Exemption from the printing and publishing arrangements set out in Section 3 (1) of the Bill does not mean that the exempted instruments will not receive adequate publicity.  The manner and form of such publicity may be left to the rule-making authority. Sub-section (5) of Section 3 of the Bill clearly recognises this by stating that&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;nothing in this section shall be construed as restricting the printing and publication of any statutory instrument which is not a statutory instrument to which this Act primarily applies&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (2) of the Bill provides that the decision of the Attorney-General will be final in determining whether the Bill when enacted applies to a particular statutory instrument.  This is a change from the procedure under the Rules Publication Act, 1893, which provides that such questions shall be decided by the British Treasury with the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker of the House of Commons.</P>
    <P>In view of the possibility that some statutory instruments to which the Bill will apply may inadvertently be omitted from publication in the prescribed series or may be so published but without an official number, provision is made in Sections 3 (2) and 4 (2) that the validity of any such instrument will not be affected by such an omission.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in Section 3 (3) of the Bill to ensure that contravention of a statutory instrument will not be punishable as a criminal offence unless adequate publicity has been given to the instrument when made, and a defendant charged with contravening <Col N="2205" /> a statutory instrument is to be acquitted unless it is shown that reasonable steps were taken before the date of the alleged offence to bring the purport of the instrument either to the notice of the public as a whole or to the notice of persons likely to be affected.</P>
    <P>While there is no definite legislative sanction at present for the publication of statutory instruments it should not be inferred that appropriate measures are not taken to give them adequate publicity.  All Departments are instructed that every statutory instrument affecting the public should be available to members of the public seeking it, as soon as it comes into operation.  To enable this to be done every such Order is published in neostyle form whenever it is not possible to have it printed in time.  In addition, notices of the making of such Orders are published in the Press and also announced over the radio when necessary.</P>
    <P>It is desirable, however, that there should be legislative sanction for the publication arrangements and that there should be some determining authority clearly prescribed by law&mdash; the Attorney-General as provided in the present Bill&mdash;to decide which statutory instruments should or should not be included in the official series and published in the manner set out in Section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Poultry Hatcheries Bill, 1947&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  In recent years there has been an increasing tendency under which the older system of hatching eggs on the farm, either by natural means or in incubators, is being replaced by the distribution of day-old chicks from large-scale commercial hatcheries. Some 24 large commercial hatcheries are already in operation in different parts of the country and it is understood that the establishment of several <Col N="2206" /> additional such hatcheries in the near future is contemplated.  In addition a considerable number of poultry-keepers throughout the country who have facilities for artificial incubation engage in the sale of day-old chicks.</P>
      <P>While the establishment of commercial hatcheries is considered to be a very desirable development and has many advantages as compared with the hatching of eggs on the farm, there is no doubt that the danger of outbreaks of disease on a large scale in poultry flocks will increase correspondingly as hatcheries increase in size and number. The existing commercial hatcheries are subject to no control whatsoever as regards the sources from which eggs are obtained or the conditions under which incubation is carried out and chicks are distributed.  The same position obtains with regard to other distributors of chicks, except where these are holders of poultry stations under my Department's Poultry Stations Scheme.  Moreover, in many cases the hatchery owner or poultry-keeper exercises no discrimination in the selection of eggs for incubation, with the result that the chicks distributed are of very doubtful quality.</P>
      <P>The Committee of Inquiry on Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy recommended that distributors of hatching eggs and day-old chicks should be licensed under conditions to be determined by the Department of Agriculture and that holders of hatchery licences should be prohibited from in cubating eggs other than those derived from flocks certified to be blood-tested and free from disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed legislation to provide for the licensing of hatcheries, as outlined in the Poultry Hatcheries Bill, has the twofold object of ensuring (1) that the eggs used for hatching in hatcheries are derived from flocks of suitable type and quality which are free from disease, and (2) that the production and distribution of chicks by hatcheries are carried out under conditions calculated to reduce to a minimum the danger of spreading disease.  It is not feasible at this stage to extend the scope of the Bill so as to provide that other distributors of day-old chicks and distributors of <Col N="2207" /> hatching eggs, should be licensed, but such a development can be considered at some suitable time in the future when the present Bill dealing with the licensing of hatcheries is in full operation.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that when enacted it shall come into operation at such times as may be fixed by Order of the Minister for Agriculture.  The present intention is that the Act will be brought into operation in two stages, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Stage 1.  This will include the operation of Parts I, II, IV and Sections 15 to 18 in Part III of the Act.</P>
    <P>Stage 2.  This will involve bringing into operation Sections 12 to 14 in Part III of the Act whereupon Sections 15 to 18 will cease to operate.</P>
    <P>Stage 1 will be taken as soon as practicable after the enactment of the Bill. At this stage poultry hatcheries, other than those classes that may be exempted, will be prohibited from operating except under licence to be issued each year subject to such conditions as the Minister for Agriculture may think proper.  Provision is made in the Bill for the Minister to make regulations exempting from the licensing requirements hatcheries of certain classes to be defined in such regulations; for example, hatcheries which do not engage in the production of chicks for sale or of which the hatching capacity is less than a specified minimum.  Egg supplies for a licensed hatchery will have to be obtained from farms the owners of which have been granted &ldquo;provisional permits&rdquo; each year to supply eggs to licensed hatcheries.</P>
    <P>This &ldquo;provisional permit&rdquo; arrangement, which is intended to be of a temporary nature, was devised to get over the difficulty arising from the fact that the hatcheries at present in operation are getting hatching eggs from many farms that are not of the standard that will ultimately be required for &ldquo;approved egg supply farms&rdquo;.  Therefore, in order not to disorganise the working of existing hatcheries, it will be necessary for some time to grant &ldquo;provisional permits&rdquo; to many of these farms and so give them the opportunity to qualify ultimately as &ldquo;approved&rdquo;<Col N="2208" /> farms.  The provisional permit period will also afford an opportunity of determining the reliability and honesty of the owners of existing hatching-egg supply farms.</P>
    <P>When Stage 2 is reached after Stage 1 has been developed for some years, licensed hatcheries will not be allowed to purchase eggs for hatching from any farm which is not &ldquo;approved&rdquo; each year as an egg supply farm.  At this point the system of granting provisional permits will cease.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the Minister for Agriculture may authorise persons to be inspectors for the purposes of the Act.  Apart from a number of inspectors who will have to be appointed on the central staff of the Department of Agriculture, it is intended, when the Bill is enacted, to ask the county committees of agriculture to signify their agreement to having their poultry instructors authorised to be inspectors for the purposes of the Act.  It is anticipated the committees of agriculture will, in general, be willing to agree to this course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to this particular measure.  As a matter of fact we fully appreciate the importance of having some control over the eggs that are used in our large hatcheries.  Up to this there has been no control whatever over the proprietors of these hatcheries who have been buying eggs all over the country.  These proprietors offer attractive prices because they have to offer such prices and that leads to abuses.  The supplier is tempted to buy eggs outside his own farm.  He buys eggs from farms where there has been no blood test and because of that the incidence of B.W.D., is very, very high.  The mortality subsequently in the young chicks is proportionately high.  Anybody who has any experience or knowledge of the poultry industry appreciates how important it is to have blood testing carried out and to ensure freedom from eggs produced by stock which have not been blood-tested.  For that reason I welcome the control proposed under this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister has not given us more information about the <Col N="2209" /> operation of such hatcheries.  From my experience of the county committee of agriculture I know that difficulty has arisen in controlling the eggs which went out from our stations into the big hatcheries.  The bulk of the production left the county and last year we were left short of essential stock.  In fact there was no guarantee that when our subsidised eggs were hatched out and the day-old chicks were ready they would be retained in the county.  We had no guarantee that would happen. It did not happen as a matter of fact and we had to take special measures to ensure that the stock would be retained for our own people and would not leave the county.</P>
    <P>Reading the Bill I can appreciate the difficulties so far as control is concerned, but there is no indication given as to how the control will operate. Neither did I hear from the Minister anything as to the operation of the Bill to prevent one county being robbed at the expense of another in regard to day-old chicks.  He has given no information as to what his intentions are regarding the owner of the small incubator with a capacity of 100 to 150 eggs.  As a matter of fact the smaller ones are controlled at present and blood testing is carried out by the county instructresses.  We are quite safe in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think all the small ones are controlled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Not all of them, but the ones that are stations at present under the committee of agriculture are all controlled.  I merely want to point out that if people bought all their eggs from such stations they would have a guarantee of freedom from the incidence of disease.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that it is the type of station we now have which should be enlarged for the purpose of supplying the bigger hatcheries. How are they to be subsidised?  If they are to be subsidised by the county committee the possibility is that the committee may find itself in the position of putting up money to supply day-old chicks to some other county. Naturally any county committee would be reluctant to do that.  When the <Col N="2210" /> Minister is replying perhaps he will give us some further information on that point.  I can understand why the provisional permits are necessary for the purpose of implementing the scheme in the transition stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us that there are 24 large hatcheries at present and that several more will be in operation in the near future.  One thing that strikes me, so far as the poultry industry is concerned, is that we will be up against fairly keen competition from Denmark and other countries if we plan to compete under normal conditions and in normal export markets.  It is essential that we should have day-old chicks at the lowest possible price and for that reason I am not keen on bringing in commercial interests who will be anxious to net a profit.  The industry can scarcely afford a big margin of profit, particularly in the case of the smallholder, whose production is limited.  If these day-old chicks cost too much it will further reduce the small margin that accrues to them.  Cooperative societies could be very beneficial in this respect.  If a member of a co-operative society does not get a margin on the supply of day-old chicks he will get it in some other way through a dividend from his society.  I think that the supply of chicks through cooperative societies would be the ideal solution.  Where there are no co-operative societies the work could be undertaken by the county committees.  It might be said that that is somewhat socialistic but the fundamental aim as far as the poultry industry is concerned is to do all in our power to improve that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty at the moment is that on the average small holding there is only an oil incubator available and the housewife has to keep a constant watch on it.  It is not a very efficient heating apparatus.  She may give it a lot of care for three weeks and then one night when she is in bed the lamp goes on fire and all her efforts are wasted.  That is very disappointing. The modern idea of encouraging people to take the day-old chicks is the ideal one and if they can be supplied at a reasonable price the industry will be well on the way to recovery.  My advice to the Minister <Col N="2211" /> is to go slow before encouraging the commercial interests to come into this service.  Admittedly the large proprietors are very expert in the business but the margin of profit might be more than the industry can afford to bear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will be welcomed by all those who are interested in poultry production.  If we have purebred stock we will definitely have increased production.  Now that we are gradually moving towards modern methods and more efficient lines of production the control of hatcheries will no doubt have a beneficial effect on the poultry trade in general.  The controlling of eggs, seeing that the proper type of eggs is used for incubators, is something that is definitely wanted, because the more or less mongrel breeds that can be so easily crossed in hatcheries have a bad effect on egg production.</P>
      <P>Everybody who understands poultry realises that the purer the breeds are the better the production.  But if large hatcheries are encouraged there may be a danger of squeezing out the smaller hatchery or the average housewife or farmer's wife who has a small incubator.  There should always be room for those who wish to keep a small incubator to produce chicks and sell them to anybody who wishes to buy them.  I am afraid that the Department may find it hard to keep effective control over all types of incubators.  If, however, they decide to exercise a real control over large hatcheries, those commercial concerns may demand that the small hatcheries be controlled as well, and that may result in the small hatcheries being squeezed out of production. Of course, in poultry production you will always have some persons who believe in the old system, but there is no doubt that, if you are to increase production, the incubator is definitely the best and the quickest system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my locality there is a great inclination to go in for the ordinary paraffin incubator.  No matter how progressive we are, we must realise that it will be years and years before we will be able to provide these people with <Col N="2212" /> any other type of incubator than the paraffin one.  I should like very much if control could be exercised in such a way that chicks produced for sale in these small hatcheries and incubators would be of pure breed.  We know that the average farmer's wife is not too particular as to the type of eggs which are put in the incubator and the chicks may be sold as pure Minorcas, Wyandottes and Rhode Island Reds and no one will know what type they are.</P>
    <P>My own objection to this Bill is in connection with the appointment of inspectors to look after these hatcheries. Encouragement by way of grants to smallholders or small farmers to keep incubators and produce day-old chicks would perhaps be as good a means of increasing poultry production as helping out the large hatcheries, while at the same time making sure that the eggs used even in the smallest hatcheries would be of good tested quality and would not produce a mongrel stock.  I should be glad to see the scheme getting as much encouragement as possible, because we are now coming into the year 1948 and the system of 40 or 50 years ago, if not altogether abolished, must definitely take second place.  I would be very pleased if some system of grants were introduced for smallholders who wish to carry on a system of hatching chicks for the purpose of sale and if the inspectors working under the committees of agriculture would see that the eggs which are to be hatched out came from a purebred stock so that there would not be any cross strains.</P>

      <P>I have not given any attention to the point made by Deputy Hughes as to eggs passing from one county to another.  That, I think, could be dealt with in the poultry station scheme.  Anyhow, I suppose it cuts both ways.  We can at least examine the matter.  All I can say is that there must be a movement both ways.</P>

      <P>I think it is rather fortunate that this measure is introduced now because, when enacted, it will coincide with what is contemplated under the agreement recently made between the British Government and ourselves regarding eggs and the preparation of a scheme of development which is provided for in that agreement.  If we want to encourage and expand this industry to meet the demands of the future, I agree with Deputy Hughes that these chicks should be made available. As to what he describes as the commercial hatcheries, some of these, perhaps, are not desirable; some of them may not, perhaps, be too well looked after and there may be the danger to which he referred.  I will examine all the aspects of that matter. I do not know that there is any serious objection to allowing the commercial hatcheries to continue.  As I say, I agree that the chicks should be made available at a reasonable price, however that is to be done.  In the preparation of this scheme which is contemplated, it is well that we should have a proposal such as this.  It is a good foundation on which to build our scheme and we should be able to take long strides forward to put this industry on a sounder foundation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hughes has given notice that he intends to raise the subject matter of Question No. 1 on the Order Paper of 13th November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it perfectly clear that I am 100 per cent. with the Minister if his aim is to ensure the efficient handling of meat from the time it leaves the farm until it reaches the consumer, and minimum cost.  If that is his aim, I am with him 100 per cent. But, if his intention is to compel those engaged in the business to try to buy stuff below the present market value, then I am critical of what he is doing. I have no personal experience of the retail trade here.  Neither have I gone into close calculations of a fair margin. I do not claim to be competent to do that because I would not be able to value the offal, skin and so on.  I want to point out to the Minister that the particular fancy cut that the City of Dublin is interested in is obtained from a medium weight heifer of about nine cwts. and that if he tries to batten down the price of that below the export level, he will compel butchers to kill lower grade cattle.  At the present time I think that is almost in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister must remember, when he first introduced this Order, we had no outlet for cattle of that type because they were graded very low in Great Britain for immediate slaughter. But, since that time, the price has gone up by 5d. a lb. dead and it means they will realise 7/10 a cwt. live weight. That is still 9/- below the British price for animals from Northern Ireland and Great Britain, that make a price of 96/10.  The particular animals supplied to the City of Dublin are, in my opinion, animals that would definitely qualify for the quality grade and that would mean a subsidy of 2/6, bringing the price up to 90/4.  If you add the cost of shipping to that, which is about 50/-, the Minister must begin to realise that the competition for export purposes will deny the butchers or victuallers an opportunity of buying first-grade animals for the Dublin trade.  I have not discussed the matter with anyone in the trade.  I have not had <Col N="2216" /> an opportunity and I am expressing my personal views.</P>
    <P>So far as a reduction in price to the primary producer is concerned, the Minister must bear in mind that the producer is still getting, as a result of the London talks, 9/- under the price that is paid to the Northern Ireland or British producer, both of whom have the further advantage of a subsidy of £6 for rearing the calf, so that there is a considerable margin as between our producers and Northern Ireland and British producers.  I do not think the Minister is wise in suggesting that the people in the trade should buy cattle below the market level.  Our people are definitely entitled to get for their cattle the level that beef is realising to-day.  I have given figures to show that it is substantially below the price realised in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The Minister is making this Order at a time when country people are prepared for winter feeding.  People whose land is not suitable for the carrying of cattle up to the time winter feeding comes into operation&mdash;mainly tillage land I am thinking of&mdash;in order to produce farmyard manure, must have stock to be in-fed and they buy their stock at this time of the year, to go into stall. If the Minister fixes a price that will batten down or copper-fasten the price those animals will realise coming out of stall, he will certainly injure in-feeding which should be encouraged if you believe in a tillage policy.  In any case, all must agree that the man who produces an animal during the winter and spring months spends substantial sums on feeding stuffs in order to produce beef at that period, and that beef will cost him far more than the cost to the man who sits back and looks at the animal growing fat on grass.  I am not casting any reflection on grass-produced beef but I am pointing this out as something that the Minister should take cognisance of.  When the Minister put this price into operation, he ignored grade.  He indicated to me that it would be difficult to operate different maximum prices because it means an elaborate system of grading.</P>
    <P>I have a further grouse and an even greater one about sheep prices.  The Minister introduced his Order at a <Col N="2217" /> time when most feeders have prepared for winter feeding.  Again, Deputy Allen can give him information on this matter.  On farms where roots and grain crops are produced and where oats is fed, they buy the sheep in store condition and they have bought it at a very high premium this year in store condition&mdash;substantially higher than any other year.</P>
    <P>Before the Minister made this Order, people who went in for winter feeding had bought in stocks at premium prices and he is not allowing them a fair margin under the fixed prices in operation at the present time.  The Minister has seen the reactions of his Order in the fact that sheep are not coming on the Dublin market at present because these people are not prepared to sell at a loss.  The margin accruing to the winter feeder has always been very narrow.  He must produce roots to feed the sheep and occasionally give them oats and that is too costly.  The Minister ignored the fact that during last summer sheep and lambs were commanding very high prices, even though the cost of feeding then was not so high, and he brought this Order into operation at a time which is going to strike the man who is prepared to produce mutton during the severest period of the year.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect to which I should like to direct the attention of the Minister.  There has been in operation in the City of Dublin, as well as throughout the country, a system by which victuallers have tried to stabilise prices over a period of 12 months. There is a good half-year and a bad half-year.  During the good half-year there are plenty of animals available but during the bad half-year the victuallers have to work on a very narrow margin and even at times suffer a loss. That is from Christmas on to April and the late spring.  If the Minister throws his mind back to the conditions which prevailed last spring, when peak prices obtained, he will remember that the very inclement weather conditions had a prejudicial effect on supplies and prices soared.  The victuallers suffered losses during that period and, to balance out these losses, prices were kept a bit high during the later half of the year when supplies were more <Col N="2218" /> plentiful.  If the Minister is going to control prices, he must take cognisance of the fact that the people in the trade were attempting to stabilise prices over the whole year and were not desirous that prices should fluctuate too much over the whole year.</P>
    <P>It is true that people in the trade have at times taken very high margins but I have no hesitation in saying that quite recently no high profits were made in the trade.  The margins allowed them were very small.  As a matter of fact, people in the trade were suffering losses.  I feel that is the position. I have already said that I would welcome any intervention by the Minister that would ensure that a more efficient system of handling meat as between the farmer and the consumer was introduced and that a narrow margin would be allowed for that particular service.  I am opposed, however, to the Minister's intervention if it is going to have the effect of reducing prices to the primary producer.</P>
    <P>We have been discussing the effect of the London talks and the agreement arrived at in the last few days, and we have all lamented the fact that our stocks are falling and that there is no sign of any improvement in the numbers for export purposes because the number of one-year-olds we have to-day is substantially less than we have had for the past two or three years. The Minister should bear that in mind in his anxiety for increased exports and remember that any further reduction in prices is likely to cause a further diminution in live-stock production here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been wondering whether it was wise to fix the price of mutton at all.  Sheep are very scarce and the mutton trade has become more or less a luxury business to a great extent.  It will be a luxury business from now on.  There is no doubt that sheep are bringing exorbitant prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>As a luxury article for consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, for consumption. Mutton has become a luxury commodity and it is beyond the reach of the ordinary person.  There is no doubt that the farmers had stocked up with <Col N="2219" /> sheep before this Order was made. Three-fourths of the sheep change hands in autumn and they changed hands this year at very high prices to the feeders.  At present fixed prices these feeders stand to lose.  That is a fairly serious aspect of the matter.  The fixed prices come into operation at a time of the year when two-thirds of the sheep had gone into the hands of the feeders at a very high figure.  The number of sheep operating on the market would be in the ratio of four to seven as compared with 12 months ago.  The Minister should keep that in mind.  If he could keep beef at a reasonable price to meet the needs of the ordinary household, he could then allow mutton to be sold as a luxury article, which it really is.  It has become so because of the scarcity of sheep.</P>
      <P>With regard to beef, there is no doubt that it was generally felt over the summer months that people in the trade were taking good margins of profit. There were periods last spring when they had thin margins but for some months afterwards it was generally recognised that they were probably taking too high a margin.  Last spring, in the months of April and May there was a great scarcity of beef and I think indications are that you will have even a greater scarcity next May. You will have less stall-feeding this winter owing to the scarcity of grain and its high cost.  Barley and oats are selling at very high prices.  Oats is changing hands at about 50/- per barrel, a price that was never heard of before in this country.  You will therefore find that there will not be much stall-feeding this winter and that you are likely to have a great scarcity of beef in April.  All these things should be kept in mind.  It will need very careful watching to prevent a scarcity of beef in the late spring and anything that would lead to farmers switching over from stall-feeding would not be for the general good.  I can foresee just as big a scarcity of meat next spring as we had last spring, even though we may have a mild winter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is necessary to <Col N="2220" /> get clear the basis on which prices have been fixed.  Until this Order was made, the maximum prices chargeable for beef and mutton in Dublin were regulated on the basis of an informal agreement made by me with the Dublin Master Victuallers' Association.  I was not very much concerned about enforcing maximum prices for meat, particularly for beef, because I assumed that competition would be keen in so far as there was a full supply of cattle and that consequently there was not that element of scarcity which affects prices of other commodities.</P>
      <P>I think the informal agreement arrangement worked well enough. The last time I made an agreement with the Dublin Master Victuallers' Association was in February on the basis of the prevailing prices in the Dublin market in January.  The Dublin master victuallers agreed with me as to the prices they would charge for beef and mutton in Dublin.  Subsequently market prices began to fluctuate so violently that the agreement could not be maintained. Prices rose considerably, but when they fell again the retail prices of beef and mutton did not fall with them and I have now made an Order fixing maximum prices for beef and mutton on a basis which is more favourable to the victuallers than the basis they agreed to accept last February. I think I was justified in giving them a somewhat wider margin because their costs, including the wages of operatives, have increased in the meantime.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise that the maximum prices now fixed are related to the market prices in October and provide for the victuallers, even allowing for increased costs, the same margin as they agreed to be reasonable in February of this year.  I think that the price of meat was too high.  It is true, as Deputy Hughes said, that it is the normal practice in the trade to work on low margins during the spring of the year when the market prices of stock are high, and to recover in the autumn of the year when the market prices tend to fall.  But there can, I think, be little justification for the prices which were prevailing at the time I made the Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 12 months from August, 1946, <Col N="2221" /> to August, 1947, prime beef costs on the Dublin market advanced by 2.13 pence per lb. of meat, dead weight.  In the same period the retail prices of beef in shops, as shown by the inquiry conducted in preparing the cost-of-living index number, advanced on the average by 5.3 pence per lb.  In the same period prime mutton costs advanced by 4.64 pence per lb., dead weight, while the average retail prices of mutton in the shops advanced by 7½d. per lb.  It is obvious that the advance in retail prices was out of relation to the advance in market prices.</P>
    <P>These traders ordinarily work upon a low profit on turnover.  Deputies, no doubt, have seen in the Press a statement by some victualler to the effect that these prices yield him a margin of profit of something over 3 per cent. on sales, but ordinarily, from the information available to me, victuallers work on a margin of about 4 per cent. on sales.  When you consider that the present percentage is related to very considerably inflated money values, it is quite obvious that a lower percentage on sales is justified, having regard to the fact that no other section of the community can get the same percentage return on turnover as operated before the war.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the effect of fixing meat prices upon stock prices in relation to cattle and sheep separately. The British made an agreement with us and the higher prices which the British are going to pay for fat cattle under that agreement do not affect this issue at all.  I tried to explain that to Deputy Hughes before, but apparently he has not fully grasped it.  The prices for prime bullocks and heifers on the Dublin market during five dates in October were as follows: 84/8¾ per cwt., 83/2 per cwt., 82/2 per cwt., 81/7¾ per cwt. and 82/8½ per cwt.  Even the increased prices which the British propose to pay will not bring their price to anything around these figures.</P>
    <P>At the prices the British are prepared to pay, even with the increases, they will not get this class of animal. The class of cattle which the Dublin butcher ordinarily buys is selling at these prices in the Dublin market, whereas the British will buy around <Col N="2222" /> 75/- or 76/-.  It is clear, therefore, that they are going to get the second grade of fat cattle, the type which have not been moved heretofore because the British did not pay enough and the type butchers buy only in times of scarcity.</P>
    <P>There is no conflict between the buyers of cattle for export&mdash;cattle sold at the prices the British and continental buyers pay&mdash;and the Dublin butchers, because the Dublin butchers buy these prime bullocks and heifers, while the buyers for export purchase the other animals.  At some seasons, when there is a scarcity of these cattle, the Dublin butchers may be in competition for the other types, but there is no competition at the price the British are paying for the heavier and older cattle they are obtaining.  Such competition does not enter into this picture and will not unless and until there emerges a time of scarcity of fat cattle which will require the butchers to go into the market for the other types.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that cattle prices are subject to seasonal fluctuations and normally, from the end of January on, prices tend to rise and meat prices rise with them.  I have intimated that the maximum retail prices for meat will be related to the current market prices for cattle.  I recognise that that may not be altogether practicable.  If circumstances arise in which there is a considerable reduction in the supply of this type of cattle and there is undue competition between the butchers themselves to obtain supplies, it may force prices unduly high.  Our aim must be to keep meat prices as low as practicable in the interests of the consumers, but obviously there is in the present maximum prices for beef no element of unfairness to the victuallers, having regard to the margins they obtained in the past.  Neither does any problem arise at present because of the higher moneys the British pay for fat cattle for export.</P>
    <P>The position is different concerning sheep.  There is no one buying sheep except the victuallers.  There are no sheep available for export and the rise in the prices of sheep was due entirely to butchers competing with one another for the limited supply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, but because of the scarcity, and because that scarcity produced the competition to which I have referred, the prices of sheep on the Dublin market have increased since last year by about 40 per cent.  That is a substantial increase, but the present prices which I have fixed for sheep bear the same relationship to the prices which prevailed in the Dublin market during October as the prices which the butchers agreed last February to maintain having regard to the prices which prevailed in January, again with a slight advantage to the butcher to offset the increased cost which he has incurred in the meantime. I think sheep prices have gone high enough.  It may be some people have speculated on the possibility of a further increase and have bought sheep to hold them for that.</P>

      <P>If I had brought the Order in earlier&mdash;so far as sheep are concerned the prices moved upwards slightly since August but went back as compared with May last&mdash;the prices fixed for mutton would have been higher and we would now be reducing the prices of mutton because of the fall in the market prices of sheep.
