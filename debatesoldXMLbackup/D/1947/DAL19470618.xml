      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that agricultural machinery ordered last November has, in general, not yet been delivered; and if he will state what steps have been taken to ensure a supply of horse-spraying machines, manure distributors and other agricultural machinery essential to our requirements, and, specifically, the number of binders and tractors which he anticipates will arrive in time for the harvest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that certain agricultural machinery required for the summer and autumn periods has not in general, been delivered.  Manure distributors, as well as ploughs, corn drills and harrows have, however, I understand, been supplied in adequate quantities.</P>
      <P>The principal reason for the delay in the delivery of agricultural machinery is the shortage of foundry coke, but every effort is being made to obtain adequate supplies of this essential material.  A small quantity was recently imported from the U.S.A. and this was allocated entirely to those concerns engaged in the manufacture of agricultural machinery.</P>
      <P>As regards binders and tractors, present indications are that for this year's harvest approximately 1,000 additional binders and 1,000 additional tractors will be available.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the information afforded to him about adequate supplies of manure distributors and spraying machines being distributed, is fantastically false?  Supplies of such commodities were not to be had at all after the very early part of the delivery season and, such as they were, they were of antediluvian pattern.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware of the discrepancy in the road allowances payable in the various counties to members of county councils for use of their cars when attending meetings; and if he will fix a basic mileage rate, applicable to all counties, in like manner as the subsistence allowance is fixed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In lieu of defraying the actual expenses of locomotion incurred by members in attending meetings a county council may decide to pay a fixed mileage rate.  Some county councils have decided to adopt this course and where the rate has not exceeded 1/- per mile actual travelling distance, it has been sanctioned.  The remaining county councils are, it is presumed, still defraying actual locomotion expenses.  It is a matter for the county council to decide which method of defraying expenses they will adopt.  Furthermore, should the council decide to pay a fixed rate, it is for it to determine what this will be. Although the rates fixed by the county council do not take effect until sanctioned by him, the Local Government Act, 1946, does not give the Minister power to fix mileage rates.</P>

There are no restrictions, and I see no reason to impose any, on the payment of sterling through ordinary banking channels, nor on the import of sterling bank notes from the Six Counties, Great Britain, the Isle of Man, or the Channel Islands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I had reached a point on this Estimate where I was discussing the imposition of fines by the courts for infringement of the tillage regulations.  I stated that my experience in many cases was that fines have been excessive and I now wish to state that there should be some curtailment of the powers of inspectors, or at least I would expect them to be allowed freedom of discretion in dealing with people in extenuating circumstances who were not able to comply with the regulations to the full.  There may be such things as sickness in a family.  There may be old age, or such a vital and important matter as lack of capital which would not permit them to comply with the tillage regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that a minute investigation should be held into the affairs of those people, and if they are suffering from sickness, infirmity, old age or lack of capital, it should receive serious consideration, and if they have to be brought to court, I would ask that the Department should not press for such penalties and that they would take into account any extenuating circumstances in the case with which the court may be concerned.  I heard one Deputy in particular on the Opposition Benches suggesting that we should not export agricultural produce at all, that we should look to other aspects of our economy and to other industries for products for the export market.  I cannot see for the life of me what we have got to export from this country, with the exception of agricultural produce and I would say that the biggest items of our exports have been <Col N="2015" /> and will continue to be cattle.  In dealing with that problem, I would say that we should tackle first the question of our surplus cattle population in a businesslike manner.</P>
    <P>For some years in this country, perhaps for a period earlier on, there has been some prejudice against trade with other countries, particularly with our nearest neighbour, Great Britain. I do not like to be raking up old history and repeating ancient statements, but I can clearly remember a time when we were led to believe that the English market was gone, and gone for ever.  I never believed that.  It was a fable at the time, and many Deputies, I feel, realised it was not the case and that there is a good and profitable market in Great Britain for any of our surplus products or any products we can send.</P>
    <P>I would like if the old prejudice could be dispelled that we should try other countries in the world besides Great Britain.  We have made an attempt to establish trade with many European countries.  In these attempts we have not been wholly successful and I still hold that our best customer will continue to be our nearest neighbour. It is up to us to make a trade agreement with Great Britain on sound business lines.  I do not mean to say that we should go hat in hand or down on bended knees and beg them to take our produce.  There is no necessity for that.  We have a good article to sell, and the English people realise that it is the best in the world.  Therefore, there is no necessity to go craving or begging or on our knees to them.  They will be glad to take it if only for the reason that it is a superior article, better than they can get elsewhere.</P>
    <P>As I have been saying, the cattle export business is perhaps the most profitable, and will continue to be the most profitable side of our export business.  We cannot hope for exports of butter and bacon for a considerable time.  I think I have already dealt with the bacon position as far as administration is concerned, but I should say that a desperate and determined effort should be made to revive our cattle trade.  It must be remembered that it is one of <Col N="2016" /> our industries that survived the war and the emergency conditions without a subsidy, even though it was not always a profitable business.  But at the same time it was a business which survived without grants despite the fact that at some periods it was not by any means profitable.</P>
    <P>Regarding the eggs arrangement with Britain, I do not consider it satisfactory at all.  This arrangement means that we are more or less tied hands and feet across the water.  We are asked to provide up to 700,000 cases of eggs a year, and if we do we will get a better price.  I think there should be a great deal more freedom and I do not think the rod should be held over our heads that if we do not export this quantity we will not get an economic price.  I think there should be some kind of open agreement without any stipulations.  We could agree to stipulations as to quality but I do not think there should be any stipulation that we should export 700,000 cwts. We should have our freedom to export as much as we possibly can to Great Britain and if we are not able to do that, we should not suffer any financial loss.</P>
    <P>Since the present Minister for Agriculture took office there are a couple of things on which I think he deserves congratulations.  I am not going to say things that will cause him to leave this House or to remain in it suffering from a swelled head.  I thought he was making an earnest attempt to come to the aid of the depressed farmer by voting money for the relief of rates.  On the surface his proposal was good.  It was a gesture, but when the gesture was boiled down, it can be assumed, and it is a reality, that that £1,000,000 voted for the relief of rates never reached the farmer's pockets.  He never made a penny out of it because to coincide with it agricultural wages went up about 6/- a week per worker.  I am not going to stand up and say that the agricultural labourer is overpaid.  I hold, and I have always held, that he is underpaid, but I say that as far as the farmer is concerned, he derived absolutely no benefit from the £1,000,000 relief of rates because it went out again by way of increases to <Col N="2017" /> his agricultural workers&mdash;a very good thing&mdash;but the farmer who believes he is getting relief is living in a fool's paradise and is not sane or right.</P>
    <P>Another matter on which I wish to congratulate the Minister is the money made available for loss of stock during the severe weather, but in that there is also a snag.  Heavy losses were suffered by farmers during the winter and the spring.  I say that this requirement that farmers should produce sureties is humiliating.  Surely if land is worth anything at all, it should be sufficient security for advances in respect of losses of stock. I think these cases should be dealt with on their own merits.  Suppose that next year we have a repetition of the great calamity where we had a bad harvest and a severe spring and suppose the losses when they are counted up prove to be greater than this year.  The man who goes security for his neighbour who meets such losses will find himself in a very undesirable position when he discovers that his client is not in a position to meet his commitments so far as these loans are concerned.  I suggest to the Minister that this question of sureties should be left out of it by probing fairly well into a man's financial ability and inclination to pay.  In addition to that, the securities on his land and his farm should be adequate for the Government or the banks.</P>

      <P>I do not know of anybody who gets that profit.  When we pay a decent wage and all the other expenses we can easily count our profits.  I know it because I am in the grocery trade.</P>
      <P>I would refer to a statement which was made in this House by Deputy Moran wherein he gave a glowing and very detailed account of the sale of a side of bacon.  Deputy Moran has told us here in this House that a Wiltshire side of bacon, weighing 61 lbs., when cut up into several cuts or grades shows a net profit to the shopkeeper of £1 13s.  10½d.  I must say to Deputy Moran that that is highly exaggerated. Deputy Moran never stood behind the counter to cut up a side of bacon because if he did he would know exactly what the profits are.  If he were in my position he would know the true position.  Did he ever take into consideration the loss in bones, shrinkages and perhaps the entire loss of the side which occurs frequently at the present time of the year?  With his limited experience of the bacon business as a director of the Castlebar Bacon Factory, I do not think he should try to tell the world that we, in the grocery or provision business, are extortioners or racketeers.  If he divided the figure by three he would, perhaps, arrive at a nearer calculation to the net profit on a side of bacon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also suggest to the Minister that the duty on imported machinery should be abolished.  If we come down to brass tacks and study that duty we will find that it is an indirect and carefully hidden tax on the agricultural community and I would suggest to the Minister that that is so.  I think that <Col N="2019" /> if there is a duty of 33? per cent. on it, as the Minister suggested&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Now that peace has once more been restored, I would urge the Minister to have the duty on imported machinery removed.  As I have already said, it is a carefully and well-designed imposition on the agricultural industry and any man who buys agricultural implements not manufactured in this country must realise that he is paying something in indirect tax.  It is an unfair and unjust tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to summarise all the points I have dealt with on this Vote.  In order to refresh the Minister's memory I would summarise the <Col N="2020" /> points under six headings.  My first point is that there should be introduced under the system of primary education some kind of text-book that would give the boy in later years a flair for agriculture. My second point concerns a long-term policy for agriculture.  To my mind it would be a grand and a sound idea if the Minister could give us some indication of what we will be doing next year or the year after and give us an idea of our outlook for the future, so that we can plan and hope to realise the ambitions of the Minister and of everyone connected with the agricultural industry of this country by putting it on a good, firm and solid foundation. My third point is that there should be less Government interference in agricultural industries, particularly in the pig industry.  If the Government wash their hands of interference and let these industries stand on their own legs they will survive because when there is no compulsion or control the position will adjust itself.  I would stress my fourth point again.  I feel that trade agreements are necessary. However, they need not be only with our nearest neighbour.  We could make them with anybody.  I would say to the Minister that he should make the best trade agreement he can with any country in the world.  It can be done. He should tell them and advertise to them that we have agricultural products in this country which are second to none and that we can give them the article if they are prepared to buy and give us a reasonable price for it.  As my fifth point, I would ask the Minister to approach the Minister for Finance, who is responsible for the Drainage Act which is locked up in a pigeon-hole in this House or in some other Department, to implement that Act at once.  I think agriculture and drainage are more or less interdependent.  I can see myself that production in this country is greatly retarded because of the need for a proper drainage system.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister to urge the Minister for Finance to implement the Drainage Act.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would say that the Minister should go minutely into the question of prices for farm produce and, where he sees that there is a possible <Col N="2021" /> chance of increasing the prices of any agricultural products in this country, he should not hesitate to come to the House and ask for the money. As I have already said, the farmer should be able to get favourable remuneration and the agricultural workers should be given equitable wages.  In order to do that, however, the prices must be increased.  In putting these points before the Minister, I can say that if he gives effect to them I will be able to compliment him as perhaps the best Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture we have had up to the present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read and read very carefully, if I have not listened to them on some occasions, nearly all the pronouncements made by the present Minister for Agriculture since he came into office.  I cannot discover in any of his pronouncements any indication of any change of policy compared with that of his predecessor.  The Minister will have to admit&mdash;no amount of bluff will get over it&mdash;that the policy of the Minister for Agriculture, for the past five or six years particularly, has left 20 per cent. of our citizens&mdash;because of low incomes&mdash;in the position to-day that they are unable to get bacon, butter, eggs or a sufficient quantity of milk.  In addition to that, it has left us in the position that we have not a proper supply of the type of labour that will enable the agricultural industry to pay its way.  Every citizen of this State must recognise, and I am sure does recognise, in some form or other, that the farmers and the agricultural labourers have rendered a great national service to the citizens during the emergency and that we can never repay them either in cash or in kind for that wonderful service. We can never repay them, either in cash or kind, for that wonderful service of feeding the people when we were absolutely isolated from other parts of the world.  What is the policy of the Minister in regard to the repayment of the farmers, or, should I say, what is his policy so far as it aims at giving the primary producer a reasonable return for the use of his land and labour?  Will it be suggested by the Minister that the farmer is getting a <Col N="2022" /> decent return for the use of his land and for his labour and that the agricultural labourer is getting a decent cash wage, sufficient to enable him, if he is a married man, to maintain his family in common decency and comfort? There must be some revolutionary change in the previous policy of the Department and the Minister for Agriculture if the agricultural industry is to survive and if farmers are to get a decent means of livelihood.</P>
      <P>The Minister will probably say, in the same eloquent way as his predecessor, that there has been an increase in the consumption of butter. That may be true.  How does that apply to the 20 per cent. of our citizens who are living on low State incomes, such as widows' and orphans' pensions, old age pensions, blind pensions, unemployment insurance benefit, unemployment assistance benefit and national health insurance benefit, apart from the large number who have to survive on the miserable maximum of 8/- per week by way of home assistance? How much butter, bacon, eggs and milk can be purchased by the people living on these incomes?  I know that the Minister will say it is not his job to provide higher incomes for the classes I have mentioned.  But he has a collective responsibility in that matter.  He has a responsibility as Minister for Agriculture as well as a member of the Government under the Constitution to see that every citizen is provided with a decent livelihood and clothing and shelter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is the policy of the Minister to change the policy of his predecessor and to provide a better livelihood for the farmers and agricultural labourers, will he say how he proposes to do it?  Will he say, for instance, how he proposes to increase the amounts paid to the producer for his agricultural produce and live stock and, at the same time&mdash;I think both are possible if you go the right way about it&mdash;reduce the price of essential commodities to the consumer?  We have too many middlemen in this country.  We have more middlemen <Col N="2023" /> per head of the population than any other country in the world.  That is why the price to-day to the producer is so low and uneconomic and, worse still, that is the reason why the charges made to the consumer are so excessive. I have personal knowledge within recent times that in the part of County Dublin where I have lived for about 25 years the average housewife would be lucky if she could get a head of cabbage for 1/2.  Has the Minister taken any steps to deal with the people who make these prohibitive charges?  If he has made any inquiries into the matter, will he say how much the producer was getting for the cabbage for which 1/2 per head was charged to the average housewife in the City and County of Dublin?  I have been told that housewives in the city have been charged as high as 1/7 and 1/8, but I have no proof of that.  My wife, however, has proof that she was charged 1/2 in the town of Dún Laoghaire for a head of cabbage.  Is there any Minister or any Deputy sitting behind the Minister who will defend that policy, knowing perfectly well that the producer is only getting 3d. or 4d. per head out of it?  What does the Minister propose to do to stop that kind of profiteering and racketeering?  What is the Department doing to encourage the farmer, a farmer with a funny point of view like Deputy Beirne, if you like, to cut out a certain percentage of the middlemen and to get down to running this country on the basis of co-operation, co-operation as close as possible between the producer and the consumer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we have been cut out of the British market or other world markets&mdash;and the British market is the chief market where we have been selling agricultural produce&mdash;we have been cut out because other countries understand the meaning of co-operation; co-operation in the production, distribution and selling of produce.  Anyone who knows anything about the conditions in Denmark can understand why Denmark can beat us in the British or any other market.  They produce on a co-operative basis.  The co-operative societies were established by the Government, <Col N="2024" /> are propped up by the Government, and are run under a system of Government control.  They have control of their own transport or, if they have not complete control of it, they have the power to see that the farmer or the producer gets preferential low rates for the carriage of agricultural machinery or produce for export.  They control their own shipping.  They pay higher rates of wages and better prices to the producer in the long run than we do, because we have too many middlemen in between the producer and the consumer.</P>
    <P>Is it possible to persuade the Minister to instruct his army of inspectors, either local inspectors or the inspectors working under his direct control, when touring the country and speaking at meetings to say a little more to the people about the value of co-operation and tell them what the Minister proposes to do to help the farmers to establish co-operative societies, or even to maintain the ones established already?  The sooner we face up to that position, the sooner the Government will be in a position and the sooner this House that supports the Government will be in a position to give the producer a little bit more for his labour and the use of his land and to give the consumers those essential commodities, at a far lower price than they are forced to pay to-day.</P>
    <P>I could go on quoting commodities essential to the life of the community for which prohibitive charges are made. Somebody may say that that has nothing to do with the Minister for Agriculture, that it is a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce. It is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture and for him before anybody else, because his job is to see that the primary producer is put in a position to continue in production.  The present position is leading, as you can see in various aspects of the agricultural industry, to the people clearing out of production.  You would nearly salute a pig now if you saw one.  Of course, Deputy Cogan said he passed through a town in Wicklow where a fair was being held and saw a few pigs there.  He saw more than the average <Col N="2025" /> Deputy will see if he goes around the country.  The people are getting out of pig production.  There must be some sound reason why they are getting out of production.  The farmer will always hang on to the production of the commodity which pays him.  He does not go out of production because he is lazy or unwilling to take advantage of whatever encouragement, financial or otherwise, may be given to him to continue in the production of essential commodities.</P>
    <P>I cannot stress too strongly the necessity, not alone for the Minister, but for Deputies of every Party who want to see this country regain the position which it occupied in pre-war days, to produce the necessaries of life for our own people and to export whatever is genuinely exportable, so as to enable us to pay for the commodities that we must continue to import until this policy of complete self-sufficiency comes to us in the next generation or after.  At the moment it certainly does not appear to be on the horizon.  So long as we have to import essential commodities we must send out our exportable surplus in order to pay for such imports. There is a wrong idea in the minds of a good many people with regard to what an exportable surplus constitutes. An exportable surplus, to some people, means what you cannot sell.  An exportable surplus, to my mind, means what the community are unable to consume after they themselves have been provided with the necessaries of life.  We all know, and the figures are there to prove it, that a very high percentage of our people cannot purchase bacon, eggs or butter in a sufficient quantity, because they have not got the purchasing power to enable them to do so.  We are told there has been an increase in the consumption of butter.  Who is consuming it?  It is being consumed by those people who are coming in here from the Six Counties and Great Britain and from other parts of the world from which they can get a passport.  The proof of that for any Deputy who does not already know it may be found in our hotels all over the country.  Our hotels are packed with foreign visitors and their pockets are packed with money. They are coming in here with unlimited <Col N="2026" /> funds at their disposal because of the currency system which ties us to our neighbouring nation.  They can bring with them sufficient money to purchase whatever they can get in a market where there is a shortage of essential commodities for our own people. Being placed in that fortunate position, they are forcing up the cost of our essential commodities in the very country in which they are produced.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Minister for Agriculture altogether for that because the Cabinet has a collective responsibility as far as our monetary system and financial policy is concerned.  That monetary system at present enables foreign visitors coming in here to buy up whatever they can as against our own people.  Anybody who has been down at the North Wall during the past 18 months can see there the long line of furniture vans on the quays.  To whom does this furniture belong?  It belongs to those people who left this country in 1922 when we got a certain measure of freedom to which they took exception.  It belongs to those people who left the country in 1932 who did not approve of the de Valera Government. It belongs to those people who left the country in 1939 who did not approve of our policy of neutrality. They are coming back now and they are glad to come back as quickly as they can, with their pockets bulging with money.  They are glad to come back because they can buy up food and other essential commodities as against those of us who have always stayed here.  All this goes to prove&mdash;if my statement is acceptable and if the Minister is in agreement with it&mdash;that a revolutionary change in our agricultural as well as in our financial policies is vitally necessary if we are to survive as a Christian democratic State.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Heskin that there is an urgent necessity for an increase in the price of milk to those farmers who supply milk to the creameries. I do not profess to have any expert knowledge of the dairying industry but I do know that the few creameries which were established in my constituency during the last 15 or 20 years are quickly going out of existence because&mdash;it is alleged at any <Col N="2027" /> rate&mdash;the farmers are not getting an economic price for their milk.  I have always supported the policy of the Government in regard to subsidies and I have always maintained that if a subsidy is necessary for the purpose of enabling a producer to remain in production, then it should be a sufficiently large subsidy to provide an economic price for the person producing the particular article or essential commodity. There is no use in giving them a small sum in order to provide them with an uneconomic price.  If you subscribe to the policy of subsidising industry you must go the whole way and give the primary producer particularly a sufficient subsidy to enable him to make a profit on his labour and on the utilisation of his land.  Deputy Heskin gave figures and facts to substantiate a good case for a higher price for the dairy farmer.</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe to the policy of the Minister&mdash;and I would like the Minister to note this in order that he may reply to it&mdash;in regard to the slaughter of calves.  In the present circumstances of this country it is in my opinion inhuman and immoral that our young calves should be slaughtered. That policy should be stopped and steps must be taken by the Department of Agriculture to bring it to a stop immediately.  Otherwise we shall find ourselves in a worse position from the agricultural point of view in the live-stock section of our agricultural industry not so many years hence.  I would like to hear the Minister defending this policy, if he can make any defence for it.  I can be converted if the Minister can advance a good and sufficient argument for his policy.</P>
    <P>Looking over the Estimates for the Department of Agriculture and the Estimates in general, I find that we are providing here roughly a sum of £6,000,000 of the taxpayers' money for different kinds of education.  I have examined the Estimates in some detail and I have had my examination checked by colleagues.  Out of the £6,000,000 provided for the education of our young people in the various schools which are subsidised in this State only £160,000 is provided for agricultural education. That represents roughly 2d. or 3d. in <Col N="2028" /> the £ out of every £ paid by the taxpayers. I have always held the view, though I do not put my view against the view of the experts of the Department of Education or the Minister for Agriculture, that our system of education in the rural areas has always been a bit lopsided.  Certainly there is something radically wrong when only 2d. or 3d. out of every £ provided by the taxpayers is provided directly for agricultural education.  Compared with the days when I went to the primary school &mdash;now some 40 years ago&mdash;there has been very little change but any change that has come about has been a change for the worse from the farmers' point of view and from the point of the rural population as a whole.  The boys and girls now going to our primary schools are receiving an education to fit them for &ldquo;clean hands&rdquo; jobs&mdash;typists, shorthand writers, counter jumpers and everything else except bricklayers or carpenters.</P>

      <P>He can provide agricultural colleges.  If he cannot provide them I am prepared to listen to his reason for his inability to do so.  I am speaking for my own constituency.  I am not speaking for County Cavan or anywhere else.  But I would like to see an agricultural college in every county in this country.  If there is any difficulty in the way, I will give the Minister all the help in my power to overcome that difficulty and to remove any obstacles that may be placed in his way so far as the provision of such <Col N="2029" /> colleges is concerned.  I would in particular like to hear him defend the provision of 2d. or 3d. in the £, out of this £6,000,000 of the taxpayers' money, for agricultural education.  I am not blaming the Minister for all that is wrong in the Department of Agriculture. He has not been long enough in office to learn what has been going on during the time of his predecessor.  He need not be in any way annoyed at the remarks I make here.  I have said some of these things here before and I shall continue to say them so long as my constituents send me here for that specific purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think too that the farmers in this country should get all the encouragement possible from the Government, from the Minister for Industry and Commerce and from the Minister for Agriculture by the provision of cheap transport rates either by road or by rail for agricultural machinery and the raw materials of the agricultural industry. I think I can safely say that there is no other country in the world where the Government has not provided special rates of carriage for agricultural machinery and the raw materials of the agricultural industry.  A glaring example of what I consider to be an unfair discrimination arose recently when the Government authorised Córas Iompair Éireann to increase their rates by 20 per cent.  Anybody who knows anything about the economy of transport knows that it is the luxury articles which should be asked to bear the higher rates and the bulky traffic, whether it be machinery for the farmers or coal or anything else, should get specially low rates.  I definitely advocate here that Córas Iompair Éireann should be instructed by the Department responsible for the appointment of its chairman and board of directors to provide specially low rates, such as we had in pre-war days, for those people engaged in the agricultural industry.  If you must put an increase of 20 per cent. on to the rates of carriage, put it on to the motor car which is going to Parknasilla for the gentleman who is spending his holidays there.  Surely it can be justified much more easily in that case than it can be justified on the raw materials of our <Col N="2030" /> primary industry.  It is all wrong for the Government and the responsible Minister to put an all-round increase of 20 per cent. on everything carried by this semi-State controlled transport company, instead of giving preference by way of low rates to the commodities that cannot bear a heavy rate in the same way as luxury articles.</P>
    <P>We have not heard anything from the new Minister about the reasons for the shortage of agricultural labour, or his views with regard to the rates of wages paid to agricultural labourers. The Minister may say that it is not his job, but the chairman of the Agricultural Wages Board is carrying out the policy of the Ministry in a way quite different from what is done by other Ministers in regard to rates of wages and working conditions.  In this Estimate provision is made for the administration of the Agricultural Wages Acts by a chairman nominated by the Minister.  The procedure adopted by the Agricultural Wages Board and the chairman should be completely altered.  That is what I want to see.  Why can we not have a public hearing of the claims of agricultural labourers, if they are to continue to be heard by the chairman of the Agricultural Wages Board instead of by the Labour Court?  Why can there not be a public hearing instead of the secrecy that surrounds the present procedure, which is laid down by the Minister's nominee?</P>
    <P>I understand there is no agenda issued, and there are no minutes issued after the meetings are held, and the chairman, on some occasions, has completely ignored the recommendations of the area board, as well as of the national board.  The chairman is the Lord Almighty; he is like the chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann&mdash;a quorum in himself and a law unto himself.  That is the Minister's policy, and compare that with the open diplomacy policy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce through the Labour Court.  I know a member of an area board who wrote to the chairman some time ago asking why a recommendation made by the area board had not been adhered to.  The chairman had not opposed it <Col N="2031" /> at the area board meeting, but when the award was made it bore no relation to the recommendation of the area board.  The chairman refused to reply to that letter directly and he told the member he would have a word with him when next he was in Dublin.  He was afraid to put his reasons on paper.</P>
    <P>It is about time we got rid of that antediluvian system with regard to the wages of agricultural labourers and their working conditions.  What is wrong about the chairman sitting in his office in the same way as the Labour Court, hearing both sides and letting the public be judges?  The public will be the judges in the long run, but they cannot judge what happens at the Agricultural Wages Board meetings, because there are no minutes issued.  There is some element of doubt in the Minister's mind, and there was also a doubt in the mind of his predecessor, as to whether there is a good case for the provision of loans for farmers at nominal rates of interest, or, as some people suggest, free of interest.  That is quite common in other countries.  If you are to help the farmer to cut down the cost of production and provide him with a better means of livelihood and a more profitable form of employment, one of the ways is to give loans at nominal rates of interest.</P>
    <P>We have the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the Industrial Credit Company.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation is a State-established institution. I have yet to learn that it was established for profit-making purposes, but I allege that it is paying more attention to the profits it can make upon the capital provided by the Minister for Finance than it is to the question of reducing rates of interest on loans provided to farmers.  The Industrial Credit Company is a far greater sinner in that respect.  I do not see why loans should not be provided for farmers on the security of their land.  The bankers place no value on land as security for a loan.  That is where they are upside-down in our agricultural policy.  The land which produces all our wealth and the raw materials for our industries in a good <Col N="2032" /> many cases, is worthless to a banking institution as security for a loan to enable farmers to work the land to better advantage.  If the land is worthless for that purpose, what is worth anything in this country?  It is about time the Government came to the conclusion that it should be taken as a security.  I would not say that the Agricultural Credit Corporation should be advised to give a loan to a farmer when a banker, some Jewman or moneylender had a charge on the farm.</P>

      <P>These institutions were established with capital provided by this and by the previous Government. I did compliment the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture upon making considerable progress in recent times in regard to the interest charges on loans.  The Minister for Finance has had the courage, probably in spite of his advisers, to reduce the rate on local loans.  I hope the Minister for Agriculture will be able to use his influence &mdash;and he has considerable influence in matters of this kind&mdash;with the Agricultural Credit Corporation to get them to reduce the rates of interest charged upon farmers' loans.  By doing that he will help to reduce the cost of production, improve the position of the farmer and give him breathing space so as to buy machinery or stock that may be very badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Beirne that this idea of getting personal security from some friendly neighbour is all wrong. It is unfair even in family circles.  It would be unfair for the Minister for Agriculture, although I suppose he will not require a loan as long as he is a Minister and probably never did require a loan.  I expect he would feel much the same as other citizens&mdash;that if he could get a loan on decent security he would not ask even his <Col N="2033" /> brother to sign a bill.  The personal security idea should be abolished. Once you give personal security to a brother citizen looking for a loan, your own security is interfered with if you want money for yourself.  This thing called banking is all foreign and all out-of-date and would not be tolerated in any progressive country.</P>

I am sure the Minister has more intelligence on this matter than I have, because he has able advisers.  I join with Deputy Beirne&mdash;although I agree to differ with him on many things he is advocating&mdash; and with other Deputies who suggested that it is the duty of the Minister here to make arrangements to meet his opposite number in the British Ministry of Agriculture at the earliest possible date.</P>

I know the Minister has a fairly good knowledge of the views of the people of the country but the longer he is in the Ministry, the less he will know about them because he will not have time to meet the ordinary people.  I say to the Minister that the view of the people of the country is that it is his job to meet Mr. Tom Williams, his opposite number on the other side, so that they may put their heads together and try to work out an agreement.  There is nothing wrong in that.  The Minister has some very able advisers who know the advisers of the Minister on the other side but I think it would add influence to the conduct of such negotiations if the Ministers on both sides met each other and tried to understand each other.  I join with Deputy Beirne or any other Deputy who says there is no time to be lost in bringing about such negotiations if beneficial results <Col N="2034" /> are to be achieved for the people on both sides of the channel.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Davin has land as collateral security for a loan and his debtor does not pay, he must take the land.  Now, for good or ill in this country, we have established the principle that we do not like people who take their neighbour's land for debt. Economists, bankers, and divers other persons take the view that Adam Smith would not have thought well of that position and the great banking authorities and the great moneylenders of history would have frowned on that decision.  We were aware of that when we took the decision but, all the moneylenders domestic and international notwithstanding, we still do not like people who take their neighbour's land for debt.  The knowledge that we do not like people who do that in this country, any more than we like people who grab their neighbour's land because they are covetous, has discouraged grabbers and discouraged moneylenders from taking land as collateral security for a loan.  The banks would be fools to take land as collateral security for a debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that it is an attractive proposition to say that we ought to get rid of the system of getting two neighbours to guarantee a loan.  However popular that thesis may be, it is false. The Agricultural Credit Corporation would be fools to give a loan to any man who could not find two of his neighbours to answer for his readiness to repay.  They would not alone injure <Col N="2036" /> themselves but they would gravely injure a very considerable number of men who are potential borrowers. There are certain individuals down through the country and the moment they hear of an interest-free loan for anything, they are clamouring to get the form on which to apply.  Some of them mean to repay but never succeed. Some of them are just cheap rogues who mean to get the loan and, having got it, join a Fianna Fáil club and become the local Fianna Fáil bosses so that when pressure is brought to bear on them to repay the loan they can go to the local Fianna Fáil T.D.s and say to them: &ldquo;If the writ issues against me, I shall take over the local branch of Fianna Fáil into Clann an Poblachta and ye will not like that.&rdquo;  Does Deputy Davin deny that that is so?</P>

      <P>I am not thinking of the West.  These things can happen in Leix-Offaly just as readily as they can happen anywhere else.  Sometimes when I see the anxious countenance of Deputy Gorry I pity him for having such exigent supporters.  From the point of view of borrowers themselves, I am strongly opposed to waiving the requirements for guarantors.  If a man who is credit-worthy&mdash;that is to say a man who intends to repay his debt and who can be depended on to spend the proceeds of his loan on some rational outlay&mdash;wants to get two neighbours to guarantee him he will have no serious difficulty, but if a fellow who is either hopelessly improvident or fundamentally dishonest wants to get a loan, he will have the greatest difficulty in getting two neighbours who know him to go bail for him.  I doubt very much if this system of scattering loans all over the country, interest free, has anything to commend it.  You take an unfortunate small farmer who lost a couple of beasts in the middle of the winter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I remember well the heifer scheme and the disgusting farce into which that degenerated when heifers were assembled at different centres and poor damn fools were bidding against one another, and bidding two prices because the Department's inspector was there with the money to pay for them and the fools all the time hoping to God they would be able to pay some time.  I solemnly warn this House on these interest-free loans that 50 per cent. of the recipients will live to curse the day they got them.  There is no use pretending that we can insulate every human creature against all the misfortunes he will meet in the course of his life&mdash;it cannot be done.  Every one of us from the wealthiest to the poorest will from time to time meet with reverses.</P>
      <P>If he is a man at all and puts his shoulder to the wheel to retrieve the ground lost, be it lost through no fault of his own or not&mdash;the loss may ultimately transpire to be a blessing because it gave him an occasion of showing his fortitude and showing his courage to retrieve himself, but if the loss be so crushing as to make it impossible for the best intentioned man to get on his feet again after it, I have yet to meet the parish in Ireland where friends cannot be found to raise the price among themselves to put him back on his feet and allow him by his own effort to restore the circumstances of which misfortune deprived him.  If we are going to lay down the principle that in every place misfortune falls, it becomes the duty of the State to step in and restore the <i>status quo ante</i> with grants, loans and benefactions, the last surviving citizen or the citizen who still takes pride in his independence will have to carry the burden of the parish.</P>

      <P>I have often heard of the case of the widow who lost five cows. When I started out to find the widow who lost five cows I travelled from townland to townland.  I was getting hot all the time but I never found her and I never found anyone who saw the widow who lost five cows.  But there were hundreds who had met the one who had spoken to the man who had seen the widow who lost five cows, and I met crowds who had wept with the one, who was witness to the one who had wept over the widow's loss.</P>
      <P>Come, let us face reality.  We are not all angels in this country and I would like to see a Deputy of the House who would undertake to segregate the cattle or sheep which died from the effects of hard weather from the sheep that died of fluke and the cattle which died because the man who had them sold his hay and did not keep the food wherewith to feed them.  That there were many who suffered parlous losses for which they could not be blamed I have no doubt, but if we try to ascertain precisely who they were and if they were in the ranks of those who qualify for help and assistance, thousands who are mere chancers looking for what good luck may send them, will come forward to meet us.

      <P>Beidh fáilte roimhe nuair a thiocfaidh sé isteach.  Did many Deputies in this House observe the application made in the name of this country by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the International Wheat Authority?  He bespoke on behalf of Ireland, 400,000 tons per annum of Canadian or United States wheat, and he added to that request this addendum: that he would undertake on behalf of this country to accept that allocation for many years ahead.  Four hundred thousand tons represent 3,200,000 barrels, which represent, in turn, the total consumption of wheat per annum by the people of this country.  If we are going to buy from abroad 3,200,000 barrels of wheat, what has become of the 650,000 acres of wheat that were the keystone of the Fianna Fáil's agricultural policy?  Do you remember the days when it was well-nigh high treason in this country to point out that dusty fraud of the &ldquo;grow more wheat&rdquo; scheme?  Do you remember when it was sabotaging the national effort to expose the shameless and disgusting dishonesty of the &ldquo;grow more wheat&rdquo; scheme?  Do Deputies remember when I warned them that that scheme was primarily designed to line the pockets of the millers of this country at the expense of those who had to eat bread that I was held up to ridicule?  Do members recall, for I warned them to remember, that I said, speaking from this place, that in normal times, with markets available to us, I would not be seen dead in a field of wheat in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that because I said that and because I practised that when the time of emergency came I was able to grow more wheat per acre on my land than any of the pirates who had been mining their own land with wheat during the previous ten years? And, having grown more wheat per acre on my land during the years of the war, I want to say again, with emphasis, that once wheat from abroad is available to this country again, I would not be seen dead in a field of wheat on my land in this country because I know that that whole rotten fraud in fact was invoked to permit the Rank interests and the other milling interests in this country to charge our people 30/- a cwt. for flour when they were selling it in Liverpool for 19/-.  I will not have to worry because the wheat scheme is as dead as a door nail.  Take off your compulsion to-morrow and see how much wheat will be grown.  Did Deputy Corry tell you his estimate of the average yield of wheat from the land in this country during the last seven or eight years?  How many barrels was the average yield?  Ask your neighbours. Ask the Minister for Agriculture what yield he got when he went wheat-growing in Cavan.  He is a very open, frank, plain-spoken man.  Sometimes he would like us to believe even that he is a tough egg.  Let us judge him by his personal experience and I will send him a nice wreath of rue with a big black bow which he can go out and lay on the land which so abundantly yielded wheat under his personal direction in County Cavan.</P>

    <P>Peat! Do you remember the halcyon days when peat was to be almost the greatest industry in this country, second only to agriculture, employing 80,000 men?  Do you remember the bags, great big long bags?  I think we bought nearly 500,000 of them and lost them all&mdash;every one of them.  I remember the last year I was Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee I inquired of the Comptroller and Auditor-General what had become of the bags and echo answered: &ldquo;What&rdquo;?  So was fulfilled another prophesy I dared to make when that scheme was first adumbrated in this House&mdash;that the only person to make profit out of the <Col N="2041" /> peat scheme would be the man who made the bags.</P>

      <P>It is a pretty story, Sir. There remains beet&mdash;the blessings of beet! Some day, and in the not far distant time, our people will have to ask themselves whether it is in the best interests of the community as a whole to continue the production of sugar from beet in this country at an annual cost to the community of £3,000,000 sterling.  That is what it costs in normal times to keep the beet industry going in this country If, instead of growing beet and converting it into sugar, we import refined sugar into this country there will be £3,000,000 sterling more for the national exchequer and that £3,000,000 can be used to increase children's allowances in every home in Ireland from the 2/6 per child to 5/- per child, and the land vacated <Col N="2042" /> by that crop can be used for the production of profitable agricultural produce which will help to finance essential imports and to enrich the farmers who live upon the land.</P>

Deputy Ryan, when Minister for Agriculture, declared that to be his view from the front benches of the Fianna Fáil Party as a justification for putting tariffs on all agricultural produce imported into this country. I reject that.  I believe that in certain lines of agricultural and industrial production we can produce as cheaply, as good, if not cheaper and better than any other country in the world.</P>

God speed that day.  Then the land of this country can be used for the purpose for which it was intended&mdash;the profit of those who own it and live upon it and the benefit of those who consume its products and who, without that production, might find themselves short.  Deputy Moran, from Castlebar, initiated the Fianna Fáil lament for maize meal that has begun.

      <P>Oh, yes.  Not one ounce of maize meal could be brought into this country, and it was Deputy Ó Briain and his colleagues who prevented it by law.  For whose benefit? For the benefit of the millers.  There was no restriction on the import of maize.  You could bring in maize if you were a miller, but if you were a contemptible farmer, a clodhopper on the land, you could not bring in maize.  If you were a miller, one of that exalted body, imports of maize were unrestricted and untariffed, because maize was the raw material of the industrialist, and you must not tax the raw material of the industrialist.  But when it was converted into meal it was then the raw material of the clodhoppers and, if it were necessary to kick them about for the protection of the industrial aristocracy, of course, Fianna Fáil was very ready to oblige.  Deputy Ó Briain was marshalled to vote for the <Col N="2044" /> legislation which, from his own protestation now, I can have no doubt he did not understand.  He gets desperately angry when I say that he was prevailed upon to vote in that Lobby for legislation the nature of which he does not understand.  Yet he tells me that he never voted for the Bill to prevent the importation of maize meal.  I tell him that he did.  I saw him do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Maize meal is coming back.  But, are we sure, or will the industrial aristocracy intervene again? I beg of Deputy Ó Briain to constitute himself a watch-dog on the future.  I suggest to him that the proposal which will be made is that maize will be admitted to be ground by the industrial aristocracy and then distributed to the clodhoppers on the land, but that maize meal will not be let in, because, if it were, the price of the imported article would compete with the price charged by the industrial aristocracy and they would not be able to buy their detached houses in their own grounds with a lodge at the gate. The industrial aristocracy of this country consider it to be their God-given right to live in the fashionable suburbs of Dublin and Cork and any legislation designed to interfere with that God-given right will be deemed to be in conflict with the Constitution.</P>
      <P>I want to see maize meal relieved from taxes, quotas and restrictions. I want our farmers to have access to their essential raw materials at the lowest price at which they can purchase them whencever they may come and I object to our farmers being called upon to pay taxes on those raw materials either to the Exchequer or to the industrial racketeers who want to bleed our people, but who should not be let.  The only means of securing that they will not is to expose them to the competition of supplies of maize meal whenever they may come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do you remember the maize meal mixture scheme?  I stood by its cradle and wept.  Now that I am polishing my silk hat for its funeral, I feel as if I had accepted an invitation to a wedding. It is dead and we may speed it to its grave in the fastest vehicle we <Col N="2045" /> can find.  It should never have been born.  This was the good fairy at its cradle speaking:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Let us grow all the feeding stuffs for which we have a market.  Why should we be supporting farmers in Minnesota and the Argentine when we have our own farmers to do it? We can grow the quantity of grain which we have been importing.  If we only grow the amount we have been importing, I presume we will not increase our live stock; because, if we did increase our live stock, we would have to grow more grain than we have been importing.  That may be disputed.  It does not matter very much to the argument, however. Suppose we did go beyond the amount of grain required to replace the imports, and we did increase the live stock, then we would be up against the question of marketing. Whatever market we get, whether the British market or the continental market or the home market, what we produce does not matter very much, as our production is a very small proportion of the world production.  If we produce 20 per cent. more mutton than we have been producing, 50 per cent. more bacon, or 50 per cent. more cattle as a result of this policy, it makes very little difference in the world supplies.  If we put the produce into England, France or Belgium, and if we put 5 or 10 per cent. more, we will not influence the price, if we have a home market at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The operative words in this prescient forecast&mdash;and the quotation is now ended&mdash;are</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Why should we be supporting farmers in Minnesota and the Argentine?&rdquo;</P>

Is it not surprising that there should have been a British food mission in this country for the past ten days and that the Minister for Agriculture has not seen fit to say a word about it?  Is it not remarkable that there have been officials of the British Ministry of Food discussing with our Minister for Agriculture how best we can co-ordinate our efforts to secure more foodstuffs for the British consumer and a better market for the Irish producer and the Minister for Agriculture is absolutely silent, the reason being, I believe, because, as I warned this House when they appointed the present gentleman Minister for Agriculture, he has made a &ldquo;haims&rdquo; of it.  Perhaps he will describe his forensic skill in dealing with these envoys from Great Britain before this discussion comes to an end.  It is hard to comment on what has taken place when we have nothing but rumour to inform us.  It will not be a very encouraging message if we are told that the fruits of these discussions have been nil.</P>

Has Deputy Ó Briain forgotten the fowl we sent to Belgium?  Homer's Iliad had nothing on this.  They started on their weary journey and they arrived at the Hook of Holland.  It was there discovered that in order to get them in an immense import duty would have to be paid; but we paid it like a man.  Then they moved to Rotterdam and at Rotterdam we discovered that there was an agricultural regulation obtaining in Holland which prohibited the sale of chickens from abroad and that these favoured fowl could not be excepted.  Nothing daunted, we sped them on their way to France.  They arrived&mdash;oh, safely.</P>

The chickens were now costing about 16/-apiece, but they still sped on their way. They passed through Belgium eventually and reached the French Republic. They wound up in Smithfield, where a meeting was held and it was decided that the best thing to do was to summon the undertaker and bury them as quickly as possible, which we did, at considerable expense.</P>
      <P>Nothing daunted, there was the saga of the case of eggs.  Of its peregrinations through Europe I have forgotten the details but they were dramatic&mdash; even sensational&mdash;and I think they were ultimately sold in Great Britain.</P>

    <P>I remember so well going into the Department of Agriculture and meeting there a most distinguished public servant&mdash;now retired from the service, I think&mdash;who had forgotten more about eggs than most other men ever knew. He was hurrying through the corridors of the Department of Agriculture with a hunted look in his eyes.  I stopped him and I said to him: &ldquo;Where is the hurry; where are you going?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;If you must know, Mr. Dillon, I am going to look for alternative markets for eggs, which I know do not exist but for which it is the Minister's policy to go on looking&rdquo;, and, faithfully <Col N="2048" /> and dutifully, he continued to look.</P>

      <P>This much is plain to see, we sell our agricultural surplus on the British market or we do not sell it at all.  Let us face that.  Lest I forget, I direct the Minister's attention specifically to the fact that there is a very considerable accumulation of potatoes in South Monaghan, largely created by the provision of a guaranteed price. Those potatoes are now becoming unsaleable.  There are not less than 2,000 tons which must be disposed of in the next month or they will go bad. That is in South Monaghan alone. There is no opportunity for the farmers who own them to export them and I would urge upon the Minister forthwith to remove the restrictions on the export of potatoes because there is a good market for these in Great Britain if we can export them now.</P>

    <P>We are subsidising butter production to the tune of £2,000,000 per annum. How long will that go on?  Do we expect butter to get dearer in the markets of the world?  Do we expect a time in the early future when the price of milk will become so adjusted that it will be possible to suspend this subsidy or do we intend to continue producing milk for conversion into butter in creameries at an annual cost to the taxpayer of £2,000,000 per annum?  I want it to go on record most emphatically that I think such a policy is sheer insanity and is purely pursued for the purpose of maintaining the prestige of incompetents in the offices of the Minister for Agriculture since Fianna Fáil came into power.  If butter cannot be produced for manufacture in creameries and sale to the public at a price which will not involve the community in a <Col N="2049" /> cost of 2/6 per lb. and the Exchequer in an annual grant of £2,000,000 the sooner we get out of producing butter through the medium of creameries for sale to the consumer the better it will be for the consumer and the men on whose lands the milk to make that butter is produced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment?  That is quite another problem.  The burden of my question is, is this policy of granting £2,000,000 per annum as a subsidy to the price of butter a permanent feature, because that permits the payment of only 1/2 per gallon for milk. Deputy Heskin says that anything less than 1/5 is uneconomic.  Well, £2,000,000 a year permits the payment of 1/2 with a retail selling price of 2/6 per lb. for butter.  If the Minister says this is merely to provide butter during the emergency when butter is not available from other sources of supply, that is another story.</P>

      <P>In times of emergency one must do the best one can.  I am looking forward to a period of permanency in our agricultural policy. Deputy Corry interjects: &ldquo;Where did all the wheat come from during the last six years?&rdquo; I say that 60 per cent. of it came from Great Britain.  The Deputy need not shake his gory locks at me.  These are the facts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that 60 per cent. of the wheat consumed here in the war years came largely in British bottoms and some of it in Irish ships from Canada and the United States by leave and licence of the British Government, and when the time came in the spring of this year when our people were no <Col N="2050" /> longer able to get Canadian wheat for the first time since the emergency, we had the enthralling, stimulating and surprising experience of eating bread made out of Irish wheat.  Before you ate it you had to hold it out in your hands, squeeze the water out of it, then tease it out and make up your mind whether it was a handful of boot polish or a handful of bread.  If it was boot polish you put it on your boots or shoes and if it was bread you tried to masticate it if you were fit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The astonishing thing is that that experience notwithstanding, still the ridiculous, idiotic attempt is made by the Fianna Fáil Party to maintain the fraud that we grew here all our wheat requirements.  We grew 40 per cent. of our requirements and the bulk of that 40 per cent. was grown on the lands of men who had refused to grow it in peace time, because they knew it would be foolish and uneconomic to do so, but in time of emergency they had their lands in good heart and fertility and they were able to grow wheat or any other crop that the community required in the circumstances in which we found ourselves. The boys who in earlier years had robbed their land of its fertility and sold it to the Land Commission before the war were not very much worried about growing wheat during the war years.  They got everything they could out of the land and then they sold the desert acres they had wrecked in the process of their plunder.  The farmers who had worked their land well according to sound methods of husbandry and who wanted no doles or grants from the Government prior to the war, had it in fit condition to grow wheat or any other crop when the emergency arose.  They grew up to 40 per cent. of our requirements and the remaining 60 per cent. came from abroad.  Without that 60 per cent. our people would have gone hungry and there was nothing we could do about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What, then, should be done to make <Col N="2051" /> this country prosperous for its farming community, to guarantee a high standard of living for the urban population and to ensure the major amenities to which a civilised population is entitled? There are two things we should do, one, to restore to the land of this country its ability to earn profits and, two, to eject the Fianna Fáil Government from office.  To-day we are primarily concerned with the first part of that enterprise. Our object should be to concentrate on the production for export of perishable agricultural products which we are in a position to deliver in a fresh condition in the British market. There is there a market capable of absorbing far more of that kind of produce than this country could ever hope in any circumstances to produce.  The capacity of that market will absorb all their own farmers and all our farmers can ever produce of that class of merchandise.</P>
    <P>If we play our hand well, we can ensure that the agricultural industry in Great Britain will be a vested interest working not only for itself but for us to ensure that nothing will be done by any other branch of the British Government to hinder the activities of the British Ministry of Agriculture in the interest of the farming community of Great Britain and, incidentally, in so far as that community will be made to depend upon us for raw materials, the agricultural community of this country.</P>
    <P>One of the principal raw materials which we are in a position to supply to the British farmer, and which no one else in this world can supply is store cattle.  If we can induce the British farmer to go in, in a big way, for the fattening of store cattle, we can ensure the creation of a huge investment by the British agricultural community in the equipment necessary for the fattening and finishing of cattle which will make it incumbent upon these farmers to safeguard our interests in their market because if we ever fail to deliver the store cattle which is the raw material of their fattening industry their huge investment will collapse because there is no alternative source of supply for them.  Further, the more dependent we make <Col N="2052" /> them upon us, the greater the volume of store cattle we deliver to the British farmers, the more enduring becomes the guarantee we have of permanent control of that immensely valuable market, 90 per cent. of the profit of which goes into the hands of the small farmer proprietor, living in Connaught, Donegal and South-West Munster.  That is the type of farmer in this country most vulnerable to disasters when they overtake the agricultural industry, because their margin is so narrow that any considerable disaster pushes them over the edge into the region of destitution.</P>
    <P>Secondly, our primary concern should be live-stock products&mdash;pigs, fowl, eggs, cream, bacon and other live-stock products&mdash;which we are peculiarly fitted by our geographical location to deliver into the British market in a fresh condition.  People may talk of refrigeration, chilling, of the quick freeze and of the hundred and one methods of preserving perishable agricultural products for the period required to ship them over a long distance to the centre of consumption. Many of these methods have great merits and great revolutions have taken place in their employment in the last 30 years, but this is certain: that no matter how good these systems are, refrigeration in any form reduces the quality of the product in some degree, great or small, below that of first quality fresh products.  There is a market for first quality products delivered in a fresh condition in Britain which, by our supreme effort, we could never hope adequately to supply.  If, however, we are to supply that market, then those who have charge of the task of producing supplies must have a reasonable prospect of earning a profit. However, I want to say particularly to Deputies on the Farmers' Benches: &ldquo;Do not become obsessed with price; price does not matter a row of pins.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It will be an instructive discussion if we go back three or four generations, but let us not go down to that level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If anyone wants to initiate an inquiry on those lines it can be followed, but I am concerned only to establish this principle from the point of view of people who do the work.  It is not the price but the profit that matters. If I offer a farmer in this country £10 for a pig and so rig the market for his meal, for his implements, for his machinery, for everything he has to use to produce that pig, so that the pig is going to cost him £10 10s. Od. to produce, is not that farmer losing 10/-for <Col N="2055" /> every pig?  But suppose I say to the farmer: &ldquo;Get your raw material wherever your skill enables you to get it.  Get the best quality you can find for the lowest price you are asked to pay&rdquo;, and if the price of the pig drops down on the market to £7, to a level that an unthinking person would deplore, the farmer is at least freed from strait-jacket restrictions and he would find that it cost him only £6 5s. Od. to buy the raw materials to fatten his £7 pig.  Suppose he fattens a dozen £7 pigs, he will take home with him £84 and he will have £9 profit, but if he fattens 12 of the £10 pigs, he would have £120 in his pocket and he would have lost £6.</P>
    <P>Now, do Deputies understand what I say when I tell them that the price is rigged?  The farmer is paid £120 into his hands and he thinks because he is getting a big sum of money that he is making a profit.  How often have I seen my own neighbours defrauded by that loathsome confidence trick?  How often have I seen the farmers' own leaders who have responsibility for keeping the farmers right and protecting them against their folly, say to the farmer: &ldquo;Look at the grand price you have got&rdquo;, but when Paddy Hogan&mdash;the Lord have mercy upon him&mdash;was Minister, and pigs were sold at 56/-, there was not a pig sold on which a profit was not made.  When pigs were. 56/-, I sold Indian meal for 4/-.  Not only did I sell the meal, but I fed the pigs, and I fattened them and I sold the bacon, and does anyone tell me that I sold these pigs without a profit?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You could give them away if you wanted to.  You have no sense anyway.  I bought them, I fattened them and I sold them as pigs and I sold them as bacon, and I assert here that from the day that man took office to the day when he was put out, <Col N="2056" /> there was not a pig fattened that did not pay a profit, albeit a small one, but the price was only one-third of what is available to-day.  Pigs were sold at 56/- then and you can get 168/- now. That is all every pig paid at the time, but the profit at 56/- then was better than the profit at 168/- at the present time.</P>
      <P>Now, does the Deputy understand what I say, that the price does not matter?  What matters is the profit, and it is because of the miller, the exploiter, those who want to live on the labour of the farmers of this country, that the profit to-day is so low.  It is time that the farmers of this country learned that lesson&mdash;that the exploiter does not give a damn about the price so long as he gets the cream and the farmer is content with the skim milk. But what makes me mad is that the people who profess to lead the farmers are telling their supporters that they are far better off with the skim milk than with the cream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why cannot we face those realities? Cannot we realise that to make agriculture prosperous in this country we have got to get the profits for the farmers?  I cannot control the price on the British market, nor can anybody else in this country.  We chose to leave the Imperial House of Commons and I glory in the fact that we made that choice.  We made it of our own free will.  By our own determination, we divested ourselves of our right to be heard in the British House of Commons about the price to be paid in Britain for Irish produce.  We did it with our eyes wide open and let us not repine and whine about that&mdash;we would do it again to-morrow if we had the choice, but we cannot control prices on the British market.  We can discuss and we can negotiate.  We can make the best bargain we possibly can, and try to get the best price we can and the most effective way to get the best price is to offer the best products and use the best marketing methods.  But the fact that we cannot control prices in the British markets is no reason whatever why we cannot ensure that our farmers will make a profit on their work.  What is the profit?  The profit is the difference between the cost of production and the price we get, the <Col N="2057" /> gap between one hand held over the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Though the price stayed there for ever that does not mean that we cannot increase the profit.  We can, by bringing down the cost of production. Why do our farmers want to do that by raising the price?  We cannot do it.  It is not in our power.  But we can widen the profit gap.  Why do not we do that, and we can do it to-morrow, there is nothing to stop us? The profit of the agricultural community at the present time is being absorbed by the taxes, quotas and restrictions which have been put on the raw materials of the industry by our own Government.</P>
      <P>Lots of people are inclined to say: &ldquo;My gracious me, most of the stuff our farmers are using does not come into the country at all; it is made here and does not pay any tariff.&rdquo;  It does not, but study the price charged by those who make it.  They raise the cost up to the highest penny which it is possible to do under the protection they get, and if the tariff is not sufficient to protect them from competition, they ask and succeed in getting from the Government a quota to prohibit imports at any price high or low, so that they will be guaranteed the opportunity of charging what they will and the farmers have to pay.</P>
      <P>We have a Prices Commission, of course.  This commission is designed to control their profits, we are told.  All my eye and Betty Martin.

      <P>I hear people continually clamouring in this House that the only hope for the whole community is an expansion of production. I quite agree.  Everybody <Col N="2058" /> acknowledges that if we are to finance the purchase from abroad of the things we must have to maintain industry and existence and a proper standard of living for our people we have no other currency than agricultural exports wherewith to pay.  How are we going to get that production? It is a perfectly simple answer.  There is one way to ensure that extra production and it is none the less excellent because it is not novel.  It is the method that put this suit of clothes on me.  It is the method that fed every Deputy of this House.  It is the method that enabled our fathers and mothers of many of us to raise families of six, ten and 12 children.  It is the method of allowing the farmers of this country to farm their own land in such a way as to earn a profit for themselves.  If we do that we will get ultimately from the land of this country all that the land of this country is capable of producing. If we deny it we can hold meetings, we can pass laws, we can make regulations, we can negotiate trade agreements or anything else we like, but if the man producing the stuff cannot earn a profit on his work we will not get the production and we will not be able to export.  If we hope to get profit in the only foreign market where we can hope to sell our exportable surplus we have got to compete with others who are free to send their produce into that market&mdash;Danes, New Zealanders, Australians, Dutch, Belgians, every one of whom can purchase the raw materials of their industry wherever they like at the cheapest price that they can get.  I am not tired of reminding this House of simple propositions which they never seem able to grasp.  We will accept the rough calculation that it takes 7 cwts. of meal to feed the pig from the weanling stage to the bacon pig. 2/6 per cwt. was put on Indian meal in this country by the operation of the maize meal mixture scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That means that if a farmer in this country fattened a pig and a Dane in Denmark fattened a pig, when the Dane brought his pig to London to sell it the Irishman will have had to spend seven times 2/6 more than the Dane had to spend in feeding his pig.  If the Dane spent £4 for his weanling <Col N="2059" /> and meal cost 10/- a cwt. his fat bacon pig would cost him £4 plus £3 10s., i.e., £7 10s., and if he wanted to make 10/-profit on the pig he could sell it in London for £8.  The Irishman bought his weanling pig for £4 and 7 cwt. of meal for which he had to pay £3 10s. plus 17s. 6d., i.e. £4 7s. 6d.  His pig cost him £8 7s. 6d. to have ready for sale.  When he went to London with his pig he had to sell the pig for the same price as the Dane.  The Dane had 10/-profit on his pig and when the Irishman sold his pig both the Dane and the Irishman had got the same price but the price does not matter because the price meant a profit of 10/- for the Dane but a loss of 7/6 for the Irishman.</P>

      <P>No.  Entry would be prohibited. And, sure we would be lonesome for them.  I see Deputy McCarthy looking vexed as though I made little of him.  I would be deeply distressed if he or the likes of him did not exist in our midst.  I like the Orangemen in Belfast, and the daftees from all sides. They are characteristic of the community in which we live.  Sometimes they are a costly luxury, but so far as Deputy McCarthy or the likes of him are concerned, I consider that he gives more value than anything he ever cost this community&mdash;possibly not in the sphere of politics but in the wide range of his other everyday activities.  I hope he will find it in his heart to say as much for me.  We have a splendid market to which we can export an abundance of pigs and bacon if we go the right way about it and enable the pig to be produced at a profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sometimes charged with taking a poor view of industries.  The greatest industry we have in this country is one that uses an immense quantity of native produce.  I refer to the beer, porter <Col N="2060" /> and stout industry.  It has no protection, no tariffs, no quotas, no monopoly. Just a group of men who wanted to earn profit legitimately went into the open market to buy barley, bought it, and sold their porter wherever they could find customers to pay the price for it.  They employ a vast number of our fellow-citizens at good wages and provide a valuable export for this country-founded on the growth of barley.  Such industries are a blessing not only to those who enjoy the profits earned in them but to those who grow the raw material for their processes and to those who receive the wages which they earn from them.</P>
    <P>I want to see the output of eggs steadily increasing.  Deputy Beirne sometimes feels that it is unreasonable for the British to say: &ldquo;We will give you so much for your eggs, but if you increase production above a certain figure we are prepared to pay an even higher price for the whole lot.&rdquo;  Surely that is not an unreasonable proposal. What unfairness is there in that proposal from the Deputy's point of view? Suppose the consignees said to us: &ldquo;No matter what the number of the eggs we will only pay you the lower price.&rdquo;  What would we reply&mdash;that we will send them to Antwerp&mdash;to an alternative market?</P>

      <P>I am addressing the Assembly at large.  It seems to me the most fantastic proposition to say <Col N="2061" /> that not only are we entitled to bespeak a market for our eggs but that we are entitled to fix the price in that market and to say that anything below that price is a grievance.  There is no obligation on us to send any goods to Great Britain.  If we do not like the price, we need not send them.  I think it is a foolish approach, because if you have two men trying to do a business deal and one sees that he is always on the defensive and is always inclined to say that he is being exploited and ill-treated, an atmosphere grows up which makes the business impossible.  If the British do not pay us a price which seems to us fair and reasonable, there is no law that I know of which constrains us to send them our produce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the dilemma. There is no use in pretending, if we have no alternative market, albeit that we should try to find one to the best of our ability, that that puts a moral obligation on the British to give us a higher price than they want to give.  Their moral obligation is to offer us what appears to them to be a fair price.  Do not let us turn ourselves into public objects of charity to everybody with whom we do business.  We do not have to be; we never were. This is the new philosophy, this business of going around and saying: &ldquo;It is very unfair that they do not give us more.&rdquo;  We have traded with the outside world for a thousand years.  Since when has it become necessary for us to crawl on our stomachs to everybody who buys anything from us and say: &ldquo;You are not being fair.  You are not giving us enough.&rdquo;  If we do not like the offer, then tell them to go to blazes, that we will not send them our goods; but let us stand up on our hind legs and not be begging them of their kindness and love for us to give us a few shillings more.  To hell with their few shillings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My position is that, given a chance, we can supply the British or anyone else who wants to deal with us with better value for their money than any other country in the world.  If they do not want to take it, so much the worse <Col N="2062" /> for the British; they are passing up a good bargain, value for their money. If they want to make it impossible for us to offer them at a competitive price that high quality we are able to produce, that is their funeral.  All we can do is to show that we are ready to supply them with better value than anybody else.  The British are no fools. They will buy the best value they can get and make no compliment of it. That is the basis on which I want to do business.</P>
    <P>The last things I want to mention are these: First, we should remove tariffs, quotas and restrictions on feeding-stuffs, artificial manure, agricultural machinery, agricultural implements and all other commodities which constitute the raw materials of the agricultural industry.  Secondly, our line of country should be to find out what class of commodity our principal customer most urgently needs and concentrate upon the production of these things of the highest possible quality at the lowest possible price.  I believe that that category of perishable agricultural produce which we should be in a position to supply to the British market will cover all the things they require.  Thirdly, we should concentrate in so far as we can on persuading our people to mechanise the agricultural industry.  It is no longer possible to compete in the markets of the world with manual labour.  The only place that manual labour is going to be cheap in the hereafter is under such administrations as the Nazi and the Bolshevik, where you take humanity against whom you have a prejudice and use them as you would the lowest kind of animal; worse, you use them to work them to death and to bury them when they fall.  That is the only basis upon which manual labour can be used in any bulk production operation and that is a basis which, please God, will never be accepted by our people.  If we want to pay the agricultural labourers a living wage, the only way we can do it is to take them off the graip and the spade and put them on the tractor and the agricultural machine, so that one man using modern equipment to-morrow can do the work of four men using primitive tools of husbandry years ago, and thus <Col N="2063" /> become entitled to the sort of wage that agricultural workers have long ago secured in Great Britain, the market where we will be selling the bulk of our production.</P>
    <P>The fourth and last thing is to provide for the education of those who intend to live upon the land.  If a farmer's son wants to learn Latin or Greek or history or literature, there is in the diocese where he was born a diocesan college to which his parents can send him and from which he can earn for himself a scholarship.  I want to see established in every diocese a diocesan agricultural college to which every boy who is prepared to present Irish in his national school-leaving certificate will entitle himself thereby to a scholarship.  In that college he will learn how best to operate the kind of farm which he is destined to inherit from his parents, the present occupants. At the same time, I want to see established in every parish a parochial school for girls, the school-leaving age for every girl to be raised from 14 to 15, with the proviso that, when the children in the national schools reach the age of 13, the girls will cease to attend the national schools, but will be gathered up by school buses into the parochial school, where they will continue to attend until they are 15 years of age, there completing their education in the three R's and such other academic subjects as will be provided, but, at the same time, getting during the last two years of their school course a thorough grounding in the fundamentals of housewifery in all its branches, so that when they go home from school they can become competent apprentices to their practical mothers and so grow into that type of woman who will make of an Irish farmer's home the kind of place into which he will be proud to bring his friends without any notice and to which, all his working day, he will long for the hour at which he is permitted to return.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture on nothing.  I think he and his Party are a catastrophe.  I think that so long as he is there we will get nowhere.  If I did not believe that I <Col N="2064" /> was talking to a wider audience than that represented by the Minister and his supporters, it would be a waste of breath to say a word here.  It is because this House provides a forum for endless repetition that one may hope to educate those who are still ignorant and to inform those who labour under illusions, such as Deputy Ó Britain does, as to the true nature of what they are doing, that we here on the Opposition Benches continue to discharge the very tedious work which this Opposition is called upon to do.  I do not despair.  Corruption, intimidation, fraud and every device of Parliamentary and political trickery has undoubtedly dug the Fianna Fáil Party deeply into the political life of this country.  All that could be said of Tammany Hall in the Island of Manhattan. It is comforting to remember that Boss Tweedy ended in Sing-Sing, and Boss Croker in Dundrum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Almost every Deputy who has spoken so far has referred to the necessity of our having an export market, with the addendum that live stock represent possibly our only real export.  I realise that at this stage it would be impossible for any Deputy to speak without reiterating to a great extent what has already been said by other members in this House.  I propose, however, to spend some little time talking about cattle.  Possibly I may advance some ideas that have not already been expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in his short opening address, said that it was his intention to set up a consultative council to inquire into the working of the Live Stock Breeding Act of 1925.  The main purpose of that Act, as the Minister said, was to do away with the scrub bull.  I do not know what the terms of reference are going to be of this council and I would have been glad if the Minister could have given us some indication as to what they will be.  Will it be their function to determine what policy we should pursue in the future in regard to our live stock, or whether we are to abandon one particular form of agricultural operations in respect of live stock, such as dairying, and go in for another branch of live-stock breeding&mdash;say, the fattening of cattle and so <Col N="2065" /> on?  We have no indication as to whether this particular council will determine these matters.</P>
    <P>Almost every Deputy has referred to the slaughter of calves and expressed regret that such should happen in this agricultural country.  All this is bound up in the live stock question and if it is proposed that the council should examine all these matters the terms of reference will have to be very wide indeed and I can quite visualise that the deliberations of such a council will take a very long time.  Possibly when the time comes and they furnish their report and recommendations that report and those recommendations will meet with the fate of other reports and recommendations in the last 15 or 20 years, and will never be implemented.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred at the end of his speech to what he thought was the best thing we could do for agriculture in this country now.  He said that the best thing we could do was to knock the shackles off the farmer and let him pursue his own business untrammelled. I agree with Deputy Dillon in that.  I believe that the farmer himself is the best judge of the particular type of agriculture in which he ought to indulge.</P>
    <P>For over 100 years the dairy farmers of this country pursued a policy of dairying founded on the Shorthorn and they pursued that policy successfully. They produced sufficient butter for the population of this country at a time when that population was three times what it is to-day.  Admittedly, we never supported that 8,000,000 but the 8,000,000 were there and a certain percentage of them ate butter.  Possibly it was a small percentage and no doubt the bulk of the population in those days subsisted mainly on milk and potatoes.  They exported the grain they grew.  But for 100 years the farmers carried on their dairying business founded on the dairy Shorthorn. They produced the finest stores in the world and they exported them to England.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that I am blowing my own trumpet when I say that I was to some extent instrumental in making Mr. Hogan, the then Minister for Agriculture, agree with my opinion in <Col N="2066" /> regard to milk production with that particular type of dairy Shorthorn. For three or four years after I entered the Dáil I was continually in consultation with Mr. Hogan in connection with the passing of the Live Stock Breeding Act and the effect it was having on the dairy stock all over the country.  Mr. Hogan, being a broad-minded man&mdash;as I hope this Minister is too&mdash;eventually came to the conclusion that there was something in what I said and that the Act had not the effect of improving the cattle as far as dairying was concerned and was problematical in its effect as far as the store trade of the country was concerned. We produced for 100 years&mdash; and this has never been refuted&mdash;the best Shorthorn cattle in the world.  We produced the cow giving 600 gallons of milk, the best calf and the best store to be found in any market in the world.  According to statistics we are unable to-day to produce a cow yielding more than 380 or 400 gallons on an average.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the Hereford, the Black and, to a lesser extent, some other breeds mingled with the Shorthorn have gradually produced a type of beast that can only be described as a mongrel.  You cannot go on breeding mongrels from mongrels without producing a type of beast quite useless for any purpose.  If horses and donkeys are mated together they produce either mules or jennets, and both are mongrels. Neither of them can reproduce themselves, though they are admirable quadrupeds in their own ways and are in some respects superior to the horse or the ass from which they derive. Luckily, however, nature ordains that they cannot breed.  In that way the horse population of the world was saved the indignity that we to-day are trying to inflict on the cattle population of our country.  I say that we are producing mongrels, and anybody who studies the question will have to agree with me in that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>In the West of Ireland it was common some years ago-and I <Col N="2067" /> believe it is to-day&mdash;to see very handsome animals, black bodies, polled, white faces, lumps of fat&mdash;beautiful animals. You will not see the same type of beast there to-day as you would ten or 15 years ago, when the Act came into operation, because the second generation of mongrels is inferior to the first and the third generation is still worse. If we are to pursue that line of breeding, we will eventually arrive at a class of cattle useless either for dairying or for export purposes.  We have the cattle breeders lamenting that they find a difficulty in getting sufficient cattle of a certain quality for export. In the fairs anyone familiar with cattle breeding will find the number of good cattle is small and the number of scrub animals, mongrels, is very great.  We brought in an Act to do away with the scrub bull and we substituted a mongrel live-stock population.  It is time we did away with that.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the slaughter of calves.  The fact is that this Government has adopted a policy that has ruined our live-stock trade.  We have not sufficient cattle to export.  To add to our misfortunes, there is an arrangement with Britain.  Whether it was Britain made the arrangement and forced it on us, I do not know, but the arrangement was that Britain would take only our mature stock and the immature stock, the calves and the yearlings, were to be left on our dairy farmers' hands.  The man who pursued the policy of fattening cattle did not want to wait two or three years to fatten a calf.  He wanted to get something that would suit the British market, and so the calf was left on the dairy farmers' hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dairy farmer did not want him either, because he could not keep him. The small dairy farmer was in the position that he could feed his calf for eight months, but then he was forced to sell because he could not keep him over the winter.  The operation of the compulsory tillage scheme added to his difficulties, because whatever chance an odd one had of keeping a beast in winter, he had none at all then, as the best of the pasture land had to be tilled. So he ceased to rear calves and numerous <Col N="2068" /> calves were slaughtered.  The farmers found that having raised a calf and fed it on whole milk and then on separated milk and other foods, when they came to sell it in October or November they could not get a price commensurate with the cost of the food, not to talk of any value for the beast itself.</P>
    <P>That was the position in regard to calves.  How will it be got over? These are some of the things I want the Minister to deal with.  I am sorry he has left the House, and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary is taking some note of what I am saying.  I want to impress on the Minister the desirability of preparing terms of reference for the consultative council he proposes to establish.  If that council merely considers the operation of the Live Stock Breeding Act, or has to determine whether one kind of bull is better than another, then it might as well never have been set up.</P>
    <P>Not all the difficulties in relation to breeding cattle have arisen from the difficulty of producing a bull.  In the breeding of cattle, just as in the breeding of any other animals, the dam is as important as the sire.  It does not matter a button to me if I had all the inspectors coming down to a sale and picking out what they considered the best bull.  Nine times out of ten they do not consider correctly, compared with the verdict of the majority of farmers.  But even if they were infallible and always picked out the right animal, it would not follow that that bull, mated with an indiscriminate kind of heifer, would produce good store cattle.</P>
    <P>The dam is more important than the sire.  All the great breeders of race-horses think so, and they have gone more intimately into breeding than any other breeders of animals, if we except dogs.  Breeders of race-horses and dogs have gone more intimately into the science of breeding than any other people.  Most of them, in describing the pedigree of a horse or dog, will go down the female line for generations and they regard it as of more importance than the sire line. We have concentrated on producing our stock from the angle of the male progenitor, a wholly fallacious method of <Col N="2069" /> breeding cattle or any other animals. We did not stop at that.  We allowed intermingling of breeds, thus producing the mongrel type.  If that is allowed to go on, it will result in our cattle population getting to the stage that they will be useless for dairying or export purposes.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to suggest a remedy.  I do not suppose I would be responsible for giving the remedy, and I do not suppose the consultative council will provide the remedy.  But there must be some attempt to find one.  We must, first of all, improve the breed of cattle and, secondly, we must stop the slaughter of young cattle which is proceeding. As regards the first point, I am of the opinion that, in the dairying counties, the Hereford and the black Aberdeen-Angus bull should be prohibited. We should get back to our foundation breed of Shorthorn cattle. Luckily, there are enough of the female line of good Shorthorn cattle to preserve our breed if we do not allow the deterioration to go any further.  There are enough Shorthorn heifers in this country to preserve the breed if we do it now, but if we wait for four or five years, I warn the House it will be too late, because we will have let the type deteriorate beyond redemption.</P>
    <P>I have been speaking more or less in this strain for the past five or six years. I was not listened to; very little attention was paid to what I said.  If anybody cares to look up the debates he will find I referred to this matter. Every year the position was getting worse until the cattle dealers and various groups of people took it up. Now it has become the topic of conversation where cattlemen of any grade gather together.</P>
    <P>As I said, I believe we ought to get back altogether to the Shorthorn in the dairying districts.  If it is desirable to produce Herefords or Aberdeen Anguses, they must be produced in some other part of the country distant from the dairying districts.  When I say distant, I mean that there must be a province between them because our country is so small that you cannot have the segregation of cattle which would be desirable if you are to prevent cross-breeding, in a narrow district. It would be impossible so to <Col N="2070" /> arrange matters, say, in the Counties of Limerick and Tipperary that cattle born in one county would not mingle with cattle born in the other.  It might be arranged that cattle in Roscommon or Sligo could be segregated from the dairy cattle in the dairying parts of the county.  If we are going to continue dual purpose operations in regard to live-stock farming&mdash;that is producing butter for our people and, if possible, for export, and producing as we have done up to the present store cattle of good quality&mdash;to my mind we have got to get back to the perfection of the Shorthorn.  We cannot do that or we will not do that so long as we allow the intermingling of the various breeds, Herefords, Anguses and several other breeds.  That intermingling produces the mongrels we all know.</P>
    <P>As an illustration of what I mean, I may say that for years I have gone in for cow-testing.  It is an excellent operation and it enables you to find out the bad milker from the good milker, but most people are able to do that for themselves.  I have gone to a great deal of trouble to get the best heifers and to get them registered eventually as milkers by the Department. I have a great number of registered cows, luckily.  One of my cows had twin calves last year.  She is a cow about six years old and had a very good record as a milker&mdash;apparently a good specimen of a Shorthorn cow, but there was a throw-back in her case. One of the calves was black.  Where did the black colour come from?  It did not come from the bull because he was not black.  It came from the throw-back, from some intermingling of generations ago, probably 15 or 20 years ago&mdash;some throw-back to the Polled Angus species.  The mixing of breeds is coming out now after generations. Probably some people will say that I am giving a lecture in eugenics, but I am not.  I am telling what will happen in the cattle trade if the Minister is not active.  Deputy Fagan, who is more conversant with developments in the cattle industry than any Deputy in the House, will probably speak afterwards, and I think he will confirm what I said in regard to the deterioration of the Shorthorn breed as we know it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2071" /> I said that I was going to prove that in this county for a hundred years we produced a Shorthorn cow capable of producing 600 gallons of milk, and at the same time an excellent type for export purposes.  I think I can now give references to confirm that statement. I do not know that there are many Deputies in the Dáil, outside Deputy Carter and myself, who can remember the period prior to the introduction of the creameries, but in my county and in Tipperary, before the creameries were instituted, nobody would think of keeping a cow unless she produced three firkins of butter in the year.  Probably three and a half firkins would be the average for each cow.  A firkin of butter weighs something like 70 pounds, so that the average production of butter per cow was 225 pounds.  That butter was produced by the primitive methods in vogue at that particular time, because there were no separators, of setting the milk in a pan and skimming it.  It took something about three gallons of milk to make a pound of butter, so that, allowing three firkins for each cow, it meant that each cow produced over 600 gallons of milk each year. Whatever arguments there may be about that, there can be no argument whatever that we produced the best store cattle in the world.</P>
    <P>In conversation at one time with the late Mr. Hogan I put these facts to him, and he asked me whether I could confirm the claim that we produced better store cattle from our Shorthorn dairy cattle in these days than we did at the time I was speaking to him.  I said that I believed that I could and I suggested that he should consult the late Deputy Dwyer, who was connected with one of the largest firms of cattle traders in the country.  Deputy Dwyer was sent for and we put the question to him whether the operation of the Live Stock Breeding Act had or had not improved the breed of cattle in the country.  He said that in some districts, like the Dingle Peninsula and the West of Ireland, where there had been bad cattle, the introduction of the Hereford and the Polled Angus had produced an improvement but that <Col N="2072" /> in counties like Limerick, where we always had the Shorthorn breed, no improvement had been brought about by the Act.</P>
    <P>At one time I happened to be one of the owners of the largest fairs in County Limerick where the Dwyers and the O'Connors of Charleville and other big cattle buyers came to purchase yearlings in the month of May.  I mentioned to Deputy Dwyer that I remembered the time when Jimmy Dwyer was a young man and came with his father and his uncle to that fair.  I recalled getting tolls for 625 yearlings from the Dwyer Brothers and at the same time getting tolls for over 400 yearlings from the O'Connors&mdash;that is tolls for a thousand yearlings from two sets of buyers. I asked Deputy Dwyer in the course of cur conversation how long it would take him to put 1,000 of such yearlings together now&mdash;&ldquo;now&rdquo; being 15 years back&mdash;and he said it could not be done. It was impossible then even though the Act had been only in operation a short time.  That class of cattle does not now exist.  We bred them out, but we can get back to them.  Luckily, we have enough of good Shorthorn heifers to resuscitate the breed if we do it now, and if we prevent the further infiltration of the Hereford and the Aberdeen Angus and such breeds into the dairy districts.  I put this to the Minister as forcibly as I put it to his predecessor, but the only reference his predecessor made to it in his reply was when he said that I made a remark that even the Dairy Shorthorn Society which purports to interest itself in the dairy Shorthorn breed was permitting the sale of Herefords and blacks at their, sales, and the only remark the Minister made in 1946 was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy Bennett said many Herefords and Aberdeen Angus are sold at sales organised by the Irish Dairy Shorthorn Society.  I wonder if Deputy Halliden will agree to that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Deputy Halliden, who happens to be secretary of the Dairy Shorthorn Breeders' Association, is not in the House, because I want to reiterate to-day what I said last year. It is lamentable that a society in which I have a very profound interest, which is concerned mainly and I <Col N="2073" /> should say wholly, with the resuscitation of the Shorthorn breed in this country, should permit and encourage, and I am afraid, induce the sale of Herefords and Aberdeen Angus at the same sale and on the same day as they hold their own sales, and this is done every year.  If such a society leads the way where are we going to find our selves?  I say it can only be done from the Ministry.  I hope the Ministry will request this particular consultative council to determine whether we are going to continue dairying, and say what remedy they suggest to improve the milk breed and at the same time produce a good calf for export, or if they believe this cannot be done, whether we are going to abandon dairying altogether, and go in for production of the meaty, small, rounded beast, the cross between the Hereford and the blacks such as is common in some parts of Ireland. These are the vital questions we have to determine.  The Minister has not referred to them and he appears to be ignorant of them.  There is one other question.  References have been made to the scarcity of cattle and to the unfortunate slaughter of calves.  I say it was as a result of the fact that the farmer could not sell his yearlings at a profit.  You could not blame him. He is not going to run his neck into the halter altogether.</P>
    <P>References have been made to making a good working agreement with Britain.  I agree with it.  It should be quite possible for two contiguous countries like ourselves to make such an agreement, and I believe there is no man better fitted to do it than the present Minister.  He is a courageous man who is ready to face up to difficulties. The last Minister for Agriculture was a timid man.  If the present Minister for Agriculture has any other fault he is not timid, and I do not see why he should not take a trip over the Irish sea and have a heart-to-heart talk with his fellow-Minister in Britain.</P>
    <P>Knowing our Minister for Agriculture, I am quite confident that the other gentleman is not going to have it all his own way, as far as scowls and cross-looks across a table are concerned and something good may result.  There is an arrangement at the present <Col N="2074" /> moment but it is a one-sided affair. Under this arrangement the British will take our cattle, our first-class store cattle, at a certain price; they will not take them at any other price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not mar eadh me. The last Minister for Agriculture made a certain kind of apologia for it, that it was the best thing he could do and that we could not get a price they would not give.  He suggested it could not be done.  Well, you can do a lot if you get down and argue your point from the other side of the table as a farmer does with a cattle trader at a fair.  As I said, we got the worst of the deal.  Britain will take first-class animals&mdash;mind you first-class and no other.  They are not going to take your young cattle.  Let you mature them and sell them then.  We have to say &ldquo;All right, we will give them&rdquo; and we are giving them our first-class matured cattle at 7/6 per cwt. less than they are worth to the British farmer.  At least, the British farmer is getting for two months' feeding 7/6 per cwt. more than we are selling them for and the value of the extra weight he puts on.  I do not know if the Minister ever realised that but if he is an honest man he will admit it.  A three-quarter finished beast puts up a lot of weight in two months, perhaps a hundredweight, so that the British farmer is getting the value of an extra hundredweight of beef which is worth about £6 in England and 7/6 per cwt. on the whole 12 cwts, a total of probably more than the Irish farmer has got for feeding the animal for 12 months.  That is the arrangement we subscribed to and we are still subscribing to it but it can be amended if the Minister gets courage and sits at the other side of the table with the British Minister for Agriculture.  But the Minister will not do it, although as I said he is a courageous man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister spoke of the pig <Col N="2075" /> trade he said that legislation would not help us very much.  He said he was holding his horse.  He is a wise man waiting to see what will turn up but maybe he will go on holding his horse until it is too late.  Holding a horse could be a dangerous occupation sometimes because the horse might take the bit in his teeth and run away.  I would advise the Minister that he might drop the bridle for a while and see what he could do by getting on the horse and riding him to the market.</P>
    <P>It is a curious fact that when we were discussing the operation of the Live Stock Breeding Act the Northern Government should be considering the same thing and this morning the report of the committee they set up was issued.  Mind you it bears out to a great extent much of what I had been saying here.  They remarked in their report that too much attention had been given in recent years to beef qualities in their cattle and they said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is important that this tendency should be reversed; but, provided the primary emphasis is on milk, we recommend that official policy should continue to recognise the dairy Shorthorn as the foundation breed of the country....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Northern Ireland has never been noted as a great dairying area but nevertheless it is recommended by the committee that the tendency should be reversed in regard to attention to beef qualities in the Shorthorn.  Here we pride ourselves on our production of dairy products, yet we are allowing other breeds to become popular at the expense of the Shorthorn, so popular that we are producing a mixed breed of cattle.  The Northern Ireland farmer is not going to have that if his Department of Agriculture can stop it.</P>
    <P>The committee recommended that the foundation breed must be the Shorthorn breed.  They go on to say that the foundation cattle stock of Ulster should be developed from English dairy Shorthorn bulls.  I quite agree with most of what they said but I think we can very effectively provide the Shorthorn bull ourselves.  We can still provide a bull capable of producing the best Shorthorns in the world. <Col N="2076" /> They recommend very strongly something that Deputy Dillon spent half an hour deriding here, something he tried to force down the throats of the members of this House as being dangerous to farmers &mdash; guaranteed prices for agricultural products.</P>
    <P>In the second section on agricultural marketing and processing the report recommends very strongly that the Government should continue in the future the policy of guaranteed prices for all the major products sold off the farm.  Such prices should not be related to consumer prices, but should be based upon the prices considered necessary to call forth the production required from home sources, regard being had to the need for maintaining a prosperous and well-balanced industry. I agree with those sentiments so much that I might have written them myself.  Deputy Dillon outlined the policy of fixed prices for agricultural products.  He said the price does not matter.  Deputy Dillon was fallacious in his argument.  I do not want to go into that technical matter now, but to say that the price does not matter is ridiculous.  He went on to argue that though the price does not matter, what does matter is that if the price of one thing goes up the price of something else follows.  He did not expect us to swallow the story that the price, anyhow, did not matter.</P>
    <P>We have here a competent body of men set up by the Northern Government recommending that they should continue in the future the policy of guaranteed prices for all major products sold off the farm.  That applies to the people in the North of Ireland, but we in the Twenty-Six Counties have an even greater reason for asking for them than the Northern Ireland farmer because, luckily for the Northern Ireland farmer, the raw materials and the other essentials he requires are not taxed to the extent that the Éire farmers' purchases are indirectly taxed.  He is saved from a lot of that yet, even in such circumstances, he needs guaranteed prices. We certainly need them until such time as the prices of other commodities which the farmer purchases come down. I do not believe they will ever come down while we have a high tariff policy <Col N="2077" /> here.  I wish to make one or two other remarks in regard to cattle.  Someone has already said in this debate that we ought to export nothing but fully finished cattle&mdash;that we should fatten them here and sell them.  As a farmer of very many years' standing, as a producer of all sorts of cattle, and as a seller, I do not agree.  I believe that our best policy lies in the export of the highest quality stores which is what we are doing at the moment.  It will pay us better than exporting beef because anybody who has anything to do with the feeding of cattle knows that the last pound of flesh is the dearest to produce.  In other words, that when you have a beast at least three-quarters fat, it is costing more to put the other quater on than it took to put on half of what is already on.  That is a well recognised fact especially to anybody who is at all familiar with the feeding of cattle.  For that reason, it would pay us better to sell our cattle when they are nearly fat; in other words, first-class stores, as we are selling them.</P>
    <P>The food that would be necessary to produce the last few pounds of fat would go a long way towards furthering the next batch of stores to the proper condition.  That is my belief. I believe it will be backed by a great volume of opinion and by people who have any knowledge of the live-stock industry.  It may be that I am wrong, but anyhow it is my opinion that it would pay us better to develop the store cattle end rather than the beef cattle end and that, in the long run, we would gain more by it.  Of course, it will always be necessary to fatten a great many cattle for ourselves at home and probably in the winter months, if we are going to manure our lands, to in-feed cattle.  Luckily that is not necessary in County Limerick, but it is elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I think that we will have to in-feed cattle in some districts for the primary purpose of producing manure for the lands.  Even there they will find that the last pound of flesh is the dearest to produce and that it would probably pay them to get a customer to buy at the seven-eighth fat stage.  Those are some of the things which will have to be considered <Col N="2078" /> if we are going to make any arrangements with Britain, as I hope we are, for a long-term policy.  I believe a policy could be arranged with them for say five years ahead.  Arrangements could be made in regard to prices and to the quantities we could provide them with and which they could take from us.  If we knew these particular matters five years ahead it would have a great effect on production in this country.  If farmers knew that definitely they were going to get a market for a certain quantity of eggs, animals, etc., at a certain profitable price an effort would be made to produce them. However, an effort must first and foremost be made to arrange that market.  I believe that the Minister has the courage of his convictions.  I believe that he should go across to England and make an agreement with the British Minister for Agriculture.  They are desirous of getting our cattle as we are of selling them.  They want to purchase our live stock just as much as we want to sell it.  Our live stock is indispensable to them.  They cannot replace it by sending goods to any part of the world, but they are bluffing the Minister and his advisers and they are winning every time.  They are the greatest poker players in the world.  It is time their bluff was called.  If the Minister is strong and effective enough to face up to it he will do so.</P>
    <P>I have said most of what I meant to say in regard to the cattle policy of this country, but I should like to say one other word.  Somebody has advanced the proposition that we cannot produce a Shorthorn beast in this country to provide 600 gallons of milk and at the same time produce a good store beast.  It was done in past years and will be done again and, in fact, I believe it is being done now.  I see here from the interim report of the Advisory Agricultural Committee who considered all these points that it was in fact being done in my own county. As I said, luckily for us the foundation stock in good heifers and calves is still there to preserve the Shorthorn breed all over the country, if we make an attempt to do it now.  They are there in the County Limerick, but they are being sullied every day by the introduction <Col N="2079" /> of the Hereford and the black. The foundation stock of heifers and cows is there, but it will not be there in three years' time if the Minister does not make an effort to preserve it.</P>
    <P>This report dealing with the production of milk all over the country and which states that the average production is about 400 gallons per cow or less, admits that the production in Limerick is probably about 640 gallons per cow, but that the actual amount sent to the creameries over a period of seven or eight years up to 1942 averaged about 486.5 gallons per cow.  That was milk sent to the creameries.  That did not take into account the milk kept by the farmers for themselves or for the feeding of calves.  They state it is right to assume that the production of milk in the dairying County of Limerick was over 600 gallons of milk per cow, which is greater than any other county. My suggestion is that the foundation Shorthorn stock of heifers and cows is there in Limerick, but that it will not be there in three years' time if the Minister does not take some steps in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>So many aspects of our agricultural policy and activities have been covered in the course of the debate that I do not intend to travel over that broad field now.  Instead, I want to concentrate my brief remarks on two net issues arising out of our agricultural activities, and they relate to the wages and conditions of employment of agricultural workers.  During the past seven years in particular, we have all been compelled to acknowledge the indispensable character of the work and service rendered to the nation by the agricultural worker.  We have been compelled to acknowledge that, even though our Defence Forces might not be as strong as we would wish them to be, nevertheless, on the economic field and in the realm of agriculture we had been able to establish a very solid front, a front which ensured, at all events, that the nation could be saved from starvation and that, however much it might be besieged <Col N="2080" /> by external forces, it still had within its own territory reserves capable of sustaining the nation on the economic front.</P>
      <P>During all those years we have paid lip-service to the agricultural worker. We have told him how he manned the &ldquo;beárna baoghal&rdquo;.  We have told him how his magnificent efforts were able to succour the nation during its worst difficulties.  We told the agricultural worker that he was the one man on whom the nation relied to see it through a crisis.  We told him that the nation would be grateful to him.  These were cheap words, but they were dishonest words.  We never meant a single one of them.  They were used just to ensnare the agricultural worker into giving of his best to the nation in producing the maximum quantity of food possible.  In all that effort to produce what the nation required in foodstuffs, the agricultural worker thought little of his own requirements, little of his wife's requirements and little of his children's requirements in the task of trying to produce for the nation the quantity of food necessary to sustain it in a beleaguered position.</P>
      <P>To-day, we find the agricultural worker in receipt of a wage of 50/- per week.  That represents the monument of gratitude which we have erected in our minds and our hearts to the agricultural worker.  That represents our concept of the life the agricultural worker ought to enjoy.  That represents what we think is the human value of the agricultural worker and his wife and children.  That represents what we think is his value to the nation. That represents our measure of gratitude, a mean and miserable measure of gratitude, to those who have given of their best to the nation in its darkest hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine that wage of 50/- per week in 1947.  Is there any Deputy who would like to see himself compelled to exist on a wage of 50/- per week?  Is there any Deputy who would like to see his wife providing for herself and children on 50/- a week?  Is there any Deputy who has a recipe for living in Ireland, even in rural Ireland, on a wage of 50/- per week?  Will anybody in this House have the audacity to stand up and say that life on <Col N="2081" /> 50/- per week to-day, even in rural Ireland, represents the concept of the Ireland which they envisaged in other years when this nation was struggling for freedom?  Yet the measure of the way in which we use our freedom is that whilst, as Deputy Dillon said, we provide millions for the millers, untold wealth for every profiteer in this country, dividends undreamed of accruing to wealthy investors, the backbone of this whole nation, the agricultural worker, the food producer, is compelled to subsist on the miserable wage of 50/- per week.</P>
    <P>We vaunt our Christianity and we talk about our Christian Constitution. While we are busy talking and vapouring about our Christian Constitution and our Christian outlook and our Christian manner of life we let the millers away with millions, and the miserable shillings are doled out to the agricultural workers.  In 1947 50/- a week represents our Christian concept of life for those who saved the nation during the emergency and for those who are striving to save the nation to-day.  To what does that 50/-amount?</P>
    <P>Recently, the Minister for Industry and Commerce acknowledged that the pre-war pound is now worth only 10/-. It is worth less to-day because the cost of living has jerked up another ten points in the last three months.  Let us assume the present worth is 10/-for the purpose of argument.  We are giving to the agricultural workers to-day 25/- a week on 1939 standards. We know the outcry there was in this House against the wage of 24/- a week paid by the Board of Works on relief schemes, designed to relieve endemic poverty and destitution.  To-day, making an appropriate adjustment and at this time when everybody with wealth is getting away with all the loot they can get into their pockets, we give the agricultural worker 25/- a week and, at the same time, we hypocritically tell him that we appreciate his services and admire the magnificent work he is doing for the nation.  Is it any wonder that the agricultural workers are in the poverty-stricken condition in which they are to-day?  Go into the house of any agricultural worker and see the <Col N="2082" /> condition of his home.  Look at the clothes he is compelled to wear.  Look at the clothes his wife and children are compelled to wear.  Look at the general domestic standard of living in that man's house.  Then you can see, whatever else we have done during the emergency from the standpoint of making the miller wealthy, we certainly grossly and shamelessly neglected to provide a fair remuneration for the agricultural worker.  In fact, his wage is less than 25/- per week to-day, because many of the commodities he has to purchase have increased more substantially in his particular type of domestic budget than for any other class in the community.  Nobody can imagine an agricultural worker's wife going into a draper's shop in any part of the county with her husband's wages of 50/- a week and buying clothes or boots for her children.</P>
    <P>Can anybody imagine an agricultural worker's wife buying a coat or a costume for herself out of that 50/- a week?  Can anybody imagine an agricultural worker going into a tailor and saying: &ldquo;There is my 50/-; what can you do for me in the way of a suit?&rdquo; Can you imagine the length of time it would take him to pay for a suit on the instalment system out of that wage of 50/- a week?  Can anybody in this House give the agricultural worker a recipe to enable him to live on 50/- a week?  If we cannot give him that recipe then we have no authority to compel him to live under destitution standards.  Surely, it is our obvious responsibility to take such steps as will give that worker a decent wage to enable him to live in decent comfort, and to take him out of the depressed and untouchable class in which he is to-day in a land where the rich are getting daily richer and the agricultural worker is getting daily poorer.  The agricultural worker can properly be described as the most exploited worker in the country.  This House and the whole nation is sitting by apathetically whilst the worker, who is the backbone of the nation because he produces the food necessary to sustain it, is being unscrupulously exploited.  Some 12 months ago I introduced a Bill into this House designed to provide agricultural workers with holidays such as <Col N="2083" /> were granted to other classes of workers in the country.  The discussion on that Bill produced an amazing analysis of the plight of agricultural workers from no less a person than Deputy Corry who, on that occasion, intervened in the debate to say: &ldquo;What is the use of giving poor devils holidays?  No. 1, they have no place to go to; No. 2, they have no clothes to wear.  What is the use of giving them holidays when they have not a bob in their pockets?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have had 14 years of Fianna Fáil government and 25 years of native government and all we can say to-day is, as Deputy Corry said then, what is the use of giving them holidays?  They have no clothes to wear.  They have no clothes in which to go to Mass on Sunday. They have nowhere to go and they have not a bob in their pockets.  Is that something in which we ought to take pride?  Put those facts down beside our airports and the money that has been spent on them so that wealthy millionaires will deign to put their feet on the soil of this country and give interviews to the Press.  Put that down against the visitors who are coming in here to reap the wealth of the country.  Put it down beside the luxury hotels to accommodate those visitors.  Put it down beside the cinemas that are going up every day and all the other ostentatious displays of wealth.  Having done that, let us ask ourselves&mdash;what sort of consciences have we?  What moral responsibility do we take when we allow our own people to deteriorate into the position that Deputy Corry has described?</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Government that they have a moral responsibility in this matter.  I agree with the fixation of agricultural prices for agricultural produce in order to maintain a balanced agricultural industry.  The Government has a moral responsibility to fix decent rates of wages for those engaged in agriculture and to ensure that the workers are rescued from the poverty and destitution so graphically described by Deputy Corry.  Some years ago an effort was made to provide machinery by which agricultural wages could be examined and standard <Col N="2084" /> wages fixed.  An Agricultural Wages Board was established.  That board has been a useless blister on the backs of the agricultural workers.  Tested by its outlook on wages it is a useless institution and it should be abolished forthwith.  It is there only as a bulwark behind which the Minister shelters when he wants to divest himself of responsibility in this matter.  I would sooner see the Minister take personal responsibility for this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the people who receive £2 10s. per week for producing the food of the nation while those who produce buttons are in receipt of £6 per week.  Is there not something wrong in a system of economics where such an extraordinary anomaly can exist?  Are we going to be content to pay our agricultural workers less than half the wages of our industrial workers?  Are we going to pay those men, engaged in the most essential industry in the country, less. than those who are engaged in other industries?  Because of their long tradition of trade union organisation the industrial workers have fashioned for themselves weapons which insulate them against a low-wage policy which unfortunately the agricultural worker has not embraced with the same enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>In case the Agricultural Wages Board would ever be of use to the agricultural worker, the Ministers for Industry and Commerce hand-picked the workers' representatives on the board.  He packed the board with a number of people who represented no one.  In the main they are political ward heelers of the Minister&mdash;not in a personal sense, but of the Minister's Party.  They do not represent agricultural workers.  They were selected by no representative method; they were simply hand-picked and put on the board.  What can you expect of people appointed in that way&mdash;just the creatures, the acquiescing creatures, of those who appointed them?  You have a chairman with a final veto over anything the board may decide to do.  He has all the power.  The general poverty-stricken outlook of the board is responsible for the fact that agricultural <Col N="2085" /> workers are compelled to work for £2 10s. a week in Ireland when they can get a minimum of £4 10s. a week in Britain.</P>
    <P>The agricultural workers here have no faith whatever in the Agricultural Wages Board and the Minister ought to recognise that some other type of machinery is necessary for the establishment of wage standards for agricultural workers that will lift them out of the morass of poverty into which they have been allowed to sink in consequence of the fixing of wage scales by the board.  I have no faith in that board.  Its concept of life for agricultural workers is a coolie concept of life, measured by rates of wages which it prescribes for the agricultural workers.  That board ought to be abolished as soon as possible and some proper type of wage-fixing machinery should be devised which will more definitely and deliberately aim at lifting up the wages of agricultural workers until they approximate to industrial standards.</P>
    <P>Would anybody here dare to suggest that an agricultural worker is in any way inferior in the quality of his work or in the skill associated with it to an industrial worker?  We dare not offer industrial workers the wages paid to agricultural workers, firstly, because we probably recognise them as inequitable and, secondly, because the industrial workers would not work for them.  We appear to be very complacent in our approach to the problem of offering agricultural workers rates which cannot be justified by any economic factor and which cannot be justified by any reference to the moral code.  In this respect the Minister has a personal responsibility to look after the welfare of agricultural workers and to ensure that in a country which makes millionaires out of millers, at least the agricultural worker will get a fair wage, that he will get an opportunity of living, that his wife and children will not be always in poverty and destitution, that they will get a fair break and be enabled to live a decent life, and that the State will deliberately plan its policy so as to ensure that agricultural workers, the foundation of our agricultural economy, will <Col N="2086" /> be given rates of wages sufficient to sustain them in decency and comfort. We are not entitled to ask them to live in any other conditions.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in respect of holidays, every class of industrial worker, shop worker and domestic employee&mdash;indeed, every class of worker you can think of &mdash;is entitled by statute to paid annual holidays, all except the agricultural worker.  Why must he be the untounchable? Why must he be the depressed class?  The State has deliberately and persistently refused to provide holidays with pay for agricultural workers.  It is true that some of them may get here and there and now and again payment for Church holidays or bank holidays, but it is equally true that large numbers of them get no pay either for Church holidays or bank holidays and none of them get the regular holidays authorised under our statute law.</P>
    <P>We ought to remove the agricultural worker from being in the category of the untouchable in respect of holidays. If we give holidays to every industrial worker in this city and in every other city and town throughout the country, why do we think so little of the agricultural worker that we will not give them to him?  We have mouthed our admiration for him and his magnificent services during the emergency.  In that period we were providing holidays for other workers.  Why is not the agricultural worker entitled to have holidays the same as the industrial worker, the shop worker, the office worker, the domestic worker and every other class in the community?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, charged with responsibility for the welfare of agricultural workers, has a special duty in that regard.  Just as the Minister for Industry and Commerce found it incumbent upon him to introduce legislation granting holidays with pay to industrial workers in response to the demands of the industrial workers, so also the Minister for Agriculture should ensure that agricultural workers are as well treated in respect of holidays as any other class in the community.  I hope that, in view of the Minister's absence, the Parliamentary Secretary, who is now sitting <Col N="2087" /> in the Government Benches, will direct the Minister's attention to my remarks in this connection and I trust we will have some indication from the Minister of his intention with regard to wages and holidays for agricultural workers and that there will be some hope that these workers will be rescued from their poverty-stricken conditions and that they will be given an opportunity to lead decent lives under conditions which will remove from them the privations and hardships which are unfortunately inseparable from the life of agricultural workers in this country to-day because of the appallingly low rates of wages paid to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the Minister's opening speech and I was disappointed with it.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us that we want to increase production and that we must export if the country is to live.  He said that it was only by increased production that we can get the surplus to export.  I therefore expected that the Minister for Agriculture would give some lead to the farmers whereby they would be enabled to increase the output of agricultural produce so that we would have enough for ourselves and a surplus for export.  I felt he should give us some guidance.  The farmers are looking for a lead in this connection and I was disappointed by the Minister's speech in that respect.</P>
      <P>I was somewhat perturbed by his statement about changing over to dairying.  I think there is some inclination at the back of his head&mdash;he did not actually say it, and I hope it is not true&mdash;that we should change our system of bulls; that we should change over to be a dairying country and that we should change the Cattle Breeding Act.  We have a monopoly the world over of store cattle.  It took generations to build that up.  It would take very little to undo all that.  If the present schemes in the Department of Agriculture are kept on they will help us to maintain our monopoly in store cattle; they will help us to maintain the type of beast we are producing, although that type is deteriorating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the policy in the Department <Col N="2088" /> of Agriculture is to subsidise the Shorthorn bull as much as possible.  I think in the case of our committee of agriculture, you must have two Shorthorn bulls before you are allowed to have one white-head or black bull. Some committees of agriculture are trying to break that system, but I was very glad to observe that the Department of Agriculture are adhering to that policy.  It is still my opinion that the white-head or the black bull should not be subsidised at all because people who keep them will get sufficient cows to come to them without a subsidy. What should be subsidised more and more is the Shorthorn bull because anybody in the cattle trade knows that the foundation of our store cattle trade, of which we have a monopoly the world over, is the Shorthorn breed. Everybody knows that with the first cross from a Shorthorn, you get a lovely beast but if you cross again you get a certain type of beast which, though its appearance may seem all right, is not so satisfactory.  My experience on the market is that if a butcher comes up to you and sees you with a fat white-head heifer he will tell you that it is a second cross and that the meat on the block is not the same as that of the first cross.  The really satisfactory meat comes from the first cross and the Shorthorn is the foundation of that.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Bennett say that there is still some of the old Shorthorn breed in Limerick and there were cows there capable of producing over 600 gallons.  I remember that in my young days all cows were capable of producing that quantity of milk but the yield has been going down year after year owing to crossing and inter-crossing of breeds.  Many farmers are going in for the white-headed variety of cattle because they will develop some months earlier than the Shorthorn.  A farmer may have a cow for four or five years and if she has a heifer calf, he is inclined to keep that heifer calf and cross her with a Hereford or Aberdeen Angus.  I think the Department would be well advised to go to Limerick where Deputy Bennett says there is a big reserve of Shorthorn heifers, purchase them and give them out to the farmers. Even if they never got paid for them, <Col N="2089" /> it would still be worth while because they would be establishing a good foundation stock in the country.  I was sorry to hear that Deputy Corry's county committee of agriculture voted solidly to send a man up to the advisory committee with instructions to have nothing subsidised but the Friesian and other milking strains.  If that is done it will be the means of destroying all our good foundation stocks.  Any butcher will tell you that the meat of the black and white or the half-Jersey is yellow.  If you got it yourself as a pound of steak you would not eat it. If you get the half-Friesian or the black and white established in the country, the farmers will have to keep them so long on their hands that they will curse the whole lot.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputies from Mayo, one a Fianna Fáil Deputy, suggesting that the Minister should introduce the dairy breeds into Mayo.  We from the Midlands go to the fairs in Mayo, to Ballinrobe and Claremorris, and other fairs to buy the Shorthorn store type.  The farmers there who rear five or six of these cattle find that it pays them very well but if they follow Deputy Moran's suggestion and introduce the purely milking strain into Mayo, there will not be many farmers from the Midlands going down there to buy their store cattle.  I believe the day will come if that policy is adopted when the farmers will curse the Department of Agriculture for introducing it. As I say, I believe that nothing should be subsidised except the Shorthorns which are the real foundations of the cattle industry of this country.  What can we export at present but cattle?  Is the cattle export trade not the biggest asset in the country and why should we do away with it?  We should not destroy what it has taken generations to build up.  I see that the Minister is setting up an advisory committee, but why has he not asked representatives from all the county committees of agriculture in Ireland?  Why were representatives not invited from the Westmeath County Committee of Agriculture? It seems to us in the Midlands that this is a one-sided body, and I would ask the Minister to consider inviting representatives from every county committee of agriculture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2090" /> Deputy Corry in opening his speech yesterday asked why we should aim at exporting butter to Britain when Britain would not pay us a proper price for butter if we had it to export.  Why, then, should we have a surplus of milk produced in this country if England will not pay for one of the primary products of that milk?  They can get dairy produce from other countries at a rate much cheaper than we can produce it.  I saw an advertisement in an Australian paper the other day offering grazing for horses at 4/- per month.  How are we going to compete against that if the farmers of Australia decide to go in for the export of dairy produce?  At the present moment we have a monopoly of the store cattle trade, and I would ask the Minister not to change the Department's policy in fostering that trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very disappointed that we heard nothing in the Minister's opening statement about the representatives who came over here recently from England.  We understand that some representatives from the Ministry of Food have been over here recently but we have been told nothing officially about it.  We want an end to this policy of hush-hush that has been going on for the past four or five years. The Dáil should be told what is happening in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bennett advocated a fixed price from England for our cattle.  I would not support that, because it is my opinion that you cannot fix the price of cattle and I defy the Minister for Agriculture to do it.  We heard the Minister for Industry and Commerce admit that he could not fix it, and I am certain that if you try to interfere with it you will make as big a muddle of it as you did with pigs. Go to the British by all means, but get them to stop treating our cattle as foreign.  Get them to bring up the prices to the same as their own homebred cattle or cattle from Northern Ireland.  At the present time English farmers are trying to buy English-bred stores but they are not to be got.  If they were there, the English farmer <Col N="2091" /> would get from 7/6 per cwt. more for them than the Irish-bred store.</P>
    <P>The way to help the store cattle trade is to impress on the British Minister for Agriculture that he must level up the prices of our cattle with their own.  There is at present a difference of 7/- or 8/-, and if that were achieved it would fix the price.  I would not worry very much about fixing the price of beef.  I have seen people advocate the bringing of our cattle to beef, but anyone in the farming business knows that that is utterly impossible in this country, because only one-third of our land is fit to make beef.  The greater part of our land is fit only to bring a beast up to a certain stage, perhaps to the three-quarter fat stage, but when it comes to real fattening only one-third of our land is capable of doing it.  It is much better for us to get a good price for our stores, for what the English farmer wants.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed also in the Minister because I thought he would have something to say about increased prices for farmers' produce.  We are compelled to grow wheat and I say here that it is not a paying proposition even though you may have a good crop. The farmers have been treated scandalously on the cost of that.  There have been three rises of wages for the labouring man since 1943.  I am not saying that a labouring man is not entitled to better wages&mdash;Deputy Norton says he is not getting a living wage&mdash; but no matter what it is everything has gone up on the farmer by 100 per cent.  Even a graip, which cost 3/- or 4/-, is now costing 9/- or 10/-, and the farmer's prices have not been adjusted since 1943 for what he has to sell.  At present the wages of a labouring man in my county are 50/- a week.</P>
    <P>Now, it takes the price of 47 barrels of wheat to pay that man's wages for one year or the profit on 15 Irish acres of wheat&mdash;not statute acres.  The majority of the farmers employ one man but many of them employ two or three and in order to get enough profit to pay a man's wages, it takes £1 5s. 0d. on 100 head of cattle or £2 10s. 0d. on 50 head of cattle.  Those are hard facts.  Take the ordinary man <Col N="2092" /> with a 50-acre farm.  He will not grow 40 acres of wheat and he does not raise 50 cattle.  The men who are keeping two and three labouring men are losing money and it is very unfair to the farming industry to ask them to go on compulsorily growing wheat at a loss and producing other things at a loss.</P>
    <P>Last spring the farmers did trojan work for the country and should be paid for that work.  You are paying £33 a ton for wheat coming in here from foreign countries.  I heard the Minister saying that the Irish farmers were getting the highest prices in the world for wheat.  When you can afford to pay £33 a ton for foreign wheat, why can you not afford to pay 75/- a barrel for Irish wheat and recompense the farmer for the expense he is out? People are running away with the idea that the farmers are making money. No farmer employing two or three men is making money.  I employ seven or eight men and I can show anyone my farming costs to prove that I lost money.  I invite any man to look at the figures.  The position is that the cost of farming is more than what they get out of it.  You feed a certain number of cattle and you may get a good price for them but you must pay your increased rates and your increased wages.  Any farmer with two men is losing money and the man employing labour is the man who is the backbone of the country.  I saw where farms were divided into two small lots but the men who got the farms were worse off than labouring men.  I saw them without the wherewithal to give a penny to the priest on Sundays and they have to go on living this dog's existence on their small holdings.</P>
    <P>In the Midlands, the small farmer got no profit&mdash;he got it in the neck.  The big farmer had a chance in the beginning of the war because he had a market, but now in the last two or three years the policy of the British Government is to buy big and strong cattle and there was no export trade for what the small farmer could produce. I put it to the Minister that in all fairness he should try to get justice for the farmers, who went out in all weathers, by securing for them an economic return.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2093" /> I was disappointed when the Minister said he thinks he is going to get only about the same complement of manure next year.  If we are going to continue this tillage policy that we have had up to the present&mdash;and I am not against tillage&mdash;I would ask the Minister to bear in mind that we are doing away with the fertility of our land by going over the same ground time and again. I heard Deputies on the Clann na Talmhan Benches say that it did not affect the big farmer.  Every farmer has to feed cows and horses and it affects every class of farmer.  If the Minister reduced the tillage quota, he would have better tillage done and he would have more grain going into the mill at the end of the harvest.  I could guarantee him that.  We are seven years at compulsory tillage and the land cannot stand it.  I hope that the Minister will do everything possible to get an increased amount of manure.  I fail to see why he cannot get it.  I think we would be better off taking in manure than oranges and other things that we read about every day in the papers, if it was a question of ships.  Room should not be lost on any boat, and if manure can be got in any way it should be got, and double the amount if possible.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the farm improvements scheme and to say that that is a very good scheme.  However, I would ask the Minister to extend that scheme to farm buildings which are very necessary all over the country. At present the scheme does not cover farm buildings although the Minister promised that it would.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say too much on the subject of pigs.  In my opinion the decline in pigs is due to the scarcity of food.  I used to feed pigs but I gave it up in the last two years because potatoes were 10/- a hundredweight and it would not pay me to feed pigs on potatoes at 10/- a hundredweight. I am going to be hard on the Minister when I say that the whole blame is due to the Fianna Fáil policy of the maize meal mixture scheme.  I was very amused yesterday because I think the Minister overstepped himself. When somebody referred to maize the Minister said that he would go for it himself if he knew where it was.  I <Col N="2094" /> think there can be no doubt that the Minister overstepped himself as far as that statements is concerned.</P>
    <P>Another important matter is the subject of cattle traders.  In a speech the Minister went bald-headed for the cattle traders.  I know he had some excuse for doing so but I would not advise him to follow that particular line of action.  I met some farmers who are of the same way of thinking as the Minister and who have a great admiration for him, but the speech which he made either here or in the Seanad, brought him down very much in their estimation, even though he was right in his points.  He should remember that the cattle traders in this country are a fine body of men. He should welcome their views and if they are wrong he should tell them so but he should not go for them bald-headed every time.  The Minister knows that those men are the best judges of their business and that they are not men to be insulted every time, although I admit that certain things they said were not right.  I would ask him to stop fighting them all the time because the people do not like that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>I will finish on the subject of the Shorthorn bull.  I ask the Minister and the Department not to change their present policy as regards the Shorthorn bull.  The Shorthorn is the mainstay of our cattle industry in this country.  If people say that they are short of milk and that they have not good milkers a lot of it, in my opinion, is due to want of feeding.  I met some herds of cows on the roads in the South of Ireland&mdash;fine Shorthorns&mdash; which were not half fed and could not, therefore, give milk.  If people in the dairying districts were not so covetous in keeping more cows than they can feed the position would be different.  It would be a better proposition for them to concentrate on the number of cows they can feed.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the subject of milk-testing.  The Department should find out the number of gallons which can be got from Shorthorns. Deputy Burke mentioned yesterday that the supervisors are not half paid. If that is so all I can say is that if <Col N="2095" /> men are not adequately paid they cannot be expected to do the job properly. I have heard, too, that the records are not quite satisfactory.  I think it would be advisable to follow up that matter in order to get good bulls from those proved milk-tested cows.  But for God's sake keep the Shorthorn bull, which is the foundation of the country.</P>

      <i>Notice taken that 20 Deputies were not present; House counted and 20 Deputies being present,</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with very keen interest to the Vote on the Department of Agriculture in this House each year for the past five years, and each year very progressive speeches have been made as to how agriculture, which is our premier industry in this country, can be improved.  However, as the years roll on and as these speeches are still being delivered, I notice that there is no improvement whatsoever in agriculture.  I may say that this is the first year we have had Deputy Smith as Minister for Agriculture. I take this opportunity of welcoming the new Minister on the occasion of the presentation of his first Estimate to the House.</P>
      <P>I am going to give the new Minister for Agriculture some advice, for whatever it may be worth.  It may not be worth a lot.  Nevertheless, from the hopeless failures of his predecessor, I honestly believe that the new Minister for Agriculture will always be right if he does everything in exactly the opposite way to what was done by Dr. Ryan.  I believe that the former Minister for Agriculture is solely responsible for the deplorable state into which our agriculture has fallen.  If the Minister for Agriculture, who has the honour to be the representative of the most important Department of State in this country, examines the past history of agriculture in this country, finds out the very great and hopeless failures of his predecessor and does the very opposite to what his predecessor has done, I am certain that he will be all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am going to ask the Minister to take a special note of what occurred last Christmas when the former Minister <Col N="2096" /> for Agriculture went over to make representations to the British Ministry of Food in connection with the export of turkeys.  A cortain agreement was reached in England with the British Ministry of Food but the Minister arrived back here with no written agreement.  There was a gentleman's agreement but, nothing in writing.  I hope the new Minister will not conduct himself in that fashion.  If he goes in for conferences either with the British Ministry of Food or with any foreign Government I trust he will not act in the very stupid and incompetent manner his predecessor did and that he will not come back here with no agreement whatsoever.  It has been a typical example of the very inefficient hands into which the most important Department of this State has fallen in the past ten or 15 years.  In view of that, I hope the new Minister will learn from the mistakes made in the past and that his efforts will be crowned with success.</P>
    <P>I have no knowledge of farming, as I am not a farmer or a farmer's son. But, as an ordinary citizen, I take a very serious view of the future of this country where agriculture is our main and premier industry.  What state has agriculture fallen into when we have reached the stage that bread is rationed to three loaves per person per week, that the butter ration was reduced to two ounces at one period for every man, woman and child?  I think that is a complete admission that agriculture has fallen to its very lowest depths and that the death of the Irish nation is fast approaching when we let our main industry fall into such a state of decay as it has fallen during the last ten or 15 years.  We can put the blame for that on the former Minister for Agriculture.  I sincerely hope that notice of that will be taken by the new Minister.</P>
    <P>From conversations I have had with farmers in my constituency concerning their affairs I find that they are in a very bad state.  The majority of them complain of the hard period through which they are passing.  People may say that the farmers have had a golden opportunity to reap a bountiful harvest during the war years.  That probably was the case during the 1914-18 war; <Col N="2097" /> but it certainly was not the case during the recent war.  I find that farmers are to-day in a very serious plight.  Every farmer I come in touch with is complaining of the high demand he has for rates.  He is in a very serious difficulty owing to the manner in which the Land Commission press for payment of annuities when they become due.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation in a great many cases is failing to comply with applications for loans made by farmers.  The farmer is compelled by law to pay a standard rate of wages to his employees.  In a great many cases farmers had got loans from the banks. The banks were never more severe in the collection of outstanding debts than they are at present.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister realises that the principal thing wrong in connection with farming to-day and the main obstacle to increased production is the lack of capital.  I believe that if farmers had sufficient capital at their disposal they would be able to increase production.  They certainly would be able to pay the standard rate of wages, and probably more.  I disagree with Government Deputies who believe that farmers will be welcome in the banks if they go to secure financial accommodation.  I know from experience that any farmer who goes into a bank looking for financial accommodation is not very welcome.  A gangster with a six-shooter in his pocket would be more welcome in a bank than any farmer looking for a loan at present. As I say, the great difficulty farmers have is lack of capital.  Where are they to get it?  They cannot get it out of the land, because in order to produce they must have capital. Therefore, I believe the big job which the Minister has before him is to finance the small farmers and the small uneconomic holders who are the backbone of the country.  These men had never to be compelled to go in for tillage.  They always carried on tillage farming.  These men have no live stock or implements or a proper way of working owing to lack of capital. Some steps should be taken by the Department of Agriculture to see that these farmers are put into a sound financial way of working.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Credit Corporation <Col N="2098" /> has given loans to certain farmers but these loans have been a millstone round their necks.  What occurs is that after the harvest the money is sent to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and probably it will only meet the interest, so that the farmer will have the principal still to face.  The greatest millstone round the necks of farmers is debt.  The first step the Department should take is to endeavour to give every farmer a clean sheet and a proper start off again.  The only way in which he can get a clean sheet is by assisting him to pay off his debts so that he can get out of the hands of the Agricultural Credit Corporation or the banks or whatever other financial institution with which he may be entangled.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, when farmers apply for loans to the Agricultural Credit Corporation they are certainly in a bad way for financial assistance. But one of the first questions they are asked on the application form from the corporation is: &ldquo;How much money have you in the bank and what is the total amount of cash you have on hands?&rdquo; I think that is downright stupid.  Why should a farmer with money in the bank or cash in hands be looking for a loan?  I believe that the Agricultural Credit Corporation is inclined to help the farmer who has put money aside and does not want to use it for the purpose of increasing production. A farmer would want to be a very sound and safe man before he would be trusted by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    <P>The same difficulties arise in connection with the Minister's interest-free loan scheme for assisting farmers to purchase live stock.  The position is that the vast majority of the farmers are unable to provide proper securities. My constituency has suffered very seriously as a result of the very bad weather we have experienced.  Districts like Doonane, Wolfhill, Killeshin, Newtown, Crettyard, down into Graiguecullen and all the Slievemargy area in County Leix and along the banks of the Shannon in Offaly suffered very severely.  Farmers in these districts did not get a forkful of hay last year.  The hay was completely destroyed and the aftergrass was rank <Col N="2099" /> poison so that they could not put a beast on it.  Practically all the cattle in the South Leix area died during the severe weather.</P>
    <P>When I raised this matter on the adjournment, Fianna Fáil Deputies laughed at it.  But the Minister, in his wisdom, saw that something would have to be done to render some measure of relief to these distressed farmers.  His scheme, if it is the best he could do, is better than nothing.  Half a loaf is better than no bread.  I believe that in the case of the vast majority of those people the loans given to them will really be grants, because the loans will never be repaid.  You might as well give a grant as a loan, because in many cases the loan will never be paid off. When the Department gives them money, they may say good-bye to it, because these people have lost their means of livelihood.  How are they to get it back again?  They will purchase live stock and the very minute the live stock is fit to sell they will sell it.  If they have to send the money on to the Department for the repayment of the loan they will have nothing to stock up with again.  They are in the very same position.  I think the Minister for Agriculture should follow the example set by Mr. Tom Williams, the British Minister for Agriculture, and by the Rev. Dr. Little, the Minister for Agriculture in Northern Ireland.  We may disagree with certain things they do but, when we come to consider the farmer, we must admit that they have done more for the farmer than we have done here. They have given more sympathetic consideration to the farmer than we have given here.</P>
    <P>With regard to grants, the chief difficulty arises in relation to finding securities.  It is very difficult for the people in my constituency to get the proper security because every man is in the same boat there and they will not be taken as security for each other. One farmer is just as insolvent as his neighbour.  The Minister should view that situation with some concern.  The farmers cannot make applications for the loans because they cannot get suitable security.  I would go security for no farmer in my constituency.  I make <Col N="2100" /> that clear and candid admission.  I could not do it because of the deplorable economic position in which they find themselves.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about production. All wealth comes out of the land and it is through the land that our economic ills will be cured.  It should be our aim to do everything that is humanly possible to increase production because when you increase production you increase wealth.  The real wealth of any nation comes out of the ground.  All the energy of the Department of Agriculture should be devoted towards increasing output.  The main obstacle to increased production is lack of capital.  In the past that problem did not receive much consideration from Dr. Ryan.  I trust that our new Minister will prove more sympathetic and more generous in his approach and that he will seriously interest himself in this question of providing capital for the farmers.</P>
    <P>Recently a constituent of mine&mdash;a woman&mdash;cycled 37 miles to see me.  The moment she came into my house tears commenced to fall from her eyes.  She said: &ldquo;I am in very serious trouble.&rdquo; She opened her handbag and she took out a notice of sale from the Land Commission.  She then took out copies of warrants from the county registrar for rates.  The next thing she took out was a demand from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  The bank in Birr was down on her.  I asked her if she had her land sown and she said she had not.  She showed me a letter from her seed merchant saying that last year's seeds had not been paid for and that she would get none this year.  She tried several other seed merchants but she was unsuccessful.  They all wanted the money before they gave her the seeds.  I asked her why she did not apply to the county council and she told me she had not settled with them for the last four years.  She is the mother of nine children, the eldest being 14 years of age.  Her husband is a cripple and has been confined to bed for the past four years.  She had five head of cattle and the last of them died during the snow.  I spent about two hours with that woman.  I took notes. What did she say when she was going away?  &ldquo;Good-bye and thanks very <Col N="2101" /> much.  It is great that there are men in the country who are anxious to help us.  Where would the country be only for Mr. de Valera.&rdquo;  What can you do with people of that mentality?  This constituent of mine was in a deplorable position and yet she paid a gallant tribute to that Government which is responsible for the appalling condition in which she is placed to-day.</P>

The sooner they are made to realise who is responsible for their present position the sooner they will come to their senses.</P>
      <P>I maintain that the Government of this country at the present time has handled agriculture very, very badly. In the future they will have to devote all their time and energy to increasing production and they will have to pour money into the ground in order to get that production.  In that way they will produce some real wealth.  I cannot understand how the banks can continue to show such huge profits and at the same time refuse credit to the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I endorse every word that Deputy Norton has said in regard to the wages paid to agricultural workers.  In my opinion the agricultural worker is just as important as the farmer.  Both are engaged in production.  The law compels the farmer to pay a standard rate of wage to his worker.  In my experience the farmers need no compulsion in this respect.  They are hard working citizens trying to get all they can out of the land, and to make a decent living for themselves and their children. The majority of them treat their workers very well.  There is no sense in compelling the farmer to pay a certain rate of wages unless you put money into his pocket first.  You cannot get blood out of a turnip and you cannot get juice out of a stone.  You cannot <Col N="2102" /> get money out of a farmer's pocket unless you give it to him first or give him the means of earning it.</P>
    <P>A proposal has now been put up for an increase in salaries for Deputies, Senators, Ministers and so on.  Why are those increases necessary?  They are necessary because the value of the pound has been reduced to half what it was in 1939.  If the value of the pound has been reduced to 10/- the 55/-paid to the agricultural worker has been reduced to 27/6.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.</P>
    <P>I believe that the position of agriculture will become worse year by year unless something is done immediately. Production will decrease and the farmers will sell out.  Their sons will fly from the land like the swallows in the autumn and seek employment in Great Britain and elsewhere.  In Great Britain as agricultural labourers they will get £4 10s. 0d. a week.  In New Zealand they will get £5 4s. 0d. per week plus 14 days' holidays and a weekly half-holiday beginning at noon on a full day; and during his annual holidays the agricultural worker is paid as he is for his half-day.  These are conditions that would encourage any man to work on the land. These are the conditions prevailing in Great Britain and New Zealand and they are sufficient to encourage farmers' sons and others to work on the land.  The rates of pay and the general facilities given to the workers there are attractive.</P>
    <P>In this country, where we should be anxious to build up agriculture, the pay of the worker is 50/- a week.  How does the Minister or any State Department imagine that a worker engaged in all-important work on the land can marry and bring up his family in Christian decency and in accordance with the Christian law while in receipt of a wage of 50/- a week?  The majority of our labourers are engaged in agricultural work.  They cannot be in any other state than in a state of misery and slavery and want.  They are working from sunrise to night fall.  They have not a shilling to spend in the week-end.  They are very lucky if they can secure a smoke at the end of the week's labour.  They are expected to pay rent and rates, secure the necessaries <Col N="2103" /> of life, purchase fuel, clothe themselves and their families, and educate their children&mdash;all on 50/- a week.</P>
    <P>That is one of the reasons why the children of many of our agricultural workers are only half-educated.  The workers have to keep their children from school.  They put them at some little job the moment they have reached an age when they will be able to do a hand's turn for anybody.  The parents depend on the few shillings that the child brings in.  That is how the children are occupied when they really should be at school, getting a sound education and equipping themselves to face the dark and dreary world.</P>
    <P>I and many other Deputies are of the opinion that the most dreary life that can be experienced is the life of the farmer and the farm worker. Something will have to be done to provide more encouragement for young people on the land.  The payment of 50/- a week is no encouragement to anyone to work on a farm.  They will not do it&mdash;that day has gone.  There is a moral obligation on the Minister to see that agricultural workers are properly paid.  He should abolish the Agricultural Wages Board, which is only a political, corrupt body appointed by the Minister's predecessor.  It is representative of no section of the people; it does not represent the employees or the employers.  The members are purely representative of the Fianna Fáil organisation.</P>
    <P>I trust that the Minister will reorganise his Department.  One of the mistakes his predecessor made was to have political appointments on the board, putting the secretary and the chairman of some county executives of Fianna Fáil as members of the board. The present Minister should not follow the footsteps of his predecessor.  There will have to be some other system adopted.  There is nothing democratic about the Agricultural Wages Board. Political henchmen were appointed to it.  We should have some democratic body.  I hope the Minister will abolish the present politically appointed board.  The majority of the members are Fianna Fáil nominees and Fianna <Col N="2104" /> Fáil county councillors.  Those people are pledged to support Fianna Fáil policy and they are bound to act in accordance with the wishes of the Government. It is their policy to keep wages down to rock-bottom.  Prices may go sky-high, but wages are at rock-bottom.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy should protest in the strongest possible manner against the disgraceful and inhuman conditions under which our agricultural workers and small farmers are forced to live. No worker in the State could exist on 50/- a week.  The Minister must realise that some steps will have to be taken to pay a proper wage to the men engaged in our premier industry; otherwise the position will be very serious. We may be told that the Government cannot provide sufficient funds.  If millions were thrown into agriculture, so that the farmer could have greater production and be able to stock his lands, it would be money well spent, because you would have a good return from it.  Instead of the Government trying to make agriculture prosperous and to assist the farmers to live decently and enable young people to remain on the land, they are ignoring the importance of the industry and are refusing to pay reasonable wages.</P>
    <P>There is no end to the money spent on the erection of luxury hotels to attract American and other visitors to eat anything we have.  There is any god's amount of money to be spent under the Fianna Fáil squandermania policy. The Government are too busy studying cosmic physics and other codology and they do not direct their attention to putting agriculture into a sound position.  Does agriculture not come before the tourist trade and before cosmic physics?  All other industries depend on agriculture.  If agriculture fails and if the farmers, who are the backbone of the country, sink, everything sinks.</P>
    <P>How many spheres of life are depending on agriculture? I believe that the Government should devote more money to it instead of making contributions towards telescopes in South Africa.  A huge sum could be found for a telescope in South Africa.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will have to have a glimpse through that telescope some <Col N="2105" /> day and he may see his Ministers living in the moon.  That is where they are, because at the moment they seem to have lost touch with rural Ireland, with the farmers and the farm workers. Money can be found for luxury hotels and huge dining-halls in our airports, for telescopes and for cosmic physics, but nothing can be found for the honest agricultural worker, who is put to the pin of his collar to exist.  We must not forget that it is he who produces the food for man and beast. That is a state of affairs that I believe the people in his own area realise.  It is a state of affairs that should not exist in agriculture.</P>
    <P>All our talents should be directed towards fostering agriculture.  When we have agriculture in a sound state, our farmers in a sound financial position, sufficient for the home market and a surplus to export, it will be time enough for the Government to indulge in all this codology about cosmic physics.  While our young men are flying from the land as quickly as ever they can go, no effort is being made to induce them to remain on the land and to assist in increasing production in the country.  As sure as I stand in this House, if the present Fianna Fáil agricultural policy is carried on for another five or ten years, as sure as there is a bill on a crow&mdash;and that is sure enough&mdash;you will see this country like a complete desert because there is no one in it capable of flying out of it who will not go as quickly as possible. The low wages paid to the majority of the labourers engaged in that industry are one of the greatest driving forces behind these people.</P>
    <P>When one considers the important position that agriculture occupies in the lives of the Danish people, the manner in which our Government has sat down on their work is a great reflection on their lack of foresight.  The Danish Government have laid down their minds to a policy of properly catering for agriculture, financing the farmers and finding remunerative markets for their products.  A few years before the world war came to an end every Government in the world was planning for the post-war period, and Ministers were arranging for markets <Col N="2106" /> but our Government were too busy studying cosmic physics to look for markets or to enter into arrangements or agreements with the British Government or other Governments. While we were engaged in this codology, the Danish Department of Agriculture was capturing the market in Great Britain for agricultural products. We stood looking on.  Surely that is stupidity at its very highest.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon raised the very important point that no market could be found for potatoes produced in South Monaghan.  I was faced with the very same position in my own county some time ago when in the village of Belmont and in the parish of Ferbane, huge pits of potatoes were left to rot while at the same time a potato could not be procured by the poor of Dublin. The Department of Agriculture let them rot in the pits in Ferbane.  The same state of affairs apparently exists in County Monaghan to-day.  Is it not very bad management when in parts of the country we have potatoes for which we cannot get a market while in other parts of the country, such as Limerick, Cork and Dublin, there are people who cannot get potatoes for love or money?</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to direct the Minister's attention to a very grave injustice inflicted on the wheat growers in my constituency.  I may say that the price of 55/- per barrel for wheat does not give a profit to the grower.  It has been pointed out on more than one occasion in this House that the only man deriving profit from wheat is the miller.  I have always said that the miller, instead of milling wheat, is milling the grower and the farmer.  He is the man who has the huge profits.  But if there are any profits to be made out of the growing of wheat the farmer is certainly the man who should receive these profits.  I have known cases where growers produced wheat at a loss whilst on these very same crops, the millers had huge profits.  That should not be the case in an agricultural country.  If there is any profit in wheat it should go to the grower. He loses his sweat in producing that crop, in threshing it and taking it to the mill&mdash;for what?  For nothing else <Col N="2107" /> but a mere existence while he must take that produce to the mill to make profits for the millers.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister recalls the question which I raised in the House with my colleague Deputy Dr. O'Higgins some three months ago, when we asked the Minister to receive a deputation representative of agents in the Counties of Laoighis, Offaly, Carlow, Kilkenny and Kildare in connection with serious complaints made in regard to the price paid for wheat.  The Minister on that occasion when we pressed for immediate action by his Department stated that he had the matter under investigation and that he was dealing with it.  I have on two occasions since rung the Minister's private secretary and I think I have written to the Department&mdash;I am not so sure of this&mdash;and despite the fact that three or four months have elapsed the Department have not replied to the request as to whether they were going to receive this deputation.</P>
    <P>The agents of Irish Grain, Limited, are responsible for giving out seeds to these farmers, in many cases on credit, until such time as they have the crop threshed.  The agents covered the counties I have mentioned buying wheat, and we see that there is a competitive firm, another concern, in opposition to Irish Grain, Limited, purchasing wheat in these counties.  We find that this firm can pay more for the wheat than Irish Grain, Limited, with the result that those who are selling wheat and who are dealing with Irish Grain, Limited, have lost considerably. They have lost from 2/6 to 3/- per barrel for wheat they have given to Irish Grain, Limited.  A communication which I have received from the secretary of the agents goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The current native wheat purchasing period had only commenced when I began to receive complaints from the wheat growers who had sold their wheat through me to Irish Grain, Limited, that the price paid by me was considerably less than the price paid for wheat of even quality by agents of another organisation. I investigated these complaints <Col N="2108" /> thoroughly, and having satisfied myself that the complaints were indeed justified, I asked another Irish Grain, Limited, agent in this town if he was having the same difficulty, and learned that he was.</P>
    <P>Press reports suggested that agents in &lsquo;outside&rsquo; areas were in the same position, so I got in touch with the Irish Grain, Limited, agents in the neighbouring counties, namely, Tipperary, Offaly, Kilkenny, Kildare and Carlow, and learned that they were also having serious trouble over being out-bid and out-bought for native wheat by agents of competitive organisations.</P>
    <P>As a result of this, it was decided to hold a meeting of Irish Grain, Ltd., Agency (Wheat) licence holders in Abbeyleix, on 25th November.  At this meeting, which was representative of agents whose total wheat purchasing totals approximately 200,000 barrels in the season, the matter was discussed at length.  Each of the agents gave evidence of repeated instances where agents of a competitive organisation had bid top price for wheat while the wheat was still unthreshed, and, of course, un-sampled. There was evidence of instances where a farmer divided his wheat between two or more buyers, and received 2/- to 3/- per barrel more from the agents of firms other than Messrs.  Irish Grain, Limited. In every case where competitive bidding occurred, Irish Grain, Limited, agents were out-bid and out-bought.</P>
    <P>The detrimental effects of this position of affairs on our trade will be immediately obvious.  The Irish Grain, Limited, agents give seed wheat on credit terms to the growers on the understanding that the growers will sell the produce back through them, and that the price of the seed wheat may be deducted from the value of the crop.  This season, owing to the situation prevailing over prices, many growers failed to meet their obligations, and left the agents to wait for the money for the seed wheat.  The grave injustice to growers who did sell their wheat through us to Messrs. Irish Grain, Limited, may be estimated <Col N="2109" /> when it is calculated that the loss to growers of 200,000 barrels is between 2/6 and 3/- per barrel, or approximately £25,000 to £30,000 sterling.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What was the delay in investigating the serious situation that arose in the tillage counties of Carlow, Laoighis, Offaly, Tipperary, Kilkenny and Kildare? I am anxious to hear the Minister's reply as to what were the results of the investigation carried out.  I trust that the Minister has not that matter still on the long finger and that the investigations that have been made have had some tangible results. I shall anxiously await his reply.</P>
    <P>Certainly, people are not going to sell their wheat to Irish Grain, Limited, if they are offered a price of 3/- a barrel more by another organisation.  I would ask the Minister to make a statement on that matter in his reply.  I hope that he will personally investigate it and I believe the Minister is man enough to do it.  Since he has not written to me or the other Deputies concerned I hope he will refer to it in his reply.</P>
    <P>
      <i>An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fagan made reference to the farm improvements scheme and said it was certainly a good scheme.  I thoroughly agree with him because I feel it is one of the best schemes the Government has introduced. Wonderful work has been done as a result of the assistance of that scheme in provision of farm roadways and laneways, and the making of drains, and I think the Minister should now include provision for out-offices such as cow-houses and stables for farmers.  A large proportion of the harvest cheque each year has to be used for the repairing of out-offices and farmers are entitled to a grant so that they can keep their out-offices and dairies in first-class order.  Under the milk and dairies regulations, cow-houses have to be kept spick and span, and it is very hard for the ordinary farmer to keep up with these strict regulations.  That is why I say the farmer should get assistance for repairs and maintenance work, and that if necessary they should be helped to erect <Col N="2110" /> new out-offices.  As everyone knows, out-offices are very important.  They mean a lot to a farmer, and I hope some steps will be taken under some other scheme, if not the farm improvements scheme, to provide financial assistance.</P>
      <P>After seven years of compulsory tillage, I think we have reached a stage when those regulations should be somewhat relaxed.  As has been pointed out by Deputy Bennett, you have a part of this country used for dairy farming and a part for tillage farming.  That is in keeping with the laws of nature and regulations cannot be made against nature.  I do not see how nature can be prevented from taking its course.  Tillage cannot be carried out properly and efficiently in dairying districts.  The production of milk, butter and cheese is equally as important as the production of wheat and other cereals.  For that reason, I think that the compulsory tillage regulations should not be enforced in dairying districts to the same extent as in tillage districts.  I do not care what the Minister or any member of the Government says in defence of compulsory wheat growing&mdash;it is time to relax those orders.  I have experience of cases where farmers have sown wheat in compliance with those regulations and they are doing it at a dead loss. They are putting seed into boggy ground, some of which is not even fit for grazing a snipe, in County Laoighis. I have in mind some of the poor land which you find around Wolfhill.  On the other hand, you have in Offaly large stretches of land under water from the Brosna and the Shannon, and no one who knows these areas can say that the regulations were meant for them, but they are being applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time that farmers were allowed to sow the most suitable crop instead of wasting time, money and seed trying to grow wheat.  Although their land is suitable enough for growing oats, it is ridiculous that they should have to sow wheat at the behest of some civil servant when there is more fertile land available.  If the farmer does not carry out the orders of the civil servant, he is taken into court and made a laugh of, whereas if he had his own way, he would have a <Col N="2111" /> bountiful crop of oats.  I have seen cases where the wheat crop completely failed because it was put into ground certified to be unfit for wheat growing by the county instructor.</P>
    <P>We have had enough of this codology and it is time it was cut out.  As Deputy Dillon said, 60 per cent. of our wheat is imported.  There is no reason, then, why farmers should be compelled to slave or to be dragged into court and made a laughing stock. Again, I would tell the House that some of the fines imposed in court are altogether excessive.  It is very hard to direct a man who was used to dairy farming to change his form of agriculture&mdash;just as hard as it is to beat an old dog off his track.  I feel that it is all a waste of the Government's time and the court's time, and I hope the Minister will do something about it. These poor devils of farmers are trying to do the best they can to get along and they do not want to be dragged into the courts and fined as severely as they are at present.</P>
    <P>During the beet season I got up in this House and made an appeal to the Government to provide compensation for the farmers for the loss of their crops.  I would like to ask the Minister who got this compensation?  I saw an announcement in the papers from the sugar company referring to compensation for certain farmers but I never met a farmer who got it.  It would be interesting to know what way the scheme works.  We have a shortage of sugar and are rationed to a very small quantity.  Our farmers are asked to grow beet and I know that during the last 12 months some farmers who sowed beet lost their whole crop.</P>
    <P>I know where farmers brought their beet to the railway station just as the strike commenced.  These farmers had to get beet out of fields and over roads that were under water to try to have their crop in before the closing day, but the moment they had it at the railway station, they had to cart it back home again.  Surely they had suffered enough before they reached the stage when their crop was left completely on their hands?  I have known <Col N="2112" /> farmers whose crops have failed completely and in spite of it all, the sugar company served notice on them to pay up for seed.  These poor farmers were getting demands from the sugar company for £14, £15, £18 and £30 according to whatever contract they had.</P>
    <P>They are asked to pay for the seeds and the manures for the beet and in many cases the beet had to be ploughed into the ground.  Why does not the Government or the Minister for Agriculture make some agreement with Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann whereby those farmers will not be obliged to meet this very unfair and heavy burden?  The Minister for Agriculture is responsible for agriculture in all its aspects in this country.  When I raised the question of the provision of compensation for farmers for the loss of the beet crop which was deteriorating at the time the beet strike was in progress the Minister stated in the House that the matter was under consideration. A few days afterwards an announcement was made about compensation but I have never yet met a farmer who received any of the compensation. On the other hand, I do know farmers who have received drastic letters from Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann to pay up immediately the funds advanced for the buying of seeds and manures.  The farmers cannot pay. They should not have to pay for seed and manure, for something that was of no use to them.  They have gained nothing on the transaction and instead of losing any more I hope and trust that the Minister will see that these people will not be obliged to foot the very serious bills sent out to them, such as I have seen in my own constituency, from Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.</P>
    <P>It is only reasonable and proper that the tariff should be completely removed from all imported agricultural machinery.  I know of numerous applications which are lying in the Minister's Department in regard to threshing mills.  While I am on the subject of threshing mills I might refer to the fact that we have all sorts of inspectors carrying out all kinds of inspections.  I wonder if the Minister would consider assigning some of these <Col N="2113" /> inspectors to the task of looking at some of the threshing mills around the country.  I say that there are some threshing mills around the country which are only fit to be set on fire.  I know from experience that the amount of grain that is left in the straw is surprising.  There should be inspections in order to ensure that the farmers would get more return.  After all, a big farmer loses a barrel or two of seed yearly as a result of defective machinery.  The Minister would be wise to take steps to see that there would be inspection of those mills to ensure that they are capable of threshing the farmers' harvest properly.  All sorts of agricultural machinery are in very great demand and it is about time that we in this country modernised our farms with machinery.  I have read recently that practically every farmer in Denmark has his own mowing machine, his own reaper, his own binder, his own ploughs and harrows. All the agricultural machinery he needs is available.  There are parts of this country where we find that the one mowing machine has to go round the parish and that a farmer has to wait and depend on the weather to get his crops down.  It is the duty of the Government to see that farmers are properly equipped with machinery.  It is the duty of the Government to modernise agriculture, to encourage the use of machinery on the land, and to see that those people are provided with machinery.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin can bear me out when I say that, from my own constituency, a number of very important farmers went across to England for the purpose of purchasing jeeps for farm work.  The Revenue Commissioners decided that they were not fit for agricultural work.  I say that nobody knows better than the farmer whether jeeps are suitable for agricultural work or not.  These men were obliged to pay a huge tax on those machines. These machines should be imported for agricultural work free of tax.  Deputy Davin can again bear me out because I am sure that he, too, was asked to make representations on the matter.  I do not like to mention names in this House but if the Minister wants them I can give them to him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2114" /> A farmer went over to England to get some of this urgent and important machinery required solely for agricultural purposes.  He is the biggest farmer in Offaly to-day and he wanted these jeeps for the haulage of manure and other work.  He was obliged by the Revenue Commissioners to pay an exorbitant tax.  The farmers are doing a good service and machinery is an asset to their work.  It is helping in the drive for agricultural production and the barrier of a heavy tax should be lifted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bennett, I think, spoke about horse-breeding and of the great name our Irish horses have.  A national stud has now been set up in a place called Tully in the County Kildare. I understand that the director in charge of that national stud is an Englishman.  Is there no Irishman capable of holding that job and of carrying it out efficiently?  Horses that have won a world-wide name for this country are being trained and bred here.  &ldquo;Caughoo&rdquo;, an Irish horse, won the Grand National and we have trained and bred in this country some of the world's most famous horses. Only recently we read of the success of some of our horses at some of the shows on the Continent despite the fact that the Minister for Agriculture and our own Government apparently decided that no Irishman was capable of managing Tully Stud.  Major Hall from the British Army was made manager of the stud.  I wonder if the Minister would, when replying, explain to the House the circumstances surrounding the appointment of Major Hall.  Were there any Irish applicants for the job?  Who interviewed the applicants and what was the result?  Was there no Irishman with equal qualifications to those of the British Army officer, Major Hall, who was successful, or is it that the Government have more sympathy for retired British Army officers than for our own Army officers, many of whom, I believe, are well qualified for the position of manager of Tully Stud?</P>
    <P>I want to know why an English major has got this job, assuming that our well trained and famous Irish horsemen are fully qualified and were, I understand, applicants until something <Col N="2115" /> occurred that upset the whole apple cart.  Certain influences were brought to bear upon the Government and upon the Department of Agriculture to appoint Major Hall and our men were, therefore, rejected.  I hold that an Irishman should have been appointed in preference to any Englishman and this House is entitled to an explanation of the facts of the case.</P>
    <P>I have not been in the House for most of the speeches that have been made but I imagine that many references must have been made to the establishment of agricultural colleges. It is an extraordinary fact that in a country like ours we have only four agricultural colleges.  That should not be the case.  We should have an agricultural college in practically every second county in this country so that our young farmers will get a thorough knowledge of farming in conjunction with their experience on the land. Agricultural colleges are a great asset to this country.  The Government should consider seriously the establishment of further agricultural colleges. There should be an agricultural college in my own constituency, Laoighis-Offaly, and in the County Kilkenny which, I believe, has a very good farming record.  Instead of that, fine mansions and other buildings which could be used for such colleges were allowed to fall into the hands of the late Mr. David Frame and were tumbled to the ground.  Decent agricultural colleges could have been established in these mansions where young farmers' sons could get a thorough knowledge of the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The colleges at Glasnevin, Ballyhaise and Warrenstown are a credit to the country.  It is a pity that we have not more like them.  The men in charge of them are doing very good work. When the Minister or his officials are appointing officials under the farm improvements scheme or the compulsory tillage scheme or under any other scheme, it should be their policy to see that the men appointed are past pupils of one of these colleges, because, as well as the knowledge they have secured in these colleges, and they certainly get a good sound knowledge of <Col N="2116" /> farming, they are the sons of farmers. All such appointments should be reserved for past pupils of these colleges. I have known young men who did a course in these colleges who are now doing the same work as agricultural labourers, while those who had a political pull probably and who had not a proper education on agricultural lines or an ounce of intelligence were able to secure these appointments.  Who are better entitled to them than those who have secured their education in one of these colleges?  I ask the Minister in making these appointments to give a preference, other things being equal, to applicants who have been students in any of these colleges.</P>
    <P>In regard to the young farmers' clubs which have been established throughout the country, I ask the Minister to co-operate closely with these clubs.  It is their aim to be non-political.  There is a lot of lip-sympathy for farmers in this House and outside.  But these young farmers' clubs are taking some practical steps in the direction of modernising farming.  In addition to social functions and outings they arrange for lectures on the testing of seeds, different crops, and other aspects of agriculture.  There are at present 72 or 73 of these clubs in the country and they deserve the whole-hearted support and active co-operation of the Department. These young men are anxious to promote agriculture to the best of their ability.  They are anxious to see that halls are erected as an attraction for young men, so that they will remain on the land.  They are anxious to see that agricultural shows are organised. These clubs are helping to bring agriculture to a very high standard in the areas where they have been established.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Davin knows, there are agricultural committees in Birr and Rathdowney which have been responsible for the promotion of some of the finest agricultural shows in the Midlands. Close co-operation should exist between the Department and these committees.  Classes in dairying science, butter making, etc., for young girls, which are being promoted by the county committees of agriculture, should be given more encouragement. <Col N="2117" /> Young girls should be encouraged to attend these classes.  Halls should be made available for these classes and every parish should be asked to take a part in their promotion so as to bring agriculture up to a high standard.  The young farmers' clubs are making a genuine effort in that respect.  They are out to make work on the land more attractive for young people.  They are doing very useful work and they deserve the support of every Deputy. When a group of citizens come together for the purpose of helping our main industry, they should secure the greatest help and encouragement possible from the Department.</P>
    <P>The finest farm that I have ever put a foot on is the farm at Mount St. Joseph's, Roscrea, carried on by the Monks.  It is an ideal model farm. Deputy Davin has seen that farm and I am sure he will agree with me that it is an example to the whole country as to how farming should be carried on in a scientific way.  They have all kinds of the most modern machinery there.  It is a pleasure to see the manner in which bad land has been reclaimed through the hard work of these men.  Deputies who are anxious to see a model farm and how a farm can be worked to the fullest productive capacity should pay a visit there. What was bogland convenient to the village of Shinrone has been reclaimed and it is producing some of the best crops.  That was land on which one would say nothing could ever be produced. Now it is as good as the most fertile land in County Meath as a result of the hard work and labour put into it.  What has been done in one place can be done in other places.</P>
    <P>With hard work, courage and determination, a great deal can be done to uplift our premier industry.  The Minister, as I said, has a difficult job before him and I wish him the best of luck in his new position.  All I can say is that, if he does the very opposite to what his predecessor did, he is bound to be right, because anything the former Minister did was wrong.  I believe that the agricultural policy of the Government is wrong.  Probably the present Minister is the best of a bad lot, but nobody else could be found <Col N="2118" /> for the position.  I believe he will make a better job of it anyway than his predecessor. He knows more about farming and about the conditions of the small holders.  I hope that when he goes abroad to make agreements with a British Minister he will not do what his predecessor did&mdash;go over there to talk about turkeys and come back with nothing.  I hope that the debate which has taken place will be an encouragement to him and show him that Deputies on this side of the House are prepared to co-operate in any sensible scheme which comes from his Department.  As well as criticising, it is the duty of an Opposition to be helpful. I think a good Opposition in any country is a healthy thing.  I hope that from the debate which has taken place the Minister will have picked up something which will enable him to put the farmer into his right and proper place in this nation.  He is the backbone of the country.  Agriculture was the industry which Almighty God gave us and of its very essence this country is primarily agricultural.  No other industry can prosper or thrive in it. Probably the Minister will meet with difficulties in his efforts to assist the small farmers to whom I have referred in the course of my speech.  He is bound to meet with difficulty from those who stand behind him to-day in his endeavours to reorganise agriculture in a proper manner.  If he does meet with difficulty he can console himself with the words of Archbishop Mannix:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With patience and perseverance we shall surmount the difficulties that lie ahead of us.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This debate has now reached its third day.  It is a debate in which, as it comes around year after year, I find myself intervening with great reluctance.  I always like to hear the views of those who are much more closely attached to the land than I can claim to be.  I feel inclined to apologise in expressing myself upon this subject because I am town born and city bred and it requires considerable temerity on my part to intervene at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my very earliest years I have had it dinned into me that agriculture <Col N="2119" /> is the mainstay of this country.  I was reared on the profits of a business which was acutely sensitive as to how agriculture fared.  In my home life there was injected into me an interest, even though it was at one or two removes, in what happens to the farmers of the country and how they live because it impacted on my own way of life. Later on when I became associated with Government I realised the truth of various things which I had up to then accepted as beliefs.  When I was associated with Government, whatever I did for industrial production in this country, I made it my business to ensure that anything I did for industry would have no bad repercussions on agriculture and would not increase the cost of living while, at the same time, keeping taxation as low as possible.  In all those efforts I claim to have succeeded. During the same period agriculture, under a colleague of mine, had reached a situation which was then decried by the Fianna Fáil Party as something catastrophic&mdash;Fianna Fáil aspirants to this Parliament who now look back with a certain amount of regret at those much more prosperous days than anything they have achieved in the 15 years since they first took office.</P>
    <P>It is accepted by everybody here that agriculture is the mainstay of the country.  In recent months I got an acceptance of the view that we must export more if we are to maintain our old-time standards of living.  To get our old-time standards of living we must pay for them by visible trade items and the only visible trade items we have are what we have in the way of an exportable surplus of agricultural goods.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce says that we are going to have exports from our industries. So far we have not seen them. All that we have seen as far as industrial production in this country is concerned is a diminution in the industrial exports that we used to have.  We are, therefore, driven back more and more upon agriculture, agriculture as the mainstay for ourselves at home, for the good life that we would like to lead and also as payment for the necessary <Col N="2120" /> imports which our standard of living requires.</P>
    <P>The Minister complains that people down the country pay lip service to this view that agriculture is the great industry in the country and he, apparently, thinks that those people are sincere when they express themselves in that way.  I express myself sincerely in that way.  I will quote now from what I have often referred to here as the &ldquo;economic Bible&rdquo; of the present Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;the Report of the Banking Commission. At page 116 of the Majority Report they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Free State is predominantly an agricultural country, which means not only that the greatest proportion of the population gains its livelihood in agriculture, but that the main exports required to pay for necessary imports are obtained from agriculture... Access to profitable export markets for agricultural products will in the future as in the past govern the prosperity and welfare of the main body of the Irish people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Dealing with the question of whether we can get exports of any other type but agriculture, they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;So far as exports are concerned, there is very little evidence of any export of products from the new industries which have been established, and there has, in fact, during recent years been a marked decrease in the export volume of the older industries other than brewing.  The tendency has thus been to make agriculture increasingly responsible for the maintenance of sufficient exports.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take it from that there would be agreement with the writer, after giving these extracts, in summing it up in this way: &ldquo;The report, therefore, conceives the position of agriculture as fundamental in regard to the balance of payments, the monetary position and the possibility of economic and social development.&rdquo;  I think all Parties in the House will agree with that. We have in agriculture all that we want for our own good life at home and from agriculture we must get the things <Col N="2121" /> we require for our exports if we are to maintain our old standard of living.</P>
    <P>What is the situation in regard to agriculture?  About half the occupied population of this country is occupied in agriculture.  They do not even get even half the national income.  They get something that fluctuates between a quarter and a third of the national income.  Half of those who find employment in the country find it in agriculture.  The first startling thing that one discovers when considering this situation in regard to agriculture is the revelation contained in the pamphlet recently published by the Government under the title of <i>National Income and Expenditure.</i>  There is a thing called &ldquo;personal income&rdquo;, which is taken as the standard, and I want the House to understand that personal income means more than what a person gains by being gainfully occupied.  It means everything.  It means payments in money.  It means payments in kind. It means pensions.  It means doles.  It means everything that a person gets. The personal incomes are divided according to certain ranges in that pamphlet.</P>
    <P>As far as the general bulk of the community is concerned we are in the lamentable position that 166,000 of the population are in the £150 a year class, or the person equivalent to the £150 a year.  There is a footnote added which says that the difficulty of enumerating the net £150 is rendered specially difficult by the fact that of the big number of farmers only a minute proportion of the large total are in the &ldquo;over £150&rdquo; class; and that pamphlet is talking about £150 when it was £150, and not its present purchasing power of £75.  It would be a still more minute fraction of the farming population in the grade over £300 per annum&mdash;the present equivalent of £3 per week. That is the position in which our main industry is to-day.  Only a minute fraction of all the people who are engaged in agriculture are in the &ldquo;over £150&rdquo; per annum class.  That being the situation we could easily, if we had not got experience to guide us, forecast what the likely result might be. The people will fly from the countryside. They will get away as quickly as <Col N="2122" /> they can from farming occupations.  If they cannot find employment here in industry or anything else they will fly the country.  For those who remain on the farms the social conditions, the conditions under which they will rear their children and the marriage conditions will all be deplorably low.</P>
    <P>With regard to emigration, I hope it is not necessary for me to stress this to the House at any great length, but I do wish that somebody would try to make some answer in regard to this question of emigration.  I do not want the foolish answer that has been given from time to time that we are an adventurous people and that the 250,000 people who left this country in the last six or seven years left it for the sake of adventure.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has had its coming of age.  It reached the adult stage, if it did not reach the age of wisdom, some time recently.  There was a party and the Taoiseach said that the great aim of the Fianna Fáil Party now was to recover the Six Counties.  What is the good of parading that as a slogan when in the last six years we have emptied out the population of the remaining three Ulster counties?  The three Ulster counties still remaining with us have a population of somewhere over 220,000.  Compare that with the 250,000 we have emigrated.  If we take the population at 250,000, then we have emptied out the entire population, men, women and children, of the three remaining Ulster counties.  Have we sent them abroad to get back the other six?  Will some Minister tell us if it is a drain that has to go on, or is there any scheme or any kind of economic policy to hold our people with us, those of them we have left, and to make some provision for them while they stay at home?</P>
    <P>The last census showed that we are still having a drift from the country into the cities.  The last Minister for Agriculture decided at a recent meeting to remark upon this, and he explained that it is not unnatural.  He said we will always have people leaving the rural areas for the cities; it is not unnatural, though statisticians may bewail it.  Members of the Hierarchy <Col N="2123" /> say that the country life is good and that it is the real life and the Minister for Agriculture can go to all sorts of social functions and explain how good the farmers' life is; it is the best life in the end, he tells us.  But his predecessor has told the populace that it is not unnatural for the people to leave the land.</P>
    <P>When one thinks of the low income condition to which the people there have been reduced, one might well agree with the Minister in that.  The Minister might have thought a little of his responsibility for bringing about the not unnatural condition of the people who are flying from their homesteads and drifting to the cities, where they delay a while before they can get from the United Kingdom authorities tickets and travel permits to go to England.</P>
    <P>Even for those who stay on the land, what is the situation?  According to the census returns of 1936, 66 per cent. of the womenfolk under 30 years of age are unmarried.  Of the men under 30 years, 88 per cent. are unmarried. According to that report, this country has the unenviable distinction of less marriages and later marriages than any other country in the world.  We have the number of old people in our population increasing relative to the rest, and the number of children decreasing, and decreasing at a very rapid rate.  That is what, possibly, a reliance on agriculture, as it has been worked for some years, means, and yet agriculture is the mainstay of the community.  When one thinks of the decline that has been revealed by every test&mdash;the flight from the land, from the country, the reluctance to get married, the reluctance to rear families on the land, the low income rate at which the people have to live on the land&mdash;one can better appreciate the injury the Government's policy is doing to the country.  That is definitely a picture of decline and decay.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the Book of Estimates. It indicates the biggest sum we have ever been asked to vote&mdash;£52,000,000&mdash; and we shall have £6,000,000 or £8,000,000 added elsewhere.  The estimate <Col N="2124" /> for our primary industry is Vote 29, and the Minister is asking for £1,525,942.  He is asking for £1,500,000 out of £52,000,000.  That is the Government attitude towards agriculture, as depicted in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>There is another interesting Estimate in this Book, for Aviation and Meteorological Services.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is asking under that heading for £1,435,488, very nearly the same sum as for agriculture. Aviation and meteorological services demand from the taxpayer as much money as the Minister wants to look after our main industry.  What does he say with regard to the main industry? He introduced this Estimate on Friday and he spoke about nine columns of the Official Debates.  He described the sub-heads and it is rather interesting to see what increases he indicated as being of importance over the Vote his predecessor asked last year.</P>
    <P>May I pause for a moment to speak of one of them?  The cost of the personnel in Vote 29 has gone up by £28,000 on last year's figure of £271,000.  That, the Minister says, represents the increased moneys paid to the civil servants&mdash;£1 in £10 of the cost-of-living figure that has even jumped ten points within the last three or four days, reaching a record high point in the history of this country. With all classes of goods, according to the index figure of wholesale prices, doubled in their cost, the civil servants who got £271,000 last year are supposed to be satisfied by getting an advance of £1 in £10 in their salaries this year.</P>
    <P>That represents £28,000 of the Minister's increases.  What is the rest of it?  He wants to be allowed to spend certain moneys in connection with international organisations&mdash;a trifle of £7,000.  There is a subsidy by way of fertilisers&mdash;£166,000.  There is an increase in the provision made for some aid in the purchase of agricultural implements&mdash;£4,000.  That is extra on last year's Vote for whatever aid was given to the getting of agricultural implements.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is a sum that is just short of £300,000 for fertiliser credit dockets.  I think we can take these <Col N="2125" /> two fertiliser items together.  They represent £450,000 of a total increase of £500,000.  What are they?  They represent the Government effort to help the farmers to remake their land.  The land has suffered badly through being overcropped in recent years and there will be this provision for fertilisers to repair the damage done.  That is the Minister's relief to agriculture this year.  It is something like the rebuilding of blitzed buildings, the replenishment of goods that should be in various outfitters' shops, but are not there because they could not be got in recent years.  All this attempt to restore the capital value of the land will cost somewhere in the region of £450,000.  But by way of provision for increased production, by way of any new scheme to aid the farmers, there is nothing in the main Estimate.  I am not forgetting the subsidies.  Subsidies mean that agriculture again has to be put on the dole but, thinking of the main Estimate, the division which I would make between the two is that subsidies are regarded as a merely temporary concession and this main Vote represents what the Minister would have to spend to bring agriculture into a proper condition.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks of these things for four or five of the columns for which he spoke in connection with the whole Estimate.  He then has two quarrels, one with the cattle traders lasting about a column, and another with the bacon curers lasting another column. He rebuked the bacon curers for having mixed politics with the very important matter of bacon.  Deputies may laugh but this is not the first time that politics was mixed with bacon.  The Minister then told us that he had no legislative proposals and he thinks he is justified in holding his horses because he has not had much time for the study of the various proposals and he has not got round them yet.  What are those things that he has to study? There was an agricultural commission set up and they produced finally this big volume of reports on agricultural policy.  They had previously produced three interim reports and when the main volume and the three interim reports had been published the Government <Col N="2126" /> produced three White Papers. It is interesting to note the dates.  The first interim report was produced away back in August, 1943&mdash;nearly four years ago, another came in March, 1944, a third came in July, 1944.  The main report came just two years ago&mdash;two years ago and about a fortnight.  After pondering over these documents, some of them for two years and some of them for a year, the Minister's Department issued these White Papers.  One of them came in January, 1946, and the other two came in May and June, 1946. The Minister told us that these documents have thoroughly examined the whole position of agriculture.  So they have, but the Minister has no legislative proposals.  That may be a good thing, but the Minister's reason as to why he thinks it proper to have no legislative proposals is that he has not time to consider these matters.</P>
    <P>Away back in July, 1944, an appeal was made in this House, joined in by almost every Party, that the Government should at least take time by the forelock to a certain extent.  The contrast was made that this country, being neutral, had not any of the immediate difficulties of the belligerent countries. The view was expressed and correctly expressed that the people engaged in the war were intent on winning the war they had got into and they had all sorts of conditions to think of with regard to money, munitions, transport, manpower and everything else.  They naturally had not much time to think of three, four or five years ahead.  It was explained at the time that we here had certainly plenty of time for that sort of thing.  We had none of the immediate urgent problems of the belligerents and the Government were reminded of that.  In July, 1944, they were asked to bend themselves to thinking of the shape of the post-war world. Even though the proposals might not be other than tentative, at least they would show some activity in the region of thought.  They were asked to try to make some preparations ahead and we were told that the matter of post-war planning was being very accurately and very vigorously brought under review.</P>
    <P>So far as the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="2127" /> is concerned, the Minister in charge of the chief industry of the country which occupies half the gainfully occupied people here, even though these reports go back to 1943, and his own Department have been proposing schemes and putting forward tentative proposals, he has not his mind made up yet.  He does not know when it will be possible for him to make up his mind or whether he will bring in any proposals or not.  I am sure the Minister must have experienced a certain shock in reading the full volume&mdash;the main report as well as the minority report.  The main report signed by a very prominent supporter of the Government Party amounts to a very definite recantation of the foolish economics of which the Government Party spoke before they got into office and which they tried to operate for ten years after they got there.  I am sure it came as a great shock to the Minister to find that people reared in the same school of thought, if I can call it thought, as he was, should have signed that document.  If time permitted there would be great enjoyment in reading the second paragraph of this in regard to wheat and a variety of other matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister must have also got a considerable shock when he read the special interim report that dealt with pigs.  The Minister's predecessor, or the Minister's officials are to be congratulated on the delicate way in which they produced the White Paper and the delicate language they used in the White Paper on the reorganisation of the pig and bacon industry.  For three pages we have sketched the history of the various boards set up to ruin the whole pig industry of the country.  In any event we get a statement about the hypothetical price and the appointed price, winding up with the statement at the top of page 5:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As results anticipated from the price mechanism referred to in the preceding paragraph were not realised the system of specifying hypothetical prices was abandoned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A hypothetical price presupposes a hypothetical pig of course and the pigs were no longer there.  What is <Col N="2128" /> euphemistically called the pig population seriously declined but the curers did not decline.  We have the delicate little phrase there: &ldquo;The system of specifying hypothetical prices was abandoned.&rdquo;  That covers a multitude of sins.  The Minister knows to what I am referring.  Deputies know too because I have tried to enlighten them on many occasions.  The principle was that a certain price was fixed as a hypothetical price.  If the curers had to pay more than that for pigs, they were reimbursed by the board and if they paid less they had to pay the difference to the board.  The curers did not abandon that fund.  They discovered £300,000 in the till on one occasion.  They raided the till and they took the £300,000.  The Government set up a commission to inquire what had happened the £300,000.  The commission said that the curers took it. The Government apparently said that it was just too bad but took no further action and the system of hypothetical prices was thereafter abandoned.</P>
    <P>One other thing was abandoned in connection with pig production. Deputies who were in this House when Fianna Fáil came into the House will remember that one of their pet schemes to save agriculture was the maize meal mixture.  When Fianna Fáil came into office the maize meal mixture was attempted.  I suppose a graph showing the success in preventing imports of maize and a graph showing the decline in pig production would very nearly correspond, one with the other.</P>
    <P>Now, we are in the aftermath of a war, and maize cannot be got.  When it was to be got we would not have it, but now that we cannot get it, having been taught by the absence of the commodity, the Minister says: &ldquo;Oh, pig production will come all right if we can only get maize&rdquo;.  Any member of the Fianna Fáil Party who ten years ago said that imported maize was required for the feeding of pigs would certainly have been put out of the Party and flung into the throng of emigrants so as to get rid of his noxious influence on the community as soon as possible. Now that the war has stopped, we are looking for maize.  Somebody suggests legislation, but the Minister's excuse is <Col N="2129" />&ldquo;what is the good&rdquo;?  He says in the introduction of his Estimate:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I need not bring in any legislation about pigs.  All the legislation in the world would not add a single pig to the numbers in the country&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>and, in that, he is right.</P>
    <P>He says &ldquo;what I require is maize&rdquo;, and he made a rather astounding suggestion that he would himself go anywhere to get maize.  That should be at the end of this document, because it shows at last a concrete realisation on the part of the Minister of all the nonsense that passed for his Party's policy on agriculture some years ago. The Minister is afraid of legislative proposals.  At least he sheers off them at the moment.  But his speech showed quite clearly that he has no plan; that he has not even studied his own document. One would think that as member of the Party and a prospective Minister he would have had time to make up these things, but he may be right that legislative proposals are bad.</P>
    <P>We have had so much interference with agriculture and we have seen such deplorable results of that interference that most people would agree that the Minister was probably wise in deciding not to contemplate any more.  But what does the Minister offer instead? Has he a policy?  Has he any idea of future activity?  Is it merely a matter that he is going around to the various associations in the country and saying that he knows that farmers have had a hard time and that he will do all he can and that farming is still the best life and things like that, but when are we going to hear his policy?  Is the policy merely this Estimate and the various subheads of odd bits of money here and there to try to remake the harm and damage done to the land in recent years?  Do we want to get back to the 1939 position?  Are the targets, to use that expression, no higher than that? Have we no realisation of the new situation in this country that we cannot now draw on the old accumulated credits mostly accrued from farming activity, and that we will have to export visible goods in future according to the Minister's own colleague? Why are we to get only what our agricultural <Col N="2130" /> goods will buy for us?  How does he propose to get these goods?  As I said, leaving legislation outside, has he a policy at all?</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister and his colleagues are all going around now on the same note.  They say that for years back the farmer has been getting everything in the way of bigger prices, that he has been met as far as prices go.  But the volume of agricultural production has remained pretty static, and I take it that the present Minister is joining his defeatist predecessor in accepting the view that you cannot look for anything from agriculture in this country, and what whatever may be done elsewhere we can do nothing. That appears to be the line of the Minister himself, as it was of his predecessor&mdash;the acceptance of the theory that we are different from other countries and that if they can get production we cannot.</P>
    <P>I take one article with regard to production in <i>Studies</i> for December, 1938.  The writer of that article set out to examine the physical possibility of increasing production, and thereby increasing the exports of agriculture.  He then writes this very arresting sentence:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no evidence that there has been any appreciable increase in the total production of agriculture in this country since the beginning of the century.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have spoken with the writer of this article and he tells me it is conservative, that he should put the date as 1870 instead of 1900, so that since the days of the Franco-Prussian war there has been no appreciable increase of the production of agriculture in this country.  The course zig-zagged&mdash;it went up in our time a bit, but Fianna Fáil saw that what we added went away.  Is that statement accepted?  It states that there has been no appreciable increase in agriculture in this country since the beginning of the century.  If that is so there is an immediate problem.  Here is where a big interrogation make raises its head. The writer goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...the export of butter from Denmark has doubled from an average <Col N="2131" /> of 76,000 metric tons during the years 1901-1905 to a figure of 152,971 metric tons in 1937.  The export of bacon and hams has more than doubled from 76,000 metric tons to 181,000 metric tons, and the export of eggs has almost quadrupled from 3,600,000 great hundreds to 13,400,000 great hundreds.  The impression is sometimes given that Danish production is obtained to an overwhelming degree by the use of imported foods. The fact is that, in the years 1935-37, of the total food units used 86 per cent. were produced in the country.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The export of butter from New Zealand to the United Kingdom increased from 12,600 tons in 1913 to 147,500 tons in 1937, and the export of cheese increased from 27,000 tons in 1913 to 86,500 tons in 1937.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know whether these figures are accepted by the Department.  They have been spoken of in this House. They must have been brought under review by the Minister's advisers. There may be some point of detail which may be challenged with regard to their accuracy but if the general picture is correct, what is wrong with this country?  Denmark can double&mdash; more than double&mdash;her hams and bacon and quadruple her eggs.  New Zealand can go along the line of increased exports, and if it can be said that the volume of production here has not advanced since the 1900's, can the Minister say what is wrong?</P>
    <P>New Zealand and Denmark were very much in the picture when the Minister's predecessor went to Cork some time ago.  He went to read a paper to the Cork students, the Agricultural Society in University College, Cork.  At that time, the Minister had made a big effort to help agriculture.  He had cleared off the people considered to be surplus to agricultural requirements. He had cleared between 30,000 and 40,000 people off the land in his time of office.  He was talking, I think, in the year 1938 but in that time he had deprived of their position on the land somewhere between 30,000 and 40,000 people.  I have often remarked before that this country reserves a special <Col N="2132" /> place in its detestation for the landlords who cleared the land, and you have various landlords in various parts of the country to-day held up to public execration because they threw off as many as 100 or 1,000 people from their holdings.</P>
    <P>Dr. Ryan, the then Minister for Agriculture, cleared 40,000 off the land and nobody apparently thought it was worth while saying anything to him about it. In any event, they had gone, and the Minister probably felt relieved by their going.  He said that even with the lowered number he was constrained to listen to a lot of talk about what was called the &ldquo;back-to-the-land&rdquo; policy. Of course, the main authors of the &ldquo;back-to-the-land&rdquo; policy were the Taoiseach and his group of Ministers. It is certainly not a year ago since the Taoiseach harped back to his old view that this country should support 8,000,000 people at a time when we had arrived at the point of having a population of only 3,000,000.  Yet the then Minister for Agriculture thought there were too many people on the land, got rid of them, and protested against any &ldquo;back-to-the-land&rdquo; policy.  He said that if any policy of that sort is permitted it can only mean a reduction in the average size of holdings followed by a smaller income per person for those engaged in agriculture.  He said that if we get to a lower stage than that reached in 1938 it would mean that the farmer would be able to produce only enough for himself and his family and that he would have no surplus to sell&mdash; probably not enough for maintenance purposes.  However, he did recognise that this country had to buy certain necessary imports and that the only way to get the currency to pay for them was by exporting, and he recognised that agriculture was the only export. He said that.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;when this war is over, we must continue as far as we can to export agricultural produce.  We shall do so, however, in the knowledge that we cannot control the price of our exports.  We must, in fact, compete against the big exporting countries all over the world.  We may be compelled to discontinue some of the exports that before this war had <Col N="2133" /> become entirely uneconomic.  The first of these, and the one that will interest the present audience most, is dairy products.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Having brought in the matter of dairy products to this Agricultural Students' Association in these gloomy terms he then steeped himself in gloom:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We cannot compete on equal terms with the Antipodes.  The question is often asked why our farmers cannot compete with New Zealand in the production of butter. Before the war we were both on the British market, and it may appear strange that New Zealand so far away could increase her exports and evidently build up a profitable business while our exports declined, even though we helped producers through an export bounty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the explanation! The then Minister went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The farms are bigger in New Zealand and can be more easily mechanised than ours.  They have practically no winter to provide for. Their milk yields per cow are higher. They can, therefore, produce a much larger volume per person engaged in agriculture than our farmers can here.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And he continued that in all these circumstances we might look forward to the virtual elimination of our trade in dairy products and that if such a course should become necessary it would not be so disastrous to farmers as might at first sight be feared.</P>
    <P>
      <i>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle took the Chair.</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister then referred to bacon.  He told the Cork audience:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When the war is over, the price of exported bacon will probably be lower still, and I have no doubt the free import of maize meal will be advocated for the feeding of pigs.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister himself advocated, but he said, nevertheless, there was danger ahead in this whole pig business and he came to this summing up:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The obvious thing to do is to reduce pig stock to about our present <Col N="2134" /> number, which is only sufficient to supply the wants of our own consumers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So there was the dairy products industry killed and the pig business killed! His colleague who was then, I think, Minister for Industry and Commerce but who was only known here as the Minister for Local Government presented himself also at a meeting of students in University College, Dublin. His view was that, so far as he could see the price for cattle was going to go down after the war, in which case, he said, we could look forward to the virtual extermination of the cattle trade.  Between the two&mdash;dairy products and the pig business&mdash;we would not be able to supply the home market and we might look forward to the virtual elimination of the cattle trade! I wonder if the present Minister accepts these views.  Does the present Minister, for instance, hold the views of his predecessor which I have read &mdash;that there is practically no winter in New Zealand, that the farms are bigger and can be more easily mechanised? I think he will have to accept the last statement that the milk yields per cow are higher.  But why?  This matter has recently been examined by Dr. Kennedy of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society and, in the paper he read, he states he is tempted to make a comparison with New Zealand.  He said that the comparison is most important on account of the similarity of climatic conditions.  I quote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The greater part of the butter is produced in the Northern Island. In it there is a high and more or less uniformly distributed rainfall, the conditions in that respect being very similar to ours.  The winter temperatures are higher, and cows are wintered in the open protected by rugs.  It is a mistake to suggest, however, that it is unnecessary to provide winter food.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then gives statistics which show that for four months they have to conserve their fodder entirely and for eight months in part.  I quote further:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The New Zealand farmer has some advantage in winter conditions. On the other hand, there is a much more frequent occurrence of summer <Col N="2135" /> drought&mdash;in the last summer the drought was particularly serious.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He follows with a paragraph about the condition of the soil and gives his own conclusion which he fortifies with statements made to him, that the land in this country is incomparably better land than the New Zealand land.  He said that a great part of New Zealand land was man-made; that it was necessary to burn the scrub in the Bush and sow the seeds, that it was man-made and stock-made, and that even yet there is certainly nothing inferior in the type of land we have for agricultural production.  He comes finally to the last point which contradicts the statement of the previous Minister for Agriculture:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is a very prevalent idea that New Zealand dairy farms are very large, and that because of the magnitude of their operations it is possible to produce far more cheaply than in Ireland.  It is true that the size of the herds and of the farms is greater than in this country, but there is a very considerable proportion of our farms comparable in size. The average dairy farm is about 100 statute acres carrying about 50 milking cows with young stock for replacements.  Of all New Zealand farms 78 per cent. would fall within the range in size of the farms surveyed in North Cork by Mr. Murphy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He continues by making a comparison of the amazing increase in production in New Zealand and compares it with the static production here.  I think the statement of Dr. Ryan will not bear examination&mdash;this talk of his about bigger farms as though they were something immensely to the advantage of New Zealand.  The statement about practically no winter is a gross exaggeration.  Remember, there are advantages on our side too. We are both competing for the British market.  We have a very narrow strip of water across which to convey our goods.  New Zealand has to come thousands of miles yet, according to Dr. Ryan, the previous Minister for Agriculture, New Zealand traded with Britain on terms which would bankrupt <Col N="2136" /> this country if we agreed to them. I have often talked about the sense of frustration I feel when I consider this matter of New Zealand.  New Zealand is a country which every Labour Deputy in this House holds up as an example, and very properly do the Labour Deputies do so.  New Zealand has higher wage rates, better labour conditions.  It has more in the way of complete employment and, in so far as the question is comparable, they have a bigger range of social security and social services than this country can ever hope to have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>And a lower cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Big wages and good conditions of labour; all these things we classify as social services; a great housing programme which they carried out very successfully.  Yet they are up to their necks in debt.  Deputy Davin said they have a lower cost of living than we have.  They can produce agricultural produce and send it thousands of miles across the ocean and they are satisfied to take a price for it, and, apparently, to make money out of that price, which the previous Minister for Agriculture said would bankrupt our people if they were to take it.  Why is that so?  What curse is on this country that we cannot advance in agricultural production?  Denmark can do it; New Zealand can do it.  New Zealand is handicapped by all the things that should make for increased cost of production.  Notwithstanding that, she has had this amazing increase in her volume of production, can transport it immense distances and sell it at a price with which we cannot compete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take Dr. Kennedy's statement.  He says it is not the size of the farms. So far as conditions are concerned, climatically we are very much the same. They have it better in the winter; we have it better in the summer.  So far as the land is concerned, we have the advantage.  So far as distance is concerned, we have an enormous advantage. We have hundreds of millions to our credit abroad; New Zealand is up to her neck in debt.  Everything that seems to count as an advantage is on <Col N="2137" /> our side.  Everything that seems to count as a disadvantage is on New Zealand's side.</P>

I believe there are certain answers, that there <Col N="2139" /> are answers to three out of four of the problems.  As to the fourth, there is this big note of interrogation.  If you keep a dual purpose animal, you have to look not merely to the profits from milk, but to the profits from beef as well.  It is unfair to compare that condition with the conditions in a country which is only concerned with milk.  That is all argued out.  The dual-purpose animal, the proper cultivation of the land, the proper seeding of the land, the proper working of it, the proper use of fertilisers; these are all things that were harped upon.  Then there is the particular matter of the winter that our animals have to go through as opposed to the milder winter temperature in New Zealand, where cattle can be kept out with merely a rug for protection.  You require to meet that.  He said it should be met and that it is easy to meet it.  In addition to that, he speaks of the great advance in the use of the machine in New Zealand.  We have not got it.  Are we going to get it? Can we get it with the small farms?</P>

      <P>I am asking the Minister as a responsible Minister and as the moulder of our future agricultural policy what he is going to do about all these things.  Dr. Kennedy makes many comparisons&mdash;one with New Zealand and another with Denmark.</P>
      <P>I would like to offer to this House again a suggestion&mdash;even though it may be a bee that is buzzing very loudly in my bonnet it is a matter that requires very careful consideration in relation to agriculture among other things&mdash;and that is why not take off the shoulders of agriculture some of the burdens that have been put on it?  The rates are very heavy and they are going to be still heavier.  We got that definitely from Dr. Ward last year in this House.  Deputy Allen knows that. He protested against it very bitterly last year and he agreed that that was going to be the position.  The rates are going to go up and go up very rapidly.  We are going to be compulsorily driven into good health or better health than we enjoy at the moment. We are going to have new public health institutions.  All these things will cost money.  All these things will go on the rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comment has been made here in regard to the burdens placed on agriculture because of the waywardness of the industrial policy pursued here.  There was one very interesting interlude in the history of Government in the <Col N="2142" /> last 15 years.  Just as war broke out the Taoiseach thought fit to relieve the then Minister for Industry and Commerce of his duties as such Minister and to make him wholly and entirely Minister for Supplies.  He moved into the Department of Industry and Commerce the then Minister for Local Government. That Minister went almost immediately&mdash;I think he was six weeks in office at the time&mdash;to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and he informed the Dublin Chamber of Commerce of the iniquities of the tariff situation.  He gave as an example one undertaking.  He adopted it and I presume it was a fair example.  He gave one undertaking and he said that after a high tariff had been in operation for several years he found that the cost of a routine job was twice as much as elsewhere and the wastage due to bad workmanship was from 30 to 50 per cent. of the value of the finished product and that the gross net profit after all that was 80 per cent. of what it was costing.  He took that himself as an example of what tariffs did.  The routine job cost twice as much as it would elsewhere; it was done wastefully and bad workmanship represented 30 to 50 per cent. of the finished value and, in the end, the profit was only 80 per cent.  He told the Chamber of Commerce:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I shall do my best to persuade my colleagues in the Government that those responsible, whether as employers or employees, for the concern have had their chance, that they have shown themselves unworthy of support, and that the whole thing should be written off as a dead loss to the nation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He told the Chamber of Commerce that he found certain figures very disturbing. He said he found industrial incomes had increased, at a time when agricultural output had dropped, from 38 millions in 1926 to 49 millions in 1938.  What industry had gained agriculture had lost and more than lost.  He went on to say that he was surprised at this because more manufacturers and more workers should have involved more workers and greater production in agriculture.  Greater production in industry should have induced greater production in agriculture.  He said that <Col N="2143" /> had not been the result and he asked himself why.  He gave the answer; he said it was because the industries that had been tariffed had been wrongly chosen and that he was going to get rid of a lot of them.  Unfortunately, before he could get going, he was removed from office and the Minister who had originally put on these tariffs which his colleague torpedoed was back again holding fast to these industries.</P>
    <P>That Minister, in particular, adverted to the very heavy burden that the industrial policy of the country had placed upon agriculture and he said he was going to relieve agriculture of that burden.  That was the Minister who then occupied the office of Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That was the mind he then had.  It was not that he was specially devoted to agriculture, but he saw the harm that was being done.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister who is now in charge of agriculture take up his colleague's statements on that occasion and will he ask him for a list of those industries that were handicapping agriculture so badly and see if he can do what his colleague could not do?</P>
    <P>There is one matter upon which I feel that I must have earned the reputation of being a crank; that is, this question of capitalisation in connection with land.  Denmark is the other country that immediately comes into comparison with us.  Denmark has been made the subject of quite an intensive piece of study by Dr. Beddy, who wrote a paper on it.  Dr. Beddy points out the terrible disadvantages under which this country labours in any such comparison.  He winds up by pointing to the standard of living in both countries. He first of all deals with the immense productivity of Denmark and, in particular, her increased productivity while this country is still adhering to the old form of production which we had with us for many years.  At the end of his paper he makes a comparison on the standard of living as between this country and Denmark.  A number of the things he regards as marks of the standard of living I would not care to classify as such, but his <Col N="2144" /> trained mind did happen on these things.  He says precisely in this paper that there is a higher standard of living in Denmark &ldquo;than in Éire as indeed is suggested by the respective national incomes of both countries. While available statistics do not permit of precise measurement in this matter, a few facts will serve to support the point.  In Denmark in 1938 there was a telephone to every ten or 11 persons; in Éire there was not quite one to every 100 persons&rdquo;.  I am not sure that that is not a blessing but nevertheless he puts it in as an indication of a higher standard of living.</P>
    <P>He said: &ldquo;Nearly one out of every five persons had a wireless set as compared with a little over one to every 20 persons in Éire.&rdquo;  Again, there are people who might doubt that as a standard. &ldquo;These and other amenities are not confined to urban districts.  Unlike Éire, in nearly all rural homes there is electric light; in many there is central heating, a bathroom and a telephone; while in even the smallest, house there is usually a wireless set.&rdquo;  He talks then about the automobile figure and it is rather surprising here to find that Denmark has over two and a quarter times more automobiles than Éire.  She has two and a quarter times as many cars as this country.  He relates his comparison then to the conditions of life.  He deals with what the people eat and drink and his comparison is adverse to this country.  He talks about the consumption of tea on our side as against the consumption of coffee on the Danish side, and the comparison is not to our benefit.  He talks about the use of sugar, tobacco, meat, cheese and bacon and in all these things the Danish standard of living was higher than our standard here.</P>
    <P>He deals with this vexed question of debt and he calls it capital investment in the land.  He adds up all the various items that go to the making of debt in the case of the Danish farmer and in the end it is found that the whole debt that the farming community in Denmark has to bear was £198,000,000. As far as this country is concerned, by adding in certain things which he says should not really be brought into consideration, <Col N="2145" /> the debt in this country as far as the farming community is concerned is £14,000,000. £14,000,000 as opposed to £198,000,000.  Remember, that is debt inside the country.  There was a time, away back in 1870, when Denmark had the same position externally as we have.  There were bundles of money abroad.  The whole world owed her money and she did not owe to anybody.  By one means or another, that money was brought home in the shape of machinery or something else and Denmark arrived at the position where, as a nation, she owed abroad and the indvidual members of the community owed £198,000,000 to members of the farming community. We owe £14,000,000.  We have immense credits abroad.  We have the Danish position of 1870.</P>
    <P>But Doctor Beddy will not accept that as being debt; he calls it agricultural capitalisation, and the contrast he makes is that to every cultivated acre in this country we have about 25/-of a debt or, if you add in the Land Bonds, we have a debt of £3 10s. for a cultivated acre.  The Danish figure is £25 10s.  I am sure a lot of people will whoop at that and say: &ldquo;Is not that a great position?&rdquo; But we have not shown it to be a great position.  One has the example given from time to time in newspapers of people who are picked up in rags in the streets, found dead from malnutrition, and it is discovered, when their means are inquired into, that they have any amount of money but, through some oddity or miserly habits, they have decided to go without food, which brings them to their death, rather than spend the money they have.  One often sees through the countryside houses let go into a rather derelict condition and when inquiries are made you will find the owner has considerable sums of money, but he would let the house go to rack and ruin rather than put his money into it.</P>
    <P>We have any amount of money abroad and we would be anxious to get it home, but we have never had the habit of putting money into the land here.  What this paper calls agricultural capitalisation is very low and, <Col N="2146" /> unless you capitalise in these modern days, you cannot get work done.  A man is timid about putting money into a machine because it may mean that he will go into debt.  Possibly he has no realisation that the machine will save its money many times over.  But debt is a thing people shrink from.  According to the best view one hears nowadays about debt, it is nothing to be ashamed of.  I am not speaking of the waster who lives beyond his means and whatever step he may take it only still further shoves him into the bog.  I am speaking of the community that has an objective and that has resources, and particularly the community that is under-developed and has plenty of money.  Debt is nothing to be afraid of.  Debt, according to one of the textbook writers, means nothing more than the standard of a person's credit-worthiness. Debt is a measure of the credit a person once had.  Debt means how much credit should he be allowed to run, so there is apparently something to be deplored about not having a profitable investment made in the land here.  Is such an investment required?</P>
    <P>I turn to the last page, but one, of the main report on agricultural policy, where Dr. Kennedy, after signing a minority report of his own, adds an estimate on capital requirements.  He said he does not intend it as anything in the way of an accurate estimate. One of the phrases he uses is that it represents the order of magnitude of the requirements and he places the requirements for the land in this country under five different heads:&mdash; The better improvement of the land. housing&mdash;mainly for stock&mdash;equipment &mdash;farm implements, etc.&mdash;better provision for live stock, and water supplies. The whole tots up to £217,000,000.  He said it is not to be taken as an accurate estimate, but it shows the magnitude of the requirements.</P>
    <P>£217,000,000 is not a frightening sum.  If this country had been bombed during the war, £217,000,000 would have been very little in the matter of damage.  If we got off with £217,000,000 worth of harm being done, it would be very light.  It is less than one year's <Col N="2147" /> national income, supposing we spent the whole of it at one go, but of course we could not do that.  There is a great need for investment in land, he says, and it is rated as highly as £217,000,000.  Can we get it?  Of course we can, and more.  I am not now talking about the £300,000,000 that we have abroad, the £300,000,000 that we shall never see, because it is being depreciated at a much faster rate than normally it could ever be.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about the amount of money that is made in some sort of production in this country and that is not put back into production.  Classical economists always tell you that from your current production you must make enough to support the people who are producing; you must give profits to those who have involved their money in any sort of productivity and you must have a certain amount saved for investment purposes.  If you do not do that, and make money or borrow money, you are in for a certain type of inflation.  What do we do in this country?  We apparently make money out of some sort of production and we do not invest here and it is sent abroad.  Some part is left here, but a great part is sent abroad.  Quite a considerable amount rests at home. The reverend chairman of the Central Savings Committee made a statement to the quarterly meeting of that group in June, 1941.  He made a series of calculations about what he called the small savings movement in this country.  It is a phrase that has become popular since that time.  He talked of the various avenues you have of getting savings out of production, what savings there were, what they had accumulated to and what the annual rate might be expected to be in the year 1941.  He made a calculation which amounted to £50,000,000, between money that was on deposit in the joint stock banks at 1 per cent., money lodged in Savings Certificates, money in the Post Office Savings Bank and money in the Trustee Savings Bank.</P>
    <P>The figure is now £82,000,000&mdash;I am taking all the figures from the recent estimates &mdash; £82,000,000 which people <Col N="2148" /> some way or another have saved.  What are they content to do with it?  As far as £30,000,000 is concerned, that money is left in the banks, drawing less than 1 per cent.  As far as £11,500,000 is concerned, that amount is in Savings Certificates, where it does not get anything more than 1.1 per cent. of a return.  The other two figures, which I cannot divide, amount to £41,000,000 between the Post Office Savings Bank and the Trustee Savings Bank.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Trustee Savings Bank we had legislation recently, as a result of which it was decided to reduce the 2½ per cent. return on deposits to something lower than that.  If the calculation made by the chairman in this address as to the volume of savings is accurate there is a sum of £50,000,000 which is not bringing in more than 1 per cent.  Certainly as far as the £50,000,000 is concerned, it is not bringing in more than I per cent.  The people of this country of their own accord are willing to lend money, or at least to put money by in Savings Certificates and in the banks, and take less than 2 per cent. on it.  Dr. Kennedy thinks that we want £217,000,000 for the reorganisation of industry, but there is £82,000,000 on which the people are content to take 1 per cent.  Could we not bridge the gap between the requirement of the £217,000,000 and the availability of the £82,000,000?  I cannot see any difficulty in that. Australia and New Zealand did it. Denmark certainly did it.  Denmark has a debt of £198,000,000 to which the agricultural societies, the State banks and financial organisations contributed the largest part.  The commercial banks were responsible for only 7 per cent. of the whole debt.  There is money, and money galore, available in this country for capital development. If the Minister wants money for agricultural utilisation, why cannot that money be used?  When I put that point of view before I was met with the taunt: &ldquo;Oh, these are short-term savings and we cannot use them for long-term purposes&rdquo;.  Of course you can.  All you have to do is to provide a State guarantee that the State will provide the money should the depositors call for repayment.  Over-the <Col N="2149" /> years the people have not rushed in to withdraw their money, which is now accumulated to the extent of £82,000,000.  I do not think they are going to change their habits suddenly. The money is there to be used and agriculture apparently requires it.</P>
    <P>The last point about which I want to speak is the ever-present bogey of inflation.  I am sure that I shall be told that if we put money into agriculture at the moment, it is going to mean putting new money into circulation and the raising of prices all round.  We are faced with the programme&mdash;I hope it is nothing more than a programme; I do not believe it is anything more than a programme&mdash;of expenditure by the Government on a variety of roads.  I have seen a road plan, the expenditure on which is calculated at £20,000,000 or £30,000,000.  We are going to spend millions of money also on public health institutions.  We have a variety of schemes for airports and fantastic projects of that kind, not one of which will aid production.  If you put certain money into a scheme to aid production, that will not cause inflation.  The only money which has an inflationary effect is money which is spent and produces no return in goods.  The only form of expenditure in this country now, if we are looking for an immediate return in consumers' goods, that will not have an inflationary effect, is expenditure on agriculture.  If we spend £4,000,000 this year and get £2,000,000 worth of extra production, we have not caused anything like the inflation effected by tourists who come into the country.  The only safe investment, the only safe way to spend money and to avoid inflation, is to invest it in agriculture.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The agricultural industry could do more capital development inside the next year than has been done in industry over the last five or six years.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the statement of the Minister's own colleague and I take the Minister's own statement that he can do nothing at the moment.  Is that his attitude towards emigration and his contribution towards stopping the flight from the land?  If that is so, I wonder why the Minister should ask for £1,500,000. Why should he ask for £1,500,000 if he cannot do anything this year?  Is the £156,000 to be devoted to fertilisers the biggest amount that can be expended this year?  Is there a grain of sense at all in what the Minister for Finance said in the Seanad last year in regard to building outhouses for cattle and so on?  Is there anything in that statement?  I do not know but I take it that when the Minister said that he was referring to Government policy and that the present Minister would help to solve unemployment by implementing this policy. If we are speaking of a year or two ahead, I should like the Minister to let us know in view of statements that have been made about building outhouses whether he has any intention of giving effect to that policy or are we to take it that this statement was made in the same mood as that of his colleague who said that dairy products had no future as items of export from this country?</P>
      <P>Does he think that as far as bacon is concerned we have to concentrate on efficient production and manufacture for our own people and nothing else?  Does he think the cattle trade is at any point nearly approaching virtual extermination?  To use that peculiar and objectionable term &ldquo;the pig population&rdquo; that figure has fallen and has continued to fall until the last return shows a new low record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not the last one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have reached in the last three years then one of the lowest points on record.  I do not know what the Minister will have to say about poultry, or if there is any hope of change there.  Or must we depend on importation?  It comes badly from a Minister who believes in a policy of self-sufficiency to tell us that we are so completely dependent on outside aid <Col N="2153" /> in the way of materials that nothing can be done to increase production in the country this year.  I did not know we had come to that profession of self-insufficiency in regard to production. I am not putting my view regarding this here.  I quoted the phrase used at the outset by the Minister.  There has been no denial that the Minister's policy was accepted by the Party behind him, and even Deputy Corry boasted the other night about the results of it.  I think he boasted rather gleefully of the situation in which we have nothing to export from this country but some cattle.</P>
      <P>Is that view accepted by the group who keep the present Ministry in power?  Is it a good situation or one that the Minister laments or is there no way out of it for the time being? Let him cast his view forward for a year or two when the ports may be open and materials flowing in.  Has he planned for that?  Has he any plan for the expenditure of money when that situation occurs?  What are his objectives? What are his aims for loans to aid the rehabilitation of agriculture in the country or does the Minister sit as his predecessor did in 1942 and say: &ldquo;We are considering the matter and supplies may be easily available&rdquo;. When supplies do become available, will the plans be ready?  I think these matters should be discussed here, and I say it again that I do not profess to have any information other than that which can be derived from a certain amount of reading, from the reports of the Minister.  But even the Minister's own written reports give you a pretty black and gloomy picture of the situation.  I did not gather anything from the Minister's speech although he prides himself on relieving the gloom. I wish he would say there was something better ahead of us than the prospect which his own reports and speeches seem to hold out for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose it would be wrong to conclude a debate of this nature to-night without referring to that unfortunate class of people who, as Deputy Norton says, live under those who live on the land&mdash;agricultural labourers.  Agricultural labour is said to be the poorest paid piece of work that any man can <Col N="2154" /> find, but it has been taken as the standard down to which they want to grade the other workers in the community. As long as the agricultural labourer is on the level to which he has been brought, there is a menace to all other people who earn their livelihood by giving their services, because they will be all graded down to the lowest.  The Minister, on the Local Government Bill, said that the wages of the road worker are to be related to the wages of the agricultural labourer.  Where are the considerations of a living wage? A living wage is supposed to be a wage on which a man may keep himself, marry and rear a family and keep them all in frugal comfort.  Does the Minister think that the wages of an agricultural labourer fall within that definition?</P>

      <P>Is the agricultural labourer such a horrid person that he has to be kept out of this debate?  Nobody in this House can stand over the wage paid to him.  On a previous occasion when I attempted to quote a phrase from a Papal Encyclical, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said he was not going to have these political and economic theories, but there is a statement in an encyclical to the effect that a man ought to get such a wage as will enable him to live himself, get married and rear a family in frugal comfort.

We can equate the present miserable wage to its real purchasing power.  I think it is a scandal and it is certainly nothing that anyone can boast about.  If it is all agriculture can provide, although it is a primary industry, then the Estimate of £1,500,000 which the Minister asks for ought to be reduced to the same level.  As I said, if it is all agriculture can provide it would be better to pay money to people to keep off the land.</P>

      <P>(a) Particulars of overdrafts on county council turf production accounts have been furnished in reply to questions by Deputy R. Ua Maolchatha on 5th May, 1943, 10th October, 1945, and 6th November, 1946 (Official Report&mdash;vol. 89, cols. 2240 and 2241; vol. 98, cols. 46 and 47; vol. 103, cols. 343 and 344).</P>
      <P>(b)  Since November, 1942, the rate of interest paid has been 3 per cent.</P>
      <P>(c)  The annual report of the Department of Local Government for 1943-44, appendix XV, shows for each county the total production in 1942 and 1943 as ascertained by sales.  Particulars of production for the 1944 season and the estimated production for the 1945 season have been furnished in reply to a question by Deputy J. Larkin on 17th April, 1947 (Official Report&mdash;vol. 105, cols. 789, 790 and 791). It is not yet possible to ascertain by sales the particulars of production for the 1946 season as there is still unmoved turf on the bogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  Particulars of the production costs for the seasons 1942 to 1945 (inclusive) have been furnished in reply to questions by Deputy P.

The costs for 1946 cannot be ascertained until the balances of turf on hands have been disposed of.</P>
    <P>(e) and (f) The full ascertained cost of turf produced by county councils and sold to Fuel Importers (Eire) Limited, Government Departments and other purchasers excluding cost of turf appropriated for councils' road machinery and county institutions will be recouped to county councils and no loss will fall on the ratepayers.  The cost to be recouped will include loading and haulage expenses.</P>
