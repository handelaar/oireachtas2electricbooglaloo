    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he has made, in recent months, any direct approach to the British Government regarding Partition; whether he has taken steps to represent to the British Government that responsibility for the continuance of Partition rests solely on them; whether he has indicated, or intends to indicate, to all concerned the basis on which, in the view of the Government, the six north-eastern counties might be re-integrated in the State; and whether he is prepared to make a public statement regarding the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in reply to a Dáil question on the 20th March last, hardly a month passes that the question of Partition does not arise in one context or another in our relations with the British authorities and, so far as official action of the Government can hasten the ending of Partition, nothing that can usefully be done is being left undone.</P>
      <P>In my speech on the 24th June on the External Affairs Estimate, I pointed out that, in order to secure a settlement for the ending of Partition, it is necessary to get concurrence of wills between three parties&mdash;we here who represent the majority of the people of Ireland, those who represent the majority in the separated part of Ireland and those who are the majority for the time being in the British Parliament. The latter, inasmuch as the British Parliament was responsible for the creation of Partition and has the key to its solution, has, of course, a primary responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="786" /> As to the basis on which Partition might be ended, and our national territory re-integrated, I have more than once indicated what in my view would be a politically practicable, though not by any means the ideal, solution, namely, that the people of the six north-eastern counties should, if they so desired, retain their present local Parliament with its existing powers, but that the powers at present reserved to and exercised by the British Parliament should be transferred to an All-Ireland Parliament in which the minority would receive their full democratic proportional representation. Effective guarantees safeguarding the democratic rights of the Nationalists within the area of jurisdiction of the local Parliament would, of course, be essential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Taoiseach admits that the primary responsibility for this matter of Partition rests with the British Government, will he consider the advisability of asking the British Government to a conference, so that that responsibility may be brought home to them and some steps taken to enlighten them on the tragedy and outrage for which they are responsible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned that matter before and I think I told him that, if I thought a conference was going to lead to useful results, of course I would ask for such a conference, but one which would not hold out prospects of leading to useful results would not be worth while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has on many occasions described our attitude towards Partition and told us where the responsibility lies, that is, with the Northern Parliament and the British Government; but would the Taoiseach let the country know what the members of the Taoiseach's Government are going to do about Partition?  This is the most favourable time there has yet been and the people should know what the situation is and what can be done about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach think it expedient to state whether the organisation known as the Connolly Club in Great Britain, which professes to organise Irishmen in Great Britain for the abolition of Partition, is a movement which he and his Party regard as a commendable one or as one to be viewed with circumspection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question and I do not think the Taoiseach has responsibility for the actions of the society referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the original question was to ask what the Government intended to do in respect of the problem of Partition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  The Taoiseach is responsible there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking if the Taoiseach thinks it expedient to say at this stage, for the information of our people at present in the United Kingdom, if their participation in the Connolly Club movement helps or hinders the realisation of the unity of Ireland?  I think it is right that the leader of the largest Party in this country should express his opinion, so that the young people may know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; they should get a lead from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They should be told whether it is wise to join that Party or not and whether it is helpful to Irish unity.  I think it is not, but I would like to hear what the Taoiseach says. I think they are not.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say whether he has made any overtures whatsoever to the Northern people, indicating how far he is prepared to go to give them safeguards in regard to, for instance, their Civil Service, compulsory Irish, old age pensions?  Has he, or will he, prepare a programme <Col N="788" /> that might be acceptable to the Northern citizens as a whole?  I have been asked to put that question by people interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put this last question to the Taoiseach?  The Taoiseach has indicated that whilst he does not regard the suggestion he has made as an entirely acceptable solution to the problem, at least it has the roots of progress within it.  Would the Taoiseach consider now discussing with the British Government the scheme he has just outlined and ascertain their views on a scheme of that kind, which is a very reasonable approach to the whole problem from our point of view?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The last occasion when I had an opportunity of dealing with this directly and immediately in conference was in 1938.  I do not think that the British Government lack any information with regard to our view on the matter.  I believe they know it now.  They know it fairly well.  I have, in private, on many occasions, informally, pointed out that this matter was one of vital importance for themselves as well as for us, and I do not know that anything would be gained by asking for a formal conference at the present time. That is my own view.  I would not like to suggest something which would not lead to some useful results. I think it might be more harmful than otherwise.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Byrne's question, our hand has been held out to the people in the North for the last 20 or 25 years.  If there is not some response, what is the use of talking about such matters as safeguards? Surely you must have some indication from the people to whom your hand is held out that they wish to grasp it, that they would wish to come down to close consideration of the matters involved. If there is any indication of that, then we would be very ready to deal with the matter in detail, both with the people in the Six Counties and with the people in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said, I think, that the latest conference was in 1938.</P>

      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as we have seen the attitude of the present British Government towards India and freedom for India, would it not be possible to make an approach to the new British Government to see what their attitude is about freedom for Ireland? It is a new Government.  Let us try them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We understand that very fully.  I can only assure the House that the thoughts that are passing through the minds of most of the members here have naturally been through my mind, since I have a serious responsibility in this whole matter and have always regarded it as the keystone of Irish relations with Britain for the last 25 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand from the Taoiseach that this matter has not been discussed between our Government and the British Government since 1938?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not formally, but it has been informally discussed with members of the different British Governments since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>One matter of urgent peril to a number of our young people is here present.  I am asking the Taoiseach, does he think it expedient at least to give these young people who may be led away a word of warning so that in any case, if they are led away, it will not be for want of a warning which can be accepted or disregarded at their own discretion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the same thing practically as the case in the United States, to which the Deputy referred yesterday.  The Deputy will understand that I would need to be very sure of my ground.  I would have to be absolutely convinced that these were in fact communistic organisations. I am not sure of that.  If I were talking without having a sense of the responsibility that I have here, I would probably say they are.  That would be my impression.  But I do not want to say that here, definitely, until I have satisfied myself that they are. If they are, then there is the second <Col N="790" /> question that arises.  Suppose you have communistic groups composed of people who are interested in this country and the unity of this country &mdash;people of Irish origin in one way or another&mdash;it is very hard to say of these people that they have not an interest in this country, apart from Communism. We have various sections who are interested in this country who hold various views on social, political and other questions, and it is very hard for me to say that any particular section of our people, no matter what views they have, may not be interested in this country, apart from the question of their views on politics or social or economic matters.</P>
      <P>There is a danger which I pointed out yesterday, and it is a serious danger, that any groups might try to use the Irish national question for ulterior motives.  That is a danger which everybody ought to be alive to. If I were a young man in England or a young man in America, interested in the unity of Ireland or in any Irish cause, I would be very careful not to allow my view in that regard to be exploited for some other purpose.  But I cannot give a definite warning and say: &ldquo;Do not join the Connolly Club. I have information that it is doing so-and-so.  I have information that, instead of being interested in serving the Irish cause, it is interested in serving Communism and that it is only using the Irish cause for that purpose.&rdquo; I cannot, you see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>All I want you to do is to warn them to look at it, to study it before they plunge in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is all, I would say that everybody should be alive to the possibility and the probability that outside causes will use any cause like ours for their own purpose, if it is convenient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Everybody&rdquo; includes the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is true&mdash; everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not it important for our people to be warned as to whether such associations are a hindrance or <Col N="791" /> not in the cause of the abolition of Partition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, there is a very difficult question there.  Suppose that in the United States there are groups with whose views we cannot agree at all, but who for some reason believe in and help to support the Irish unity movement, it is very hard for us to say that these people must not help.  I would have to be satisfied, very definitely satisfied, that they were injuring our cause and that they were using it for an ulterior purpose such as Deputy Dillon has suggested.  It is not easy for me to talk here responsibly and to say that such and such are people that should be shunned.  All I can say is that if there are Communists, either in this country, in Britain, America, or elsewhere who are trying to use the Irish cause for their own purpose, we should shun them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 2, 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>The temporary discontinuance of railway services is governed by the provisions of Emergency Powers (Córas Iompair Éireann) (Reduction of Railway Services) Order, 1944, as continued by the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the rail services on these branch <Col N="792" /> lines were discontinued on account of the shortage of fuel.  Recently restricted services were restored to Courtmacsherry for the carriage of sand, and between Skibbereen and Baltimore on one day a week for passengers. It has not been possible to restore any service between Skibbereen and Schull.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to issue any direction to Córas Iompair Éireann in relation to these services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that these branch lines were originally guaranteed by the ratepayers of the areas concerned, and that over a long number of years they bore the heavy impost of establishing and maintaining those lines?  Does he not think, now that there is a general improvement in the fuel situation and in the railway situation that these districts should have some consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the question of the former baronial guarantees matters at all.  All these guarantees were completely liquidated by the Transport Act of 1924.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are parts of the general railway system of the country. That system has not been operated fully because of fuel shortages.  The company must be left a discretion to use available fuel supplies to serve the public need in the best manner possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the trains return empty to Courtmacsherry from Clonakilty Junction after depositing the sand there?

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think these are matters on which representations should be made to the company.  The Deputy is asking if I will go and ask the company to do certain things.  I do not propose to ask the company.  I am informed that the vehicles which are used for the transportation of sea sand are of a special kind and are not suitable for the carriage of sundries or turf. If there are suggestions or proposals emerging out of local circumstances which the company should be asked to consider, I think that these suggestions or proposals should be sent to the company rather than that I should be asked with the very insufficient information at my disposal to give orders when I know nothing about them.</P>

Having regard to the fact that the Minister appointed the chairman of the company and that he is the one person in this House with responsibility to whom an approach can be made in this matter, may I ask him to say that this is not an unreasonable way to make the approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I inquire from the Minister for the information of such would-be employers, is the correct procedure this: To make contact with an individual alien, and on getting particulars can they ascertain from the Department what particulars the Department will require to know of the alien in order to consider the alien's application for a permit to enter?  I should also like to know, should the actual application for a permit to enter be made by the prospective employer or by the intending immigrant?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The matters to which the Deputy's supplementary question refers are mainly for the Department of Justice.  The admission of aliens to this country is supervised by the Department of Justice.  The application for a permit to enter must be made <Col N="796" /> by the prospective employer.  The employer must previously have obtained from the Department of Industry and Commerce a permit to employ an alien.  Having got that employment permit, he will then take up with the Department of Justice the question of the admission of the particular alien whom he wishes to employ. The Department of Justice will be concerned primarily with the suitability and personal character of the alien.</P>

      <P>In view of the simple but duplex procedure involved here, will the Minister consider having printed a leaflet either under his own Department or the Department of Justice which would be available to prospective employers with instructions as to what is the correct way of proceeding?  I imagine that a good many people will desire to proceed directly.  If they find a good deal of difficulty in doing what is necessary, it may, possibly, give rise to an awkward situation by bringing aliens to their doors and then finding that they had not done what was right.</P>

Bearing in mind the fact that the Six-County Government have already increased pensions by 50 per cent., does the Minister not consider that in this portion of the country some steps ought to be taken to relieve the plight of lowly-paid pensioners when the £ we were giving them in 1939 is now admitted to be worth no more than 10/-?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I also want to oppose the motion.  While I do not wish to travel over the ground already covered, I think it is worth underlining to-day the difference in the approach to the problem of the lowly-paid people and the approach to the problem of the relatively well-paid people.  I had three questions on the Order Paper to-day, in one of which I asked the <Col N="807" /> Minister for Local Government whether he was prepared to give favourable consideration to increasing the pensions of employees of local authorities, many of whom are to-day endeavouring to subsist on pensions as low as £1 per week.  The answer I got from the Minister was that the matter was under consideration.</P>
      <P>In a question addressed to the Minister for Finance I asked whether he was aware of the hardships endured by persons who retired from the service of the State with pensions as low as 20/-, 25/- and 30/- a week and, in some instances, even lower than 20/- a week, and I was told that the State cannot afford that Bill.  I addressed another question to the Minister for Defence asking whether the State proposed to make, in 1947, some better provision than it made in 1923 for the widows of men killed during Easter Week, 1916, or who subsequently died as a result of their participation in the Rebellion, and the Minister said that he did not propose to introduce legislation to increase the rates of pensions for such widows, notwithstanding the fact that I quoted here on an earlier stage of this Bill the case of one widow who lost her husband as a result of his participation in the 1916 Rebellion and who is now trying to maintain some standard of respectability on a sole income of £30 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to direct the Minister's attention to the notable difference in the approach by him to the problems of the Minister, the problems of the Parliamentary Secretary, the problems of the Deputy and the problems of the judiciary and his approach to the problems of the lowly-paid pensioners, people subsisting on shillings per week.  For those who get hundreds and thousands of pounds per annum, the Minister is prepared to grant increases of 30 per cent. but, when we come to the unfortunate people who have served the State for upwards of 40 years, who are subsisting on pensions as low as 25/- and 30/- a week, the Minister can find no money whatever to relieve their plight.  I recently interviewed a deputation of mental hospital attendants, many of whom <Col N="808" /> had given over 40 years' service, and who are living on pensions as low at 23/- and 24/- a week after 40 years' service and more in the employment of a local authority.  Is it possible that, in a Budget which imposes taxation to the extent of £50,000,000 per annum on our people it is not possible for the State to make some provision for people in such an unfortunate economic plight?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I concede that it is almost anomalous to discuss the plight of people living on pensions of £1 and 25/- a week in a House which can give them nothing, but which can give hundreds to those who have thousands per annum.  That is the anomaly I am pointing out to the Minister.  It seems to me that, while we have the problem of lowly paid pensioners and people subsisting on rates of income incapable of raising them above a mere subsistence level, the State is completely unjustified in introducing legislation of this kind to provide the increases for those who will benefit by this Bill and the associated Bills.  I do not want to travel over the whole ground again, because the matter has been covered in principle already in the Second Reading discussion, but I say that the Minister is in a very odd position&mdash; whether the oddness is obvious to him, I do not know&mdash;in asking the House to pass proposals for legislation giving a 30 per cent. increase to those with thousands per annum, while saying that he is unable to give even a small increase to those living on pensions of 25/- and 30/- a week after having served the State for 40 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>All I want to say to Deputy Norton is that I am not proposing to increase any of the pensions granted for service in the various posts with which this series of Bills deals. Deputy Norton could talk for quite a long time, and with his usual eloquence, upon the plight of certain <Col N="809" /> sections of the community.  He elects to-day to associate the plight of certain sections with the increases which I am proposing here for members of the Oireachtas.  The only reason I am making the proposal is to ensure that the Irish people will get their work done in an efficient manner.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton objected last week or the week before to the granting of 30 per cent. on the allowances to Deputies, but he did not object to a very much greater increase for higher civil servants and for district justices. He did not say, in their cases, that we must not give these increases until we did this, that and the other for all sections of pensioners.  He was wrong to say, too, in my recollection, that the widows of 1916 men got nothing since 1923.  Their pensions were very greatly increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Pensions awarded under the 1923 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>They were increased in one of the Acts passed when I was Minister for Defence in 1932 or 1933. I could not tell you which one of those Acts increased the pensions.  With regard to the other military service pensioners, those who got military service awards or ordinary service medals, are now guaranteed, under legislation passed here within the last few years, a certain income.  Before that the only award granted to them was based on their service.  They are being guaranteed a minimum income very much higher than the ordinary citizen is guaranteed under the various social services governing health, sickness benefits or destitution protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am prepared to admit that, if Deputy Norton wants to ring the changes on what Deputies will draw under this Bill as against an old age pensioner or somebody who is living in dire poverty, he can do it and make a very effective speech, but I would ask him to bring into that speech quotations from his own statements in relation to the district justices who were, under legislation passed through this House&mdash;I do not <Col N="810" /> know whether it is still going through the other House&mdash;granted £300 or £400 as against the £144 proposed for Deputies.  He did not say that the district justices or the higher civil servants or ordinary civil servants should not get increases until the old age pensioners and the lowly-paid people are given some consideration.</P>
    <P>We are all sensible enough to know that, if you go to any State in the world, you will find that the people who have to take responsibility in politics, in industry or in the professions, get a reward commensurate with the responsibilities which they undertake.  One State started off in our time with the idea that all people should be paid equally.  After trying to work that system, their experience proved that there must be greater inequality between the people who accepted responsibility and those who worked at the bench or on the plot. There is now a greater difference there than in the fabulously wealthy State of America, where we always hear that the capitalist has such a huge income.</P>
    <P>Compare the State I refer to when you take the man at the bottom, the man who is doing the actual physical work and the person who does the directing and takes responsibility. There is a greater difference in that country than there is in the United States and, of course, many more times a greater difference than there is in our community.</P>
    <P>I do not think we will get the development that is necessary to increase the general standard of our people's lives by keeping Deputies in the position that they are unable to carry out the most important work that any set of men in this country could be engaged at.  It would be unwise to prevent them carrying out that work efficiently. Everyone knows that the Dáil approved a certain level of allowances for Deputies in 1938.  Deputy Norton, on other occasions, would say that that level of allowances has been cut in half by the upward movement of prices.  I am proposing to add 30 per cent. to the 1938 level for the sole purpose of enabling Deputies to carry out their duties by their constituencies and their duties by the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="811" /> I hope Deputy Norton will content himself with having made this type of speech a couple of times.  I do not think it does any good to raise that type of issue so often as he has done. I could answer him, if I wanted to make a long speech, by quoting his statements showing that in his approach to this matter he is very inconsistent indeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made two points which require to be cleared up. He said the Army Pensions Act improved the position of a widow who got a pension following the death of her husband because of his association with Easter Week, 1916.  That is not so. The Minister, if he looks up the Act, will find that his information is not correct.  These were granted under Section 8 of the 1923 Act.  Section 4 of the 1927 Act doubles the pensions of the widows of men killed in 1916, if they signed the proclamation of 1916, and only then.  The Army Pensions Act of 1927 brought in the children of such persons.  But the original amount granted in 1923 to widows of men who did not sign the proclamation still stands in 1947.  The Minister wants to make some play with my advocacy on behalf of civil servants and their rights to get certain increases.  Obviously he wants to bring in discussions which took place elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister was discussing the civil servants, the main case against him was that in 1940 he abrogated a solemn agreement which had existed for 20 years and he did that at a time when, having extracted all the benefits of the agreement, he wanted to say to the civil servants: &ldquo;Now, as the tide is likely to turn in your favour, and you may get some compensation for the rise in prices, I will prevent you getting it by abrogating the agreement.&rdquo;  I pointed out to the Minister that he had interfered with a solemn agreement under which civil servants up to this were morally and legally bound, that he had exacted every pound of flesh he could get and took some of the bone away as well, and that in fact he was now being asked, since the emergency was over and since he had lifted wage controls in respect of all classes of workers, to do the same in respect of civil servants. The Minister knows I was concerned with lowly paid civil servants, not highly paid civil servants.  In that respect, all the Minister was asked to do was to restore the agreement because the circumstances on which he had relied for its abrogation had ceased to exist.  Is there any inconsistency in that?  I know the Minister did concede some increase but he knows well he did not concede all that he knew was legally and morally due.  My advocacy on that occasion was of the same type as I am making now.  I argued the claims of the lowly-paid people and I am doing the same now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the amount voted for this particular section of his Department each year&mdash;and it is a very valuable section&mdash;is insufficient. It has been brought to my notice that along the east coast of Mayo, with Lecanvey and Louisburgh as centres, a vast and valuable harvest is lost each year for want of sufficient boats and tackle with which to take in the fish. I have been told the fish are so plentiful at times along the west coast that they can actually be scooped with baskets out of the water from a shallow shore.</P>
      <P>In one or two instances the Department of Fisheries has helped fishermen to purchase boats and gear.  The amount involved has been repaid very easily and within a very short time. In one case a man was assisted to purchase a boat to the extent of £600.  The boat needed repairs.  Because of the emergency, a perfectly sound boat, with a good engine, could not be provided by the Department and this boat, which cost £600, needed repairs amounting to an additional £300.  I shall give the Minister an idea of the harvest that can be reaped along the western coast when I tell him that inside two years the £600, plus the £300 for repairs, were repaid to the Department and the fisherman and his family had a reasonable profit over and above.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because there are not enough boats and there is a lack of suitable tackle, expert fishermen who know the whole coast from Slyne Head, in Galway, to Killala are leaving the country.  The very pick of our fishermen are going away.  Last year 11 men, who have expert knowledge of the coast, went to England, and I consider that is a deplorable state of affairs.  The fish, <Col N="825" /> which are in abundance there, are left ungathered or left to the mercy of foreign trawlers, which occasionally make poaching raids, and meanwhile our expert fishermen are leaving the country.  A good fisherman is an expert just the same as a man in a machine shop or in a trade.  A fisherman cannot learn all that is to be known about fishing in a short space of time.  He has to be a keen judge of the weather, a good sailor, and he must know about the vagaries of the fish and shoals and the handling of gear. He requires an iron constitution to stand up to that particular life, but it is a good life and it gives a good dividend if the fishermen are properly equipped.</P>
    <P>The Minister should devote more money to this section of the Department. I have not any idea whether boats and engines are available but, now that the emergency is over, suitable boats should be available, even though the price may be high.  The Department should do everything possible to develop the sea-fishing industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that the Minister, in taking over responsibility for the fishing industry, is faced with a very big task.  There is no doubt the industry is declining.  It must be admitted that the prosperity in the industry during the past seven years was largely due to war conditions. Since the termination of hostilities, fishermen find it more difficult to market their fish.  That is due to the fact that English fishermen are in a better position to supply the needs of their own markets.  The people of this country consume only a fraction of the fish landed here and it is obvious that if the industry is to be prosperous we must find outside markets for our surplus fish or else we must be in a position to preserve or cure our surplus fish so that they can be used in a period of scarcity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present we find there is no difficulty in getting a market for our prime fish, but the quantities of prime fish will tend to decrease rather than to increase.  This state of affairs is due to the fact that the fishing grounds will be destroyed by over-fishing, both <Col N="826" /> within and without our territorial waters.  Our great problem will be to find a market for the huge quantities of mackerel and herrings landed at certain times of the year.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I asked a question for the purpose of ascertaining if the Fisheries Department were considering any plans to help the industry on the mackerel and herring side.  I was very disappointed to find that no such plans are being considered.  It is very discouraging to the inshore fishermen and the people who depend on the industry. It is disappointing to people who invest large sums in boats and gear.  There is no doubt that without some assistance the industry cannot carry on.  So far as I can see, the industry will have a very difficult future and I can state definitely that the mackerel and herring trade cannot be continued without Government assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What should we do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall tell the Deputy. The point is that the fishermen are already losing confidence and they find it is becoming more difficult to earn a livelihood.  They are selling their boats.  In the locality from which I come, I find that a number of men who were engaged in the mackerel trade for a considerable time are offering their boats for sale.  I assure the Minister if he is anxious to help the industry, that he must do so immediately; otherwise it will be too late.  I am sure the Fishery Department is not satisfied with the present position and that the officials will admit that the industry has not made the progress which it was hoped it would.  I must admit that since this State was established the industry has not got the attention from any Government that it should have got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit of course that the present Government since it took office has done a lot for the fisheries.  I remember that in 1932 things were in a very depressed state but the Government encouraged the fishermen to continue the trade.  They gave boats and gear on the instalment system.  Were it not for that assistance, I think very few fishermen would have been in a position to avail of the past seven prosperous <Col N="827" /> years in the industry.  The position now, in my opinion, is that we are coming to the end of that prosperity.</P>
    <P>The question must be asked: is the industry worth assisting?  Those of us who come from fishing localities know very well that a large number of our people depend on the trade.  We know quite well that many of our small farmers along the coast could not live on their small holdings were it not for the money they earn at fishing at certain times of the year.  We realise of course that the industry must get assistance, and, considering the importance of the industry, we often ask ourselves why a serious effort is not made to help the trade.  The Department appear to think that the activities of the Sea Fisheries Association are sufficient to help the trade but I assure the Minister that that is not so.  The Sea Fisheries Association has undoubtedly done good work for the fish trade.  It has given boats and gear.  It made an attempt to find a market for prime fish but beyond these contributions, it has been of very little assistance to the trade.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind as I have said already, that we have come to the end of the prosperous period and I think that if the Sea Fisheries Association is to help the trade, it will have to consider plans by which the trade can be helped in a general way.  At the present time I am afraid the directors of the Sea Fisheries Association consider only plans which will help the association.  If the directors concentrated more on introducing measures by which the problems of the industry could be solved I think it would be far better for the trade.  For instance, if they made a serious effort to develop the home market, if they considered methods by which our present system of curing mackerel and herring could be improved, if they considered the question of quick freezing of fish and if they made some effort to procure foreign markets, they would be making a serious attempt to help the trade. So far as I can see, the Sea Fisheries Association has not made much attempt to solve these problems.</P>
    <P>Recently at the annual meeting of the Sea Fisheries Association, the <Col N="828" /> chairman made what I consider a very extraordinary speech.  In that speech he stated that it was intended to import fish into this country.  Considering the fact that we are an island with a huge coastline, it appears extraordinary to me that the Sea Fisheries Association should consider it necessary to import fish, having regard to the fact that at certain times of the year large quantities of fish are landed on our coasts for which we find it very difficult to procure a market. I think if the Association were to consider the question of quick freezing, which British scientists consider a success, we would be able to preserve the surplus quantity of fish available at certain times of the year for use in periods of scarcity.</P>
    <P>Again the chairman says that it is intended to import this fish from England on a quota basis.  That is a very dangerous line for the association to adopt because members of the association must remember that if we are to import fish from England on a quota basis, there is a danger that the English Government might adopt a similar procedure in regard to our fish.  If fish is allowed into England only on a quota basis, it would be impossible for us to find a market for our surplus mackerel. The chairman stated also that it was intended to give the Sea Fisheries Association alone the right of importing this fish.  I regard that as a wrong thing to do.  I think that the merchants who were engaged in the fish trade long before the association was formed should get an opportunity to import fish if necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has asked me how I think the fish trade could be assisted. I assure the Minister that one of the most important ways in which the fish trade could be assisted is by giving us a faster and cheaper train service.  That is the whole secret of success in the fish trade.  We want a cheaper and a faster train service.  I remember up to the second year of the war we had a reasonable service from the railway company.  Our fish could arrive at the market within a reasonable time.  Now we find, with the service now provided, it takes our fish 24 hours longer to reach the English market than it did with the service given up to the second <Col N="829" /> year of the war.  It is absolutely essential that our fish should arrive in the English market in good condition. Recently I was over in England and I visited a number of markets.  I was amazed to find that fish from Norway could arrive in far better condition at these markets than our fish could.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Was that at Billingsgate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>This was due to the fact that they had a better system of transport. If we sell our fish in England in competition with foreign fish, our fish must arrive there with the least possible delay.</P>
      <P>There is another matter in connection with the transport system which in my opinion is going to kill the mackerel trade in South-west Kerry and I am sure the same remark applies to the west coast of Ireland generally.  The increase in freights by the railway company has brought about a crisis in the mackerel trade.  Up to recently small boxes of mackerel were accepted by the railway company at one quarter, 16 pounds.  That is they were charging only for the fish and the box and they were making an allowance for the ice.  Now they have insisted on charging freight on the actual weight, that is, charging for the weight of the ice. We know that during periods of warm weather after a short time, no ice exists in the box so that we now find that we are compelled to pay for a weight which does not exist after a short time.  That in my opinion is unjust to the trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an indirect way of robbing the fishermen of their money because in all these cases it is the fisherman pays for it.  Along with that they have increased freights by 20 per cent. and these increases mean that it costs 2/-extra per box from Valentia Harbour to Billingsgate, which means that the fishermen will receive 6/- per long 100 for their fish.  We have got to consider that the maximum price which the fish buyers can get in the English market is 4/7 per stone.  Taking that figure into account the highest price which the fish buyers could pay the fishermen for their fish was about 16/- a cwt.  The increase in freight would reduce the price to 10/-.  Last week the merchants were informed that the ice company is <Col N="830" /> increasing the cost of ice by 15/- per ton which will probably have the effect of bringing down the price by another 1/-.  All the fishermen receive for fish is about 9/- per cwt. which is uneconomic. The cost of running a boat is expensive, the cost of nets is very high, and unless the present Government does something in a big way to help the fishermen in connection with the increase in freight I cannot see any chance of the fishermen making a living out of the industry.  I assure the Minister that I am not exaggerating this matter.  I come from a fishing locality and I have a fair idea of the fishing industry.  I am satisfied from my conversations with fishermen that they cannot carry on at the present price owing to the increase in the freight price.  It may be asked what the Government can do about the matter.  I referred to this question during the recent debate on Industry and Commerce. I pointed out then to the Minister that I did not agree with subsidies. However, in a case of this kind where the price is fixed in England by the British Government no amount of talk here will have any effect because they will not increase the price. Expenses and freights in this country make it impossible to carry on with the price to be obtained in English markets and the Government has no other course to adopt than to come to the assistance of the marketing trade. There is only one other solution if the Government do not wish to subsidise the trade and that is, to adopt some system similar to that adopted by the Herring Board in England in connection with a minimum price for fish.  I consider that the Government must do either of these things because the fishermen cannot carry on at the price which the merchants now pay them owing to the increase in freights.  If the railway company is not reasonable in the matter and does not accept the boxes of fish instead of charging the freight&mdash;there is a difference between it and a sack of flour, for instance, because in a short time the ice melts and therefore the weight is no longer in the box&mdash;I would strongly impress upon the Minister that he should take up the matter and try to get the railway company to see reason or else to <Col N="831" /> subsidise the freights.  Otherwise the fishermen in South Kerry and West Kerry and along the west coast will not be able to carry on.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to another matter about which we in Kerry have heard a lot of rumours, that is, the reopening of the Dingle branch line.  I consider that the reopening of that line is absolutely essential to the fishing industry in the Dingle Peninsula.  One must remember that landings of fish are very irregular.  One cannot foretell when there will be heavy quantities and when there will be light quantities of fish.  As a result it would be practically impossible for the railway company to give a proper boat service.  For weeks there might be no fish.  The question, therefore, arises as to whether the railway company would be prepared to keep a number of lorries lying idle until the fish reach the shores.  Everyone will agree that it would be too much to expect the railway company to keep too many lorries idle and yet, on the other hand, when there would be heavy landings of fish no lorries would be available.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to another matter which is very common in the Dingle Peninsula.  Sometimes perhaps 4,000 or 5,000 boxes a day are landed and it would take at least 20 to 25 lorries to remove that fish from the Dingle area into Tralee.  In such a situation I think it could be safely said that the railway company could not procure the necessary lorries at such short notice.  Again I assure the Minister that it is absolutely essential for the fishing industry in the Dingle Peninsula that the branch line be reopened.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the bad landing facilities at some of our chief ports.  I have constantly referred to the case of Valentia Harbour.  We have, I think, between 40 and 50 boats fishing out of that harbour, but the landing facilities can be described as nothing but primitive. There is only a small slipway and the boats cannot get near it.  Despite the fact that the people have been agitating for years to have this pier improved nothing has been done about it.  During the winter we frequently find that a number of boats are swept from their <Col N="832" /> mooring at Valentia Island and several have been destroyed.  It is absolutely essential that a proper boat shelter be constructed at Valentia Island.  That state of affairs has existed for many years.  I remember that after the 1914-1918 War the British Government were considering plans to erect a new pier at Valentia Harbour.  Since the establishment of this State there has been constant agitation for an improvement in the present slip.  As far as I can see everyone in this House will be dead and buried before anything is done about the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that it is intended to set up a deep sea trawling company in this country in the near future.  In my opinion, it is essential that we should have a number of deep sea trawlers for the purpose of supplying the home market, because at certain times of the year we find that our small trawlers cannot go to sea and, consequently, we have a scarcity of fish in the country.  The question of where we are going to get the crews to man these ships may be asked.  At the present time our fishermen are not familiar with the work of deep sea trawlers and if this fleet is to be set up it would be very advisable for the Minister to have a number of our fishermen trained&mdash;especially in English trawlers&mdash;so that when we could have these boats we would have the crews to man them.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that this Government has at last decided to make a serious effort to prevent poaching within our territorial waters.  I consider that not alone should we have boats to protect our coasts but that, at the same time, every effort should be made to extend the limits of our territorial waters.  The three-mile limit is not sufficient.  Other countries, such as Norway, are not satisfied with the three-mile limit.  In order to prevent more poaching within our territorial waters it is absolutely essential that the three-mile limit be extended.  The people along the coast are very grateful to the Government for purchasing the corvettes for the protection of our territorial waters.  It is considered that this money is well spent.  However, I should like to point out to the Minister that it is considered that the <Col N="833" /> speed of these corvettes is too slow.</P>
    <P>I have made inquiries and find that these corvettes can do only about 15 knots, while the up-to-date trawlers can do 18, and we have known cases in which British trawlers have been able to escape from the corvettes when those trawlers were found fishing in our territorial waters.</P>
    <P>There is at present a limited demand in the American market for cured mackerel, but the fishermen cannot procure barrels.  I would like to know if the Department has made an effort to procure barrels.  I know that a few companies in this country are considering selling barrels, but they are asking very high prices.  The Minister should go into the question of costs with them and see that they charge only a reasonable price.  The merchants would not object to a reasonable price. It is very unfair of those companies to charge a very high price as they have more or less a monopoly.  I know there are wealthy companies contemplating setting up canning factories for fish.  I am very glad to see money invested in such a venture and think those companies should get every assistance from the Department, as it is the first time people have been prepared to invest large sums of money in the processing and canning of fish.</P>
    <P>The mackerel industry was a failure on the Kerry coast last year and, as a result, the fishermen find it very difficult to pay for nets and other gear.  I would ask the Minister to consider steps by which fishermen who lost nets would be able to purchase new ones at a cheap rate.  I know the Sea Fisheries Association has a system by which nets are given and may be paid for in instalments, but in some cases they are asking the applicant to pay a deposit of at least 50 per cent.  Very few in the mackerel trade have much money, as they had a bad year last year, and I would ask the Minister to see that these applicants get the nets on the instalment system on a nominal first payment.</P>
    <P>There was a very poor demand in the English market last year for certain kinds of shell-fish, particularly mussels, as the type of mussels we <Col N="834" /> were exporting was of an inferior quality to the foreign mussels offered for sale in the English markets.  I am afraid the Sea Fisheries Association are neglecting the planting of mussels at Cromane, and as a result we find the purified mussels exported from Cromane are of inferior quality.  The Minister should see that the Association restocks those beds immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can discover, one of the great difficulties fishermen experience is that their trade depends on a fluctuating demand. When fish is plentiful, it drops a little in price and people buy it, but when it is scarce the price rises rapidly and people refuse to buy, or purchase only in very limited quantities.  The only solution I can see to the problem is to popularise the eating of fish here.  We are one of the smallest fish-eating countries in the world and, when we have available readily to us an opportunity to land fish here, the fishermen are not in a position to avail fully of that opportunity.</P>
      <P>If we want to ensure a steady demand, we must make sure the public get the fish at a reasonable price.  They are obliged to pay too dearly, while at the other end of the scale, the fisherman is not paid a remunerative price. There is too big a gap between what the fishermen receives, having undertaken all the risk and labour, and what the consumer is obliged to pay.</P>
      <P>In places like Kerry and parts of the country far away from large cities, the cost of transport inevitably is reflected in the price of fish, but that does not affect to the same degree the catch made by fishermen on the east coast.  At the same time, for some unexplained reason, some of these east coast people find that, when they catch fish in large quantities, the demand is insufficient to clear the catch and consequently many of them are obliged to work only on occasional days during the seasons in which catches are plentiful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and the Sea Fisheries Association must consider seriously the possibility of quick freezing.  I see that portion of the sum of £4,700 increase over last year is to be devoted to experimentation <Col N="835" /> in quick freezing.  If we had quick-freezing plant available at certain centres, it would be possible, when there is a glut of fish, to freeze the surplus and keep it for times of scarcity.</P>
    <P>This past season has been one of the most difficult fishermen ever experienced, as the severe weather in the winter and early spring damaged or destroyed, not merely gear but boats, and many fishermen were obliged either to undertake financial commitments or go out of business.  I have experience of a number of people on the east coast, from Dún Laoghaire to Balbriggan, including the small harbours in between, who suffered seriously as a result of the weather.  I do not know how it is expected that those who have lost boats and gear could get back into a position in which they could continue on their former lines.  Many of them are fishermen who own a maximum of two or three boats and the majority have only one boat.  They work with members of their families and, possibly, with the addition of one or two men.  They are people of very limited means and they could not be expected, at present prices, to get back into production on anything like their former scale, in view of the loss they have suffered.  The Minister and the association will have to approach this question in a far more lenient manner than they did in the past.  The difficulty is not merely the cost but the shortage of gear and equipment.</P>
    <P>We should avail now of the opportunities we have to increase the market for fish and increase the potentialities of that market&mdash;and the only way I see by which we can do it is to provide facilities such as quick freezing and also quick transport from far-away parts of the country to the big cities and larger towns.  Unless the fish is brought quickly and at a cheap rate from the port of landing to the big towns&mdash;or, for that matter, to the rural areas&mdash;there is no hope for any increase in the home market.  The present price of meat would, in the ordinary way, influence people in increasing their consumption of fish.  When meat <Col N="836" /> is cheap, people tend to eat more meat, but with the present high price of meat they are limiting their consumption of meat.  If they limit their consumption of meat and if we cannot reduce the price of fish, it is unlikely that we will increase home consumption of fish.</P>
    <P>There are two other difficulties that fishermen on the east coast have.  One is that a number of small harbours are in a bad condition.  Under the Harbours Act the larger harbours are provided for.  Most of the small harbours are not provided for in that Act and the weather, that has so adversely affected gear and boats, has also affected harbours and unless grants are made available for the building of protective walls and the repair of existing landing places and quays, I cannot see how these harbours can continue to be used.  All the harbours along the east coast&mdash;Balbriggan, Loughshinny, Skerries, Howth, are now suffering as a result of previous neglect.  Their usefulness is seriously impaired because of neglect over a number of years and the very heavy weather in the late winter and spring.  In fact, only portions of some of the harbours can be used.  I would suggest to the Minister that increased attention must be paid by the Sea Fisheries Association or directly by the Department to the harbours that are not covered by the Harbours Act.</P>
    <P>The other difficulty that fishermen on the east coast have is the extent to which poaching by foreign trawlers is carried on.  Even in Dún Laoghaire, which is a large harbour, foreign trawlers come into the coast.  I do not know whether there is much in the point that Deputy Healy made about the corvettes not being fast enough to catch the trawlers but the fact is that the corvettes are very rarely there when the trawlers are there.  The system whereby responsibility for coast protection has been transferred to the Department of Defence has not so far improved the protection given.  Generally, the procedure adopted when a foreign trawler is sighted is that the guards ring up the nearest military post or the nearest port at which a corvette is stationed and inform them that there is a trawler within our territorial <Col N="837" /> waters.  That system is totally inadequate. By the time the Guards have phoned and the corvette gets out, the trawler has gone.  The amount of protection given on the east coast is negligible and poaching by foreign trawlers has, from time to time, completely wiped out any possibility of the local fishermen getting a catch.  It even happens in a prominent place where they are in full view.  It is not merely off the smaller harbours.  They have even come into the bay of Dún Laoghaire.  I suggest that that is a matter which must be given more attention and immediate attention if fishing is to be protected.</P>
    <P>I notice from the Minister's speech that negotiations have been going on concerning the exclusive limits of our territorial waters.  The sooner that these negotiations are concluded the better but, pending their conclusion, we ought to ensure that our territorial waters are protected for our fishermen. The corvettes and the facilities provided by the Department of Defence at the moment are inadequate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>During my 24 years' membership of this House, no subject has been discussed so consistently along the same lines as this particular subject of the fisheries industry.  It is most regrettable that after that long period of years there should be the same complaints and criticisms.  The one gleam of hope in recent years was the prosperity in the fishing industry during the emergency period.  I would like the Minister to give the House some assurance that that prosperity is not to be followed by a slump, such as occurred in the industry in former years in post-war periods.  I agree that the question of transport enters into this matter.  I want to say, particularly on behalf of the people in the fishing centres in West Cork, Schull, Baltimore, Courtmacsherry, and even the smaller places, where the industry has been of prime importance in providing employment, good wages and in promoting the general good of the district, that they are anxious about this matter.  The present indications of a possible closing down or non-resumption of rail services in those areas for a considerable time to <Col N="838" /> come will have very serious reactions. There has been a good deal of talk about the need for establishing industries in various towns and other places.  I know of no industry which, if it were reasonably prosperous, would give such quick results as this industry would give or such continuous and well-paid employment.  In that connection, it is a tragedy that the specialists in this industry, the ordinary fishermen, extremely skilled and proficient in their work, should have gone in considerable numbers out of the country and that a number are seeking facilities to follow them.</P>
      <P>Great advantage would flow from the development of inland trade in fish.  It is a fact that in the inland towns in County Cork the supply of fish is irregular and inadequate and that there is a scramble to get whatever fish is available.  Generally, a taste for fish requires to be cultivated amongst our people.  Interest should be stimulated in fish as a food.  I suggest that the opportunities for the development of the fish trade are not being pushed to the extent that is possible.</P>
      <P>I live about 15 miles from the sea. The supply of fish to the town of Dunmanway is an event in the house-keeper's week.  On some Fridays there is a certain amount of fish available, good fish on some occasions and on others a small and inadequate supply. The parts of the town nearest to the place of arrival of fish get a certain amount and the people in the other parts of the town do not even know that fish has arrived.  That is all wrong. When I think of the extensive County of Cork, with its large number of inland towns, I realise that, apart altogether from the possibilities of markets abroad, the development of the home market is one of the most important aspects of this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister what are the immediate prospects in connection with the experiments in deep sea fishing that have been under consideration for some time and in which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I and other Deputies from West Cork are interested.  It was suggested that Kinsale Harbour should be utilised for <Col N="839" /> the purpose.  I should like to hear more of what has been done about this matter.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister inform us what is the present position regarding the representations that have been made in connection with the provision of a slip at Old Head of Kinsale?  The Minister's advisers who are extremely courteous and helpful in such matters, and particularly so in those constituencies where we have fishing areas, will be able to tell him the story underlying that demand.  Due to extraordinary weather conditions and storms in the past the pier at the Old Head of Kinsale was completely swept away.  The proposal is that, in the interval until the pier is restored in the manner required, a slip should be provided there to facilitate those who are engaged in the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>There is not much more that I have to say except to emphasise the points that have already been made.  May I ask that the other marine works which have already been the subject of consideration by the Department of Fisheries and of consultation between that Department and the Board of Works and its Employment Schemes Branch should be pushed forward as rapidly as possible.  I feel that the people of the country would like to know that the Minister has confidence in the fishing industry.  I trust he will be able to give the House an indication of a policy calculated to obviate a slump in that industry such as occurred on previous occasions.  I refer particularly to the slump that followed the first world war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I trust that a slump such as that will be avoided on this occasion.  The Minister, I think, is in a better position to meet a situation of that sort than were his predecessors to deal with the slump that occurred in 1918. That slump left a heavy legacy of financial difficulty both for the Department and the fishermen because of their inability to meet commitments which they had entered into during the peak point of prosperity while the war <Col N="840" /> was on.  When that slump occurred, the fishermen found that there was no fishing industry for them, and their boats were left derelict.  They had to default in the repayment of the loans due to the Department simply because there was no other way out for a number of them.  The Department over a long number of years had an extremely hard and painful task in connection with that matter.  It is hoped that such a position will not arise again.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now starting off fortified by the prosperity which the industry has enjoyed in the last few years, and with advantages that his predecessors at the time I have referred to did not enjoy.  I hope that he will be able to give some indication of the fact that the opportunities which are available to him will be capitalised to the fullest extent: that on his advent to office as Minister for Fisheries he will be able to give an indication to the fisherman and to the people of the country that he has confidence in the industry and of his hopes for the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to what I regard as a very important point when he said that the increase in the price of meat is bound to have a very favourable effect on the sale and consumption of whatever fish is available.  I feel sure that situation has been examined.  It is one in which there should be great scope for development in the immediate future.  I suggest to the Minister that in those areas which are closely associated with the fishing industry facilities should be provided for sending fish inland.  We know that in the last few years it was difficult to do that.  We had a number of people who were willing to undertake the transport of fish.  A number of them converted old cars into small serviceable lorries for the purpose of sending fish inland over distances of 30 and 40 miles.  They applied time and time again for an extra petrol allowance but met with the inevitable negative reply.  At present there is not the same difficulty in getting petrol and oil.  I think the Sea Fisheries Association could render a great service by selecting reliable people who would be prepared to <Col N="841" /> undertake that work.  The transport of fish to inland centres is a matter of very great importance.  I believe that if people could get the fish brought to their doors they would welcome such an effort and would be prepared to pay a reasonable price for it.  I think every effort should be made to arrange for the transport of fish to inland centres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious, from some of the speeches made, that people interested in the fishing industry expect that a slump will follow the prosperity which the industry enjoyed during the war, a slump such as that which occurred after the first world war. People seem to anticipate that the British trawlers will be back again, and that you will have much the same situation as that which arose then.  To meet that situation appeals are being made to the Minister to organise the industry on some new basis.  I think there is not much use in trying to rationalise the marketing of fish here unless something is done about the catching of the fish.  It seems to me that we have looked upon the fishing industry as a sort of semi-social service, one that is well able to stand on its feet in times of international stress, but that, when peace returns, is a sort of cinderella industry.  Now that we have a naval service, I think the Minister should consider utilising it in an effort at rationalising the catching of the fish.  I do not know exactly how that can be done.  Perhaps something might be done on the lines of the Army Construction Corps.  The idea would be to charter trawlers in countries where they can be got, with expert instructors, and then recruit your personnel in those towns where you would be likely to get young men interested in the sea.  They could be instructed in deep-sea trawling.  It might be possible to incorporate them in the naval service, where they would be taught a useful vocation.  After their discharge from that service, it is possible that they would be able to find employment with boat owners or perhaps they might, in conjunction with their fellows, embark on deep-sea trawling on their own.  I think that, if a serious effort is to be made to put the fishing <Col N="842" /> industry on a successful footing, an organisation such as the naval service must be worked into it.  I do not see any reason why the cost of a scheme such as I have suggested should not, in the initial stages, become a charge on the Department of Defence.  We have built up a considerable inshore fishing industry, but it is one that is very much subject to the vagaries of the weather, so that when the fishing cannot be carried on it is not able to give us the supplies that we cannot get from any other source.  I think if we had this other organisation working in conjunction with and dove-tailing into the inshore industry, we could practically guarantee a continuous supply of fish of all kinds.</P>
      <P>At the present time I think there is only one place in which you can get prime fish in anything like continuous supply, and that is here in Dublin.  In Galway we only get what the fishermen cannot find a market for in Dublin. Usually we cannot get anything other than whiting and, possibly, the commoner sorts of shoal fish.  I do not think that should be so.  It was common enough pre-war to see fish from Grimsby coming into Galway and Galway fish coming to Dublin and the trains carrying the fish passing probably at Athlone.  If you are to popularise the use of fish you must guarantee a supply and you must try to guarantee a supply in variety.  There is no use in giving the prime fish all to Dublin and possibly to Cork, exporting what you do not sell there, and leaving the rural parts of the country to use the commoner sorts.  I do not think you will build up a nation-wide market on these lines.  Therefore, I think that the object ought to be to supply our rural places with the prime sorts as well as the cities.  But, again, continuity of supply is very essential to success in any attempt of that sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point I want to put before the Minister is that it is obvious, from speeches which have been made and views expressed elsewhere, that we have to face a period of slump in the industry.  If that is so, I should like to repeat that this question of roping in our naval service to this industry ought to be seriously considered by the <Col N="843" /> Government.  I think it ought not to be looked upon as an ordinary effort by the industry, during the initial stages at all events, and that the Department of Defence ought to be asked to bear that part of the cost.  We have, as I pointed out, the double advantage of guaranteeing a supply and training men in a very useful industry.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to explain one or two things to which he made reference in his opening speech. He said that it was proposed to take over the estuarian fisheries and to abolish netting in fresh water.  Does that apply to all the several fisheries in the country?  Does the taking over of the estuarian fisheries mean that the men who have been making a livelihood from salmon fishing in these estuaries are to be deprived of the right to fish in them in future?</P>
    <P>Another point is the reference to the scarcity of cordage for nets, etc.  Has the Department considered the utilisation of flax as a substitute for cotton for this purpose?  We are now producing flax here and, if we cannot get a satisfactory or sufficient supply of the ordinary cordage used for this purpose in exchange for the sale of our flax in England, will the Minister consider the possibility of utilising some of the flax and having it manufactured here?  I understand there are people in Dublin who can manufacture cordage from flax and make quite a good article.  That has been one of the big difficulties that the industry had to contend with during the war and it hit not only the man in the power-boat but the man who fished from a rowing boat.  In fact there was a leaning towards the man who had the bigger boat in the distribution of whatever nets were available.</P>

      <P>I detect a note of unrealism whenever this Vote is discussed. Deputy Healy is a man for whose specialised knowledge in this business I have great respect.  I listened very closely to what he said, but it seemed to me that every second statement he made contradicted the statement that went before.  He warned us not to put a quota on imports of fish lest Great Britain should retaliate.  He <Col N="844" /> seemed to say in the next sentence that we ought to prohibit imports of fish. If we are going to vex Great Britain by putting a quota on, will it not vex her twice as much by prohibiting altogether?  What will we do suppose she prohibits our exports of fish?  I seemed to hear him say that his experience of the fish trade had led him to the view that a subsidy was no remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I did not believe in subsidies but, if necessary, they must be sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the next breath he said that in the situation in which we find ourselves now we ought to have a subsidy.  He says he does not think it reasonable to expect the railway company catering for the Dingle peninsula to keep an indeterminate number of lorries available to deal with the occasional gluts of fish which would be landed; but he does think it reasonable that they should leave the railway open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the railway will be there when the fish are there, but the lorries will not be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is more expensive to keep a railway line down to Dingle than to keep 20 or 30 or 40 lorries available in Tralee to be called to the Dingle Peninsula if an exceptional quantity of fish has been landed on a particular day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>The wagons will always be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And the rails.  But it is much more expensive to maintain a railway to the Dingle Peninsula than to maintain a fleet of lorries in Tralee, which can be used from time to time while they are waiting, but which can be mobilised rapidly if a large quantity of fish is landed and is being packed for the British market.  While the landing and packing are proceeding the company can be notified and the lorries can be called in for the dispatch of the fish to England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much as I respect Deputy Healy's judgment in this matter, he is not the only man who knows anything about the fishing industry.  I represented Donegal for a long time and I know a <Col N="845" /> good deal about it.  But I will give him, for his edification, the opinion of experts who take the view that in modern conditions motor transport is superior to rail transport, more flexible, more rapid, and capable of going from the port of landing to the port of shipment without any switching or transferring or delay.</P>
    <P>I refer the Deputy to the observations of Messrs.  Snowden Limited of Fish Quay, North Shields, when applying before the licensing authority at Newcastle for permission to double their fleet of lorries for the transport of fish, when several representatives of the fishing industry alleged that the rail facilities for fish transport were quite inadequate&mdash;and they were not talking of the Dingle Peninsula Railway but of the London North Eastern Railway&mdash; and the objection the railway company put up was, not that they were giving a better service than lorries could give, but that if lorries were provided, the fish merchants, by purchasing lorries of their own, might keep for themselves an undue proportion of the subsidies provided by the British Government to faciliate fishing.  That difficulty does not arise here, and I cannot see why, if the railway company is not giving a satisfactory transport service to the fish industry at any port in the country, either by way of insufficient wagon facilities or excessive charges, the fish merchants, who are, after all, the sale-masters for the fishermen, will not buy lorries of their own and shift the fish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But, if you could use them, why not?  Deputies representing these areas complain that fishing is being treated as a social service.  They want this House to make the railway company do one thing, the road authority do another and Billingsgate do something else for the trade.  I think that those in the fishing industry could do a great deal to help themselves and if they do not find it possible to provide road transport for their <Col N="846" /> own trade, I should like them to elaborate the theory that if Córas Iompair Éireann undertakes to provide road transport for all the fish landed at Valentia or any other centre and to take it by road direct from the quay where it is packed to the port of embarkation for England, what complaint the fish trade have to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the use of talking when they will not do it?  They have never given a proper service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My information from the Department of Industry and Commerce is that if at any time I go to the Department and produce to them a statement from any local merchant that transport facilities are not forthcoming from Córas Iompair Éireann adequate to do the special job which has to be done in that area, the Department will call on Córas Iompair Éireann to do it, and, if they do not, will provide merchandise licences for as many persons who choose to purchase lorries in that area as may be required to do the job efficiently which Córas Iompair Éireann failed to do.  I do not see why those of us who are concerned with the fishing industry should not exert ourselves to see that the requisite transport is supplied, in Valentia, Gweedore, or anywhere it is required, to facilitate the transport of fish in good condition to the British market.</P>
      <P>I want to come now to the question of deep sea trawlers.  What sense does it make to any rational person to say that we are now at the opening of a great slump in the fishing business? I think that was Deputy Healy's view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the marketing side of the industry, due to the increase in freights and bad transport service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood Deputy Bartley to say that the general impression was that there was going to be a slump in the fish business analogous to that which we had to face after the last war.  Does it make common sense to say that, at a time when you anticipate that the fish industry is about to experience a sharp slump, you should buy a fleet of trawlers and go into a market which you say you believe is going to be <Col N="847" /> overburdened with fish?  That does not seem to me to be a realistic approach to life at all.  Could Deputies imagine somebody saying that he foresaw a vast surplus of oats in Canada and elsewhere and that the price of oats was expected to slump heavily and that, therefore, we ought all to go out on a &ldquo;grow more oats&rdquo; campaign?  I think that kind of talk is daft, and I want to say quite definitely to the Minister that I hope to God we never have deep-sea trawlers.  I think it is a rotten industry.</P>
      <P>I remember once&mdash;I think Deputy McMenamin may also remember the incident&mdash;a Scottish trawler put into Rathmullan because there was a dead man on board.  One of the men there asked if they wanted a priest to come down to see the remains and consider whether it would be proper to anoint them.  He was told: &ldquo;Not at all; that fellow never saw a priest.&rdquo;  The local man asked who he was and was told they did not know who he was.  When he asked what was his name, the reply was: &ldquo;We do not know; we always called him Joe.&rdquo;  The man asked had he any friends or relatives, or do you know anything about him?  and the skipper of the trawler replied: &ldquo;God bless your heart, we do not bother about who these fellows are&mdash;they come and go.&rdquo;  The general impression I got was that the men on that trawler were regarded by the skipper as so many animals.  They were of no importance whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>That was an English trawler?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>A Scottish or an English trawler.  I asked these men up in County Donegal if that was typical and the impression I got from them was that, in that deep-sea trawler trade, the conditions and treatment of men generally were as bad as those in any industry in the world, that it was a beastly kind of life and the last industry I should like to see established here as a training ground for young men.  If we had six deep-sea trawlers, I do not suppose we could provide, on the trawlers, employment for more than 100 men.  The expense is gargantuan <Col N="848" /> and the results, so far as I can see, virtually nothing, except to provide us with a marketing problem which will be a headache for successive generations.</P>
      <P>If it were an industry which would confer any material benefit on anybody, it might be examined, but, so far as I am concerned, I hope to God this Government will never be responsible for committing us to the deep-sea trawler trade, unless and until it is looked into very much more closely than those who call out for it seem to have looked into it, and unless we are satisfied that it would be economically possible for us to operate it under conditions which, according to our standards, would be tolerable to the kind of men whom we would expect to man it.</P>
      <P>What is the use of saying: &ldquo;Develop the home market&rdquo;?  What does that mean?  It makes no sense just to say: &ldquo;Develop the home market.&rdquo;  Any country shopkeeper who wants a stock of fish on Thursday can buy them&mdash; nothing to stop him.  He can purchase sole, salmon, whiting, herring, mackerel in season; he can order all the fish he wants and put it on his slab on Friday and sell it to whom he can.</P>
      <P>How will you make the people eat fish if they do not want to?  Surely, it is a complete caricature of the situation to pretend that the rural population are going around with their tongues out looking for fish?  I was for 25 years in Ballaghaderreen and I never saw them buying anything but herrings that would nearly chase you out of the house.  It used to be the bane of my life for a countrywoman to leave her basket in the shop.  She would run everybody out of the shop.  You would have to take the basket out very often and hang it on a hook in the yard.  But if you tried to persuade her to buy whiting or plaice or those kind of fish she would laugh at you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the thing is practicable, I assume that Deputies who advocate it mean that it could be made profitable.  If that is so, why does not somebody do it?  I did it myself for a while.  I sold fish and I could have gone on selling fish except that some Emergency Powers Order was made fixing a maximum retail and <Col N="849" /> wholesale price for fish, but they forgot the freight.  By the time you paid the maximum wholesale price and put on the price of freight the fish would cost more than we were allowed to sell it at and, inasmuch as I knew the Department of Industry and Commerce would be delighted to send in an inspector to catch me charging above the statutory price, I was afraid to put on the price of the freight and I had to give up selling fish.  Prior to that I could sell a considerable quantity of fish.  But to pretend that there is a market on which to found a trawler industry or any enduring inshore fishing, is fantastic.</P>
    <P>Our people are not a fish-eating people.  How many Deputies would eat fish unless on a Friday?  I would not eat fish if you paid me.  I might sit down to luncheon with a man and, when I call for a bit of meat and he would call for fish I would look at him and say: &ldquo;My God: is this a fast day?&rdquo; If he said it was not I would be inclined to put him in the category of eccentrics.  How many people here would eat fish unless on Friday?  The fact is we are not a fish-eating people.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the fish market in England consists of wealthy people who eat fish as a second course, and the fish and chip shops, for which there is an immense demand in England which does not exist in this country.  There used to be a fish and chip shop in Parnell Street, but the only one now left is on the Quay, whereas, if you go through the back streets of London, those shops are nearly as common as are public houses in this city.</P>
    <P>I do not see that there is very much you can do to develop the domestic market except one thing, and I advocated it often here before: that is, to purchase herring and mackerel and sell them to the fishwomen for 4d. a doz., so that they could revert to the old custom which obtained when I was a child, and that was, two herrings for a penny, at the corner of Marlborough Street.  I remember when I was young you could buy two herrings or mackerel for a penny in Britain Street, as it was then, or Moore Street, or James's Street or Thomas Street.  In the times in which we live it would <Col N="850" /> be a comforting thing to know that there were baskets of herrings and mackerel all through the town which people could buy at two a penny if they wanted.  It would be all nonsense for people to say they are hungry, destitute and miserable if there are herrings at two a penny.</P>
    <P>A Dublin Bay herring is as nice a thing as you could get, and there is the same nourishment in a good fresh mackerel as there is in a chop.  When you start comparing the demand you could create, even for herring at two a penny in the streets of Dublin, with landings of crans of herrings, the thing is nonsense.  The demand you could create for herring in this city would be no substantial relief for the problem of the herring and mackerel industry here.  At certain portions of the year there are vast quantities of herring and mackerel which they must be able to cure for foreign markets.  We must cure large quantities of fish or else throw them back into the sea.  Before the war we lost the German market for salt mackerel which, as Deputy Healy knows, was a considerable market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>Mackerel was never sent to Germany.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I always thought they sent salt mackerel there, or was it herring?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>They sent it to America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Mackerel were sent to Hamburg for years and to America, too, and we lost the Hamburg market to the Scandinavians.  We lost the Hamburg market and we could not get it back.  Then something happened to the Americans and they gave up eating mackerel.  Their taste changed and there was nothing we could do about it.  I am told now that the British Board of Trade is pressing the fishermen in England to send fish to some hard currency countries that badly want it and are pointing out that if a particular type of curing that is customary in these countries and quick freezing, to which Deputy Healy referred, are employed, a valuable addition to the dollar pool could be secured.  The countries that they name are North, Central and South America, the Philippines, Sweden, Switzerland, Portugal <Col N="851" /> and the Portuguese Colonies.  They point out that the quick freezing of fish and certain types of curing are badly wanted there.  We are not accustomed to trading with those countries, Central and South America, the Portuguese market or the Philippine market, and in my submission it would be a great mistake for us to try to break into these markets unless we have in our employment experts who understand the trade.</P>
      <P>I invite the Minister for Agriculture to consider the procedure adopted by Barytes Limited in Sligo.  They thought we were going to put the devil in the bag with barytes in Sligo but sensibly enough when they found the deposit, instead of trying to work that deposit on their own, they sought an expert with a knowledge of the peculiar problems associated with the mining of barytes.  They knew that the British Board of Trade wanted barytes as a substitute for some other component of paint that could not be obtained at the time and they went to the British Government and said: &ldquo;Will you find for us an expert in the mining of barytes? If you will provide us with such an expert, we have the barytes and the capital and we will take out the barytes and sell it to you and keep you going.&rdquo; The Board of Trade did find such an expert.  They found a fellow who had to fly from the South of France where his family had barytes interests.  They seconded him to Barytes Limited.  He was general manager until they got the machine going and until he had trained three or four young Irishmen.  Then he went back to his own country after it had been reconquered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the British Treasury want dollars and under our dollar pool arrangement any dollars we earn are put into the common pool.  I think it would be a sensible thing to go to the British Board of Trade and say: &ldquo;We observe that you are anxious to use fish exports to get dollars and hard currency.  We have a great deal of fish at the moment and we should be glad, if you have a first class man in this particular line of preparing fish for export, if you would send him over to us and let us have his services for a couple of years.  We shall see if we cannot supply <Col N="852" /> some of these markets, earn dollars and let them go into the dollar pool.&rdquo;  Once we make contacts with these markets and have learned the tricks of the trade in these markets, we might retain them hereafter, though of course we might discover when the normal channels through which they formerly obtained their supplies were re-opened that they might be able to obtain fish from other sources.  I think, however, it is worth trying and we could bespeak the necessary assistance from the Board of Trade inasmuch as the British Treasury would derive material benefit from our capacity to earn dollars for the common pool.</P>
    <P>So far as I can see, I am the only person&mdash;and I am not a fish expert at all&mdash;who has made the Minister concrete proposals calculated to increase the consumption of fish.  They may be bad proposals or they may be good but at least they are practical proposals. When I listened to men who are experts, and whom I know to be experts, I was disappointed that I did not hear something which would tend to relieve the situation.  Listening with the desire to hear them say that I am obliged to say that I was not much wiser when they sat down than when they stood up.  I should say that Deputy Healy did suggest that we should prohibit imports of fish.  Is that not so?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I misunderstood him and I beg his pardon.  I should say that I have received some representations from my friends in Gweedore and they say that I should approach Deputy McMenamin, Deputy MacFadden and some of our friends on the opposite side to protest against the proposal to remove the embargo on imports of foreign fish which they say, is a detriment to the livelihood of our inshore fishermen and they request that the embargo be re-imposed.  They say that no later than the week ending June 14th 70 boxes of foreign fish were imported when the fish markets of Dublin were glutted and fish, to wit, skate, had to be dumped in Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I do not know that my friends in Donegal might not be very well <Col N="853" /> advised to consider some of the observations of Deputy Healy in this regard. If we are to prohibit imports of fish into this country from Britain, what will we do if the British start prohibiting exports of fish from this country to Britain?  I am obliged to say to my friends from Gweedore that in this case I should not like to see any prohibition of imports.  I am a free trader and I do not believe in prohibiting the import of anything any more than I believe in prohibiting the export of anything. Given a free field, I believe our people can hold their own with anybody.  If we start putting up barriers we may find that the barriers put up against us will injure our trade much more than our barriers will injure foreign traders. However, I have told the Minister what my friends in Gweedore want and, having stated that I do not agree with it, perhaps the Minister will be all the more ready to concede their demand.</P>

      <P>The Deputy does not understand the Donegal people.  They never write to their friends merely for what they want to get out of them and they are never cross with a man if they believe that he is acting honestly. They are a decent people.</P>
      <P>The last thing I want to mention is trout.  One of the most valuable assets this country could have is brown trout. I hear from my neighbours, and I know from my own experience, that you will find that some rivers have declined and that you can never get any satisfactory explanation why that has happened.  The same is true of lakes.  There was a time when Lough Arrow was one of the greatest trout lakes.  You could be flogging it for a month now and you would not get a trout out of it.  On the other hand, Lough Gara, which most fishermen would not bother about formerly, is now nearly as good as Lough Sheelin during the Mayfly season.  Various experts have various theories, particularly as to how one can most effectively restore the trout population of rivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some will say here that the best way is to pour in fry.  Others will point out <Col N="854" /> that to take one pike out of the river will do more to restore the trout than the putting in of a million fry and that the method is to take out the coarse fish.  Others will suggest cleaning the rivers, while others will suggest putting in weeds.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that he should invite the boards of conservators throughout the country to choose from their own number a committee consisting of, say, two representatives from each conservation board to put forward their views as to how best the trout of the various rivers in Ireland can be increased.  I think he will get, probably, four or five diametrically contradictory recommendations. I suggest to him that, instead of frowning on that, he should say to them: &ldquo;Now I am putting you under no obligation to be unanimous&mdash; far from it.  I would much sooner if you would break up into four of five schools of thought.  Send me in your reports exactly as you draft them.&rdquo; We have seven or eight fishery districts in the country.  If I were the Minister I would take my seven or eight districts and if I got five schemes from five groups of men who, whether I agreed with them or not, I was satisfied were experienced, well-intentioned and anxious to help, I would say: &ldquo;Very well, I am going to give directions that each of these five schemes will be put into operation&mdash; one in each fishery district&mdash;and we will keep each of these plans in operation for a five or a ten-year period. At the end of that time the Minister for Fisheries or whoever he may be will consult his record and we will seek by a method of trial and error to find the best way.&rdquo;  It may be that a different method is suitable for a different district, but at least we will put an end to this situation where nobody knows what the solution of the tendency of a great many of our trout rivers to decline is.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that money spent in that way would come back to us in great abundance, not perhaps in a way that one would directly connect with the expenditure, but in tourist traffic and expenditure in hotels, expenditure on the people who tie flies and all the <Col N="855" /> various local activities that are associated with the fishing business.  I believe if the Minister were responsible for that kind of reform his name, to my utter astonishment, would be favourably remembered in the future, if not as an expert on agriculture at least as a friend of the fish.</P>

      <P>The Irish fishing industry had a fairly prosperous time during the last five or six years of the war but now that we are entering on more normal times and, naturally, meeting with a good deal of up-to-date competition many people who are in close touch with the fishing industry feel that the next five or six years will prove the testing time for the fishing industry in this country, and especially for the organisation behind that industry. During the 1914-18 War we had flourishing conditions in the industry but six or seven years later we found the industry in a very depressed state. In that connection I would like to pay here a tribute to the Sea Fisheries Association for the spade work done by them in those days of depression in helping the industry generally and assisting fishermen with boats and with gear to resume an industry that was falling into disrepute.  To-day we must ask ourselves if our plans and outlook for the future are so efficient and so up-to-date that we can hold our own with the foreign fishing fleets operating off our coasts, whether we can look forward to an expansion of the industry in our own country, and whether we can with our present methods recapture the markets lost to us as a result of the last war.  These are the questions which at present agitate the minds of those who are interested and who are close to the fishing industry. In my opinion our plans will have to be very drastically improved and revised if this industry is to hold its own at all either in this country or outside it. There is, for instance, great danger to our cured herring trade which is so important to Donegal and which has been referred to by other Deputies here.  If we are to allow Great Britain to dump her herrings here I am afraid that that important industry will be lost to us <Col N="856" /> altogether despite what Deputy Dillon says to the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What will we do if Great Britain stops us from dumping our herrings there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="Mr. Breslin Mr. Breslin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Breslin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a hypothetical question.  The fact of the matter is that we are allowing Great Britain to dump her cured herrings here with the result that our buyers when they go around to the markets which they have attended for the past 100 years are informed that the market is glutted and that there is no market for the cured herring.</P>
      <P>Surely any Irish industry should look to the home market and should preserve it for our own people.  That outlook bears fruit in all other Irish industries and I feel that the Department of Fisheries should hold the view that they should not allow Great Britain to dump her fish here in large quantities to the detriment of our own people.  As foreign markets may not be available to us for obvious reasons for many years, surely it should be the policy of the Department of Fisheries to ensure that the Irish market will be reserved for our own fishermen.  One side of the fishing industry which should be of great interest to everybody is the home market.  Donegal is a maritime county. Even so we find great difficulty in getting fish there on any day of the week. Now and again we may get fish, but very irregularly.  I feel that if supplies of fish were made available at regular intervals the people would have no objection to paying a reasonable price for it.  It is a surprising fact, but nevertheless it is true, that most Donegal hotels, in order to ensure regular supplies of fish, order it direct from Dublin because if they depend on any other means they will be without fish.  Surely it should be the duty of any Department if they are interested in fisheries to ensure that supplies of fish will be available in most areas where there is a market.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that the organisation behind our fishing industry is not what it should be because, if it were, fish would be available three or four days a week.  I was glad to hear, in the Minister's opening statement, that supplies of gear would be improving this year.  For the last month, we have had excellent salmon fishing in Donegal and all the boats engaged in that fishing did very well, but unfortunately only a fraction of the boats could take part, as they had no gear and were unable to get it.  That has happened around Gweedore, Burtonport and Arranmore.  It should be the duty of the Department to see that supplies of gear will be forthcoming and at reasonable prices, as the prices during the last five or six years were exorbitant&mdash;due to war conditions and not to any action by the Department.</P>
      <P>I feel we are adding very much to the work of the Minister for Agriculture in asking him to take over what should be one of our most important industries. I am not detracting from his capabilities in any way, but I feel that the Minister for Agriculture has sufficient to do in this country in providing food for the people without asking him to take over a Department which should be as important as any other Department of this State.  I hope that some day we will have a separate Minister for Fisheries, instead of asking a very busy Minister for Agriculture to look after one of our main industries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>In successive years I have contributed to the debate on the fishery Estimate and, even at the risk of having to repeat myself, I must go over almost the same ground.  I was interested to hear Deputy Dillon speak about the decline in the trout population.  I have a fairly large experience of both salmon and trout angling in various parts of the Twenty-Six Counties and I think every angler for salmon and trout will bear me out, that there has been a considerable diminution, especially in the trout population, over a period of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="858" /> That diminution was intensified during the war period, due to at least one cause&mdash;the high price being paid across the Channel for sea trout, white trout or brown trout or Loch Leven trout, as they are better known.  Any species of trout was fetching very high prices in the English market and that was one of the chief causes of the diminution.</P>
    <P>Several estimates have been made, none of which could be described as strictly accurate, but I am sure, if the Minister makes some inquiries, he will find that in his own Department he has some very expert anglers and authorities on this very question.  It is calculated that trout angling in this country could be made worth more than £1,500,000 annually, because of the fact that across the Channel&mdash; where I did a bit of fishing, too, for salmon and trout&mdash;it is a rich man's sport, whereas in this country, which is known as the &ldquo;sportsman's paradise&rdquo;, the trout fishing, at any rate, is free in nearly every district I know of.  By a process of elimination we might arrive at some of the root causes of this falling off in the trout population. Let us take first the question of poisoning streams.  I can say with some authority that that is dwindling, and has been dwindling very considerably in recent years.  Streams have not been poisoned to the extent they were some 20 years ago.  That is a practice which is dying out, I am happy to be able to report.</P>
    <P>The next cause is the use of explosives for blowing up salmon and trout pools in some areas.  That is not done now to the same extent as it was done previously.  Then we have the gravest danger of all and one which is on the increase&mdash;an increase which was very marked during the war period, from 1939 to 1943&mdash;that is, the taking of larger fish out of the small streams by means of night lining.  These night liners have adopted a new technique now.  The Minister may be aware of if, though I am not suggesting that he is either a poacher or a night liner. The line was attached to the bait hook and loaded and then thrown into the centre of a pool and the line hitched on to a stone or a tree on the bank of the river, or anchored in some other <Col N="859" /> way.  The new technique they have got is to wade into the river in thigh boots, so that even an astute gamekeeper or a civic guard&mdash;who, by the way, deserve great credit for their activity in preventing a good deal of poaching&mdash;or a water bailiff cannot discover where the night lines have been put down.  If they were put down by the old methods, they were difficult enough to discover, but they are far more difficult now and it is almost impossible to discover where they have been put by the new type of poacher. I know a case where there were only four or five rods in a village; now there are 30 or 40.  This does not mean they are all anglers who fish in a sporting way.  The rod is used as an excuse to go to the nearest stream and wade in and put down these night lines, which I regard as the greatest enemy of fish life in the country to-day.</P>
    <P>In Cork for a long number of years past we have had our own hatcheries. I am grateful to the Department of Fisheries for helping in many ways in the initial stages of establishing our trout hatchery.  They have helped us by giving us some ova and on many occasions by giving us some yearling trout.  That has done something to populate the streams as they should be populated, but unfortunately, notwithstanding our efforts, a falling off has been shown.  We know that, to some extent at any rate, the falling off is due to children not being taught at school to save these little fish in the summer time when these streams are very low and the small fish are easily taken out.  Some decent anglers, who do not think they are doing any harm, have been putting these fish in their baskets, creels or bags and by taking out these useless fish they are depopulating the streams to a serious extent. However, there again there has been some improvement.  The growth of a number of anglers' societies and clubs means that numbers of people who before would have taken out under-sized fish and put them in their fishing creels now throw them back into the river immediately after hooking them.  The encouragement of other clubs to form their own hatcheries would be very helpful in <Col N="860" /> increasing fish in the rivers.  We know that over the past 20 or 30 years there has been an enormous increase in the number of anglers.  The sport has become very popular.  The Minister should consult some of the men in his own Department&mdash;I know some of them who are experts and whose advice would be worth having&mdash;if he intends to develop inland fisheries as they could be developed with considerable financial and other advantages to the country.  The streams should be looked after and properly bailiffed.  That would help to make fish more prolific. If our rivers are well-stocked it will attract, as it has attracted in the past, some of the best sportsmen from the other side.  I have met many of them who came here to observe the customs and habits of the country and to spend their money here.  Fishing attracts a good type of sportsman to the country. The Minister could devise some means of policing the rivers not already policed, if not by uniformed men, at least by giving the boards of conservators some financial assistance to enable them to employ extra bailiffs.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister some statement as to his attitude in relation to some of the boards of conservators.  A very wise step was taken by the Minister's predecessor in regard to the position in Galway which was antediluvian in every respect. There had been a system of voting by proxies and the riparian owners and the ordinary fishermen were almost prohibited from fishing on many parts of the river because of proprietary rights being held by one person.  The system of voting by proxy should be abolished and I am speaking as one who is entitled to a vote.  I remember being beaten by one vote on a board of conservators, where all the proxies were used.  That does not influence me because it happened some time ago. Certainly, something should be done to curb voting by proxy.  If persons who have fisheries want to vote, let them come to the elections and vote.  Under the old system of voting by proxy one person can buy up the rents from the riparian owners and buy up their fisheries and then keep out the man who pays his licence but who is not prepared to buy votes.  The Galway Deputies <Col N="861" /> in this House will be able to corroborate what I say.  The system that operated in Galway was modified and was made more acceptable to the people and more in line with the times we live in.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Minister should look into the whole question of elections by proxy on the various boards of conservators and I hope he will encourage, as his predecessors encouraged, those who are prepared to establish trout hatcheries and who are prepared to look after them without cost to the community.  All the labour is supplied free and in my opinion this work is of considerable advantage to the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesKilroy" hpid="Mr. Kilroy Mr. Kilroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer particularly to the condition of slips and piers along the west coast of Mayo. They have all got into a state of disrepair and, unless they are put into proper condition, fishing will be discontinued in that area.  I will give one example.  During the 1914-18 War a mine burst near one particular slip and, as a result, the whole slip was cracked.  Nothing has been done to that slip since and it has broken away and is being washed away by the sea and nobody can use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time there were 14 to 20 crews fishing from that slip, going out every day.  Now, fishermen are afraid to go out because, on account of the condition of the slip, they might not be able to get back again.  Several appeals were made to have the slip put into repair but nothing was done.  It is a shame that something is not done.  I admit that the Board of Works did offer to make a grant some years ago but it was conditional on the county council providing 25 per cent. of the cost and maintaining the slip afterwards. The county surveyor refused to do that.  That slip should be put into a state of repair immediately.  There is a great deal of fish along the coast there and there is no means of getting it out.  The same thing obtains along the coast of Erris and Achill.  Slips that <Col N="862" /> were provided by the Congested Districts Board have got into a state of disrepair.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to see that grants are provided for this work.  The people of these areas do not derive any benefit from the best scheme, the wheat scheme or the turf scheme and the least that should be done is to see that the slips and piers are put into a state of repair.  Achill and Erris are in great need of slips.</P>
    <P>Foreign trawlers are poaching there day and night and there is no sign of their being stopped.  There are many fishermen along the coast there and there is as much fish there as in any other part of the coast.  If loans were available for fishing boats and gear, the fishermen would be induced to go out fishing again.  In most places fishermen have stopped going to sea because, on account of the lack of landing facilities, they are afraid they might not be able to get back.  Some years ago a tragedy occurred there and it is only by the mercy of God that tragedies are avoided.  If slips were made safer, there would be more fishermen in the area.  I believe that there are possibilities in that area equal to those in any other part of the coast, if they were developed properly, and therefore I would ask the Government to see to it that facilities are provided and, further, that the proviso as to the local contribution of 25 per cent. should be waived.  The majority on the county council can out-vote the representatives of this area and we can never hope to get that grant from the council The majority of the members of the council represent inland districts. Although there is a very big coastline, there are very few representatives of the coastal districts.  In the interests of the poor people along that coast, I ask that something should be done along the lines I have suggested.  I hope my appeal will receive some consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an aspect of the matter that was referred to by Deputy Kilroy which, I think, the Minister and the Government generally ought to bear in mind.  The Deputy spoke of the importance of helping the <Col N="863" /> fishing on the west coat of Mayo, and of improving some of the slips and piers there for that purpose.  I have been trying to direct the attention of the Department in charge of the Gaeltacht industries and also the Board of Works to the position of one particular pier on the west coast of Kerry.  This whole matter of improving facilities for fishing on the west coast is intimately bound up with the economic well-being of one of the most valuable sections of our people in relation to our national being and our national culture&mdash;that is the Irish language.  I would like to ask the Minister if, in relation to the conditions on the west coast of Kerry in the corner of Dunquin, he could get anything done to put the pier there into a position in which boats could come in with safety so that fish and other articles could be landed there.  As I pointed out before, you have there a self-centred community.  The Irish language is the dominating language of their lives.  They depend on agriculture and on fishing to sustain their economy.  They have in that small parish, or half parish, excellent land. You also have there some of the best farmers in Kerry.  They are small farmers.  The district is very circumscribed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been endeavouring to get the Department of Agriculture to give facilities for a travelling creamery there so that more cows could be kept and a better return got from the land by people who are perfectly well able to give it, and whose land is perfectly well able to yield it.  The fishing side of their economy has been disastrously and completely wiped out.  Deputies who have been to Glendalough and have found their way far into the tail-end of the valley will recall seeing the desolation of stones there.  On a smaller scale, the desolation at Dunquin pier is almost more terrifying.  A few hundred pounds would re-establish the connection of an excellent, active and enterprising community there with the sea.  The work that was undertaken by the Board of Works has been left entirely derelict because, in the first place, the situation for the pier was a difficult one, and in the second place, <Col N="864" /> when the cliff fell in on top of it, it was left there.</P>
    <P>There seems to be no authority ready to step in and save the situation.  The piers that have been mentioned by Deputy Kilroy are a prop to the economy of our Irish-speaking people. We shall have before us this evening a Vote for an additional sum of £1,500 for the Oireachtas to be spent on an annual festival here in Dublin.  For what?  To help the Irish language. We can do nothing but waste money in helping the Irish language in Dublin if, through neglect here and there in the areas where we still have communities speaking the Irish language, with a tradition for speaking it that goes back for thousands of years, their economy is allowed to waste itself or be destroyed.</P>
    <P>In connection with this matter which Deputy Kilroy mentioned and which I mentioned previously with regard to Dunquin, I should also say that some representations were made in regard to An Beal Bán, which is at the other side of Ballyferriter.  There is a problem there to be dealt with.  It is a simple one, and I suggest that, if nobody else is going to deal with it, the Minister for Fisheries ought to look into it, take it up and get something done, because contact between the community there and the sea is really being cut off.  It is cut off through a certain amount of neglect which a little care and attention would wipe out.  If that were done these people could re-establish themselves in a better and more progressive way on the social wealth that is there, wealth which they are perfectly well able to use if their contact with it is not blocked.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to bring to the notice of the Minister's Department the shortage of nets which has been experienced by fishermen during the past few years.  I assume, now that things are coming back to normal, that the position will be remedied in the near future.  I notice that several Deputies urged the placing of an embargo on imports of fish.  I do not think that would be a wise course to take.  Some Deputies seemed to give the impression that, because there is a <Col N="865" /> little extra fish coming on the market we should place an immediate embargo on all imports of fish.  I know that the question of a continuous supply of fish is an intricate one.  There is one thing that Deputies should get into their heads, and it is, that you cannot regiment fish.  You can place tariffs and restrictions on many a thing, but thank God you cannot make fish come here and go there at will.  Anybody who has ever seen a fisherman fish for salmon at the estuary of a river will know that he may go there day after day and not catch one salmon.  On other days he may catch 30 or 40.  Fishermen may cast out their nets but they cannot say to the salmon: &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;  They have to trust to luck.</P>
      <P>There is no such thing as controlling the supply of fish.  If men could go out on any day and catch 30 or 40 salmon they would then have to haul the salmon around Dundalk or some other town and perhaps get about 6d. a lb. for it unless they were able to send it direct to the Dublin market or to the London market where there was a keen demand for it.  This matter of putting on an embargo is a two-edged sword.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputies talk about a slump, surely they do not envisage a situation in which there will always be big prices for fish and other commodities.  We must have some thought for the poor in our back streets.  They want to get fish at a reasonable price.  Everybody knows that if fish can be got at a reasonable price the consumption of it will go up automatically.  People with large families would like to be able to give two or three plaice to each member if the price were reasonable, but because the price is high each member has to be content with one plaice.  The same thing applies to herrings.  I think it would be most unwise for the Minister to place any restriction whatever on the import of fish.  We all know that in the old days those who engaged in the buying of fish might go out one day and not be able to get any supplies on the home market.  They then had to get supplies from the far side.  If they were depending on the fish landed at our Irish ports, well, there would be no <Col N="866" /> fish at all for many people in this city or in many of the larger towns throughout the country.  On the question of a slump, one might as well say that, because we have a few extra fish, we should call on the Department forthwith to put an embargo on imports. If that were to be done it is not one Fishery Department but dozens of them that would be required to control the coasts, sending out wireless messages not to allow any fish in until the last Irish fish had been sold.</P>
    <P>We have some people selling tomatoes in this country who think that we should keep every foreign tomato out until they squeeze out the last ha'penny for the home-grown ones, and when the home-grown ones are all sold, they want the foreign-grown ones brought in for their own use.  It is illogical to be talking about the high cost of living and, at the same time, keeping it up by prohibiting the import of any article of food that is at times in short supply. What good is money unless we have the commodities in sufficient quantities for the people to buy which they have not been able to get for some time?</P>
    <P>As to setting up on a very elaborate scale a deep-sea organisation with trawlers, et cetera, that is easier said than done.  It would cost a vast amount of money and it is questionable if you would get a sufficient return from the expenditure.  Such a project as that would have to be carried out on a large scale.  The French and the Norwegians and others have trawlers which can fish in the North Sea and other places and they do not land all their fish in their home ports.  They have to land the fish in different ports on the Continent and Great Britain.  I would say to those who suggest that this thing can be easily done that it will cost a large amount of money and that it would be almost impossible to put it into effect and to bring about the results envisaged.  The fishermen have to go out to meet the fish; the fish do not come into them.  If the fishermen are prepared to purchase the boats themselves, I am sure they will get assistance from the Department.  I think, however, that the time has arrived when people should do something for themselves and not be asking <Col N="867" /> the Fishery Department to place the fish in their baskets.</P>
    <P>One aspect of this question to which I would like the Minister to pay attention is that of the inland fisheries. Great harm has been done to our rivers during the last few years and as a result the supply of trout and other fish has not been as good as it was.  I do not know what is the cause of that, but I know that the Department of Fisheries cannot bring about much improvement unless they have the goodwill and co-operation of the people. It is unfortunate that in this country there seems to be an entire absence of civic spirit in regard to the preservation of our rivers as well as the preservation of our wild fowl and game. Some people have no qualms of conscience about netting trout and salmon, especially in the close season for their own advantage.  They never think of the very serious loss as a result of their ill-advised action at certain times of the year.</P>
    <P>I think a great deal of the shortage of fish in the rivers is due to the lack of co-operation by those who, by virtue of their position, one would think would try to help the boards of conservators all over the country to preserve our inland fisheries, so that some return can be got by those anglers who, at great cost to themselves take out a licence and procure the necessary equipment for fishing for their own enjoyment.  Inland fisheries are one of the greatest sources of revenue this country could have.  Fishing is a sport which is taken up by many people in different walks of life and a great deal of money is put in circulation by people not only from this country but from other countries because of their incidental expenses.  If the Department would concentrate on improving our inland fisheries they would be doing a great work which would not cost very much money.  I wish to emphasise again that to make that effort successful it is necessary to have the co-operation of the people. especially those in the areas through which these fishing rivers flow.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to take steps to see that the small piers along <Col N="868" /> our coast are put into a proper condition of repair for the accommodation of fishing boats.  I wish to emphasise again that I do not think it would be wise for the Minister, except after very serious consideration, to do anything to prevent the import of fish.  We export a lot of fish at certain times of the year and possibly what we might gain in one way would be lost on the double in the other way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish, when speaking on the motion to refer the Estimate back, dealt with a matter which I think practically every Deputy who has spoken in this debate also referred to, namely, the provision of suitable landing facilities for our fishermen. Deputy Mulcahy came into the House apparently to discuss the matter of the Dunquin Pier with which I was very familiar in the Office of Public Works. Deputy Healy dealt with the question of Valentia Harbour, which was also a bit of a thorn in my side when I was in the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>As to the provision of suitable landing-places for our people, when I was in the Office of Public Works I took the view that Deputy Mulcahy has suggested the Minister for Fisheries, so far as he has responsibility for this matter, should take.  The system through which these facilities are made available to these fishermen is perhaps a bit elaborate and cumbersome.  I always felt that it was too cumbersome and sometimes even irritating to a person who has responsibility in one Department or another because he could not get some repairs carried out in a place where he felt that repairs were necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although my responsibility at that time was different from what it is now, I did take a keen interest in the matter, and I found a different approach to it in the different counties. Deputies will understand that direct provision is not made in this Vote for the provision and repairs of piers and slips for our fishermen, but this Department enters into the matter inasmuch as, when an application is made to the Office of Public Works, that application is referred to the Department <Col N="869" /> of Fisheries so that it may express its opinion on the fishing interests involved. When the Department officials signify their approval to the proposed work, the matter which has been referred to of the attitude of the local authority arises.  Will the local authority make any contribution?  Is it reasonable to ask the local authority to make a contribution?  If the local authority makes a contribution, is it reasonable to ask it to maintain the structure?  If they refuse to maintain it, is it reasonable to ask a State Department to set up an organisation for the preservation of these works along our coast?  Would it not be much better and much more businesslike if the county council would undertake the work, as it has in the area an engineering organisation of its own capable of a quick approach to any sudden problem which may arise?</P>
    <P>When dealing with these matters in a different capacity from my present capacity, I tried to approach them sympathetically for the reasons stated by Deputy Mulcahy, but I found the most peculiar attitude on the part of local authorities.  Some of them were very helpful; some were very anxious; some were, if I may use the expression, falling over themselves in order to cooperate with the Department directly concerned; and some of them would not touch the work with a 40-foot pole. I can say here that I used every means of persuasion possible, through the members of councils who are also members of this House, to get these local authorities, who were, I supposed, advised by their technical staff in many cases, to adopt a different attitude.</P>
    <P>The same applies to Dunquin.  I do not know the details of that problem now; they are not fresh in my mind; but the general picture of the case is in my mind and I can assure Deputy Mulcahy that while I have no desire to shirk any responsibility&mdash;you often find a tendency as between one Department and another or as between a Department and a local authority to try to push the blame over on to the other party&mdash;that, whoever was responsible, when I was in the office directly concerned, I was terribly anxious to find a solution of that problem.  I do <Col N="870" /> not think it is entirely a fishery problem&mdash;it is partly a fishery problem and partly something else&mdash;I confess&mdash;as I say, I have been out of touch with it for some months&mdash;that I was somewhat disappointed to learn that progress has not been made since, because I thought at the time I was leaving the office that we had reached a point at which we could look forward to having the work done.  The harbour at Valentia has a much longer history and I think that we are nearing a solution of that very vexed question.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the present system is a good system or not.  I often thought it would be more satisfactory if some means could be devised to eliminate all these corners, and some others which I have not referred to at all, around which one must go in view of the different interests involved &mdash;fishing interests, the interests of those who take sand from the sea, and so on&mdash;but I suppose it is necessary that a number of Departments should be consulted.  In order to satisfy myself as to whether we were doing as Deputy Mulcahy suggested we ought to do, I spent some time going around the coast and looking at the facilities provided for fishermen, especially in those counties which were willing to co-operate, willing to make whatever small contribution they were asked to make and willing to maintain the structures erected.  I was in Kerry and Donegal and other places and what surprised me was the generosity of the facilities we were providing.</P>
    <P>In some of these centres, we had expended money on the provision of slips and piers, and my visit was completely a surprise&mdash;whatever evidence was there would be there any day.  I took with me the files dealing with all the small works we had erected and I said to myself: &ldquo;I will see what case was made for this work before it was undertaken and I will have a look at the completed work and see what evidence there is of traffic from the point of view of fishing.&rdquo;  In many cases, I must say I was severely disappointed by the lack of indication of that kind in spite of the provision of these landing facilities about which I have been urged to be generous.  There <Col N="871" /> is no provision in this Vote for this service and I can only tell the House what my approach to it was, at a time when my responsibility was different. I can only say that to the extent to which this matter will come before me from another Department for my views as to whether a particular proposal should be gone on with or not, my tendency and the tendency of my officials will be, where there is a doubt, to load the dice in favour of those who are in need of these services.</P>

There might be cases where, because of all the interest involved&mdash;the local authority, the Office of Public Works, the Department of Fisheries, and so on &mdash;vexatious delays took place.</P>
      <P>On the matter of the fishing industry, I have heard many points of view from men who are experts and some men who are not.  I find myself in agreement with Deputy Murphy when he spoke of the number of occasions on which we had heard the same kind of speech and I was particularly struck by his suggestion as to the necessity for our developing an inland trade in fish.</P>
      <P>That point, too, has been made by other speakers and I have often asked myself: &ldquo;How would you do this, what effective steps could we take in order to achieve that end?&rdquo; And again, if you were to succeed in developing that inland market for fish, what sort of organisation would you set up, how would you control it?  What is wrong with the present organisation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am posing those questions; <Col N="872" /> I have been asking myself those questions.  I have met fishermen since I came into this office and they have said the same thing to me as Deputy Murphy has said: &ldquo;There is none.&rdquo; One of those individuals is a member of the deputation of fishermen and was at one time a director of the Sea Fisheries Association.  Most of the points raised here as to the need to cultivate and develop a taste for fish, to develop an inland trade and set up an organisation to handle the fishing industry, are very interesting, but you will get that sort of loose talk about the fishing industry and I have invited these men to try to clear their own minds and to give me, either in conversation or in writing, what ideas they have as to how this could be done.</P>
      <P>It is not often that Deputy Dillon and I agree on any matter, but I must reluctantly confess that many of the points he made in the course of his speech were points that I would have made.  I say to people who talk about our lack of taste for fish, what can we do about that?  You lift up a journal and read an article by some authority on fish.  He gives figures showing the consumption here as compared with the consumption in England or in Canada.  He compares the consumption of fish in Dublin with that in London, mentions the desirability of cultivating a taste for fish, and points to the liberty, the scope there is, to induce our people to consume a most desirable food.  I agree with that, but, like Deputy Dillon, when I go to the restaurant for my lunch I might sometimes forget whether it is Thursday or Friday and when I see by the activities going on around me that it is Friday, I curl up my nose and say: &ldquo;Ah! it's fish.&rdquo;  If my own reactions and the reactions of other members of the Dáil are like that, it is only natural to expect that the reactions of the people in the country are the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What can we do to change that, if it is desirable that it should be changed? When you have that done, if it can be done, what steps will you take to organise the fishermen?  If what Deputy Murphy says is correct, that the Sea Fisheries Association is not an organisation, what steps will you take <Col N="873" /> to organise fishermen, because it will be necessary to do that?  Will they respond to your efforts to organise them and, when you have that done, what sort of scheme will you have for the co-ordination of the whole industry for the purpose of the proper distribution of fish after you have cultivated a taste for it?</P>
    <P>These are matters in regard to which one would expect a closer sort of reasoning on the part of people, some of whom are members of this House, who have been engaged in this business for a long time.  They talk about the undesirability of importing fish but, as I said to those who visited me, why would the Association allow the importation of fish to ruin the industry here unless there was some substantial reason for it, unless the market conditions here were in such a state that they were entitled to take that course? When you ask fishermen to give you any reason why the Sea Fisheries Association should have the desire to destroy the fishing industry, as would appear to be suggested here, by allowing fish to be imported, you simply cannot get any kind of answer that seems to make sense.</P>
    <P>I would be very glad to hear the views of those who are interested in the matter.  The organisation that is there is, so far as I know, always open to consider any views, and unless there is more clarity in the views that they might decide to send, either to the Sea Fisheries Association or to me or my Department, unless there is more clear thought behind it, I can well understand the failure, or whatever other word you may use, of that organisation or of my Department to take any serious notice of it.</P>
    <P>Fishermen are afraid of a slump, I am told.  I do not know of any producer in these times who is not afraid of a slump.  The world is agog talking of the danger of slumps.  In every branch of the agricultural industry world-wide organisations are being set up for the purpose of ensuring, in so far as it is possible to do so, that the slump which followed the last war will not follow this one.  Whether their efforts will be successful is another matter, but since that is the case in regard to other industries, it is not unreasonable, <Col N="874" /> I suppose, that fishermen would have their doubts and fears, too.</P>
    <P>I, and I am sure everyone here, would like to see the fishing industry and those engaged in it reasonably secure, for the reasons that were given by Deputies from all parts of the House, but it is not an easy task.  Anyone who listened to the debate will realise that it is very hard to get any degree of unanimity as to the line of approach to the solution of the problems that confront fishermen.</P>
    <P>There is and must always be on the part of the Government a desire to do everything that is possible to help and to protect those engaged in this business to the full limit within reason. Deputies of course are aware, so far as the availability of boats and gear is concerned, that it is purely a matter of inability to secure these supplies. As the Estimate shows, a very much larger provision than heretofore is made for this purpose because of the hopes we have that these materials and this equipment will be on the market in future in greater quantities.  It is not a matter of money.  If the provision in the Estimate is not sufficient to purchase what we are able to secure, the money can be obtained.  We expect that the tendency will be towards an improvement and we intend to take advantage of it.</P>

      <P>We are trying to get boats and equipment of all kinds.  Deputy Dillon, Deputy Anthony and Deputy Coburn and others referred to inland fishing.  I, like Deputy Anthony, could never understand what was the reason for the disappearance of certain types of fish from certain lakes and rivers. Neither could I understand Deputy Anthony's speaking with the degree of confidence he displayed as to the falling off in the poisoning of rivers and streams and the destruction of inland fisheries.  I do not know if he is justified <Col N="875" /> in the confidence he has shown in an improvement in the position and I do not know what evidence he can adduce in support of his belief.</P>

      <P>Fishermen who follow trout fishing and other types of inland fishing are very interesting men to watch.  I do not know if there are any people in the world who seem to possess the same patience.  I never fish myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew there was something wrong with you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some very good fishing in my neighbourhood and I see men who apparently spend a great deal of time at it.  I admire their patience but you never seem to get from any two of them the same opinion for changes in the habits of fish.  I think that applies to all kinds of coarse fish in our lakes.  In my own county there are lakes in which there is a lot of coarse fish.  When I was young I used to fish in these lakes and I now meet a lot of people who frequent these lakes and they tell me that even the coarse fish that used to be found there formerly in abundance are no longer to be found.  I do not know what is responsible for that; I suppose it is just a phase that will correct itself in time. The suggestions which have been made as to the steps which might be taken to improve inland fisheries will be considered.  I do not think there is anything in the suggestion made by Deputy Dillon inasmuch as I do not think that there are any brown trout fishermen on our boards of conservators <Col N="876" /> at all.  At least so I am informed by my advisers.  Therefore, the sort of commission he suggested I should set up would have no interest in brown trout.</P>
      <P>I agree with those who say that the inland fisheries are very important but I do not know how they can so easily arrive at a figure as to the value of the industry.  I have no doubt it is valuable and that it is desirable it should be encouraged and developed. I think that those men especially who take such a magnificent interest in providing stocks for rivers should be helped in every way because I do not know of any other section in the country who devote the same time and attention to that particular type of work as they do.  It is, therefore, the duty of the Department to help them in every way.  However, I could never understand, as I say, what means they have of assessing the financial value of our inland fisheries.  I could never know what the basis of the calculation was.  I think I have referred to most of the points that were made in the course of the debate.  If I have failed to deal with any of the suggestions put forward and if I should find later that there is anything in them, we shall make all the use we can of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>All that has happened with regard to this Health Bill from the time it appeared in its original garb as the Public Health Bill, 1945, is, to my mind, a warning and a challenge, not only to the people generally but also to a certain number of various classes of people in the country.  I say it is a warning and a challenge.  I think, also, it ought to be a source of encouragement to them. When the Public Health Bill of 1945 was first introduced there was a certain amount of welcome for it from the Press.  Under the light of the examination it got here in this House it disclosed itself to be a very different measure from the measure the public thought it was going to be.  I think that those in this House who were responsible for destroying the Public Health Bill of 1945 and getting the Health Bill of to-day substituted for it should be gratified to feel that they have struck a blow against the development <Col N="878" /> of what might be called the police stage in this country, where the health institutions of the State and the medical fraternity as an organisation were to be regimented and developed into a kind of constabulary to dominate and interfere with the lives of the people. I say we have interrupted an attempt to develop the police stage in this country in relation to health on the medical side.  I am not quite sure that we have completely exorcised the mind that was behind the Public Health Bill of 1945, or that we have completely protected the people from any remnant of that mind that may be left there. But there are bodies whom we rely upon to see that the work that was done by a small body in Parliament with very little help from outside will be taken up and continued, not for the purpose of destroying anything but for the purpose of building up the type of institutions we require in this country to improve the health of our people.</P>
      <P>I would like to say that those who interrupted the steam-rolling process of the Public Health Bill of 1945 have got very little assistance from any organised body in the country.  If we got assistance from anybody it was from a small group of individual people who were interested in a particular Catholic outlook on life, in the personal dignity of the individual and who had a certain Christian outlook on sociology. However, except for a small group of individuals expressing themselves through a weekly newspaper called <i>The Standard</i> there was no help of any kind given in an organised or in an individual way from outside, and particularly from the organised medical profession, to the work that was carried on here by a small group to hold up and break down the intent that was behind the Public Health Bill of 1945.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain progress has been made. One of the things that appears in the measure before us is the setting up of a Council of Health to advise the Minister.  The Minister, as already indicated, appointed a certain number of representatives chosen by certain medical nominated bodies to act on an advisory council to advise him.  The council is composed of nominees of the Medical Registration Council, of the Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland, <Col N="879" /> of the Medical Association, and of the Society of Medical Officers of Health. A statutory obligation has been imposed upon the Minister to have such a council but beyond that the Minister was not prepared to go.  He was not prepared to accept an amendment to the Bill that the powers, functions, and duties of this body would be prescribed by statute.  In discussing the matter on the Report Stage I agreed that a certain amount of experience by the council of their work and a certain amount of examination of the problems that required to be dealt with by the council, as a council, would be required before, perhaps, they would be able to indicate what powers, functions and duties defined by statute for such a body ought to be.  When I pressed the Minister to accept an amendment to the Bill under which the council would give an actual report the Minister hesitated to accept an amendment of that kind and, in fact, an amendment to do that was negatived. It strikes me as somewhat ominous that where we set up an Advisory Health Council as a statutory body the Minister resists an amendment to the measure that that body would give an actual report.</P>
    <P>However, there is now a statutory requirement that there shall be a national health council.  As the Minister has indicated, that council will be a body, not nominated by himself but one which will have nominees on it of the various sections of the medical profession. What has happened should be a warning and an encouragement to certain classes in the country and we will be depending on the medical profession, acting in a representative way on that council, to see that nothing is left, in the administration of this Bill, of the mentality that expressed itself so often and so vigorously and in so many ways in 15 days of Committee that were spent by us in the beginning of last year in opposing the repressive and tyrannical elements in the Public Health Bill of 1945.  Therefore, I say to the medical profession that there is, in all that has happened, a challenge to them.  They have to work and to be watchful, as, if they allow themselves <Col N="880" /> through the empowering machinery of this Bill, to be moulded into a State regimented service, they will be doing a very great disservice both to medicine and to our ordinary democratic Christian life.</P>
    <P>Another class of people who should be warned and encouraged by what has happened is that large number of talented and influential people who were asked by the Taoiseach to sit as a committee to inquire into vocational organisation and who reported so unanimously and so fully on every aspect of vocationalism in this country and who made recommendations that only by the encouragement of vocationalism and the welding of the various representative vocational bodies into the economic and political life of the country in a suitable way would our work be specially well carried on. I have not seen any activity on the part of any of those people, either individually or as a body, since the Report was signed, to indicate that they were still pressing their ideas or still holding the hope that the Government would take active steps to develop vocationalism.  They should be encouraged, on the one hand, by the Minister's action and they should be challenged, on the other hand, by the things that went before, to begin to take a very active interest in this and to watch what is going to happen under this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is another class of people who ought to be interested at once in what might happen under this Bill, that is, those persons who welcomed with a certain amount of enthusiasm and hope the outline by the Most Reverend Dr. Dignan of his ideas for developing a social security scheme and, particularly, a scheme of national health. If the empowering provisions of this Bill are developed in the way in which I think an attempt is likely to be made to develop them, any chance of building up anything like a national health scheme on an insurance foundation and divorced from the poor law and the dispensary system will be killed. Therefore, those who are interested in a national health scheme for our people, divorced from the poor law system, should watch very closely what <Col N="881" /> is going to happen under this Bill. Another class who ought to feel challenged by all that has happened are those who consider our national life here from the point of view of Catholic sociology.  It has been made perfectly manifest to the House that the original Bill was a serious attack on the integrity and the privacy of the family and that that attack has not been entirely removed.  The possibility of an attack of that kind still lies in this new Bill as it is.</P>
    <P>The Bill as it stands now is a very peculiar type of Bill and we do not know what it may mean in actual practice. We have in it the proposed development throughout the country of a public health system to cover the mother and the child, for rich and poor, yet by an extraordinary change in the new Bill under Section 27, the Minister arranges whatever may be done in that particular manner.  He may differentiate between the various health authorities and may deal with a health authority of a particular class, or in a different manner and to a different extent with the various health authorities.  We do not know what we are to expect out of the measure, but we do know that there is a very considerable volume of opinion that regards it as unreasonable that a State medical service would be set up and the taxpayers asked to pay for it and that free medical attendance would be given to the mother and child of every class in the country.  Certain aspects of that are criticised and it has been pointed out that the setting up of a State system of that kind, in our circumstances, will undermine the position and the livelihood of the private medical practitioner.</P>
    <P>Another element in the Bill is that the Government seem intent on relying on compulsion in this matter, as against education.  They rely upon dipping their hands into the public pocket and spending large sums of money, both from the rates and from the taxes, on institutions of various kinds.  At the same time, there is no serious move on the part of the Government to deal with the preventive side of those things that are injurious to the general health of the people.  We have had quoted here <Col N="882" /> enormous figures in regard to the amount of money to be spent on the setting up of various institutions for the treatment of disease, but on the other hand very many voices have been raised among the medical profession and those in close touch with social circumstances in the country, to point out that what is really undermining the health of the people is bad nutrition.</P>
    <P>There are very many other ways in which Government activity would be welcome to safeguard the health of the people and that would be much better than many of the things planned in this Bill.  We could have physical education in the schools, a national food policy, a reduction in the cost of living in regard to those articles necessary for proper nutrition, a housing policy and a school policy, particularly to prevent overcrowding in the schools.  It is an astounding state of things that we were here developing a somewhat ruthless machinery for improving the public health, while infants of six, seven and eight years of age are crowded into classes of 80, 90 and 100 to receive the beginning of their primary education. I would like the new Ministry of Health to consider to what extent the foundation of ill-health in early adolescent and adult life is laid by reason of the fact that infants, particularly in the city, are crowded into close classrooms and herded together for the purpose of the early part of their education.</P>
    <P>These are matters for the future but I just want to emphasise the point that, while the Minister is preparing and planning to spend an enormous amount of money from the rates and taxes for the improvement of the personal health of our people, nothing seems to be done in a systematic way either with regard to physical education, nutrition, housing or schools.  However, the Minister is now taking from the House a Bill which is empowering more than anything else and we will be looking forward with considerable eagerness to see what kind of regulations will be made under it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has insisted on taking powers that will enable him to require parents, whose children are not sent for examination when ordered by the <Col N="883" /> appropriate medical officer to be sent for examination by him, to provide a medical certificate that they have been examined by some other doctor.  They may have to provide such a certificate twice a year and he has included in the Bill substantial penalties in money to be recovered from parents who do not provide a certificate for each of their children, perhaps twice a year, that they have been examined by a doctor. I think that that is a complete condemnation of the whole manner of approach of the Ministry to this problem, and if it is attempted to be put into operation I think the Minister will find himself up against difficulties that may very well wreck his scheme from this point of view, that the people generally will regard it that their liberties and their private lives are being invaded and that compulsion is being applied to them in matters, whereas if a different approach were made they would be only too ready to respond, and if services were offered they would be only too ready to accept them.  The compulsory element in the Public Health Bill of 1945 has not been completely eliminated and I think it has been allowed to remain in this present Bill in a very vital way.  I would look forward to the Minister reviewing that matter between this and the time it leaves the Seanad and making such an amendment to that part of the Bill as would make it perfectly clear that the medical examination that was provided for young children was a service offered to the people and not something thrust on them and imposed on them by way of medical inspection from a State machine.</P>

      <P>My principal fear in relation to this Bill is that, somewhat like the Drainage Bill, it will be passed through the House as a magnificent scheme in itself but will take about 30 years before it is operated fully.  If this Bill is to be of benefit from a health point of view to the nation, it is imperative that it should be put into operation with the least possible delay.  We know that the health of the community in this country is anything but what it should be.  We know that disease is growing in this country. <Col N="884" /> We know we are not able to provide either the preventive or curative remedies that are needed. The Minister has taken to himself in this Bill all the powers which he thinks he needs to meet the present situation. I only want to urge on him, now that he has got these powers, that they will be used without delay.</P>

He complained that the only organ he got to support him was <i>The Standard,</i> which I am not surprised supported him, because it generally mixes its Catholicism with Fine Gael policy.  I am glad to see that none of the other Catholic papers thought it wise to support him in his campaign.  He mentioned the Health Council.  The Health Council was in the first Bill.  It was not brought into this Bill.</P>

We ought, I suppose, be thankful to have Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Morrissey and the others here to work these very great improvements in the Bills that come along, and it is a pity that they cannot get the Press outside, or the medical profession, or anybody else, to support them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The medical profession, I have no doubt, will be watchful as Deputy Mulcahy has appealed to them but, again, is it necessary to appeal to the medical profession, against a Department like the Department of Health or any other Government Department, to watch and see that Catholic principles are maintained? Does Deputy Mulcahy really feel like that because, if he does, I have the greatest pity for him.  If he does not feel like that, it is obvious why he says it.  It is only to get support from a certain section of the population outside which indeed he may not get at all, after all his trouble.  He talks about Catholic sociology.  He says the Bill is an attack on the family.  I read that the other day, from what one might call a theological doctor, that it was an attack on the family.  I do not know, but neither he nor Deputy Mulcahy pointed out where the attack is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy has complained more or less about the huge expenditure that is to go on under this Bill. Then he complains that we are taking power to say that a child must be presented for medical inspection or the parent will suffer a very severe penalty. Well, we may spend a lot of money under this Bill, but it might be all lost if there were some hidden sources of disease which we would not have power to get after.  We are taking power under the Bill to see that children are presented for examination so that, as far as possible, we may discover diseases <Col N="886" /> at an early age and may try to prevent them.  I think Deputy Mulcahy agrees with that.  He also says that we are spending too much on treatment under the Bill and not enough on prevention.</P>
    <P>When I was introducing the Bill, I stated what I believed to be a fact, that this Bill is a departure from previous Bills dealing with sanitary services and with medical services in the direction that it lays more stress on prevention than it does upon treatment. There is no doubt that the Bill is going in that direction.  I know, of course, that there are things that we have not mentioned in this Bill&mdash;that we should try to see that children are more scientifically and more properly nourished.  It was not necessary to put that into the Bill because I do not see that there are any powers necessary to carry out that object.  We have made some attempt to improve the nourishment of children through milk and in other ways.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy talked about physical education.  We are providing for the education of children with regard to health including, of course, physical education.  On the Committee Stage, and again on the Report Stage, Deputy Mulcahy did his very best to nullify that by making it possible for any parent to object if a doctor, or anybody else, attempted to teach his child good lessons on health and so on.  Then Deputy Mulcahy talked about better housing.  I quite agree that we should have better housing.  I can admire Deputy Mulcahy's audacity in lecturing this Government on housing.  We should, also, as far as possible, improve the schools.  I hope that will be done.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Morrissey, I think I explained both on the Second Reading and on the other stages that this is an enabling Bill.  It enables local authorities to do quite a number of things.  I did explain that there is no possibility of getting the Bill fully implemented everywhere and immediately.  We have not got the personnel to do it, and we have not got the equipment to do it.  That is why, for instance, Section 27, which was quoted by Deputy Mulcahy, is drafted in such a way that we can make different regulations for different local <Col N="887" /> authorities.  That is done in order that we may be able to make regulations for some local authorities which are more advanced in personnel and equipment than others, and in order that we may be able to bring them all as quickly as we can into the full implementation of all the measures that are covered by this Bill.</P>

It will take some time before these staffs will be there.  I agree with Deputy Morrissey that it will take some time. I do not know whether it will take many years or not, but it will take some time before the Bill is fully implemented everywhere.</P>

I told the Deputy that as far as I knew at that time&mdash;and the same holds still &mdash;any medical men that I had discussed it with&mdash;the great majority of the medical men&mdash;appeared to think that we should continue vaccination against smallpox.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £411,350 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of <Col N="889" /> March, 1948, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health, and certain Services administered by that Office, including Grants to Local Authorities, miscellaneous Grants and Grants-in-Aid, and certain charges connected with Hospitals.</P>
    <P>I will deal first with the two conventions which have just been agreed to. Early in 1946, an invitation was received by the Minister for External Affairs from the Secretary-General of the United Nations Organisation to send an Irish observer to the International Health Conference which was to open in New York during that month.  That was done.  A delegate was sent and was later given power to sign any convention that he thought well, subject, of course, to the approval of the Government and to ratification by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The International Health Conference met in New York from the 19th June to the 22nd July, 1946.  There were 51 States represented there, and as a result of the deliberations of the conference the following instruments were drawn up and separately signed: (1) Constitution of the World Health Organisation; (2) Protocol concerning the Office International d'Hygiene Publique; (3) Arrangements for the establishment of an Interim Commission of the World Health Organisation; and (4) Final Act of the International Health Conference.  The Interim Commission was established to carry on during the interim period while the Constitution of the Health Organisation would be drawn up and the final Act which is referred to in (4) was merely a copy of the proceedings and of the deliberations.</P>
    <P>Therefore we have only two important documents to discuss, the Constitution of the World Health Organisation and the Protocol.  The Constitution of the World Health Organisation opens by enunciating principles relating to health, which it is stated, are basic to the &ldquo;happiness, harmonious relations and security of all peoples&rdquo;.  The functions of this organisation are to act as the directing and co-ordinating authority on international health work, to propose <Col N="890" /> conventions, agreements and regulations, and to make recommendations with respect to international health matters.  Membership is open to all States and States which were not present at the meeting can join by signing the articles as agreed upon by those present.  The assembly may adopt regulations concerning sanitary and quarantine requirements, nomenclature of disease, causes of death and public health practices, standards for certain biological, pharmaceutical and similar products.  Members may reject such regulations or accept subject to reservations.</P>
    <P>So far as this particular convention is concerned, States may become parties to the constitution by (a) signature without reservation; (b) signature subject to approval followed by acceptance, or (c) acceptance.  In our case the document was signed under (b), that is, it was signed subject to approval by the Government and by the Dáil.  The constitution will come into force when 26 members of United Nations have become parties to it.  The Protocol provides that, as between the signatories to the Protocol, the duties of the office under the 1907 Sanitary Convention will be performed by the health organisation and, in the meantime, by the Interim Commission.  That is that the old organisation that was there under the League of Nations will now cease to operate and all the functions and so on will be taken over by the new organisation.  By signing and accepting the constitution the Governments accept definite responsibilities and obligations.  The new organisation will have authority to adopt conventions and agreements and such agreements will become binding on members, subject to objections or reservations being made within stated periods.  But once we signed without reservation we took upon ourselves to bind ourselves by accepting.</P>
    <P>I think it will be obvious to Deputies that there is a definite advantage in having an organisation like this. For instance, planes will be coming here from many countries and passengers may bring in, let us say, malaria which, as Deputies are aware, is spread by mosquitoes.  If there is a <Col N="891" /> very potent source of mosquitoes in a particular place it might be to our advantage to join with the other nations of the world to destroy the source of malaria rather than try to deal with it when a case crops up here.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to many other diseases.  It is better to destroy the source so far as we can.  That is one of the advantages of being in this world organisation.  Having the advantage of the experience of these other countries through the various publications that will be circulated, the contacts made in meeting their representatives, and the interchange of information, will be useful in helping us in our health services.  We should gain by the experience of other countries and we hope we may have something to contribute from this country and that other countries may gain thereby.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the medical profession that participation in the organisation should have great advantages from a practical point of view and that is why I ask the Dáil to approve of it.</P>
    <P>I now come to the Estimate.  I had hoped that before this Estimate came before the Dáil we might have issued the White Paper that I have so often referred to.  The Health Bill, of course, deals with a certain number of things which the Department are anxious to get after.  The Health Bill deals principally with mother and child welfare, to a certain extent with infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, and with institutional treatment.  But there are quite a number of other things which we have not dealt with to any great extent in that Bill.  For instance, we have not dealt to any great extent with the ordinary treatment of disease, which has been carried on up to this in dispensaries and in county and voluntary hospitals. The White Paper will give an outline of the type of organisation that we think would be suitable in future and how these types of diseases and services should be tackled in time to come.  The issue of the White Paper was delayed on account of the splitting up of the Department of Local Government and Public Health and the establishment of a new Department <Col N="892" /> of Health.  The preparation of the White Paper is very advanced and I think I can guarantee that it will be in the hands of Deputies during the summer holidays.  If they wish, Deputies will then have an opportunity of discussing the contents of the White Paper when we meet after the summer holidays.</P>
    <P>Some figures from the vital statistics might be interesting.  For instance, Deputy Morrissey made a statement, which I think is generally believed, that the health of the country is disimproving and that the mortality rate is increasing.  That is not altogether true, as the statistics for the last few years issued by the Registrar-General will show.  First of all, as regards births, the number in 1946 was 67,547, which was higher than 1945 and 2,000 higher than 1944.  The birth rate per 1,000 of the population in 1946 was 22.6.  The rates in Northern Ireland, Scotland and England and Wales for 1945 were 22.0, 16.9 and 16.0, respectively.  The number of marriages registered during the year 1946 was 17,575, which is also an increase on some of the preceding years.  The marriage rate per 1,000 of the population was 5.9.  The mortality for the year 1946 showed a decrease, the number of deaths recorded being 41,455, which is fewer than in 1945 and 3,673 fewer than in 1944.  The death rate per 1,000 of the population was 13.9.</P>
    <P>With regard to the principal infectious diseases, we have a rather encouraging picture, inasmuch as things are improving and on the mend.  The position was bad about 1942 or 1943, but since that time they have been improving.  The number of deaths from the principal infectious diseases, typhus, typhoid, diphtheria and scarlet fever last year was 163, as compared with 263 in 1945 and 400 in 1943, so that there is a good improvement which, I hope, will not only be maintained but will become still greater as the years go on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that figure include deaths from tuberculosis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That figure would be much greater and I will deal with it in <Col N="893" /> a moment.  The big item in the figure I have given is diphtheria which accounts for 135 deaths, but the position in that respect is also improving.  The number of cases of diphtheria has gone down steadily for the past few years.  There was no case of typhus in the past two years and only two deaths from scarlet fever in each of the last two years, so that we have a very good picture for these two years.  If we could tackle diphtheria more vigorously than we have been doing, we would have a very low death rate indeed from infectious diseases.</P>
      <P>Immunisation was being carried out when the war commenced and it reached the highest figure about 1941. Since then, it has not been so good, but the results of immunisation of the past few years are beginning to show and the incidence and the death rate are going down very satisfactorily.  I have no doubt that if we carry out immunisation more vigorously in the next few years, we shall be able to effect a big improvement as regards both incidence and death rate.  We should be in a position now under our new Bill to have immunisation more widely practised. We have got over certain irritations which doctors felt with regard to fees under the scheme.  We have fixed more favourable fees for them and immunisation should be carried out more generally from now on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to hospital building, the programme was interrupted during the war.  It was very hard to get materials, and, although building materials are now becoming available in greater supply, equipment and fittings are just as difficult to get as they were during the war, so that it is not as easy to get on with the provision of hospitals as it was pre-war.  We are, however, going on with some building, in the hope that we may get the fittings and equipment necessary.  One work sanctioned recently is the reconstruction of Loughlinstown, County Dublin, Hospital, the cost of which will be about £150,000.  There will be 183 beds in the hospital, representing an increase of 54 general beds and 28 maternity beds on the accommodation at present available.  This provision should do much to provide for that very <Col N="894" /> populous area in South County Dublin.</P>
    <P>Approval in principle has been given for a number of other buildings and the only thing remaining is to get going on the plans and start building.  We have approved of the erection of a 60-bed county hospital in Wicklow; reconstruction of the county home at Castlebar; erection of a 50-bed hospital at Ballinasloe; erection of a 160-bed county hospital at Cavan; the erection of a 100-bed county hospital at Dundalk and reconstruction of the county infirmary to serve as a 25-bed maternity hospital; and works of improvement at the county home, Mountmellick.  In addition to the foregoing works, we have some other work in hands, and I might mention in particular the reconstruction of the acute portion of St. Kevin's Hospital in Dublin.  There are a number of other building works which are being examined at present, but I do not think I should delay the Dáil in detailing them at this stage, because I am sure every Deputy knows that, in his own county, an effort is being made to build or reconstruct hospitals and sanatoria of all kinds and. I can only say that we will try, so far as we can, to get these projects under way.</P>
    <P>There were 17,585 patients in the mental hospitals on the 1st March, 1947, as against 17,736 on 1st March, 1946, a reduction of 151.  The number of admissions during 1946 was 2,543, an increase of 237 on the previous year, but there was an increase in the number of discharges and there was also, unfortunately, an increase of 59 in the number of deaths.  The death rate, calculated on the daily average number of patients in residence, was 5.7 per cent., as against 5.3 per cent. in 1945.  There is one rather gratifying feature about these figures of admissions and discharges, that, in recent years, more are going out each year, showing that the treatment of mental patients is improving and that there is more hope now for a person of unsound mind going into a mental hospital than there was some years ago and quite a number of cures are effected.</P>
    <P>There was a blood transfusion service in the city here during the war. We had considerable difficulty about <Col N="895" /> keeping it on.  We had to try several institutions and we found some difficulty everywhere we went.  We must, however, provide the service, and I am sure we will find a solution in the very near future.  We have a committee dealing with the whole question of the service, which is an advisory committee for the Minister and the Department.</P>
    <P>I have referred before to the national survey into the nutritional condition and food habits of the people, with a view to providing data for the drawing up of standards peculiarly suited to our own people and which will, at the same time, be related to international practice, which is at present in progress.  I am sure Deputies will agree that we cannot have a world standard of nutrition, because climate, possibility of getting certain foods and so on must be taken into account. We are doing our survey here, keeping world standards in mind, and when we have completed our survey, we can come to the best conclusion possible with regard to what recommendations should be made in regard to dietary and so on.</P>
    <P>We have talked a good deal about mother and child welfare on the Public Health Bill, and it is scarcely necessary to go into the necessity for such a scheme, but Deputies perhaps are not altogether aware of our position with regard to infant mortality.  It is much higher than it should be.  We must try to see how we stand with regard to other countries and know exactly what hope we have of improving the position and to what extent we may hope for an improvement. For the ten years, from 1936 to 1945, inclusive, the death rate amongst infants for the whole country was 72 per thousand.  For 1946 it was 63, so there is a slight improvement, but there is room for further improvement.  For 1945, the rate was 68 in Northern Ireland&mdash;I have not the figures for the other countries for 1946&mdash;in England and Wales it was 46, and in Scotland it was 56.  I read a very long article on this subject in one of the medical magazines recently and there it was held that, with the advance of science, it should be <Col N="896" /> possible to get this figure down to 20 or 25, but there was no hope that it could be got further than that unless we keep people living for all time.  There is quite a lot for us to do.</P>
    <P>In the county boroughs the infantile death rate is much higher.  For the ten years the average in Dublin County Borough was 106 against 72 for the whole country, and for 1945 it was 111.  It is perfectly clear, therefore, that the infant death rate in Dublin, in particular, and in the county boroughs generally, is excessive, and we must have much more effective supervision in the first year of child life in order to try to reduce that death rate.</P>
    <P>I mentioned here before that I have great hopes of a new scheme, the details of which have been practically agreed upon.  Under our mother and child welfare scheme in the city the maternity hospitals will play a big part.  The three maternity hospitals will divide the city.  They will provide an ante-natal service for expectant mothers, and a clinic.  They will provide treatment for expectant mothers.  They will look after child birth, the delivery of those mothers and, a thing they have not done up to the present, they will extend their supervision over the babies until they are 12 months old.  That will entail the provision of clinics, where the babies will be brought, and also a domiciliary service.  They will provide a service of doctors and nurses to visit the homes of the people to look after the babies.  They will provide a children's ward in each hospital for certain specific cases.  With the great record these maternity hospitals have in Dublin, I have no doubt they will make a very big change in infant mortality in the city when they get this service going.</P>
    <P>We have dealt with the mother and child welfare scheme so much in the Bill that I do not think it is necessary to go into it at any length again.  It is proposed to make available to everybody in the country, if they wish to avail of it, a free service for mothers, and for children up to the age of 16 years.  There will be treatment for expectant mothers during that period and during their confinement and <Col N="897" /> treatment of the mothers after the birth and of the children until they reach school-going age and during the school-going period up to 16 years.</P>
    <P>We hope to have more frequent school inspections, so that diseases of the young may be detected in time to treat them before they go too far. The number of children examined in school inspections in 1944 was 102,153. It is rather alarming to think that of that number of children, 48 per cent. suffered from dental defects of various kinds.  If those children had not been inspected it is to be presumed quite a lot of them would have let these dental defects proceed until nothing could be done.  Seventeen per cent. had defects in the nose and throat&mdash;that is, principally adenoids and tonsils&mdash;and 16 per cent. had defective vision, while 2.7 per cent. suffered from other eye defects.  I think those figures are quite sufficient to convince any Deputy that school inspection is absolutely essential if we want to rear a healthy young generation from the children who are now there, and the same will apply as other children come on.</P>
    <P>I come now to tuberculosis.  There is in the Estimate an increase of £33,500, as compared with last year, for the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis.  To give you an idea of what this service covers, I would like to give some details as to how this increase arises.  There is an increase in the number of persons receiving treatment under the local authority tuberculosis scheme and a contribution is made to the local authorities by the Department.  The number of patients treated under these schemes is increasing from year to year.  That does not necessarily prove that there is more tuberculosis in the country, but it does prove that there are more people availing of the scheme.  The only sure guide with regard to the other thing is the deaths from tuberculosis. In 1940 the number taking this treatment was 17,307 and that went up every year until 1945, when it was 20,622.</P>
    <P>The next item under that sub-head is increased expenditure under the Dublin County Borough Scheme, consequent on the employment of mass radiography and the provision of <Col N="898" /> additional facilities for institutional treatment.  Deputies have heard about mass radiography and there is no doubt that it is a service that will be availed of more and more and I hope it will be effective in detecting tuberculosis in the early stages.  The third item here relates to the increase in the number of nursing and domestic staffs employed in local authority and tuberculosis institutions, and improved diagnostic facilities consequent on the introduction of X-ray and screening apparatus.  That is all to the good in diagnosing disease.  There is an increased expenditure on the provision of extra nourishment, clothing and bed and bedding under the tuberculosis domiciliary welfare scheme.  There is a very rapid increase of expenditure here.  The increase went from £5,000 in 1943-44 to £51,881 in 1945-46; for the year 1946-47 it was estimated at £62,979 and for the present financial year, 1947-48, it is estimated at £68,000.</P>
    <P>The next item of importance is that in the special institutions for the treatment of tuberculosis provided by local authorities, the costs of maintenance have risen in the last five years from £98,021 to £163,501.  We all agree, of course, that tuberculosis has been the main problem in this country for many years.  The death rate from the disease had, however, shown a continual fall for 30 years until 1938.  In that year the number of deaths from tuberculosis was 3,216.  Then there was an upward trend during the war for some time and in 1942 it reached its peak. In 1942, the number of deaths was 4,347 but last year it had come down to 3,333, which was slightly over the 1938 figure.  There is, therefore, some hope that we are reaching an improved position in regard to tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>I was asked by Deputy Byrne the position in regard to sanatoria.  I must say that there were rather long delays in regard to getting the three big sanatoria built.  The position now is that in Galway, which is the most forward, a survey is being made and it is hoped that the building will be commenced early in the new year. If there is no unforeseen hold-up, we should have the Galway regional hospital ready for patients in about <Col N="899" /> three years.  The Cork institution is not much behind that.  The building of the Cork institution should be in progress a few months after that in Galway.  Deputies are aware that we had to leave the site which was first selected for Dublin but I believe we have a better site now.  There will not be very much delay because the plans that were made for Santry Court will be applicable to the new site which we hope to get.  We have almost got it but unfortunately I am not at liberty to mention its location lest there might be any last-minute hitch in the arrangement and the owners who are selling it would not like the facts to be known if anything should occur and the deal was off.  So far as we are concerned, the deal is on definitely.</P>
    <P>I think I mentioned on a few occasions already we are doing everything possible in the meantime to increase the bed accommodation in the existing institutions.  For instance, in Peamount, three huts are being built which will accommodate 120 beds. Another 80 beds are being provided in Newcastle.  By the end of the year I think some of them at least should be ready.  In fact, it is hoped that the first will be ready by September, so that I think that we shall have some further beds available in these institutions within a short time.  It is expected that 60 beds will also be provided in St. Laurence's Hospital and an additional 43 beds are being provided at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Dún Laoghaire.  A further 64 beds in the Rialto Hospital are now ready.  All these additions, some of which are ready at the moment and the latest of which will be ready within 12 months, will total 367 extra beds.  They will make a big difference in the waiting list.  Unfortunately they will not be all available for the city as in some counties the position in regard to waiting lists is also serious and we may have to allocate some of the bed space in these institutions for patients from some counties.</P>
    <P>In the counties progress is also being made.  Accommodation is being provided in Killybegs, County Donegal, for 60 patients and Woodlands Sanatorium, <Col N="900" /> Galway, has been extended by the provision of 64 extra beds, so that in some of the counties at least extra accommodation is being provided.  I do not know that there is anything else I should say at this stage but if Deputies should require further information I shall be only too glad to supply it so far as I can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. I welcome, as I think the House generally will welcome, the fact, that this country is willing to become a member of the new World Health Organisation.  I think that the contact and the experience which members of the medical profession here are likely to gain and the exchange of information which is likely to be available through the deliberations of the new World Health Organisation, are bound to be beneficial.  I think it is no exaggeration to say that this country has long enjoyed a world-wide reputation for the skill and knowledge of members of the medical profession here.  The staffs of the voluntary hospitals in Dublin and, for that matter, the members of the medical profession throughout the country because of the opportunities which they have had of spreading their knowledge and experience abroad, have achieved, and worthily achieved, a world-wide reputation. I have no doubt that as a result of the further contacts which our medical men will have through the new World Health Organisation, this country will continue to enjoy that high reputation and that the benefits of the fuller and wider knowledge and the more varied experience available from that organisation, must have fruitful results not merely for the medical profession but for the people in general here.  I notice that the Minister said that the World Health Organisation would come into being on 26 nations ratifying its establishment. I suppose it will be possible to get 26 nations without Russia.  It may be too much to expect that they will support it as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was one matter in which the Minister admitted there had been delay, namely the question of the proposed <Col N="901" /> provision of regional sanatoria. It is over two years since this House at the urgent request of the Parliamentary Secretary responsible for the public health section of the Local Government Department, passed within a fortnight the Establishment of Sanatoria Act.  Under that Act we were informed that it was proposed to build three regional sanatoria&mdash;one to serve Dublin area, one in Galway to serve the western area and one in Cork.  I know that it had not been finally decided at the time where some of the sanatoria would be erected, but it was intended to have three large sanatoria. I had the temerity to move an amendment to limit the expenditure in order to elicit from the Parliamentary Secretary some information on the future of the Hospitals Trust Fund.  I remember that the Parliamentary Secretary at the time rose in indignation at the idea of anyone attempting for a moment to delay the proposed urgent work&mdash;undoubtedly urgent work, urgent work which every member was anxious to see expedited, to which every member of the House gave his blessing and which drew forth from all sides of the House an unusual number of compliments, in particular so far as the Parliamentary Secretary himself was concerned.  These compliments and the manner in which the Bill was received augured well and the House was entitled to expect that rapid developments would take place.  At that time the statistics showed that there had been a rapid rise in the number of deaths.  I admit that the worst year was 1942, but the drop which has since been shown every year is not regarded as sufficiently satisfactory and even yet no adequate explanation has been given for the rise in 1942 and the drop which has taken place since.  The House expected at that time that we would have had considerable developments and that by now, if one could have looked ahead at that time, some increased accommodation would be available.</P>
    <P>At that time or prior to it the Dublin Corporation had invited applications for designs and plans for a proposed sanatorium to serve the citizens of Dublin.  There was considerable expenditure and a prize scheme which <Col N="902" /> offered attractive prizes was set up as a result of which a number of designs and plans were submitted. Finally a particular plan was selected.  Under the Tuberculosis (Establishment of Sanatoria) Act the responsibility for the provision of sanatoria was taken out of the hands of the local authorities and placed on the Department.  The cost, or portion of the cost, was to be borne by the local authorities; the maintenance portion and the running was afterwards to be borne by the local authorities. At that time the Dublin Corporation had in mind a number of possible sites.  It was at one time considered possible that vast expansion would take place in the region of or to one of the existing sanatoria under the control of the corporation.  Subsequently, another site was selected and, in fact, plans were being proceeded with when the Tuberculosis (Establishment of Sanatoria) Act was passed and the responsibility became a matter for the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  Earlier this year, as a result of two Parliamentary questions, I elicited the information from the Minister who had taken over the responsibility that it was not proposed to proceed with the erection of a sanatorium at Santry Court.  I may add that when the Bill was going through this House Santry Court was not considered, or certainly it had not at that time been selected as a site.  For some reason which has never been given to the House, after the Act was passed Santry Court was selected.  Although it was at that time handed over or was in the process of being handed over to the Grangegorman Hospital authorities, the Department swept in and selected Santry Court as a suitable site for the new sanatorium.</P>
    <P>Some time at the end of last year or early this year work on the laying of a sewerage system was started and development plans undertaken so that the sanatorium might be erected.  Then after, apparently, two years' experience and two years' delay, someone in the Department woke up to the fact that Santry Court is in close proximity to Collinstown Airport.  Mind you, Collinstown Airport did not spring up overnight. <Col N="903" /> It has been there for a number of years.  The building at Collinstown Airport has excited and received the commendations of many people, not merely in this country but from abroad, as being one of the finest examples of architecture and, in fact, probably the finest airport terminal building if not in the world certainly in Europe.  However, it would seem that the responsible people in the Custom House, either under the Minister or under the Parliamentary Secretary, had not noticed that an airport, whose traffic was growing daily and weekly and whose traffic had, in fact, grown substantially since 1945, was operating close to Santry Court. They proceeded, at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year, to undertake constructional development work.  Then, after this work had been undertaken, after an expenditure of at least £19,000, the Department realised that the site was not suitable.  The Department realised then that the fact that aeroplanes were in almost hourly transit in the vicinity if not over the actual land and proposed building site at Santry Court would be detrimental to the health of the patients and would hinder any possible chances which patients housed there might have of recuperating.</P>
    <P>After a delay of two years, during the whole of which time the numbers of people looking for beds in Dublin and the rest of the country had increased, during which time the list was becoming longer, and during which time the state of health of many patients had seriously declined, the Department realised that they could not proceed with the building and they decided to abandon the site.  Not only had a sum of £19,000 been spent but, due to non-insurance, when Santry Court was burned it cost the country £25,000.  It is an extraordinary thing that Santry Court has been a most unlucky place for the State and for the people of this country.  That was not the present Minister's responsibility, but there was some muddle, and eventually, after the burning down, compensation had to be paid, so that now we have to pay £19,000 on top of that for constructional <Col N="904" /> work.  It may be that some of the work which has been started there and portion of which possibly has not been completed will not be entirely lost.  However, whether it is entirely lost or whether part of it is redeemed, the fact is that, due to incompetence, due to some carelessness &mdash;I think gross negligence is an adequate description of the lack of appreciation of the fact that there was an airport in the vicinity and that the constant coming and going of aeroplanes would render the place entirely unsuitable&mdash;even if there were no airport, the site is unsuitable.  The Department comes along two years after the Bill was passed through this House and admits that there has been delay.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Minister inherited a legacy of blame in this case, certainly if not the entire legacy the greater portion of it.  It is possible that he may feel slightly aggrieved at the criticism and responsibility which he has to bear in this connection. However that may be, Government responsibility is collective and his predecessor or somebody in the Government was responsible for the fact that the citizens of this country have had to pay over £19,000 on constructional work and on the laying of a sewerage scheme to a site which has now been found unsuitable and unsatisfactory while at the same time the numbers of patients seeking accommodation in sanatoria have increased.  It is a reasonable assumption that many of those patients have had their condition worsened by delay.  I suppose it is not an exaggeration to say that, in the last two years, some patients have died who might have been saved if accommodation had been provided.  We are told now that it is intended to provide 120 beds at Peamount, 80 at Newcastle, 60 at St. Laurence's, 43 at Our Lady of Lourdes and 64 at Rialto, and that it is expected that these 367 new beds will be available in the reasonably near future, but that the demand from other parts of the country will necessitate a number of them being set aside for places other than Dublin.</P>
    <P>I think the House and the taxpayers are entitled to a fuller explanation of the whole circumstances surrounding <Col N="905" /> the selection and acquisition of Santry Court as a proposed site for a regional sanatorium and that the House is further entitled to know why it was originally selected and the reasons for the delay in coming to the conclusion that it was unsatisfactory, when it was obvious to everyone that the amount of traffic was growing daily, almost hourly, at the Dublin airport.  It is one of the best examples of Government incompetence and reckless waste of public money.</P>
    <P>In the course of his survey of health in general, the Minister referred to the fact that the infant mortality rate in the City of Dublin was heavy and it was one of the matters which gave him and his Department most reason for consideration.  One of the contributing factors is the excessive overcrowding. When we examine health statistics, we find for many diseases that there is very often either an improvement or no appreciable deterioration over long periods.  People ask how it was that 40 or 50 years ago people existed without many of these diseases and enjoyed good health without many of the health services and benefits which we have at the present time.  It is generally forgotten that, at that time, the cities and towns were much smaller than they are now.  The rapid rise in Dublin City and the Dublin area over the last quarter of a century has militated considerably against the health of the people in that area and particularly against the health of the children.  The overcrowding, the bad conditions in many parts of the city, the lack of sufficient accommodation, while they are inconvenient and possibly a source of ill-health to many adults, have not nearly the same adverse effect on them as they have on children.</P>
    <P>Over the last quarter of a century Dublin has grown out of all proportion. The city has expanded into the county and many of the towns in the county are now expanding.  One of the matters which merit serious consideration is that we now have one-fifth of the population of the entire country in the Dublin area.  The health services, housing facilities, sewerage facilities and the other facilities incidental to an adequate <Col N="906" /> housing system will have to be reviewed and altered radically, if the city is to extend much further.  This is not entirely a matter for the Minister, but is one to which he must give attention in collaboration with the Minister for Local Government.  Most of the housing amenities were set down at a time when Dublin was far smaller. In a number of cases some slight modification, alteration or improvement was sufficient to deal with the increase, but I think the limit has been reached now and, in view of the impact which the lack of these services has on housing accommodation in Dublin, the Minister should consult with the Minister for Local Government about this question.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that Loughlinstown Hospital is being extended and that the work is at present going on there.  That is certainly a welcome improvement.  That area and the entire South County Dublin has developed enormously and the existing hospital accommodation in Dún Laoghaire was in no way sufficient so the improved facilities in Loughlinstown will be of benefit.  The standard of treatment in that hospital was of a very high character and any expenditure on work there is not merely welcome but long overdue.</P>
    <P>In regard to dispensaries, in view of the fact that we have already discussed part of this ground on the Health Bill, it is difficult to deal with it now.  Some dispensaries were built at a time when the system was portion of the poor law system and entirely different services were expected when doctors rendered and were expected to render a very different type of service to those members of the community partaking of that service.  If the services under the new Health Bill when it becomes law develop in the manner in which the Minister has envisaged and in which the House expects them to develop, the existing dispensary buildings will be entirely unsuitable in many cases.  I would be glad to hear from the Minister, when he is replying, what plans the Department have, either in conjunction with local authorities or under the Bill, for an improved dispensary service.  Some of the buildings <Col N="907" /> have been remodelled, reconstructed or improved in recent times, but by and large they are entirely unsuitable.</P>
    <P>In places like Crumlin, Kimmage and other newly-developed areas, and in places like Blackrock, which has expanded very considerably in recent years, the dispensary accommodation is entirely inadequate.  The buildings there, even where new, were never intended and could not possibly cater for the large population.  Under the new provisions, we will have the mother and child welfare treatment and other dispensary services which the dispensary doctor and the local nurse are expected to render, and the buildings will have to be remodelled entirely or new ones erected.  The Minister should pay some attention to this matter, and local authorities should be informed before they undertake further building work or erect new dispensaries.  They should know the proposed usage of these dispensaries in the future.</P>
    <P>There are services at present rendered to patients, either under the local authorities or under the public assistance authorities, under which many of the children receiving attention and medical care are obliged for a period to get special medical facilities. I have in mind a case where the local dispensary doctor or other doctor attending a child advises the parent to get surgical boots.  In the case of poor parents a contribution is forthcoming and in the case of very poor parents the entire cost is met by the local authority.  These boots wear out in a comparatively short time and there is a lapse of time before they are renewed or repaired.  It has happened that children who have benefited considerably by such treatment relapse into their former condition as a result of such delay.  There is a clash of interest between the manager who is anxious to restrict expenditure and the local doctor or county medical officer of health who is anxious to provide the treatment.  Very often delay such as I have described wipes out any benefit that might have been derived by the child.  The same thing applies very often in the case of children sent to hospitals.  It applies particularly to <Col N="908" /> children sent to Dublin hospitals for treatment of defective palate or some slight defect of the throat.  The children are treated for a period.  When they return for further treatment to the hospital the hospital has difficulty in ascertaining who is liable for the cost.  Delay takes place while the local authority, who are anxious to conserve expenditure, pursue the usual inquiries and during that time the condition of the child deteriorates.  I would suggest to the Minister that there should be instructions given that closer collaboration between the managerial side and the health side of local authorities is called for, and that every effort should be made to continue services which the county medical officer or the dispensary doctor considers essential.  Where treatment is recommended by the doctor it is recommended because it is necessary, and any delay or interruption that takes place in supplying that treatment may hinder an improvement in the child's health if it does not render such improvement impossible.</P>
    <P>The only other matter I should like to refer to is the new scheme referred to by the Minister for maternity and child welfare service.  He stated that the three maternity hospitals in Dublin propose to provide the facilities and to divide the city between them. I do not know whether that will include the county or not or whether the county will be separate but I would think that the three hospitals would have a sufficient task in meeting the needs of the city.  The needs of the county also are great and I would be glad to hear if there is any similar scheme envisaged for the county.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that it was proposed to improve considerably the acute section of St. Kevin's Hospital. I referred to this matter before and I think that very great improvements have taken place there but that hospital has a legacy which is portion of the legacy from the poor law system and that operates against the ultimate success, certainly of the hospital in its present form.  I would suggest to the Department that the sooner the acute and chronic portions of that hospital are separated entirely from each other the better.  I would be anxious to hear <Col N="909" /> what plans the Minister has in connection with that matter.</P>
    <P>Before the commissioners were appointed for Cork Street Hospital I understand that a number of the members of the staff there&mdash;not the medical staff but the ordinary manual staff&mdash; had pension rights.  Apparently, some time ago a circular was sent around directing the attention of the staff to the fact that a number of these pension rights were not likely to be continued and that superannuation might not necessarily operate in future.  A number of members of the staff, who have been there for a considerable time and who joined in the belief and in the full knowledge that they were likely to receive a pension at the end of their service, feel aggrieved.  I think the Minister should look into that matter. This hospital, over a period, has superannuated most of its servants.  When the system of superannuation is becoming more general and when it is likely that for the future the case where superannuation does not apply will be the exception rather than the rule, I think the members of the staff are entitled to be superannuated and to have their case considered.  Certainly, the matter should be looked into before a final decision is taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to the Minister that the main obstacle in grappling with tuberculosis is the fact that we have long lists in each county of patients awaiting treatment.  The Minister may reply that three new regional sanatoria to take the overflow from the counties are being erected but he tells us that the first that will be ready is Galway, which will be ready in three years' time.  I am afraid that even then the increased accommodation in the regional sanatoria will not meet the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain causes that operate to keep tuberculosis a main problem in this country.  One of them is malnutrition coupled with bad housing.  There is a great deal of talk about slums in towns and cities.  Very seldom one hears any reference to what I would describe as rural slums.  If the Minister wishes to tackle the problem he should take up with his colleague, the <Col N="910" /> Minister for Local Government, the question of providing larger grants and loans for the erection of dwelling houses in rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree but I am suggesting that bad housing is responsible for the spread of tuberculosis.  The Minister for Health is not responsible for housing but I do not think I am over-stepping the rules of debate when I ask him to take up with his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, the question of providing improved houses in rural areas and in towns and cities.  There is no use in the Minister for Health trying to eradicate that particular disease while the Minister in charge of some other Department has the key to the situation.  It is the duty of the Minister for Health to see that the other Minister helps him in that particular matter.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave the Minister for Agriculture a notice to-day that on the adjournment I would ask him the following question:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If he would be prepared to extend the repayment period of interest-free loans to farmers from four years to eight years and to increase the available maximum loan from five times the valuation to ten times that figure.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last few weeks I have received many complaints not only from my own county but from several counties in connection with this interest-free loan to farmers.  At first sight it would appear to be splendid help for those who met with serious losses owing to the bad harvest, to the poor quality of the hay fodder, due to the bad harvest, and also because of the general shortage of supplies of stock food on farmsteads consequent on the <Col N="911" /> severe winter conditions we experienced. Now that the loan is about to be put into operation, we find that it does not work out as satisfactorily as we had expected.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that, in the case of small farmers with valuations up to £15 and £20, the loan is inadequate.  The amount available will be five times the poor law valuation of an applicant's holding.  We all know that we have a vast number of farmers with valuations of £5 and £6. In my county we have over 23,000 with valuations under £10.  If we take the whole of the western seaboard from Donegal to Kerry, you will find there mostly small farmers.  They represent the class that will need to take advantage of the loan.  They are faced with this difficulty that the loan available is altogether insufficient for them.  It will not afford them any real help. Take the case of a small farmer with a £5 valuation.  He may have lost two or three cows which would each be value for £30, or take the case of a non-creamery district where there is a farmer, say, with a holding of a £5 valuation.  He may have lost three or four yearlings, or one and a half year old cattle.  They would each be worth anything from £10 to £14.  The loan available to such men is £25.  It would be very small help for the man with the £5 valuation.  It would be absolutely inadequate to meet his situation.</P>
    <P>The loan is intended to give farmers who have met with serious losses a chance not only of making a fresh start but of being able to repay the loan.  In my opinion, it will not put them in that position, because the amount of the loan is too small.  I think that if the Minister were to agree to double the amount of the loan that would be made available it would not impose any hardship on the Agricultural Credit Corporation, which is the body that is to loan the money. If the amount were doubled it would be of more help to those who will need to make application for it.  I am also asking that the period of repayment be increased from four years to eight years.  I think that is not an unreasonable demand, and I am sure the <Col N="912" /> Minister will agree to it.  If the figure is doubled for the farmer with the £5 valuation holding, he will be able to apply for a loan of £100.  If he had to repay that in four years, with a payment of £25, I do not think he would be able to do it.  A man might make a superhuman effort to do that as well as to meet his other commitments relating to the cost of running his house, the payment of rent and other things, but I really do not think he would be able to do it in four years.  I am afraid that to ask him to do so would not only discourage him but disgust him.  In fact, he might not be able to make the last two or three payments at all.  If, instead, the repayments were spread over a longer period the position would be made easier for the borrower.  I am well aware, of course, that this is an interest-free loan, to be repaid over a period of four years.  I do not want to deny that it is a generous effort, but, at the same time, I want to put it to the Minister that, in my opinion, it is going to prove unworkable in the case of small farmers, who are most in need of the loan.</P>
    <P>There is another point that I want to bring to the Minister's notice and that is the question of security.  I would ask him to give very careful consideration to this.  I have received complaints from farmers who are anxious to avail of the loan to the effect that they cannot easily get security.  Many of them are of the opinion that their own holdings ought to be security enough for the loan.  If a man's holding is not security for five or ten times the valuation of it, well then it is worth nothing at all.  I know that in some of the backward areas&mdash; in the mountainous areas&mdash;such as Connemara and parts of the County Wicklow that when farmers there who need the loan went to their friends and relations to ask them to go as security, they found that the people on whom they were relying as security were themselves applicants for the loan, and, therefore, would not be accepted as security for others.  I would ask the Minister to go into that question and see whether or not he cannot ease that particular situation.  I would also <Col N="913" /> strongly impress on him the desirability of extending the repayment period to eight years.  Perhaps the Minister may have very sound reasons for not extending it to eight years, but I would ask him at least to consider extending it beyond four years so as to come to the rescue of the people for whom I think the loan is primarily intended, the small farmers who are in many cases living from hand to mouth and to whom the losses during the late winter and spring proved disastrous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to this matter on the Minister's Estimate, but he made no reference to it whatever in his reply.  I am glad, therefore, that Deputy Blowick has given us an opportunity of discussing it again to-night.  I am aware that Deputy Mongan made representations to the Minister on the question of the short period for repayment and the matter of the valuation, as in some cases the valuations are very low.  As a matter of fact, some farmers had stock out of proportion to their valuation, especially people with sheep who had access to mountain grazing, in whose cases the valuation basis does not meet the needs.  I am informed that it is not a hard and fast rule; that is is flexible in its application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want, however, to put another aspect of the problem to the Minister. I feel that these people who have suffered very serious losses will have to buy at peak prices when they go to buy stock.  If there is any depreciation in prices in the next three or four years, they will find it almost impossible to meet their commitments, notwithstanding the fact that they have not to meet any interest charges.  I feel that part of this ought to be made by way of a rehabilitation grant; that whatever advances are made, the recipients should not be asked to repay the full amount.  I am almost certain that it will throw a burden of responsibility on a number of people which they will find it impossible to meet, particularly at this very dangerous period.  We know that prices have reached a very high level and, if they are provided with capital now and go into the market to buy stock, they will be buying it at an abnormally high <Col N="914" /> level of prices.  As a matter of fact, the stock may not show any profit over a period.</P>
    <P>I directed the Minister's attention before to what they are doing in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, where they have provided grants for this purpose. It is true that the National Farmers' Union put up funds by voluntary subscription and that the State provided £ for £ for whatever money was put up.  Therefore, so far as the individual is concerned, whatever losses were incurred by him were met to a substantial extent by a grant provided in that way.  Even if the State is asked to provide a grant of that sort, it will be really a good investment from the national point of view and it will eventually pay dividends.  If a man occupying land is hampered by charges that he is unable to meet, if he is not able to get the return that he ought to get from production, if the production is not there&mdash;and it will not be there&mdash; not only should the Minister meet the problem raised by Deputy Blowick as to extending the period of repayment and increasing the valuation basis from five times to ten times, but I think part of it should be treated as a rehabilitation grant; that the Minister might consider not insisting upon the full amount having to be repaid; that the amount ought to be abated by 25 per cent. anyway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This scheme was introduced to meet a very extraordinary and exceptional situation and it will not be any reflection on the Minister or the Department if it is found necessary to amend or improve it in any way.  I questioned at the time whether it went far enough to meet the needs of those who were severely affected. Representing County Wicklow, I think I can say that that county suffered perhaps more severely than any other county.  I know there have been enormous losses among farmers, not only in regard to sheep, but also in regard to cattle.  There was an extraordinary death rate amongst cattle, as if an epidemic had swept them away.  I think it is necessary to make a distinction between the types of people who suffered losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very good scheme for the <Col N="915" /> well-to-do farmer, the prosperous and extensive farmer, who lost a certain amount of stock.  If he wishes, he is enabled to replace that stock and he is getting a loan free of interest, even though he may have some capital of his own.  But take, for example, the mountain farmer who lost his entire stock of sheep and, perhaps, some cattle as well.  That man has lost his entire source of income for the years to come.  In the case of sheep, he has lost not only the sheep, but the lambs and the wool, so that the source of his income is gone and he is left almost completely destitute.  That man's case is entirely different from that of the more prosperous farmer who might have lost a certain amount of stock but who can perhaps survive his losses. There might be a distinction made between these two types of cases.  The man who has lost his entire means of livelihood should be given some definite grant to help him.  In the case of the other man, a loan might be sufficient. The extension asked for by Deputy Blowick is, I think, absolutely necessary, particularly for the poorer type of farmer.  It would, I think, be impossible for that type of farmer to repay the loan within four years.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department must have learned a lot during the past one or two months in the course of their investigation into this question. It would be interesting if the Minister could give some estimate of the losses that have been brought to his notice as a result of this scheme.  It would be interesting if he would give us, from the reports received from his inspectors, some idea of the counties or districts which have suffered most severely.  This is a matter of vital national importance.  The people affected are important producers and it is absolutely essential that, not only should the scheme be beneficial, but that it should be workable, so that the people whom it is intended to benefit will not find themselves worse off in the course of a year or two.  If the period is extended, it will benefit a large number of these people.</P>

      <P>Deputy Blowick opened this discussion <Col N="916" /> on the note that he had received complaints from people&mdash;I suppose farmers &mdash;in his district, and perhaps outside it, because of the unsatisfactory conditions attaching to this scheme.  Deputy Blowick may have received these complaints.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that he may have received these complaints, but my Department has received very few of them.  It may be that farmers would never think of writing to me as an individual, but I am a Deputy, too, representing a certain constituency in which losses were sustained, and, as a Deputy, apart altogether from the fact that I am the Minister in charge of this Department, farmers do write to me off and on, telling me exactly how they feel about certain things, and, apart from their telling me how they feel, I have a fair idea of their views because I meet them and attend their fairs when I have time.  I discuss various matters with them, and&mdash;I say it in no boasting way&mdash;I know that farmers feel that this is a good scheme. The farmers admit that it is a generous scheme.  The farmers who have suffered losses and who are taking advantage of it tell me that it is a good, generous scheme, and, while one will always gets complaints, I can only say, while not disputing the fact that Deputy Blowick or other Deputies may have got complaints, that, as a Minister and as a Deputy, I could count on the fingers of one hand, and have some fingers left over, all the complaints I have received.  It is true that I got a resolution from the County Committee of Agriculture in County Kerry and another from the committee in County Clare, one asking me to extend the two year period to five years and the other asking me to extend it to six years.  The suggestion was also made by one of these committees that I should increase the limit of five times the valuation.  That is not a limit, and I have announced in this House that it is not a limit.</P>

      <P>I have announced as best I can in speaking in this House that I have discretionary power and that I have given that figure as a general guide, but, in cases where the valuation is small and where the losses have been severe, I can depart from that, have departed from that and will depart from that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows how it is with the Press.  I have no control over the Press.  The Press will take note of things as it pleases them and as it suits their business.  Sometimes they will not take note of things and sometimes, without doing so, they will write a leading article without telling the public what that leading article is about, and so on.  These are methods available to the Press and I cannot dispute their right to use them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephHallide" hpid="Mr. Halliden Mr. Halliden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>In case the Press do not take note of it, would the Minister issue an advertisement to that effect, because the public are quite unaware of it?  It is very important and very desirable and I appreciate it highly, but the public generally do not know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think an advertisement will be necessary.  I am nearly sure that I made in this House a statement that I would not regard myself as being bound by the five times the amount of the valuation, where the circumstances, as shown to me in the report of my inspector, warrant me in departing from it.  I gave that as a general guide.  Deputy Blowick talks about the man with the £10 valuation having lost a number of cows.  We all know what a £10 valuation is and we know what a man can feed in the way of cows on a holding of £10 valuation. We know that, unless a man has conacre and is a very active and industrious man who extends his activities outside his holding of £10 valuation, if he carries three cows on that holding, he will be doing extra well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="918" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In creamery districts, they carry many more than three cows on a £10 valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder.  They will not do it, unless, as I say, they take conacre. However, that is a matter about which we will not dispute.  All I can say is that if that man lost two cows, it would represent a heavy loss, but five times ten are 50, and, dear as cattle have become, he will buy two cows for about £50.</P>
      <P>What, then, is our experience?  We have received under this scheme roughly 4,000 applications, and in some cases loans have been given&mdash;700 or 800 have been paid and 700 or 800 more approved for payment.  A very large number are ready to go forward to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  It is we who inspect, approve and agree with the application and it is the Agricultural Credit Corporation which lends the money.  We carry the risk, and I can assure the House that I have given instructions that they are to get on with these as quickly as possible. That has been done, and a very large proportion of these borrowers have not asked for five times the valuation.</P>

      <P>As the solicitor said when the daughter sought to prompt her mother in the witness box: &ldquo;Let her alone; she can paddle her own canoe&rdquo;, so it is with me.  I admit that assistance is all right, but I will paddle my own canoe in this matter. I have given the House the number of applications I have got, the number paid and the number in course of <Col N="919" /> payment, and I have said that, in the great proportion of cases, the applicants have asked for less than they could have got, according to the terms of the scheme.  Where they asked for more and where it was shown that, because of the special circumstances, they were entitled to extra consideration, they have got more, and, from whatever balance is left, will get more.</P>
      <P>On the matter of time, I have had no complaint and whether I had or not would not make any difference, because I feel that, in spite of what Deputy Hughes has stated and the case made by other Deputies, farmers are satisfied with this scheme.</P>

      <P>And I feel that they are satisfied with the promptness with which it was made available to them&mdash; no shilly-shallying about it, a straightforward application form which could be filled in by a child, a form in respect of which they understand that they have to get some sort of sureties, to which they raise no objection, because, as reasonable men, they know that it is customary to give sureties.  They find little difficulty in that matter and I think I have received only two letters stating that applicants had difficulty in getting sureties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important matter and perhaps I might be allowed to finish what I have to say.  With regard to this matter of the four years' period being too long, it may be too long or too short.  How do we know? How do we know what the circumstances of a man who gets a loan will be in four years' time?  He might win the Sweep.  Deputy Blowick apparently is able to assess the time it will take a man to get on his feet to such an extent as will enable him to pay back the loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>They will not all win the Sweep.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>When you start off by saying to a man: &ldquo;Here is £50, £60 or £100 for four years, free of interest, and you need not give a shilling back <Col N="920" /> for a year and a half in order to get into your stride,&rdquo; I can give this assurance that none of these people will be hanged by the neck, even if they do not make good at the end of the period. I am quite positive, however, having regard to the history of previous loans, that, as I said before, while farmers may be slow to pay in certain circumstances, practically every shilling of this money will be recovered.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes is a man whom I regard as a sensible man&mdash;he knows men and things&mdash;but I do not understand how Deputy Hughes can suggest that one could devise a means by which one could justly and equitably write off any portion of this amount and regard it as a sort of present, free, gratis and for nothing, to those who have suffered losses.  There will be hundreds of farmers who have suffered losses who will not apply for this money, who will feel themselves able to make whatever replacements are necessary.  Who is to say what organisation could be set up to go from farm-house to farm-house to determine the losses and apportion any sum of money one could name?  The thing is not a practical suggestion.</P>

      <P>It is really not expected by the farmers, and you are going far ahead of them and of what they are thinking in that suggestion.  Instead of interpreting what is in their minds, I have interpreted what they expect under this scheme, and, as I say, the facilities were given to them in a way which made them feel that here was something they understood, something devised by people who understand them.  You may try to decry as you like the merits of the scheme, but those for whose benefit it was devised and intended have approved of it, and, if they have any complaints to make of a serious nature, I would surely have heard of them just as any other Deputy.</P>
