      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state if the question of the partition of the country was reviewed and discussed at the recent London talks between members of the Irish and British Governments; and if he will make a statement on this matter, and as to the possibility of the British withdrawing from the Six Counties of Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussions which are at present taking place with the British Government are concerned directly with matters of trade and finance only.  Partition, however, is, necessarily, implicit in every question of importance that may at any time be under discussion between the two Governments.</P>
      <P>Partition is now the sole remaining obstacle to friendly relations with Britain, but that obstacle is so fundamental that, so long as it remains, the measure of co-operation and mutual help which is desirable in the interests of the peoples of both islands will not be attainable.  That is a fact which must be clear to everybody.  I cannot make any more detailed statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not consider that, since the talks are in progress, this would be a very good opportunity for raising this question of great national importance with the British Government?  He should not allow this opportunity to pass without doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made inquiries into a number of cases of this kind and have found no evidence for the suggestion that any applicants who desired to travel to Great Britain genuinely for holiday purposes have been refused visas by the British Permit Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that, since there are no restrictions on English people coming here to spend their holidays, it is most unfair for the British authorities to impose restrictions on Irish citizens who desire to spend their holidays in England?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not, of course, correct in implying that I agreed on the 24th June last to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to cover a grant to the Empire Parliamentary Association.  I undertook on that occasion to examine a certain suggestion in the matter put forward by him.  I have done so, and regret that, in all the circumstances, I do not feel that I would be justified in acting in accordance with that suggestion.</P>

When he is blathering about his desire for better understanding and common civility between this country and Great Britain, this Parliament and other democratic <Col N="222" /> Parliaments, will he consider the desirability of providing the means of facilitating meetings and discussions between the members of these Parliaments, as such is likely to do far more for the matters these institutions hold dear than high-falutin speeches by him here, in London, in Paris or anywhere else?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Twenty-two branch lines have been temporarily closed by Córas Iompair Éireann in the present year. Of these, three have been reopened for all traffic and seven for limited services, leaving 12 still closed.  The company have acted under the provisions of Emergency Powers (Córas Iompair Éireann) (Reduction of Railway Services) Order, 1944, as continued in force by the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946.</P>
      <P>Two hundred and twenty-one members of the staff have been displaced. Alternative employment has been found for 183; 16 were retired on pension or resigned voluntarily on grounds of illhealth. Twenty-two with less than three years' service were paid off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply does the Minister also recognise the acute hardship which the people in the Westport-Achill area are suffering because no public transport is available notwithstanding the fact that when that branch line was taken up they were promised transport equally good as that which was provided by the Great Western Railway?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Eighteen main line stations have been closed by Córas Iompair Éireann during 1947.  One station has been reopened for all traffic and ten for certain traffic. Twenty-seven employees have been displaced.  I am informed that alternative employment has been found for 19, four were retired on pension and four were paid off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

This appointment ceased when the Transport Act, 1944, came into operation on the 1st January, 1945.</P>
      <P>The functions of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to Córas Iompair Éireann are set out in the Transport Act, 1944.  Under that Act I have no function in regard to remuneration of the chairman or any member of the board, other than that contained in sub-section (10) of Section 39, which provides that if the Minister for Industry and Commerce is of opinion that the remuneration of the chairman is insufficient he may, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, direct that such remuneration shall be increased.  I have not taken any action under this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he was consulted by Córas Iompair Éireann with reference to the handing over by them of the management of the railway hotels, owned by them, to a foreign concern; whether he approved of the company's action in the matter; if not, what steps he has taken to prevent the carrying out of their decision; and whether he will now consider handing over the management of the railway hotels to the Irish Tourist Board, on the assumption that Córas <Col N="225" /> Iompair Éireann is incapable of running them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no statutory function in the management of Córas Iompair Éireann hotels.  The company advised me of their intention to negotiate with an outside firm for the management of their hotel and restaurant system for a limited period.  It was stated that the company have a special problem during the next few years in that considerable modernisation and alteration of kitchens and other sections of their hotels is necessary. They considered it would be in the best interests of the company to employ, for a couple of years, a firm who have the services of a number of expert advisers in each specialised field of hotel management.  I understand that this firm will be responsible to the board in the same manner as any of the individual employees of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 17, 20 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>Owing to the abnormal weather conditions which prevailed during last winter and spring the wheat acreage sown in this country showed a considerable reduction as compared with previous years.  Substantial imports will, therefore, be necessary to maintain the distribution of flour and bread at the present level.  It is not yet possible, however, to determine, with any degree of accuracy, the actual volume of imports which will be needed up to the harvest of 1948, as that will depend on the quantities of wheat delivered to the flour mills from the crop recently harvested.  A reliable estimate cannot yet be made of the average yield from that crop, but indications so far are that yields are well below average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, as Deputies are aware, a serious world shortage of cereals this year and in order to secure equitable distribution of the available world export surplus of grain, allocation is being continued by the International Emergency Food Council.  The council determines allocations on a quarterly basis, and this means that importing countries can have no assurance covering the long term supply position.  The allocations made so far cover the period up to the end of December, and those <Col N="231" /> for the January-March quarter, 1948, will not be determined until later in the present month.</P>
    <P>Because of the world scarcity of cereals and the uncertainty as regards imports, I am unable to give precise answers to a number of the points raised, but it will be clear to Deputies that the most practical contribution we can make towards the easement of the very serious grain problem is to secure that every possible barrel of wheat from the home crop is made available for flour milling.</P>

An additional ¼d. per 4-lb. loaf is payable to bakers of batchbread who became liable for the payment of the bonus awarded in 1946, under Emergency Powers (No. 260) Order, 1943, and for the cost of the granting of an extra week's holidays to their employees provided I am satisfied after examination of representative accounts that the cost involved in these concessions could not reasonably be met by the industry.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, stocks of domestic fuel were completely exhausted by the end of last winter. The difficulties of increasing output in this season were increased by the late start in turf production and the unsuitable weather which prevailed up to July.  To some extent the good weather since early August has retrieved the position by enabling the turf that had been cut to be well saved, but nothing could entirely make up for the effects of the bad start, and as a result, the 1947 turf crop is substantially smaller than that of previous years, smaller even than the bad crop of 1946.  Firewood production was, however, encouraged so far as that was possible without infringing on the labour required for the more important work of producing turf.  In the outcome, present stocks of turf and firewood combined are somewhat less than turf stocks at this time last year, and it is necessary to utilise a part of the U.S.A. coal supplies to fill the ration for the current period in the non-turf area.  The prospect for the coming <Col N="234" /> winter in the non-turf areas is, therefore, that by the controlled distribution of coal, turf and firewood it should be possible to avoid the severe hardships which developed in last winter and early spring.</P>
      <P>It is intended to reserve the limited supplies of turf and firewood for household use.  Other fuel users in the non-turf areas who failed to take the advice given them so strongly early in the year to produce turf for themselves cannot depend on getting supplies of turf or firewood from the national pool. So far as supplies permit they will be allowed to purchase coal under permit, but they must pay the full economic price of such coal and will not benefit by the subsidy which the Government has decided to pay in the case of domestic fuel.</P>
      <P>The turf areas will have to rely on turf; the quantity of coal which we have in stock or in sight will not permit of any general issue of coal for domestic purposes in these areas.  The most that can be done is to provide limited quantities of coal to certain institutions and industrial concerns in order to relieve the strain on the reduced turf supplies.</P>
      <P>In regard to the needs of industry, it will be possible to continue to provide coal for some time to come on a basis not less favourable than the present.  Fortunately it has been found possible to make better provision for gas and electricity production and the public will continue to reap the benefit in the form of less stringent restrictions than those which operated last winter.</P>
      <P>So far as the second part of the Deputy's question is concerned, the quantity of turf which was transported to the non-turf areas in the period from the 1st July to the end of September was approximately 250,000 tons.</P>

      <P>I have received a resolution passed by the Cork County Council on the 4th September, asking that a grant be made available from the road fund for the improvement of the main road Castletownbere to Dursey Sound.  At the same meeting, however, the county council indicated that they were not prepared, unless my Department met the full cost, to carry out a road survey which is an essential preliminary to this and all other improvement schemes on main roads.  The county council at their meeting had before them an intimation from my Department that grants from the road fund for the improvement <Col N="245" /> of roads would not be made available unless and until the improvement schemes had been prepared to a plan based on the proposed road survey. Consideration of the council's resolution must therefore be postponed until the necessary arrangements for carrying out the road survey are made.</P>

      <P>The amount of the increase <Col N="249" /> quoted in the question is a minimum figure.

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will indicate the classes of persons, in various areas, who are now entitled to (a) food vouchers, and (b) fuel vouchers, and the weekly value of these vouchers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is long and somewhat complicated and I propose with your permission, a Chinn Comhairle, to circulate it with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the answer:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Food vouchers, which entitle the holders to procure, free of cost, either food to a specified monetary value, or a specified quantity of food, are granted, at the discretion of the public assistance authority, to persons in receipt of home assistance.  The foods generally specified are milk, bread and butter and the exchange value of a voucher varies as between one public assistance district and another.</P>
      <P>A blind person in receipt of an allowance under the Dublin or Cork County Borough Blind Welfare Schemes may receive a food voucher to the value of 4/- per week.</P>
      <P>Persons of the following categories, who reside in a county borough, borough or urban district in the non-turf area, are granted vouchers which entitle them to obtain, during the summer period, half a cwt. of fuel and during the winter period one cwt. of fuel, per week per household:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Persons in receipt of home assistance who do not come within the categories (2) to (4) below.</P>
      <P>(2)  Persons in receipt of unemployment assistance who have dependents.</P>
      <P>(3)  Persons in receipt of old age pensions (including blind persons in receipt of pensions under Section 6 of the Old Age Pensions Act, 1932).</P>
      <P>(4)  Persons in receipt of widows' and orphans' pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons of low income, who do not belong to any of the categories mentioned, but who are deemed by the local authority to be in need of assistance to obtain fuel may be given vouchers for <Col N="251" /> one cwt. of fuel per week per household during the winter period only.</P>
    <P>With the exception of persons in category (1) above, who receive the fuel free at the expense of the public assistance authority, recipients of vouchers are required to contribute towards the cost of the fuel.  Contributions vary, during the winter period, from 6d. to 2/- per cwt. depending on the category to which recipient belongs.  During the summer period the contribution required is a flat rate equivalent, approximately, to two-thirds of the cost of the fuel in the particular district.</P>
    <P>In the County Borough of Limerick and the Borough of Galway, which are not in the non-turf area voluntary agencies, during the winter period, operate fuel schemes on somewhat similar lines to winter schemes of local authorities in the non-turf area.  In Limerick, the contribution required from recipients other than those in category (1) above (who receive the fuel free) is a flat rate of 1/- per cwt.  In Galway no contribution is required from the recipients.  The schemes operated by these voluntary agencies receive assistance from public funds.</P>
    <P>In the County Borough of Cork blind persons under 30 years of age, who are in receipt of weekly allowances under the Cork County Borough Blind Welfare Scheme, also receive fuel on the same terms and conditions as do persons in receipt of pensions under Section 6 of the Old Age Pensions Act, 1932.</P>
    <P>It is not practicable in the circumstances to assign a definite weekly value to food or fuel vouchers.</P>

      <P>Since the institution of exchange control in Britain in September, 1939, the British authorities have made available to us, against payment in sterling, the foreign exchange necessary to meet payments for such goods and services supplied from outside the sterling area as the Irish authorities regarded as essential requirements.  This arrangement has applied irrespective of whether the sterling so converted into foreign exchange was derived from current earnings or accumulated balances. The extent to which such conversion can take place in future has been the subject of discussion at the recent Sterling Area Conference in London, and the Government is at present considering the report of its representatives at the conference.  I am not, at the moment, in a position to make any further statement on the matter.</P>

    <P>The total value of our purchases outside the sterling area during the first nine months of the present year is not yet known, but the value of such <Col N="255" /> purchases for the first eight months is approximately £39,800,000.</P>
    <P>The total amount of our income from the dollar area for the first nine months of the present year is estimated at $24,000,000, representing mainly emigrants' remittances and tourists' expenditure; not more than $1,000,000 can be attributed to exports from this country.</P>

      <P>No modification of the pensions code is necessary in the case of officers who were established as a result of the examination referred to in the Deputy's question, as, subject to the provisions of the Superannuation Acts, they are eligible for pensions on retirement.  It is not proposed, as regards officers who were not granted establishment, that is, pensionable status, on ground of age at the date of appointment from the examination, to depart from the normal practice of retention in an unestablished capacity. The position of such officers was made clear in the conditions of service issued in connection with the examination.</P>

The bonus is payable in cases where the Minister is satisfied that Irish is the language of the child's home and that the child, in consequence, speaks Irish naturally and fluently, and payment is conditional on regular attendance by the pupil at school throughout the school-year.</P>
      <P>The recent examination mentioned by the Deputy was that in respect of the 1945-46 school-year.  In the previous year, 1944-45, application for the bonus was made by 12 parents in respect of 20 children attending Glengarriff National School, and the bonus was paid to six of these parents in respect of 12 children.</P>
      <P>In the 1945-46 school-year applications were received from 7 parents in respect of 13 children.  The bonus was granted to two of these parents in respect of five children.  Of the five applications concerning eight children in respect of whom the bonus was not granted, the bonus had also been refused in the case of two households (two children) in 1944-45.  In the other three cases (6 children) the bonus had been paid to the parents in 1944-45.  As a result of investigations made in connection with the 1945-46 school-year, I was not satisfied, in the case of the eight children in respect of whom the bonus was refused, that Irish was the language of the homes in that school-year.</P>

      <P>Mr. John Casserly, Drumcunney, Cloone, Mohill, County Leitrim, made application under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934, and the Referee found that he is not a person to whom the Act applies. Under the terms of sub-section (3) of Section 2 of the Act of 1945, the Referee is not required to summon an applicant, and, in any event, no useful purpose could have been served by his summoning the applicant in this case to appear before him, as the service claimed, even if established, was not sufficient to warrant the grant of a service certificate.</P>

      <P>The relief of congestion in County Mayo and elsewhere in the congested districts depends on the extent to which land can be made available for purposes of enlargement and rearrangement both by the acquisition or resumption of lands within these districts and the transfer of migrants from these districts to such lands elsewhere as can be devoted to that purpose.  The allocation of lands in hands is proceeding as fast as possible and during the last financial year an area of some 3,000 acres was allotted in County Mayo.  As a result of the return of staff, operations have been reopened for the acquisition of land in the scheduled congested districts and all suitable land which is not properly worked and does not provide good employment in those counties will be considered for acquisition as expeditiously as possible.  It is the intention also to undertake fresh acquisitions in the Midlands as soon as circumstances permit and to continue the policy of arranging transfers of migrants from congested areas whenever and wherever this is found possible after local needs have been met.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of land division for the relief of congestion, although never wholly suspended was, through force of circumstances, very considerably curtailed during the period of the emergency and as circumstances permit it will again be expanded. Already, as a result of the return of some of the staff, acquisition proceedings have been resumed in the scheduled congested districts but I am unable to say when it may be possible to resume proceedings in the other counties.  Immediate difficulties are created by the shortage of building materials, the lack of sufficient trained staff and the prevailing high prices of land and, as for the outlook in general, I have frequently explained that, with the available reserve of suitable land drying up, it cannot be expected that land division will be possible in the future at anything approaching the rate to which we were accustomed in pre-war years.  The answer to the third part of the Deputy's question is in the negative.  As regards private sales of land, the Land Commission have no power to interfere with most of the transactions which the Deputy seems to have in mind.  Such sales, nevertheless, do not remove the land in question from the scope of possible future action by the Land Commission in exercise of their compulsory powers under the Land Acts for the acquisition of land for division.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with this particular Bill I would like to make an open confession at the start.  Some months ago when the Bill was first circulated I read it with much interest and with very close attention, but I had not time to read it since.  I intended to read it to-day but I had not time.  I am giving these few words of explanation so that if my memory is faulty any misrepresentation or faulty deductions on the details of the Bill may be attributed to faulty memory rather than a design to misinterpret any section.</P>
      <P>Briefly this is a Bill to replace for the future the existing pension Act dealing with Local Government officials.  The existing pension Act entitles officials to one-sixtieth of a year's pay for each year's service, but it carries with it no bonus or gratuity on death or retirement, and the pension is reckoned on the average salary for three years previous to retirement; there is no contribution under this scheme.  This Bill allows for a smaller pension, one-eightieth of a year's pay for each year served.  The maximum pension under this Bill is one half the salary as against two-thirds under the other, and for new officers the contribution is 5 per cent. of their pay under this Bill as against no contribution under the last.  But against this, this Bill carries a bonus of one-thirtieth of a year's pay for each year's service, a bonus to be paid on death or retirement. Existing officers are being treated very very fairly and very generously under this particular Bill as they are given the option of remaining on under the old Bill or, by making application in writing, of coming under the new Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But there is one very big defect in this Bill and I think it is a defect for which there does not occur to me to be any justification or reasonable defence.  That is that this Bill carries on an old-time precedent that has at least application to the existing officers, that their pension is only reckoned on continuous service rather <Col N="280" /> than on their aggregate or cumulative service.  I and colleagues of mine and others have repeatedly put to the Minister, to legal men and to higher officials to explain what is the reason why a person is not pensioned on the amount or the number of years' service which he has given to the State rather than on the number of years of continuous service.  I have never got any reply but one, namely, that this is the precedent laid down in the 1864 or the 1884 Act and carried into subsequent legislation.  I do not see any other explanation or justification.  Surely the idea of a pension is for the years of service rendered to the State or to the organisation and pension should be reckoned on the number of years' service given.  In this particular Bill before us for future entrants you are brushing aside completely this precedent. You are giving a pension based on years of service but for other existing officials the old word &ldquo;continuous&rdquo; is carried on, instead of aggregate or cumulative service.  Let us take the case of two colleagues in the same office.  One of them has served the local authority for 30 years and gets a pension of 30/60ths or 30/80ths, dependent on the Act under which he elects to take his pension.  The other officer has served the same local authority in the same capacity for 20 years but, at the end of 15 years, he left that employment for a month and came back.  He is pensionable on the basis of 15 years' service.  The other officer is pensionable on the basis of 30 years' service although the service rendered by each of them to the same authority was similar in type and in quality.</P>
    <P>I should be interested to hear the justification for the continuance of that particular wrong.  Quite evidently, it is regarded as a wrong.  You are departing from that in the case of the registered officer and servant of the future.  They will get their pensionable service carried on from one local authority to another.  It appears to me that we are just following precedent in respect of an indefensible and unjust position.</P>
    <P>The question is of more importance in this State than, I think, in any other country inasmuch as this State is <Col N="281" /> wedded to the system of appointment by the machinery of the Local Appointments Commission.  The Local Appointments Commission aim at getting the most highly qualified type of officer or servant for any vacancy which they are called upon to fill.  Heretofore, people got into various offices on what I might call a basic qualification.  With the initiation of the Appointments Commission machinery, an ambitious young man or woman, anxious to secure advancement and a better type of position, clearly understood that the only way to secure appointment was by obtaining the highest possible qualifications. In the case of many people down the country, particularly, their only chance of securing those higher qualifications was to save a little money, resign, come up to one of the university or teaching centres, take a post-graduate course and, with the higher qualifications thus obtained, go back into the public service.  That is exactly the type of officer or servant who should be encouraged by a Government Department.  That officer or servant sacrificed the number of years' service he had up to that date for pensionable purposes.  On the day he returned to employment, he ranked as one without an hour's service for pensionable purposes.  Section 18 (4) makes that point particularly clear. The term &ldquo;continuous service&rdquo; is used there.  Under Section 35 (3) a person is pensionable according to the amount of pensionable service he enjoys under Part IV of the Local Officers Pension Act.  Part IV of that Act lays down that a pension can be reckoned only on the basis of continuous service.</P>
    <P>I submit that particular point to the Minister as a fair and reasonable one. I submit it with a certain amount of confidence that it will get fair and reasonable consideration.  I should rather have an apparent injustice, such as this, rectified from the Government Front Bench than by an amendment from any other corner of the House.  I think that the intention in this Bill is to improve the pension code of the country, to put it on a more reasonable basis, to make it watertight and to provide a bonus or gratuity for the person retiring so as to meet the expense of a possible change of abode, while including in the pension <Col N="282" /> scheme the workers as well as the officers.  All that is sound and worthy of commendation but it would be unfortunate if the injustices of an old-time pension code, enacted in the British House of Commons 60 or 70 years ago, were to be carried into the future pension scheme of this State.  I do not think that any Deputy or Minister would contest the point that a pension is earned by the years of service given to a particular authority and that it should not matter one fig whether those years of service were temporarily interrupted or not.</P>
    <P>There is another point which, I think, is worthy of attention.  The existing officials get the option of remaining under the old pension scheme or coming under this scheme.  Everybody may have a different point of view.  I think that this scheme is more attractive than the old one.  It all depends on how long a person hopes to live after he is pensioned. If he is optimistic and says: &ldquo;I am going to retire at 65 and live to 85&rdquo;, it would be more profitable to remain under the old scheme and take 1/60th of a year's pay for each year of service than to take 1/80th and a lump sum.  If a person be a pessimist and looks forward to a short life and a gay one, then I think it is better business to accept the lump sum and a smaller pension.  Be that as it may, this Bill leaves it open to the bulk of the existing officers either to remain under the old scheme or come under this scheme.  Officers who have reached the age of 60 years are, however, excepted from that option.  I do not quite see the justification for denying the option to officers or servants who have reached 60 years.  There can always be the old argument based on those immediately on one side or the other side of the line.</P>
    <P>Compare the case of the person who is 59 years and 11 months with that of the person who is 60 years and one month.  I do not see any great point in denying the benefit of the option to a small minority of officials who may be past 60 years of age on the date this Bill becomes law.  I do not see that public funds are going to be committed to any greater sum because, as against the option of the person taking the <Col N="283" /> gratuity, he takes a much smaller pension&mdash;a pension based on 1/80th as against a pension based on 1/60th.  I do not see and I have not learned from the Minister what justification there is for paragraph (b) of Section 35, that is, that if a person has passed 60 years of age he cannot enjoy the benefit of having an option as between one Act and the next.  That is a point that I would certainly urge the Minister to look into and to consider before the next stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is one other point which I consider is of very great importance, particularly in this year.  A great number of officers, officials, servants, have been retired in the course of this year, having reached the age of 65.  Some of them retired even, we will say, as late as a week or a fortnight ago.  In addition to that all pay was altered last January.  It was increased 30 per cent., 40 per cent., 60 per cent.  The pension a person retiring to-day would receive is based on the average of his pay over the last three years.  The pension of a person retiring under this Bill is based on the pay he would be in receipt of on the date of retiral.  Seeing that, following the removal of the standstill Order and in view of the increased cost of living, it was found to be sound State policy to increase the salaries of officers and officials according to a graded scale&mdash;those on the smaller scale of salary getting the highest percentage increase&mdash;I think that, whether over 60 years of age and eligible to opt under this Bill or not, the pensions of at least those who retired since the scales of salary were raised should be based on the scale of salary on the date of retiral.</P>
    <P>I understand that those who retired within a month or two of the new rates of salary, basing their pension on the average of three previous years' income, got no benefit by way of pension through the increase of salary just secured before their resignation.  That particular point matters to a very considerable number of officials who have retired not only directly under the Minister's Department but also under the Department of his colleague, the Minister for Health.  I think, if consideration of that particular point is put <Col N="284" /> up to the Minister's colleague, he will find that the view is that the benefits at least of having their pension based on their present rates of pay rather than on that which prevailed two or three years back is a reasonable thing to urge on the Minister.  Again, on that point of denying benefits in the case of a person who is 60 years of age on the date of the passing of the Bill, I consider that if the full benefits of the new Bill were given to those who are past 60 years of age they would at least be given the benefits of retiring on a pension based on the scale of pay on the date of their retiral.</P>
    <P>With regard to the portion of the Bill that deals with established servants, I wish to state that I consider it to be a step in the right direction to endeavour to include them within the pensions scheme but I can see very great difficulties.  The work of a great number of these people is interrupted work.  They are a servant or an employee of a local authority for five months, seven months, or one year; for perhaps ten months in the next year, and so on.  The Bill lays down that on retiral, or on ceasing to be an employee, where they have not reached the pensionable grade of service, contributions made will be returned.  That means that a person who has been employed for ten months, say, then gets a return of his contribution.</P>
    <P>With the poor people there is always a very great demand for any pound that happens to be in their pockets. This means that their contributions are returned in a lump sum.  The contributions are distributed or spent.  Then, if they return perhaps a year or two years later to the local authority I take it they are either non-pensionable or they have to refund that portion of their contributions which had previously been restored to them.  That would be a financial impossibility in most such cases.  I would like to see the registered servant end of the pensions scheme working smoothly, simply, satisfactorily and efficiently, but I can see very great difficulties.  The main difficulties are the application of the contributory system of 5 per cent. in the case of workers.  I submit to the Minister that the game is not worth the candle, that in the servants' end of this <Col N="285" /> matter the wisest action would be to make them pensionable on the aggregate of their service and to drop the contributory end.  If it is to be collected at all the only satisfactory way of collecting from workers is to collect weekly.  I submit that the volume of accountancy and the amount of work in connection with the number of pennies to be secured weekly from the workers' contributions is scarcely worth the effort.  Then if these contributions have to be returned every time an employee ceases to be an employee it means increased work, increased worrying with regard to the accountancy and very little public gain.</P>
    <P>These points are, briefly, what I wanted to bring to the Minister's attention. On the whole, I think, the Bill is a very sound Bill.  The aims and objects of the Bill are entirely commendable. The perpetuation of that old blunder of 60 or 80 years ago to pension a person only on continuous service and to deny him a pension for years of service if there was a month's interruption in his service is, to my mind, unfair.  I cannot see any reason why the option to go under this Bill or remain under the present Act should be denied to officials who have passed 60 years of age on the date of the passing of the Bill. I do not see the justification for that particular thing.  Thirdly, I think the pension of any official or servant who resigned since the salaries were readjusted should be based on the salary at the date of retirement rather than on the average salary for three years back.  As I said, these are points that I am referring to the Minister with a certain degree of confidence that they will be seriously and sympathetically looked into.  I would prefer that adjustments of this kind should be made from the Ministerial bench rather than forced through the House by amendments from the Opposition benches.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, one is constrained to welcome a Bill which has for its purpose the extension of what is now recognised as a modern and humane principle of giving not only recognition to service but some security in old age to those who have served a particular employer, whether he be a <Col N="286" /> private or a public employer.  Because of that fact, the Bill is to be welcomed, not only by this Party but, I presume, by all Parties in the House.  At the same time, there are many details of it that will require more minute examination in Committee and to which it is idle to make reference at this stage. There are, however, certain general features of the Bill which call for comment, particularly, features which constitute many of the main principles in the Bill.  I want briefly to refer to them because unless the Minister gives further consideration to the matter in the meantime, it will be necessary to try to rectify them on the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>One feature of the Bill that strikes me as peculiar is the difference in the treatment the Bill proposes to give to officers and servants.  First, in so far as Part II is concerned, dealing with officers, it is laid down that that portion of the Bill will operate as from the date contained in an Order made by the Minister whereas Part III, under which provision will be made for the superannuation of servants, is left as at the discretion of a local authority.  I would be the last to suggest that the local authority must be dragooned, regardless of its views in the matter, by Ministerial order.  At the same time, from experience, I am very well aware that it is possible, and it has happened repeatedly, that because of the constitution of a local authority, their sympathy with their ordinary work people was very much less than their sympathy with their higher officials.  Therefore, while leaving it at the discretion of a local authority to decide whether or not the provisions of the Bill should be applied to their servants, where they decide not to give effect to Part III of the Bill, there should be some provision whereby an inquiry might be held into their decision so as to afford their servants and their representatives an opportunity of having the position examined in public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear that one of the factors operating in the Minister's mind in connection with the machinery bringing Part III into operation is the question of cost, but the service given by the servant or workman is just as valuable as that given by the officer <Col N="287" /> and is entitled to the same recognition. If there is to be a superannuation scheme for officers, which is denied to the ordinary worker of the same local authority, something more than a formal debate and the passing of a formal resolution by the local authority should be the means whereby this discrimination is considered and decided upon.</P>
    <P>There seems to be running through the Bill a tendency to deal somewhat differently with the officer and the servant. In the case of the officer whose employment is terminated for one reason or another and who has a minimum of ten years' service, additional years' service can be granted to that officer, whereas in the case of a servant having a minimum of ten years' service, whose employment is terminated, he receives no consideration unless he is retiring under the age limit of 65.  The question can be asked, if for reasons outside the control of either the officer or the servant his service is terminated, why should there be different treatment for the officer and the servant?  In both cases the award of pension is based on recognition of service and on the fact that some consideration should be given to the employee when he is leaving his employment and has to make a new start in life.  The difficulties facing the servant in such a position are not very different from those facing the officer and inasmuch as his income over a period of years has been much lower than that of the officer, he has not had the same opportunity of accumulating a reserve to meet such a contingency.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties in dealing with the general principles of the Bill is that possibly every Deputy has to consider the Bill in relation to his own particular area and the effect of the Bill will probably appear different in relation to existing provisions in the various areas.  In that connection, some of the provisions of the Bill are in glaring contrast to existing pension provisions, say, in the case of employees of the Dublin Corporation, and it seems that some consideration is necessary because of the anomalous effect of the provisions of the Bill.  While, in general, existing superannuation provisions in the Dublin Corporation would <Col N="288" /> appear on paper not to be as favourable from the point of view of the employees as those provided in the Bill, in actual practice, because of the approach by the corporation and by the Minister, in his supervisory capacity, the provision made by the Dublin Corporation does in fact appear to be more generous.  One of the particular difficulties we are faced with under the Bill is that in the Dublin Corporation all continuous and unbroken service, whether it be of a permanent or temporary character, counts for pension purposes whereas, under the Bill, it is provided, in the first place, that an employee shall have to wait for a period of three years before he can be appointed to the established staff, can only be appointed if there is a vacancy on that staff, and may have to wait for a period of seven or eight years before he is appointed and his service counts only from the date of that appointment. I submit that if we are going to condition his appointment to the established staff by the fact that there is a vacancy, when that vacancy does arise and the employee has given service over a number of years, he should be credited with that previous service and should not be penalised by virtue of the fact that he has had to wait for a vacancy to arise.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in the calculation of wages under the Bill it is proposed that only wages and definite emoluments will be taken into account whereas, up to the present, the practice has been to base the calculation of pension on wages, including overtime earned, sick pay, and other emoluments.  Again, there is a departure from existing practice which is not commendable.</P>
    <P>One particular feature that should receive further consideration is the principle of the contribution and the amount that is set down in the Bill, namely, 5 per cent.  It is quite clear that where there is already a free pension provided, that will create for at least a number of years the anomaly of different groups, one enjoying a free pension and the other paying a certain figure.  That is not the strongest objection; it is the actual amount that is required.  There are many cases in which private employers out of their <Col N="289" /> own source of income, their own business, provide a pension just as generous as that proposed in this Bill, at much less cost, if it is not provided free. The 5 per cent. that we now propose to charge under the Bill, in the case of a labourer in Dublin City, will involve him in the payment of anything from 5/- to 8/- a week.  That, I submit, is an excessive charge to make on the weekly income of any labourer.  To levy the same percentage on the wages of a road worker in the rural areas is even more objectionable.  I suggest to the Minister that he might give further consideration to reducing the percentage even if he must insist on the principle of contribution.</P>
    <P>Another feature in the Bill that somewhat surprises me, because it is a feature we often meet with in the case of private employers, is the proposition that where an employee has not served with diligence or fidelity it shall be permissive for the local authority to reduce his pension.  More important still, that reduction is mandatory to the extent of 50 per cent.  It seems to me that that is a highly objectionable provision, and for this reason, that if an employee has not given diligent and effective service then the time to call attention to that is when the failure on his part is supposed to have occurred.  That failure should not be allowed to lie over until the time comes when his pension is to be calculated, and then mulct him in his pension payment. That is the type of thing that we frequently meet with when we approach private employers&mdash;the suggestion that things have taken place in the past that must now be held against an employee even though there is no record of it and, therefore, no means of checking it.</P>
    <P>If that system is going to be operated under this Bill, and if it is going to be held by local authorities that an officer or servant has been guilty of a lack of diligence, there should be an actual record made of that at the time.  It should not be left in doubt to be recalled to mind some years later perhaps.  The matter should be investigated at once the person becomes involved.  That person <Col N="290" /> should be afforded an opportunity of defending himself against the charge. It is only when the charge is clearly proved that any record should be made of it.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that even though there may be charges preferred of lack of diligence and fidelity some discretion should be left as to the actual amount of the deduction to be made.  As far as I can gather from the Bill, the deduction is fixed at not less than 50 per cent.  I suggest that unless the charges of lack of diligence and fidelity are of a somewhat grave nature some discretion should be left to the local authority, subject to the final decision of the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is one other point that I want to touch on.  It was emphasised by the Minister in his introductory speech yesterday.  I refer to the effect of a pension claim by servants and employees who are guilty of strike action and the withdrawal of their labour. There seems to be a growing practice of taking the view that because an employee withdraws his labour from a public authority he automatically severs all claim for a pension on that particular authority.  Do we not all realise that we are not operating in a perfect system of society, and still less a perfect system of local government? We have the peculiar position that here we are dealing with a sections of citizens who are denied all the methods which are open to other sections of workers in the State of having their claims and grievances considered by methods of mediation and conciliation.  Having debarred them from that, we now propose to take from them their right to make any effective protest by the ordinary recognised method of withdrawing their labour.  If we wish to say that an employee of a local authority shall forfeit his claim to a pension if he withdraws his labour, then we should provide for him a reasonable and acceptable system of machinery through which his claims can be considered and adjudicated upon.  At the present moment we have the somewhat arbitrary decision on matters of the manager and the final decision of the Minister.</P>
    <P>It may be quite true to argue, as it has been, that the Government has got <Col N="291" /> the ultimate responsibility, and that in view of that the local authorities have the solution in their hands by changing the Government.  That, of course, is farcical.  You cannot change a Government on the question of an injustice being done to a small group of employees in Dublin or in some other part of the country.  It is not fair or proper to try to argue the matter on that line. The point is that, if we expect to get reasonable and satisfactory service from employees in any employment, we must not only afford them reasonable conditions of employment but also a reasonable opportunity of having their claims and grievances considered and adjudicated upon from time to time. That cannot be done by machinery which consists on the one hand of employers having complete and dictatorial powers, and on the other a single individual. I suggest that if this section in the Bill is to be insisted upon the Minister should recall the debate that took place in the House when the Industrial Relations Act was going through.  In that debate the Minister for Industry and Commerce gave a definite undertaking that the practice and the working of the Labour Court would be examined in the period following its establishment to see whether machinery of that type could be applied to local authorities&mdash;not perhaps machinery of the same composition&mdash; but something of that nature to meet, what was very clearly recognised in the debate at that time, the needs and requirements of these particular employees.</P>
    <P>With regard to fire brigade officers and servants who are covered by the Bill, there is a suggestion that I want to make to the Minister.  It is now provided that they will be entitled to retire at 55 years of age.  Might I suggest at this stage, since it is a question of voluntary retirement&mdash;having completed a certain minimum number of years' service&mdash;that the retiral age for them might be fixed as low as 50?  It is quite clear that the work of a fire brigade officer or servant is of an entirely different character from that performed by the ordinary servants of a local authority.  These fire brigade <Col N="292" /> officers and servants run particular risks, not only the ordinary risks of accidents and of a continuous physical strain, but the danger of a breakdown through disease caused by the nature of the operations they are called upon to perform.  Since we recognise that particular conditions attach to the work they perform by agreeing that they may retire at 55, I suggest that they should be permitted to retire at the age of 50, in view of the hardships they undergo and the special risks attached to their duties.  Finally, I suggest that as a considerable amount of detail will have to be considered in connection with this Bill the Minister might give as much time as possible between this and the Committee Stage for the preparation of amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be generally agreed that, in the main, the provisions of this Bill represent a great advance.  The Bill provides for the great majority of employees of local authorities.  It has been a long time in preparation.  That fact, in itself, has created difficulties in connection with some of the sections in it.  One of these difficulties has already been touched on by other Deputies, namely, that men who are over 60 years of age are to be excluded from the option in participating in this measure, if they so desire.  There are men who have just turned 60 to-day who ten years ago thought such a measure would be in operation.  On account of the small number who are to be excluded, those between 60 and 65, I appeal to the Minister to drop that clause so that these officers would be allowed, like other existing officers and servants, to avail of the provisions of this measure if they so desire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a point I should like the Minister to make clear.  Are officers such as rate collectors in the country who are employed, say, for six months of every year and some of whom have been employed in that way for upwards of 25 years excluded from this measure?  After studying the Bill I am not clear on that point.  If that is so, I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider the cases of such officials as rate collectors, rate clerks and others <Col N="293" /> who are employed in that way.  The contribution provision so far as local authorities are concerned is a new principle. I do not think there will be much objection to that, but there is some objection to the 5 per cent. fixed. In the Mental Treatment Bill the contribution was fixed at 3 per cent. Every year of service over 20 years counted for two years for pension purposes, yet the contribution was only 3 per cent.  The Minister should reconsider that matter and reduce the rate of contribution.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly the death gratuity is the big consideration which will make a number of officers accept this measure as against the existing legislation. But a number of men who thought they would enjoy the benefits of this measure have unfortunately died during the period of its preparation. I know of a few cases of officials in Dublin who have died within the last two years and have left big families in very sorry circumstances.  I think the Minister should introduce a retrospective clause to cover these cases.  I think it is as far back as 1933 since this measure was promised.  It is only coming along now and, in the circumstances, I think that what I ask for should be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that this Bill puts local officers on much the same basis as civil servants.  In the case of civil servants, I think the death gratuity is free of death duties.  I do not think that that is provided for in this measure.  I take it that the idea is to put it on the same basis as in the case of civil servants.  I ask the Minister to consider these few points between this and the Committee Stage as sympathetically as he can.  On the whole, I welcome the measure.  I think it is a very good Bill and will make for much more contentment in the local services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies who have spoken, I support the measure.  I agree that the provisions are generally good and favourable.  I just want to make one or two points. So far as the 60 years of age is concerned, I think it is unfair to exclude officers who serve beyond 60 years of <Col N="294" /> age&mdash;not to permit the lump sum to increase proportionately.  There may be cases of men who intend to go out at that age voluntarily and who may be pressed to remain on because of their capacity to serve.  These officers should be encouraged to remain on if it is in the interests of the local authority that they should do so and there should be no penalty attached to the continued service.</P>
      <P>So far as road workers are concerned, I think that the 5 per cent. contribution is rather high.  With the present rates of wages and the high cost of living it may be difficult for them to make a contribution of 5 per cent.  I think the State ought to make some contribution to this particular pension scheme in the case of road workers, because the State will be saved the paying of old age pensions in their case. Whatever saving is effected so far as the State is concerned in that way, to that extent at any rate the State should provide that money for the local authorities. The tendency is to throw back too much responsibility on the local authorities.  While the scheme is a favourable one it is placing no financial burden on the State.  These pensions may amount to a considerable sum. The sum may grow to pretty substantial dimensions so far as local authorities are concerned.  In the last analysis, the bulk of that will have to be found by the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with the last speaker in asking the Minister to make the provisions of the measure retrospective to the time the Bill was circulated at all events. The Bill was circulated last May or June.  I have in mind the case of one particular officer in Carlow who died recently after giving lifelong service to the county as an agricultural instructor. Under the existing legislation his widow gets no benefit.  If we had discussed this Bill when it was circulated, the chances are that it would have become law before that officer died and before the officer that Deputy Colley referred to died.  We were engaged here in looking after ourselves, in increasing our own allowances.  Therefore I suggest to the Minister that he might consider making the Bill retrospective, say, to the 1st January when the increased rates came into operation. <Col N="295" /> When the Bill was circulated a number of people were very pleased when they heard of the terms of the measure and they were looking forward to benefiting by it.  There is, however, no provision for the widows or families of those who died in the meantime.  I press the Minister to make the measure retrospective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The announcement some time ago by the Minister that he intended to introduce a Superannuation Bill especially for established servants was welcomed generally throughout the country, but the Bill as presented to us is not as attractive as we expected.  It is not attractive to established servants especially.  The main body of workers under local authorities who have been concerned about that new Superannuation Bill are the road workers and other minor officers of local authorities, and the big objection these people will have, and I have spoken to a large number of them since the Bill was presented to the Dáil, is that this 5 per cent. contribution is a huge joke because it means that a man down in County Wexford and in most other counties with £2 10s. per week will have to contribute to the superannuation fund 2/6 per week, plus the insurance he normally pays of 1/5.  It means that a man in receipt of £2 10s. per week will have to pay 3/11 and I can assure the Minister and the House that the road workers will not take too kindly to the Bill, if it is the intention of the Minister to insist on a 5 per cent. reduction from the weekly wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To a worker with £3 a week, it means, including insurance, 4/5 deduction from his weekly wages for the purpose of entitling him to a pension at the age of 65 or 70.  It must also be remembered that the man who gets a pension of 12/6 per week under the terms of this Bill will be penalised by the Minister for Social Welfare when he reaches the age of 70, because that pension will act against him when the investigation officer comes to investigate his means.  The pension he gets will be taken into consideration in assessing his means, and, from that point of view, the road workers will not take too kindly to the measure, unless <Col N="296" /> there are some modifications, first, in the matter of the contribution, and, secondly, in the matter of the means test when they come to the age at which they receive an old age pension.</P>
    <P>Another matter which the Minister ought to consider with regard to both the established servants and officers is the stipulation that the local authority &mdash;I suppose the county manager in this case&mdash;must be satisfied as to the diligence and fidelity of the servant or officer during the period of his employment with the local authority.  Diligence and fidelity are rather vague terms to me, but I should imagine that diligence and fidelity would be essential qualifications of a man's daily work, of the servant or officer while in the employment of the local authority. Surely if a man is not diligent, is not carrying out his duties properly and not acting in accordance with the terms of his appointment, the county manager or the Minister will take steps to have him removed, but it is not fair that a man should have to carry on for 20, 30 or 40 years in suspense, so to speak, about whether he will get a certificate that he has been diligent and faithful during his service with the local authority.  That provision should be deleted because a man must look forward to his pension, but, in this case, he cannot, until the actual date on which it is allowed by the local authority or the Minister.</P>
    <P>Another feature which is objectionable in respect of both eestablished servants and officers is the section which says that any period before 18 years of age will not be reckoned as pensionable service.  I want to point out that it is the practice in some areas to employ people under 18 years of age on road repair and more especially is it the practice of local authorities to engage typists, clerks and other officials of that type at 16 years of age.  In the case of most applications which are invited for positions as typists and clerical officers, the age ranges from 16 years upwards.  I do not think it matters whether they are employed before the age of 18 because the maximum number of years which can be reckoned for pension purposes is fixed and it does not make any difference <Col N="297" /> whether a person works that maximum from the age of 16 or the age of 18. From that point of view, this provision with regard to service before 18 years of age not being reckoned for pension purposes should be scrapped entirely.</P>
    <P>In the case of established officers, up to this I think local officials must agree that they have enjoyed pretty favourable pension schemes, schemes which are all the more favourable in that they are not contributory.  As Deputy Larkin pointed out, when the Bill becomes law, we will have a position in which officials with the very same status and in receipt of the very same salary as other officials and working side by side with them will not have to contribute to their pensions while the others will have to contribute 5 per cent.  I am sure it will cause a lot of discontent and I suggest that the pension scheme introduced and made effective in the Act of 1925 should still continue for the officers of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister how this figure of 5 per cent. was arrived at. So far as I know, in commercial firms which have pension schemes, and even contributory pension schemes, a figure as high as 5 per cent. is not asked of the employee.  Certain businesses in the City of Dublin have pension schemes and no contribution at all is asked from the employee who participates. I seriously suggest to the Minister that many road workers and minor officers will not avail of this scheme if the contribution of 5 per cent. is adhered to.  Everybody in the House and in the country will realise that 4/11 per week from road workers with £2 10s. 0d. per week is an absolutely fantastic sum.  I am sure they will not participate in this scheme and will not be anxious to take up work on the roads at all if this stipulation is adhered to.  I suggest to the Minister that most people in the House and even members of his own Party are in agreement that it is far too high.  If it could be modified, the Bill for me at least would be less objectionable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my voice to what has been said in relation to this Bill, with particular reference to the road workers.  I speak on behalf <Col N="298" /> of a certain section of the members of one local authority which probably employs the highest number of road workers in the country.  The number of road workers in Cork County would substantially exceed 2,000, apart from other sections of public employees.</P>
      <P>One welcomes the departure in this Bill so as to make some provision of security by way of pension for public employees.  One is impressed with the proposals in relation to contributory pensions.  It has been pointed out, and strongly emphasised, that the restrictions in regard to the amount to be contributed, the waiting period before entering into the register, the condition regarding diligence of service and generally the whole atmosphere surrounding the granting of pensions to those people, make for a good deal of uncertainty and, I am afraid, ultimately a good deal of dissatisfaction. It is true that a very substantial number of road workers who have reached 60 years are still in possession of their faculties and their physical strength and they are able to do their work quite well, but the fact that there is no provision made for them will be a source of great disappointment to members of local authorities who know the record of service of these men and are aware of what they have done for the local authorities.</P>
      <P>I do not want to disparage the principle underlying the Bill.  It is an excellent one and it is one that we all welcome.  I hope that on the Committee Stage the Minister will remedy the points to which objection has properly been taken.  I desire to support the plea made for the retrospective effect of this measure in regard to the dependents of public officials who died before the measure was introduced.  No doubt the Minister will be informed that there are tragic cases of this kind. There are quite a number in the county from which I come.  I do not want to mention particular cases, but the Minister could be given details of such cases.  I feel he will have the unanimous support of the people, no matter how concerned some may be about public expenditure, in helping to maintain homes very sadly affected by such circumstances as I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="299" /> There are some cases of persons in very humble circumstances who had their positions abolished and who will, I am afraid, have no rights under this Bill unless the Minister is in a position to make some provision for them.  I have in mind the case of a widow in West Cork who, following her husband's death, took over the position of rate collector.  That position was abolished following the transfer of the work of the town commissioners in that district to the Cork County Council. This is a case that will commend itself to the sympathetic attention of the Minister.  There are, perhaps, other cases of the same kind.  I hope the Minister will be able to do something to meet the situation that has been created for those people.</P>
    <P>As this Bill provides for the fixing of an age limit for the employees of the fever hospital in Cork, may I make a passing reference to what I feel is a very notable omission from this measure?  It is the absence of some provision for dealing with the officers of the voluntary hospitals.  I realise that I am not entitled to develop this point, but I should like to bring to the Minister's attention the position of the employees of the voluntary hospitals in Cork and in the north and south infirmaries.  A number of them have given very long service.  If it is not possible to do something for them on this occasion, I hope the Minister will avail of some opportunity to give those very faithful and diligent employees of these hospitals, from the secretary down to the most humble worker in the hospitals, some measure of security in the future.  I hope the Minister will find it possible to bear in mind the points put forward in this discussion. If he does, I feel sure that in its later stages this Bill will be much more acceptable than it is in its present form.</P>

      <P>Like other Deputies I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  I think the Minister is to be congratulated on the whole set-up of the measure that we have before us.  I hope some attempt will be made by the Minister to react in some way to the suggestions <Col N="300" /> that have been put to him by previous speakers.  I am not so much concerned with the question of deductions in relation to the contributory scheme.  I hope that this measure will be the forerunner of a more comprehensive Bill which will include not only the workers employed by public authorities but others.  I trust it will have a wider scope and a more general application.</P>
      <P>All of us who have any contacts with the workers must know that there is the eternal nightmare of approaching old age, when they will be no longer fit for any strenuous work and in 99 cases out of 100 they will be cast aside, thrown on the scrap heap, allowed to live on the rates or on the charity of their friends.  We have to have regard to the fact that many of our people have emigrated to the Six Counties or to Great Britain.  We know, too, that many people are attracted by the relatively adequate pensions given across the Border and on the other side of the Channel to persons who attain the age of 65 years.</P>
      <P>I welcome this measure for many reasons.  It removes from the minds of many people the terrible nightmare of poverty which is staring them in the face when they reach 65 or 70 years.  I feel it will prove to be a very useful antidote in so far as it relates to emigration.  We have from time to time granted pensions to workers who come under the heading of established servants here.  I understand that has been done for a period of years and it was regarded as being quite illegal. Nevertheless, the Department of Local Government was very sympathetic and there was no question of a surcharge.</P>
      <P>I understand the Minister is contemplating the introduction of legislation which will give Cork the same right as Dublin with reference to being able to pension some of these servants.  A number of labourers and other workers who have given long service to the municipality are debarred from receiving pensions.  Some of them were laidoff and they got a pension of 10/- a week and they were thus enabled to draw 6/- as an old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 18 states that an established officer in Dublin &ldquo;shall be entitled to <Col N="301" /> reckon as service&rdquo;, and so on.  Subsection (2) of the same section also lays down that an established officer of the Corporation of the Borough of Dún Laoghaire &ldquo;shall be entitled to reckon as service&rdquo;, and so on.  I would like the Minister to clear up any misconception that may have arisen and be present still.  The White Paper states that &ldquo;local authorities which may adopt Part III will be empowered to grant retiring allowances to their established servants and the power to adopt this Part will be a reserved function under the County Management Acts&rdquo;. That reserved function is somewhat similar to reserved functions under the Cork City Management Act.  We have a very admirable city manager in Cork and I am not even suggesting that he will not adopt Part III, but I would like to know if a majority of the members of the council would be sufficient.</P>

      <P>Some suggestions were made here this evening by Deputy Larkin and Deputy Murphy which I regard as very useful and practical.  I would not cavil whether the contribution is 3 per cent. or 5 per cent. from the wages of any of the parties mentioned, as I feel that getting something for nothing, as in the case of some of the pension schemes I have heard of, is undesirable.  I would much prefer a contributory pension scheme.  After all, I do not believe we have road workers all over the country working for £2 10s.  I know they get more in other centres.  Perhaps the Minister, in view of what Deputy Corish said a moment ago, would have regard to some unfortunate people who may have to work at £2 10s. in present circumstances and see that some elasticity is provided in the measure so as to cover cases where workers may be getting only £2 10s. a week.  It might be arranged that they pay something less than those getting £3 10s. or £4.  While throwing out that suggestion, I can <Col N="302" /> assure the Minister that I give a very hearty welcome to the measure.  I think that he has retrieved a lot of his good name.  He has done himself real justice on this occasion and I wish him every success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I subscribe without any reservation or qualification of any kind to the policy of contributory pensions. If the workers generally&mdash;industrial, agricultural and others&mdash;had the good sense to take out insurance policies or contribute to funds of this kind, there would be less trouble about looking after the welfare of their families when some of them pass out of this world without making any proper provision. I would encourage the Minister to cut out as many snags as he possibly can, for the purpose of saving himself and the officials of the Department and the officers of local authorities trouble in administering this measure.  This provision, more or less putting responsibility back on the local authority for fixing the pension of an officer or servant with regard to the manner in which he has carried out his duties, is an unheard of provision.  If a man makes a contribution for a pension, under any law I ever heard of before, he has a moral and legal right to draw that pension, unless he has been found guilty of some criminal lapse.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Military Service Pensions Acts and other Acts, we have a definite provision that when a man goes on pension he cannot be deprived of that pension without being found guilty in a court and sentenced to hard labour.  It would be a queer state of affairs if this provision were maintained and it would cause a good deal of contention amongst members of local authorities.  Different members of a local authority may take different views in regard to the manner in which an officer or servant has discharged his duties.  The Minister should save himself trouble by cutting out this objectionable condition.  The obligation should not be imposed upon any members of a local authority to interpret the words in the manner intended by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to hear more from him as to why that provision was inserted in the Bill.  An existing officer or servant <Col N="303" /> will, I presume, get his pension without this matter being brought in, whereas another man who pays a contribution will be brought under crossexamination when it comes to the period for retiring.</P>
    <P>Regarding the figure of 5 per cent., I could understand that figure being laid down in the Bill and insisted upon if it were put there for the purpose of keeping a superannuation fund in a solvent condition, but there is no question here of the solvency of a fund.  It is not a superannuation fund proper: the contribution, whatever may be finally fixed, will be treated merely as part of the revenue of the local authority and is not fixed to maintain the solvency of a fund.  The figure is ridiculously high in the case of low paid workers.  I had a good deal to do with tendering advice over a period in connection with the administration of a superannuation fund which has a membership of 48,000 persons, of which I happen to be a member myself, and I have taken a great interest in the working of the fund.  In considering the solvency of a superannuation fund or any pension fund, whether solvent or insolvent, the members generally pay on the basis of a graduated scale and that is done on actuarial advice.  I know of a case of a fund which has close on £20,000,000 and in the earlier stage of the service the members pay 2½ per cent. and on a graduated basis up to 4 per cent.  But I have yet to hear from the Minister or from anyone the name of any superannuation fund where the contribution paid by the members is as high as 5 per cent.  I know of superannuation funds where the percentage of the contribution has been increased since the beginning of the emergency but that was done in accordance with the wishes of actuaries to maintain solvency on the same basis as it was fixed pre-war.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to give careful consideration to the suggestion made by Deputy Anthony that lowerpaid workers of the local authority brought into this scheme should pay a smaller contribution than those who are lucky enough to be in receipt of something like a living wage in existing circumstances.  There would be a <Col N="304" /> good case for asking a man with £500 a year to pay 5 per cent. but there is no case for asking a man with wages of £2 10s. a week and the responsibilities attaching to a married man to pay even 2½ per cent.  However, I do not want to elaborate on this, but I would like the Minister to look into this matter sympathetically before it reaches the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is another objectionable section in the Bill, the section that proposes to penalise a prospective pensioner, if in his wisdom he decides to exercise his constitutional right to withdraw his labour.  I have had some experience regarding this side of pension schemes before&mdash;and the Minister can get confirmation of this statement. Following the imprisonment of several persons occupied in public companies during the time known as the Black-and-Tan period&mdash;people who were members of a superannuation fund associated with public concerns such as railways&mdash;they were put off the pension list.  There was considerable trouble in some cases in getting these people restored to membership of pension funds to which they had been previously attached and at the same time in getting credit for the contributions they had previously made to the pension fund.</P>
    <P>In a number of cases only after considerable political pressure did these railways allow these persons who came out of jail to return to the pension funds.  They wanted to cut them out from any right to a pension and if that had taken place they would have suffered considerably when they came to the pension period, or if they had died before reaching the pension period their dependents would be severely penalised.  The Minister may have a certain point of view in connection with the rights of workers of the local authority to withdraw their labour but he must admit that it is a constitutional right and whether they exercise it or not in certain circumstances is a matter for consideration whenever those circumstances arise.  I would warn him that he may be creating a good deal of trouble for himself by insisting on insertion of a penal clause like that.  I am submitting <Col N="305" /> that it is an attempt to penalise the officers or servants of the local authority in certain circumstances for the exercise of their constitutional rights.</P>
    <P>On the whole I welcome the Bill and the policy enshrined in it and hope when it has passed through the Final Stage that it will make provision as far as possible and as far as can be reasonably done to make provision for pensions for the majority of officers and servants of the local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got an awful lot to say about this Bill, but the average taxpayer looks with a certain amount of distrust on any pension Bill introduced into this House, and I think I can assure the Minister that there will not be a good reception from the taxpayers all over the country for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the Bill has this good point that the pensions are paid from contributions paid by the different officials and workers employed by the local authorities and this will ease the minds of those people who would be inclined to grumble and grouse at the Bill.  There is no doubt that the workers of the local authority have not got sufficient consideration for a number of years past; while all the lower paid officials of the local authority are entitled to pensions on retirement because they can easily claim that they have given such long service to the State or to the local body that they have neglected to become skilful in any other means of livelihood.  They are entitled to a fund to enable them to live peacefully and with a fair amount of prosperity in their old age.  When we look at the other side of the ledger we see people who lived all their lives by private enterprise and who need not fall back on the State but go out at the beginning of each week to provide their own means of livelihood and at the age of 70 are denied the old age pension to which they are entitled because by hard work they had saved some money for their later years.  We wonder if Bills introduced to pay pensions to local officials do anything to help the advancement of the country.  If every person in this State decided to look to the Government for a means of livelihood and no <Col N="306" /> one looked to his own energy or initiative for his livelihood then no wealth would be contributed by anybody and if the State would be paying pensions to everybody there would be very little private enterprise.  I am not totally opposed to the Bill because I understand that the pensions are paid from the contributions paid by those who are to benefit by them and this will save it from the hard comments which it would otherwise get.  There are a few things that I am opposed to.</P>
    <P>The average road worker, I understand, under this Bill is by no means entitled to a pension unless he puts in a certain number of days per year in the employment of the local authority. A young man of 18, for example, gets employment as an ordinary labourer from the county council.  Some of us who are in constant touch with people who take up such employment&mdash;small farmers' sons&mdash;know that they cannot possibly be given the number of days' employment by the county council which would entitle them to benefit from this scheme.  On the other hand, for every week these men work they are supposed to make a contribution of 5 per cent.  I have no doubt that the contribution of 5 per cent. is rather high, but let us take it that they would be willing to make a contribution of 5 per cent. and after ten years of casual employment in the county council they would still find that at the end of each year they had not got the necessary number of days to entitle them to reap any benefit from the payment.  Yet they paid every week in order to help to give pensions to other officials and nothing to themselves. That is the problem that I would like to get an explanation on from the Minister.</P>
    <P>We all know that the amount of money at the disposal of a county council cannot possibly give permanent employment for eight or ten months of the year to every road worker and road ganger.  I know men who must give 2/6 a week, plus insurance, which makes a total of 4/11 out of £2 10s. 0d. a week. Such men have definitely a grievance and now is the time, before this Bill becomes law, to get an explanation of what their position will be.</P>
    <P>Again, we have the case of the young <Col N="307" /> man who commences employment as a clerical officer in a county council. These appointments are generally on a temporary basis at the commencement. In nine cases out of ten, the individuals find themselves employed almost permanently.  At least, they are employed for nine months of the year and, after a period, are made permanent. It cannot be said of a young man who started off as a clerical officer in a county council that, after 20 years, he was still a clerical officer.  For those young ment, there is advancement and promotion.  If they are energetic and intelligent enough, there is no doubt that, even in this country with all its drawbacks, they will improve their position.  But the man who starts life as a road worker will, generally, find himself, after 20 years, still a road worker.  The average ganger employed by a county council will still be a ganger after 15 or 20 years.  There is no advancement for him or, if there is, it is very limited.  In only one case out of 100 will such a man advance himself, even though he has excellent qualifications. The Minister may have ideas of his own on these matters but I should like to see some attention given to these individuals.</P>
    <P>Many pension schemes have been introduced in recent years in the interest of different types of officials of county councils.  Some men who would be entitled to get pensions will not benefit by this scheme at all.  They may be in a happy position as regards security but it will be not so beneficial to them when they come to retire. Those too old for protection will have to pay their contributions whether they are to benefit or not.  The people will look at any pension scheme with a certain amount of disfavour because they have been fleeced for pension schemes for the past 25 years.  They will say that this is a measure to take more money out of the ratepayers' pockets.</P>
    <P>On the whole, however, the Bill is a worthy one, because a contribution is demanded from those who will benefit. I listened with interest to the speakers who suggested that a 5 per cent. contribution was too high.  It is too high for the lowly-paid worker, even if he <Col N="308" /> has permanent employment.  Two and a half per cent. or 3½ per cent. would be sufficient in the case of a man earning £2 10s. a week.  The 5 per cent. could be deducted from the man earning £6 or £7 a week.  The person earning 50/- a week will not get anything like the pension which will be payable to the person earning £6 or £7 a week. Therefore, I do not think he should be asked to pay the same contribution as a man with a large salary.  This Bill will be welcomed, particularly by the persons concerned.  Whether or not it will be welcomed by the people of the country is another matter.  While it may deserve a certain amount of criticism, I do not think that it would be right completely to oppose it.</P>

      <P>I merely raised an objection to one part of it&mdash;that if a man went on strike he would lose his pension rights.  I merely want to make a few remarks now.  I welcome the Bill.  Road workers and others employed by the county council of which I am a member, as well as employees of the urban council, have been looking forward to this Bill since they saw the announcement in the Press.  I am glad that the Minister introduced it because we have old employees who are going out, after 40 years' service, without a pension.  A plumber in Enniscorthy who has given his whole life to the council has to go out without a pension.  Many others have gone out with nothing but the old age pension. All we could do was to give them a day's work.  The Bill will be welcomed by workers because it will make for security.  While one section of officials were receiving big pensions on leaving the service of local bodies, the vast majority of the road men and quarry men had nothing to rely upon but the old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the payment of 2/6 per week, when I was a flour mill worker, the flour millers offered, through our union, a pension scheme which provided for a deduction of 1/- per week.  A national ballot was taken <Col N="309" /> on that proposal and it was turned down.  A deduction of 2/6 from a wage of 50/- is too much.  Deputy Anthony says that some county councils pay more than 50/- and he is probably right.  If the Minister could see his way to reduce the contribution to 1/- per week, no man or woman employed by a local authority would object.  A deduction of 2/6 a week means £6 a year.  Many of the staffs of the mental hospitals and other institutions have not been sanctioned but I gather that they will be covered by this Bill.  As regards the ratepayers, I do not think there can be any objection.  Deputy Commons referred to the opinion of the ratepayers, but the men in the employment of a local authority will now have something to look forward to.  It will give them an interest in their work and they will do it well so that they may be able to retire on pension.  That will be something which the majority of workers do not enjoy.  Of course, some private employers, such as Guinness, give pensions to their employees. Why should not the local authorities be put on the same basis? The workers are very glad this scheme has been introduced.  I welcome it on behalf of the labour class employed by Wexford County Council and other public bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to thank the House for the manner in which they received the Bill and for the criticisms which for my own benefit and advantage they have offered in regard to its provisions.  I do not accept or agree with all of them, but I shall certainly consider them because I know they have been advanced with the idea of being helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one aspect of the Bill about which the greater part of the discussion has centred and I think I should say something in regard to it because many Deputies seem to be under a misapprehension as to what exactly the Bill does in this respect.  The feature of the Bill to which I refer is the fact that it is a contributory one.  There have been a number of erroneous assumptions made about that.  First of all it has been assumed that the Bill is purely a superannuation Bill.  However, <Col N="310" /> it does more than provide mere superannuation for a retired officer or a retired servant of any local authority. It provides him with a certain measure of assurance.  As will be seen under Section 73 and other sections a gratuity is payable to the representatives of an officer or a servant in the event of his death.  Let me be quite clear about that.  It is something more than paying for a pension.  It is also paying for that.  Under Section 73 particularly advantageous terms are conceded in the case of an officer who may be injured or who may die from injuries arising in the course or out of the nature of his employment.  These things, again, are something over and above the mere provision of a superannuation allowance to a person on retirement.  There is another point in this connection. The contribution does not meet the full cost of the benefits to be given under the Bill.  Deputy Commons who, with Deputy Roddy and some others, seems to be concerned for the position of the people who will be paying the major part of the benefits to be granted under this Bill should perhaps, with myself, have considerable regard for that fact. The contributions which we are asking will scarcely pay more than one-third of the total cost of the benefits that are to be given.  While it is all very well for us to say that a private employer may do very much more for his employees than it is proposed to ask the county councils to do under this Bill we have to remember that there is a very vital distinction between the private employer and the county councils.</P>
    <P>The private employer in a matter of that sort, if he wants to be generous to his employees and if he wants to play reasonably fair with them, does so, nevertheless, at his own expense or at the expense of his competitive position in trade and at the risk of reducing his income if his costs should go too high.  But the public authority, on the other hand, pays with other people's money.  Therefore we, who are here as representatives of the community as a whole, ought to be very much concerned with the fact that these benefits are not coming out of our pockets nor out of the pockets <Col N="311" /> of the nine, 12 or 21 people who constitute the councils of the local authorities, but out of the pockets of the ratepayers and the producers of this country.  It is with regard not merely to that fact but also to the desirability of enabling servants of local authorities to have a measure of security that we have tried to strike the fair compromise between all these interests which are embodied in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Again, it has been said that the contribution which we are asking the established servants of the local authorities to pay is excessive, having regard to their means.  I think in relation to that, we must also consider the fact that they are allowed to become pensionable upon very favourable terms.  Take the case of an established officer.  He has to be in continuous whole-time employment, day in day out, for the whole of the five or five and a half days of the week that he is required to discharge his duties.  In the case of an established servant, on the other hand, the conditions are much less stringent because we are only asking that he will be in employment for at least 200 out of the, roughly, 300 working days of the year.  It is hard to express, but it means that he need only be in what might be described as two-thirds constant employment.  That is a very considerable difference and a fair approach to meet the particular conditions of the vast body of servants or manual employees of local authorities. I think we should not, when we are criticising the amount of the contribution we are asking, in all fairness to the people who will ultimately have to foot the Bill, leave that out of consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Commons seems, furthermore, to be under a misapprehension as to the position of young men who are taken on as casual employees by the local authorities in regard to this contribution.  This contribution is not going to be asked for from any person except an established servant, that is, a person who, by reason of the fact that he has been employed for not less than 200 days a year for three consecutive years by the local authority, has earned the right to have his name placed upon <Col N="312" /> the register of established servants.  If he has not got that employment over the three preceding years he will not have fulfilled the basic condition to permit him to be registered and during that period no contribution will be asked from him.  On the other hand, if his name is entered upon the register of established servants he will be asked to pay his contribution, but if he leaves the employment of the local authority &mdash;due to any cause except his own wilful default&mdash;if he leaves because there is not work for him, he will be entitled to a return of his contribution.  In such an event the local authority could be described as merely acting as a savings bank for him and he would be no worse off from that point of view than if he had never been asked to make a contribution.  That has to be borne in mind when we are considering some of the criticisms of Deputy Larkin and Deputy Davin.  They quite overlooked the fact that under Sections 30 and 53 the contributions will be returnable in the circumstances where a person leaves the employment of the council due to any other cause than his voluntary resignation or dismissal.  I was going to deal here with some of the points raised by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, but some of them may be covered by what I say in relation to the points made by Deputy Roddy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roddy, like Deputy Commons and some other Deputies who have spoken, opened his speech by adverting to the fact that this Bill is likely to impose considerable financial obligations upon the local authorities who adopt it.  Then he rather departed from that and at the end of his speech began to criticise me because I had not made the benefits to be secured by the officers and employees of local authorities under the Bill sufficiently generous. But he did say this, and I think he must have misread the Bill, that the age of retirement, subject to compliance with the Bill, was less than that ruling in the Civil Service and, so far as I could follow him, he seemed to imply that we were forcing people to retire at the age of 60, with a pension. The position is not that.  The position is this, as I was careful to explain in introducing the Bill, that a person, if <Col N="313" /> he wishes, may retire when he has reached the age of 60.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in the case of the Civil Service.  The civil servant has the option of retiring at the age of 60, and some civil servants have to my knowledge exercised that right and have gone out at the age of 60, even though I would have preferred them to continue to serve until at least 65. But we have made an Order which compels all officers of local authorities to retire at 65.  In certain cases, of course, we have to continue to avail of their services until their successors can be found, but the general retiring age is 65, and not 60, as Deputy Roddy seemed to believe.</P>
      <P>He also criticised the Bill on the ground that the 200 days' minimum service would exclude the majority of the men.  The trouble about it is that we can only grant the pensions on the basis of permanent employment or of semipermanent employment and I think we have gone very far to meet the situation when we are asking, as I have said, that the men who have been in the employment of the council for  less than 200 days out of the working year, should be considered to be permanent. I do not think we could maintain the position of restricting pensions to people who were in permanent employment if we went any lower than that limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Roddy also criticised the Bill &mdash;and I think Deputy Anthony took the same point of view&mdash;on the ground that we were making no provision for officials who have retired since April of this year.  In fact, in Section 75 of the Bill there is a provision which reads: &ldquo;Where a local authority granted before the passing of this Act an allowance to an officer or servant in relation to his having ceased after the first day of November, 1946, to hold any office or employment, the local authority, if they so think proper, may increase the rate of the allowance to such extent as <Col N="314" /> may be sanctioned by the Minister.&rdquo; So that in fact this Bill is at least retrospective to the 1st November.  In regard to the appeals which have been made to me to make it even further retrospective I think that is a matter to which I should have to give a great deal of consideration.  I may say that I have felt in great difficulty by reason of the fact that the Bill has been long delayed but it is a very difficult matter, even in a case like this, to hold that the long delay which the preparation of this exceedingly difficult Bill has involved should give to me the right to impose burdens on the local authorities retrospectively, to impose on them obligations which did not exist prior to the passing of the Bill.</P>

      <P>This is the point that is disturbing me&mdash;it may be covered in some other part of the Bill&mdash;Section 75 covers the person who has retired between 1st November of last year and the passing of the Bill and it allows the Minister to sanction the local authority in giving him a higher rate of pension than he would have got under the old Bill.  But take the person of 60 years of age who is, we will say, serving at the moment and who cannot opt under this Bill, who retires from the service, we will say, in two months' time.  What is the position of that official?</P>

      <P>I am referring to retirement on the ground of ill-health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I would have to look into that.  I have not considered the case of a person who retired otherwise than by the effluxion of time.  I will look into it and see if it is necessary to cover it between now and Committee Stage.  The only cases I had before my mind were the cases of people who were compelled to retire by the Order which was made by the Minister for Local Government before the new scales came in.  My mind has been exercised about their position and I think they are fully covered in the Bill but if the Deputy has any reason to think they are not, I will look into it again.  There is, of course, this question of people who retire on grounds of ill-health.</P>
      <P>Deputy Roddy also expressed the fear that the name of an officer or servant could be removed arbitrarily from the register.  I do not see how the Deputy has formed that impression because it seems to me that Section 10 and Section 38 fully cover that point. First of all, I may point out, that the register is to be open to inspection. Section 10 deals with this question of the removal from the register and subsection (3) of that section provides that a person aggrieved by the removal of his name by a local authority from the register may appeal against the removal to the appropriate Minister. So that they have the right of appeal under Section 10 and also under Section 38.  Therefore, I do not think there is any fear that the name of a person will be arbitrarily removed from the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins asked why continuous service is insisted on in the case of officers who remain under the 1925 Act.  He indicated that he could <Col N="316" /> not understand why continuous service had been insisted on.</P>
    <P>Now, the insistence arises from the fact that the grant of superannuation rights had two purposes, both of them advantageous from the employers' point of view.  One is that the prospect of securing a pension, dependent on giving continuous service for a definite period, is an inducement to an officer to remain in the service.  Occasions may arise in which an officer would see some personal benefit if he left the service and tried his luck elsewhere. As we know, the departure of a trained and experienced officer may give rise to considerable inconvenience indeed and great expense.  At the moment, we have a great demand in outside employment for certain classes of officers, particularly technical officers.  They might earn something more outside the service than they are at present earning in it.  I think that, while the inducement might be strong for an officer to leave the service in these circumstances, he will hesitate to do so if he forfeits his previous service. I think that is a consideration which officers have to keep in mind.  We cannot put officers in existing circumstances into the position in which they can leave the service at any time without the consent of the appropriate Minister and re-enter it when it becomes advantageous for them to do so, and then lump all their services together as continuous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they doing so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment they cannot leave without the consent of the Minister and of the local authority and, as I have said, that consent will not be lightly given.  In fact, it may not be given at all if the officer is leaving the service to enter into outside employment. If he is leaving the service to go from one local authority to another or if, in exceptional circumstances, he were leaving in order to secure experience which might be advantageous and on the understanding that he was coming back to the service of the local authority, then the consent of the Minister would be given. As it stands at the moment, if we were to allow all existing officers who do not <Col N="317" /> opt for the terms of this Bill to lump all their services together, then I think we should be simply inviting them to take advantage of the exceptional position which exists outside to leave the service when, as I have said, they thought it was to their advantage to do so, and then try to get back into it when they found it was more advantageous for them to be in the service than outside it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, we have safeguards for the future because no period of less than two years will be regarded as continuous if the person has left the employment of a local authority in that period.  In addition to that, as I have pointed out, we should bear in mind that the new scheme is contributory and that the officer will not be able to get a refund of his contributions in certain circumstances, so that he may lose his contributions when he leaves the service.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish and some other Deputies referred to the fact that an officer is bound to serve with diligence and fidelity.  I think we are entitled to ask that.  If a local authority is going to pay two-thirds in the case of officers and perhaps more than two-thirds in the case of established servants, of the cost of the benefits that are being guaranteed to officers and servants under this Bill, then I think the local authority before giving a pension is entitled to satisfy itself that the officer has served it with diligence and fidelity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is very guileless if he feels that all officers of local authorities serve their employers with the same diligence and fidelity as they would if they were in private employment. Naturally, public bodies and such organisations are more lenient, I think, in the standards of service which they exact from their officers and servants than private employers are.  In any event, I think this is a sound principle. If local authorities are going to pay two-thirds of the cost of the benefits under the Bill, I think they are entitled to get something in return for <Col N="318" /> it.  They should at least have the satisfaction of feeling that their officers had served them with diligence and fidelity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that on the day an officer's pension is to be fixed his whole career in the service will be reviewed?  If that were so, he would be in suspense for a certain period of time to know whether he had fulfilled his duties with diligence and fidelity.  Could he not get a certificate every year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if we were to start granting certificates then, in some of the cases which I have seen coming before me, I am afraid it is his passport he would get.  However, the fundamental thing is that it is there because I think the local authority is entitled to insist on that provision.  It raises a point which, of course, if we want to be strictly logical, can be very awkward.  There is a provision in the Bill that where a local authority is not satisfied as to the diligence and fidelity with which one of its servants has served it in the past, it may give him a lesser pension.  That is a compassionate provision.  It will enable us to deal with those hard cases which we sometimes meet where a man has given very good service over a number of years and then for one reason or another has begun to deteriorate, due to ill-health or perhaps the undue cultivation of convivial habits.  We all know of such cases.  We are not so innocent here.  I have often had the very difficult task of having to determine that, no matter what pleas might be offered for sympathetic consideration, in justice to the local service a man had to be removed from office without any pension at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This provision has been included to enable local authorities, if they like, to pension men who, for one reason or another, are no longer in a position to give satisfactory service rather than to keep carrying them on, not only as passengers, which is bad enough, but as a very bad influence on and as a bad example to the other members of the staff.  It is a very awkward factor in the management and control of any organisation.  If you have a man who, obviously, is not pulling his weight in <Col N="319" /> the team or earning his money and, because of family circumstances or something else, you do not want to deal harshly with him and you keep carrying him on, there is the suggestion to every other officer and employee: &ldquo;If I follow his example, I will be treated with the same compassionate regard.&rdquo; Therefore, as I said, we put in this provision which will enable local authorities and the Minister to deal with these hard and, I will say frankly; exceptional cases.</P>
    <P>However, this is a Bill which is so complicated that I think we can better deal with it in Committee, because upon most of the provisions there may be differences of opinion as to what is the best line to take.  As Deputies know, it has been a long time in incubation. It is, I think, 14 years or more since a Bill of this sort was promised first.  It has received a great deal of consideration in the Department and from successive Ministers.  I do not say that it represents the last word in these matters; indeed, so far as Part III is concerned, it is a tentative attempt to deal with a very complicated problem and one which I am very anxious, if I can, to find a reasonable solution for.</P>
    <P>We have a number of official amendments, which will be circulated later, in relation to the Bill.  None of them will be of very great significance from the point of view of principle.  But, when they are circulated, Deputies will have an opportunity of considering them and I will undertake to give them a sufficient amount of time thereafter to formulate their own amendments.  In that connection, I am sure we are all anxious, since the Bill has been before the House now quite a long time, that we should try to get it enacted before Christmas if we can.  For that reason, I would ask, while putting down the Committee Stage for this day fortnight, that at any rate it should not be taken later than this day three weeks.</P>

In Section 75 power is given where persons retired between the 1st November last year and the passage of the Bill to give them <Col N="320" /> a higher pension than normal.  Now, say, a person over the age of 60 years retired last month as a result of ill-health. He can get a higher pension than normal.  If a person retires through ill-health the day after the passing of the Bill he cannot get a higher pension than normal.</P>

    <Title>Live Stock (Artificial Insemination) Bill, 1947&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  The object of the Bill is merely to secure control over artificial breeding of live stock in this country so as to prevent harmful exploitation of the practice.  The systematic breeding of animals by artificial insemination is of comparatively recent development, dating from the end of the first world war when modern methods were first put into effect in Russia with great success.  Denmark then took up the idea for the purpose of improving dairy cattle, and Danish experts carried the practice to the United States of America where it has been widely developed.  In England research has been carried on at Cambridge since 1935 and a network of <Col N="321" /> artificial insemination centres is now being built up in that country under the control of the Minister for Agriculture and an advisory committee.</P>
      <P>As I have already said, this measure is intended only to secure control and prevent abuses.  Accordingly it provides that centres must be licensed and subject to inspection by authorised officers, and that semen may not be imported or exported without a licence. Regulations to be made under the Act will contain other precautions such as: ensuring qualified staff and efficient premises, equipment and breeding methods; the approval of the Minister for any bulls to be used for artificial insemination; the keeping of proper breeding records; and control over the distribution of semen from the centres.</P>
      <P>Experiments have already been started in this country at the Ballyvorisheen Cattle Breeding Station, Mallow, on a farm owned by the Ballyclough Co-operative Creamery.  The station is in charge of a capable veterinary surgeon who has been trained in artificial insemination at the Cambridge Research Institute, and, to meet the requirements of the Shorthorn Society for the registration of calves produced by artificial insemination the station was inspected on behalf of my Department by an independent veterinary surgeon fully qualified in artificial insemination.  It is possible that the establishment of other centres may be called for in other parts of the country, and it is necessary that I should have power to grant or refuse a licence as circumstances may require, or to attach to any licence granted such conditions as my Department may think proper.</P>
      <P>I am also taking power to revoke licences, power to enter and inspect any premises licensed for artificial insemination or where there is reason to believe artificial insemination is being carried on, and to take all necessary precautions to ensure that there will be no abuses.  The provisions of this Bill are in line with Acts already enacted in other countries where artificial breeding is much more widespread than it is here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The origin of this method of breeding goes back much <Col N="322" /> farther than the Minister said.  It goes back some 600 years.  The Arabs used it 600 years ago.  There are records of its use in 1750.  Its utilisation on a commercial basis is, however, of recent origin.  This is an enabling Bill.  Section 3 is the operative section and is the only important section in the Bill. We do not approve of this system of legislation.  We have got no information from the Minister as to what regulations he proposes to make.  As a matter of fact, he has not informed the House whether he intends to encourage the use of this system of breeding.  He has not given us any information as to whether any financial provision is being made or whether he intends to ask the House to make any financial provision for this.  That seems to me extraordinary.</P>
      <P>If I asked the Minister what regulations he proposed to control this method of breeding, he would not be able to give me any information because what we are being asked here is to empower the Minister to make regulations and he will then hand it over to a group of civil servants in Merrion Street and they will do the rest of it.  In other words, it is delegated legislation.  Surely it is our responsibility here to examine legislation, and, if this is something new so far as this country is concerned, Dáil Eireann ought to be interested and we ought to get an opportunity of discussing its implications.  For instance, I do not know whether the Minister intends to allow the individual to operate this system privately on his own farmstead for his own stock, or whether he intends to insist on veterinary surgeons being provided where it is used otherwise. This is a highly technical job, and, in my opinion, veterinary surgeons ought to be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no information whatever as to whether there is any intention to provide a national service, whether we intend to build up a national service, and we have no information as to whether it is the intention of the Minister and his Department to carry out intensive research into the utilisation of animals in an artificial way.  We get a very scanty account of what they have been doing in Great Britain, with <Col N="323" /> no reference to the work of Sir John Hammond, to his interest and supervision in the matter, little information about the Reading station, Cambridge, and the various other stations.  As a matter of fact, so far as the proven animal is concerned, he might have informed the House what the proven animal means and its advantages, because that is the real advantage in the artificial use of an animal.</P>
    <P>The United States took up this system in 1937, and, in 1943, had 574 animals in use to inseminate artificially 182,524 cows, an average of 318 cows per bull.  Britain took it up and Reading was started, I think, in February, 1943.  By mid-summer, 1946, they had 73 bulls in use and the inseminated average was something over 40,000.  The conception rate for that particular year was 65.2 per cent.  We have suffered from a variety of diseases here and we have had problems in the matter of breeding and genetics, and one thing claimed for this system of breeding is that it is a very effective way of controlling the spread of disease, and infectious disease in particular.  In the particular type of community we have, a small farming community, where you have an animal serving a big district, it gives rise to greater disease problems than where you have independent units which are economically served by one animal.  For that reason, we should take a particular interest in whatever advantages may accrue from the utilisation of animals in this fashion.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently showed an interest in our problem of breeding.  He knows very well that indiscriminate cross-breeding leads nowhere and I feel that it is better to grade up low-yielding herds by the use of good bulls than to try to pull out the low-yielders. That would be a very long and very tedious method and would not be as good, from the breeding point of view, as the utilisation of good bulls.  The improvement of herds, in my opinion, depends mainly on better bulls.  With good females only, the chances of grading up are only about equal.  With the utilisation of the proven animal, it would be odds on the creation of higher yielding progeny and I want to recommend to the Minister that here <Col N="324" /> definitely is a solution of our problem of low yield.</P>
    <P>It is true that a co-operative society here has taken a particular interest in this matter, but I am quite satisfied, too, that a great many farmers in that part of the country are wondering whether it is right or wrong and why it is that the Department has not taken any interest whatever in it. The station at Mallow to which the Minister referred was set up on the initiative of the local co-operative society.  They have four or five animals under the supervision of a very efficient veterinary surgeon who was trained specifically for this purpose, but there was no co-operation, good, bad, or indifferent, by the Department. It was on the initiative and enterprise of a group of men down there that this work was started.  There was no investigation of any sort by the Department and no attempt to provide financially for research in the matter. Then we talk about our agriculture and about progress in Irish agriculture, while getting no lead from Merrion Street, so far as the operation of a new idea like this is concerned.</P>
    <P>Every progressive agricultural country in the world is working intensively on this system of breeding from the research point of view.  The Minister carefully avoided informing the House that Great Britain provided £250,000 for research and that a special advisory committee, under the chairmanship of the Duke of Norfolk, was set up to advise the Minister and to watch and guide research and to supervise the stations generally.  Are we going to have a national service and why is it that we have got such scant information? I want to protest against the way the House has been treated.  This is an important matter, fundamental to our whole economy and our whole prosperity. It has been made definitely clear to us that the basis of the whole future of this country is the live-stock industry and that, if we can get away from our haphazard method of breeding, indiscriminate cross-breeding which produces nondescript animals, and get down to a more scientific method of breeding animals for specific purposes, we will be making a definite advance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="325" /> The advantage of the proven animal, used artificially, is that you can use him very much longer and much more extensively, having proved his capacity to get milk.  In the natural way, when you arrive at that point, where there is positive proof that his progeny are high yielders and that you have stepped up the milking capacity, he has probably become too old to be used in the natural way.  Another advantage which accrues is that you can afford to pay much more, to go to much greater trouble breeding animals for the specific purpose of dairying especially. I think this method of breeding has proved best from the dairying point of view.  The position to-day in Great Britain, with their activities on this important work, is that there are not sufficient animals available.  We have just been marking time in this country, so far as milk production is concerned, until the problem has become so acute that the Minister, when he took office, expressed the view that we had a biological problem here, and that our methods and the Live Stock Breeding Act, in its administration, had reacted adversely and that the failure of the Department to keep close supervision on what was being done in the country had this result, that we were breeding away from milk.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Minister should study this whole system much more carefully. He ought to give the matter much more attention.  He should make ample financial provision for the research work necessary in this new system of breeding.  We should not go blindfolded into this thing.  This system has tremendous potentialities.  Other countries have proved that.  Experts who can speak with knowledge, men like Sir John Hammond, are confident that it has great potentialities.  They issue the warning that we should step carefully, that this system requires much investigation and experimentation.  Is all that work to be left to the agricultural societies, the creamery societies? Will they have to do their own research? Will they have to blunder along without any technical direction or any advisory committee with special statutory powers and special financial provisions?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="326" /> If the Minister and the Department are interested only to the extent of providing legislation of this sort, merely an enabling section to empower the civil servants in Merrion Street to make regulations to which we can object by an annulment motion, then I think the whole idea of dealing with this matter is highly objectionable.  The Minister may tell us that this is a British system.  The British were involved in a war when they adopted the system.  We have more time to deal with legislation; we can give ample consideration to whatever provisions are required.  This system of breeding ought as far as possible to be made statute law.</P>
    <P>I object vehemently to this system of legislation.  I am disappointed with the Minister's handling of this matter.  He gives us no information; he merely asks the House for the power set out in Section 3.  There is no national scheme, no optimism as to the future utilisation of this new system.  We have had only a scant account of what happened at Cambridge.  There was little reference to the rapid increase in the use of artificial insemination and the success that has attended the efforts of Sir John Hammond in stepping up the milking capacity of animals.</P>
    <P>It has been established beyond any doubt that you can raise milk yields enormously by the utilisation of a suitable sire.  The man who owns the cow that holds the world's milk yield record lives in the United States and uses his animal artificially on his own herd.  It is an independent unit and the animal is not used outside the farm.  In the British legislation there is a provision indicating that there is no necessity for a licence where the animal is used privately for the cows on the farm.</P>
    <P>We have no information from our Minister, no plan, no financial provision&mdash;merely power to enable him to make regulations to govern one station, that at Mallow.  Who will satisfy our farmers that this is a good system to step up the milking capacity of cattle? Will the State carry out any research? Are we to be as good as other countries or shall we have to wait to benefit from the researches in other countries? <Col N="327" /> Is that the Government's attitude to our agricultural problem?</P>
    <P>A country like this, that is depending to such an extent on agriculture, ought to be a pioneer in work of this sort.  The Dáil ought to be far more ambitious so far as the use of artificial insemination on a commercial basis is concerned.  The problem is an acute one.  The Minister talked about setting up a committee of farmers.  I do not think that he has attempted to do that yet.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister to make the necessary financial provisions for this and not do the job in a slipshod fashion.  This has not been put before the House in a constructive way.  It is little or no use.  I would prefer to see the Minister come in here with a national scheme.  Sound financial provisions are essential if we are to carry out the necessary research.  I am disappointed with the way the Minister has handled the matter.  This is a poor compliment to the pioneers of this work in this country.  I want to pay a tribute to the courage, capacity and enterprise of the group of farmers in the Mallow district who were keen and clear-sighted enough to spend a very considerable sum in establishing a station there and in sending a veterinary officer to Great Britain to qualify himself in this work. It has been a magnificent piece of work on their part and they are entitled to a tribute from this House.  That is the spirit that will raise agriculture out of the rut it is in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we have to depend on private initiative to that extent. If we are to save agriculture, if we are to expand production, if we <Col N="328" /> are to reach the targets that may be set one of these days in London, we want leadership and we look to Merrion Street for that leadership.  It is not forthcoming in this legislation; in this slipshod fashion you will get nowhere.  It will not inspire what is most essential&mdash;confidence.  Our people must have confidence in the future, they must feel that we are planning clearly and constructively, that we will get a clear vision of the future, knowing the goal towards which we are moving. Above all, for that we want leadership, and this is not the way to achieve it.</P>
    <P>The Minister must sit down and think this matter over again.  He had enough knowledge to appreciate that there is a milk problem: let him have the courage to face the situation and not be satisfied if the Department pushes this sort of thing under his nose.  He must tell the officials that it is not good enough, that he wants a plan which he can bring into Dáil Éireann to tell the whole story.  They must give him a plan for the expansion of this particular method of breeding dairy stock, which has been so successful in the United States, in Great Britain and in Russia, first of all.  We are in rather a tight jam economically and we must sit up and take stock.  Above all, we want leadership.  That responsibility has been put on the Minister and he must accept it.  He will have to improve his hand over this, if he is to give that leadership.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Hughes has said, the Department should meet the matter by making financial provision. This is a new method which has been adopted by a group of enterprising men in County Cork and I am glad the Minister has met the wishes of those people.  It is the duty of the Department to see that this artificial insemination is not being abused and I hope that, in the near future, the Minister will co-operate more fully with stations of this kind.  Over a long period of years, the losses and the difficulties encountered by enterprising men and by the owners of live stock and dairy stock caused them to seek methods to overcome the scourge of disease creeping through the country.  While I would not be in favour of the system and <Col N="329" /> think it is to an extent going against the law of nature, the unfortunate men are forced to take steps in order to protect the breeding industry because of this scourge of disease that has crept into dairy stocks.  For that reason, it is wise to take this step.</P>
      <P>This is a new pursuit and the Department will have to be very careful. Maybe in the near future, with the issue of licences to certain groups, the Minister will need to guard against abuse and people might be compelled to come within certain areas or stations where this practice is being carried on.  In fairness to the people carrying it out and in fairness to the Minister, it is a good thing that this should be sponsored by the Department, as it will help to overcome certain difficulties in other areas by discouraging disease getting into the cattle stocks.  Without a shadow of doubt, live stock and dairy stock are the bedrock of our agricultural and national economy.  For that reason, I would approve of this particular measure and give the Minister every assistance to see that it is perfected without any abuses being attached to it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hughes made one of his usual speeches here in regard to this measure.  The speech he delivered is a stock one with him.  If I judge aright, this is more or less an experiment which the Department is undertaking and the Minister would be very right to hasten slowly.  I think he is going the right way about it.  I prefer to see this handled as it has been handled already, by such an organisation as a co-operative society or a group of farmers in co-operation, instead of leaving the whole thing to the Department and to the Government. The enterprising group round Mallow which got going on this experiment are to be congratulated and encouraged and I am satisfied that that is what the Minister is doing in introducing this short piece of legislation.  That is the right way to approach it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hughes is very much up in the air in his whole approach to a number of agricultural questions.  Once upon a time, Deputy Corry said that Deputy Hughes reads too many books and I am inclined to agree with that <Col N="330" /> suggestion.  No matter what experiments are carried out in artificial insemination, it will be utilised only very gradually, if at all, by a big number of dairy farmers in this country. They will stick to the old methods they know about and if Deputy Hughes thinks this is going to be a panacea or remedy for all the ills and difficulties dairy farmers have to contend with in live-stock breeding, he is very much in the air and will be very disappointed.  The Minister has been acting on the right lines in introducing this measure by way of experiment and when the experiment has got a chance if there is anything in the thing he can come along and introduce a more permanent kind of measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephHallide" hpid="Mr. Halliden Mr. Halliden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>I approve of the measure and the proposals of the Miniter in so far as it is an effort, as I believe it is, to do all that possibly can be done to improve the milk yield of our cattle.  I have had practical experience over a great many years of the efforts being made by various societies and co-operative organisations to increase the milk yield and milk inheritance, but we find that the bulls which produced the best dairy cattle are very often slaughtered before their merits as producers of good dairy animals are known.  For a number of years, the Dairy Shorthorn Breeders' Society instituted cup competitions for the best yields of milk shown by our dairy shorthorn cattle.  They have had heifers with very high yields of milk, but when we go back and try to trace the sires of those heifers, we find they have been slaughtered.  That is the trouble all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The function of an insemination centre such as outlined by the Minister would be to preserve these bulls and to use the semen as far as possible cautiously and to hasten slowly to see how it may succeed.  It seems that it has gone beyond the experimental stage in America and other countries. I would like to pay a tribute to the Ballyclough Co-operative Society, who were the first people in this country to start an insemination centre.  I have been there and I know they have done their best to procure the best dairy bulls in the country; and, so far, the <Col N="331" /> progeny of the animals produced by an insemination system is very encouraging. I have no doubt that with proper supervision and careful handling it could be made a great success in this country because the point was all the time that bulls who were able to transmit a milking inheritance were slaughtered before the merits of their progeny became known.  This is very unfortunate and something should be done in that direction.  We all know that for a number of years there has been a serious falling off in milk production in the country because of various circumstances such as the lack of feeding-stuffs and one cause and another.  I take it that this is a step in the right direction.  Under wise and careful supervision by the Minister for Agriculture it will produce as good results in this country as in any other country.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt.  I may not know half as much about the breeding of cattle as the Deputy does but the vast majority of people with whom we mix must be of the same mind.  The Deputy from Waterford spoke with prejudice against this practice.  Since I came into this House I have met farmers who said that this business could not be lucky. Any individual who starts to break down a prejudice of that kind must display courage and he had the confidence of the men on this side of the House who are as interested in the new practice as Deputy Hughes says he is.</P>

      <P>He has shown wisdom in introducing Section 3, <Col N="332" /> which Deputy Hughes is inclined to blame him for.  My regret is that when he was naming the particular animals to which it applies he did not go far enough and extend it also to the insemination of queen bees, because the honey-bee must be regarded as a source of wealth to people in this country who might not be able to afford to keep a number of cattle but who can afford a couple of stocks of bees.  If Deputy Hughes is interested in the advantages of insemination and its application to that source of wealth, the honey-bee, he would find in the <i>American Feature</i> of September, 1947, an article on this particular matter.  One of the things which is outlined in the article is that the apparatus for insemination is able to be sold to all and sundry who want to avail of it.  If that were done, there is no reason to doubt that it might have the opposite effect to that which the Minister has in mind when he introduced a measure for the purpose of controlling and regulating the new practice.  What applies to the insemination of bees applies to the insemination of cattle and other animals, and it is absolutely necessary that the Minister should assume that control to prevent, not the use but the abuse of insemination, and I congratulate him on his courage and wisdom.</P>

That is all I am asking here.  Deputy Hughes has complained that I have not, in addition to seeking powers provided for in this measure, incorporated in my opening statement a long discourse in regard to the wisdom or unwisdom or the benefits deriving in other lands through the practice of this method of breeding.  Deputy Hughes opened by informing us that he was sceptical of the wisdom of this method of breeding.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is free to make a correction and I understand that the practice has grown up in this House, that Deputies with sufficient time at their disposal after making statements, should correct those statements, so the Deputy can do what a number of others have already made a practice of doing.  I took it that he was not enthusiastic for this method but he went on to cite the advantages of it and its progress in other lands. I am like the other farmers to whom <Col N="334" /> references have already been made.  I am not very keen about it.  As a matter of fact, just like them, I was prejudiced against this method until I went to Mallow.  I went to the Mallow station some months after my appointment as Minister for Agriculture and after visiting this station I had changed my mind somewhat and now I am in a frame of mind that I think that any group of persons who do as the committee at the Mallow station did are entitled to be encouraged and be congratulated in whatever way we can.  When these proposals become law, if a similar group were to approach me with a view to the establishment, particularly in a creamery district, of another centre, I should be inclined to give them what encouragement I could.  I shall have to decide the policy of my Department towards this method of breeding.  I have no proposals to make to the House.  I can give no indication now as to the extent I should be prepared to co-operate in this matter or to assist it in a financial way, nor am I now in a position to say whether my Department will directly take part in an experiment of this kind.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputies who state that I should have those powers and that those who undertake this method in an experimental way should be encouraged but, in spite of the advance, undoubtedly, made in other lands, this is still a matter in respect of which we must proceed with a reasonable degree of caution.  That is my general attitude. If I were even strongly hopeful that, as a result of the adoption of this method of breeding, I could shorten substantially the period in which we could bring back the milking capacity of our dairy cows, I should be inclined to look favourably upon the system. Not only that, but I should be prepared to go to the Government and&mdash;on that condition&mdash;ask them to make a substantial contribution for that purpose.  I am afraid I shall not have the evidence which would enable me to take that course.  Therefore, the policy I propose to follow in relation to this particular method of breeding is, as Deputies recommended, one of caution.  There is no demand on the part of the farmers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>They cannot get them in Britain.  In the artificial insemination centres there, they cannot get bulls of the type or number they require.  That problem will remain for a long time, because, even if we had a number of these centres stocked with proven bulls, if we do not develop our milk-recording system, how are we to learn the results or how are we to get the fullest advantage to be derived from a system of this kind?

I introduced this measure for the simple reason that I thought, I, or any person in my position, should have the right, authority and power, when application is made to set up a centre of this kind, to say whether it should be set up or not and, if I decided that it should, that I should be in a position to stipulate the conditions under which that could be done.  At some later date, when I shall have given the matter more careful thought, I may have some further pronouncement to make regarding my own attitude and that of my Department towards this method of breeding and the contribution, if any, which we propose to make to encourage it.</P>

      <P>Yesterday, in reply to questions put by Deputies Heskin, Corry and myself, the Minister said that, in replying to similar questions on the 20th January, 1947, and 6th May, 1947, he &ldquo;gave the House to understand that it was my intention to set up a permanent tribunal or commission to advise as to appropriate producers' costs for agricultural products.  Since then, I have given the matter further consideration and have decided that, instead of the proposals then contemplated, I propose making a submission to the Government recommending the establishment in my own Department of a costings section to advise me on matters relating to the cost of production of agricultural products&rdquo;.  In reply to supplementary questions, the Minister rather aggressively claimed that he had a right to change his mind. The right to change one's mind is accorded generally to ladies, but I think that even his worst enemy will not accuse the Minister of being a lady or <Col N="337" /> even of possessing many lady-like qualities.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be true.  The Minister was new to his position&mdash;I will admit that.  However, the Minister is not so very young not to know that this question of agricultural costs and costings has been debated in this House and throughout the country over a long period.  Every manufacturer, every producer who has sought Government assistance, every manufacturer who has established a new industry under protective tariffs has demanded and secured that he will obtain his costs of production plus a margin of profit.  We farmers frequently ask for higher prices for our produce&mdash;particularly during the war years&mdash;and we are often told that we are trying to exploit the rest of the community and to hold the rest of the country up to ransom.  It is, therefore, necessary that there should be official indisputable costings upon which a farmer's case could be based and upon which the community would be able to see that the farmer was not asking for anything excessive or for anything more than his cost of production plus a reasonable margin of profit.  The Minister in asserting his right to change his mind is asserting the right of any ordinary individual in any ordinary circumstances. However, when a definite pledge is given either to a national Parliament or to anybody else, but particularly to a national Parliament, that pledge ought not be broken.  A motion was tabled early this year by Deputy Halliden and myself.  The motion was as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the Government should set up a tribunal, or other authority, to inquire into the cost of production of <Col N="338" /> all farm produce with a view to ensuring that farmers shall obtain an economic price for such produce.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Within ten minutes of the handing in of that motion at the general office two prominent members of the Fianna Fáil Party handed in an almost similar motion.  Those two motions were debated in this House on the 14th and on the 26th of February.  It was reasonable to assume that since the case for those two motions was strong and unanswerable they would have been accepted by Dáil Éireann.  They were proposed by this Party.  They were supported by Fine Gael and, so far as I remember, by the Labour Party also. In addition, a similar motion was proposed by two members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  In that situation it appeared inevitable that the motions would be carried.  The Minister came into this House knowing perhaps that Dáil Éireann would pass those motions and he gave a very solemn pledge that he would introduce legislation immedately to implement the proposals contained in them.  He appeared to me at the time to be almost impatient and nasty because I was pressing him for the strongest possible assurance and because I was, apparently, casting some doubt upon his intention to implement those proposals.  He repeated several times a statement such as this which I quote from column 1447 of the Official Report of Wednesday, 26th February, 1947:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As I have said, I have given an assurance that there will be no undue or unnecessary delay in bringing them forward so far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>When that stage is reached, it will be quite in order for Deputies to give expression to many of the points of view to which expression has been given here.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister continued further:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I must say that I regard this discussion as a complete and absolute waste of time on the part of those who are always complaining of the inability of the Government to provide them with the time to discuss Private Deputies' business.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I was inclined to doubt the Minister's word.  I was inclined to be afraid that the Minister would change his mind but he asserted so strongly that he would not go back on his promise that Deputy Halliden and myself agreed to withdraw the motion. I consider that that was an outrage upon this Parliament.  In order to prevent a decision from being taken upon a very important national question he gave an undertaking that he was going to implement the terms of the proposal before the House.  I consider that that was a matter upon which the Minister himself, without being asked any question, should have come forward to the House with an apology.  This matter represents such an important reform that I was almost surprised when the Minister informed the House that he was going to implement it.  For years there has been pressure on the Minister's predecessors to adopt a proposal of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the last Great War when there were investigations into costings this matter has been considered urgent by farmers because farmers have realised that until there are official figures which will be accepted and not disputed in regard to their costings they cannot be assured of a reasonable and a decent margin of profit.  We know that at the present time the situation is very serious.  We know that farmers are being asked to produce, to expand, and to enlarge agricultural production.  We know they are being asked to produce for prices which leave them at a definite loss on their actual costings.  The Minister knows that.  He knows that the farmers are losing enormously <Col N="340" /> on the production of wheat and that this year they are even losing enormously on the production of barley. We know that in Great Britain, with a Socialist Government, with a Government that cannot be said to be agricultural or pro-agricultural, there has been a substantial increase and the whole range of prices is higher than here and that they are guaranteed for several years.  In addition to better prices in Great Britain there are, also, acreage subsidies which enable the farmer to produce at a profit: subsidies of £10 per acre for potatoes: £3 per acre for wheat and rye.  Why have these prices been given to the farmers of Great Britain?&mdash;simply because the Government there realises that the farmer cannot be asked to produce at a loss. No industry could produce at a loss and still survive.  However, in this country, we have a Government which relies on force, on tillage Orders, on compulsion, on an army of inspectors and a Minister for Agriculture who declares his intention to send in tractors not through gateways but over fences and ditches, if necessary.  That is the attitude of the Government here towards agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is no intention, no desire, to find out what it costs the farmer to produce and to give him at least his production costs.  It is an outrage and a breach of faith with Dáil Éireann.  I do not know how Deputy Corry regards it but I think it is an extraordinary thing that a pledge given to a member of the Government Party should be violated, as this pledge has been.  I did not mind the Minister breaking pledges to Opposition members.  Perhaps he has no love for them.  It is a very serious matter to break a solemn promise given to the entire House, on the strength of which the House agreed to the withdrawal of proposals which were before it.</P>

      <P>I have been for a long number of years, in this House and outside it, endeavouring to get agriculture, which is the greatest industry in <Col N="341" /> this State, placed on a level with other industries.  Other industrialists may present their costs of production to a tribunal which will consider them and allow a profit on them.  Agriculture is the industry on which the people of this State have to depend in every emergency. Without it they must starve. We find that industry in the position of having to compete with industrialists for labour.  It is the worst paid industry in the State, with no hope of coming to a position in which it can pay its labourers a wage in keeping with the cost of living.  That is our present position and that has been our position for a number of years.  Anybody having the slightest knowledge of agriculture must admit that during the past two years the price of wheat in this country has not been an economic price, a price at which the farmer could afford to grow wheat.  Anybody outside a lunatic asylum could not allege that it is an economic price.  Farmers this year are threshing three to four barrels per acre of wheat.  The only cereal that is left free&mdash;oats&mdash;is making £5 a ton in the public market more than the price the Minister has fixed for wheat.  That is our present position.</P>
      <P>We sought the only means there is of protecting ourselves, the establishment of a tribunal before which farmers could present their costs of production and say: &ldquo;There is the cost of production.  We want a profit on that.&rdquo;  Since we got this guarantee from the Minister and from his predecessor, we went to certain trouble and expense in order to get costings. We in Cork arranged with a professor of the university who is an expert on costings to take costings for milk in the case of a number of milk producers. We had the results ready to go before a tribunal.  I have a great deal of admiration for the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <P>I want to put the position as clearly as I see it.  I consider that the Minister has acted unfairly.  This industry, which is the greatest industry in this country, must get fair play.  All that we on behalf of the agricultural community are looking for from anybody is fair play.  Agricultural labourers are being taken from the fields every day of the week by industrialists who are supposed to be placed on a level with us but who can pay three times the wages we can pay.  That is the present position.  If we send a man to deliver milk in Cork City we get a letter from him to say that he is going to work in one of the industries.  That is the situation and until the Minister realises it he will find that instead of stepping up production he will step down production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the attitude adopted towards wheat-growing for the past few years has resulted in wheat being a most unpopular crop.  I say that as one who is a believer in wheat-growing, a believer in the policy that this country should grow its own bread and keep its people in any emergency. There has been done with the agricultural industry what dare not be done with any other industry.  I challenge the Minister for Industry and Commerce to go to the millers in the morning and to tell them that they will have to produce flour at less than the cost of production.  I would like to know what their answer would be. They would close down the mills.  To the industry that is providing food for the people the Government say: &ldquo;You must produce.  If you have ten acres of land you must plough a certain area. You must put a certain area under wheat.&rdquo;  When, as a result of that, you do not get the price of the seed, you are told that next year they will talk to you about that.  It is rather reminiscent of the policy of the Sugar Company who told you, when you had a bad year, that they would fix you up the next year.  That kind of thing has gone on for long enough and I suggest to the Minister that he should make a definite statement as to his intentions <Col N="344" /> in connection with this matter, in connection with the two guarantees that were given by his predecessor and at least one guarantee that was given by him.  I want to give the Minister plenty of time to reply.</P>

      <P>On the 24th January, 1947, I moved a motion in the Dáil asking that a tribunal or commission be set up.  The Minister gave an assurance that the tribunal would be set up.  I was rather amazed to find to-day that there has been a variation in the promise that he made at that time.  Our idea was that agriculture, which is our basic industry, should be raised to the status of every other industry so that the farmer would be paid the cost of production plus a decent margin of profit for himself, his family and his workers.  The Minister stated yesterday that, instead of having this tribunal constituted as we thought it would be, its personnel will consist of officials of his own Department.  While I have the greatest confidence in those officials I would appeal to him to see that this commission or tribunal, when it is set up, will include practical farmers. There should be, at least a number of farmers on it.  At the moment there is a Costings Commission sitting which was set up by the Beet Growers' Association. A number of farmers are engaged on that with Professor Michael Murphy.  We would have more confidence in such a commission than in one consisting purely of civil servants. I appeal to the Minister to build up his commission on the same lines.  There should be a good number of practical farmers on it.</P>

      <P>In my private capacity I would not like to be accused, and would not like to feel, that I was a person who, on giving his word would be inclined to renege it.  In a matter that would be a personal one, I would know exactly all the circumstances relating to the undertaking that I had given.  It may <Col N="345" /> be that I am dense, but I can see no relationship between an undertaking given in relation to some matter that concerns a man personally and a declaration made in good faith at the time with no intention of doing other than honouring it, and then finding on closer examination a more attractive method and system of achieving largely the same thing.  I cannot see, in taking such a course as that, that I as a Minister can be accused of a breach of faith.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry has reminded me that I should have made an announcement to the country when I found myself shaken as to the wisdom of establishing a commission or a tribunal.  Before the Dáil adjourned, Deputy Corry asked me, at the conclusion of my speech on the Estimate, if it were my intention to set up this tribunal.  Although I do not think that in my reply&mdash;I have not the report before me&mdash;I made it as clear as I might have, at least I gave him to understand, I think, that I was in grave doubt as to the wisdom of proceeding along the lines that I had previously indicated.</P>
      <P>I remember when I was young&mdash;when first I struck off to a ceilidhe&mdash;I thought I was a great fellow until it got dark. Sometime during the night, maybe it was 9 o'clock or 10 o'clock, I started for home.  I was crossing a hill and there was a bit of a moon which was sometimes covered by fast-moving clouds.  As I climbed up I saw some small black object on the top of the hill and said: &ldquo;What in the devil is that?&rdquo; I pretended that I did not care.  I kept going on, but the nearer I came to the object the larger it became.  I was terribly frightened.  I said that I must go the whole hog now, anyhow. When I got up to it the object, instead of being something dangerous&mdash;whether a ghost or an animal or whatever thought that may have occurred to me as to what it might be, I found it was a rush bush.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That often happens.  I had proposals for the establishment of this tribunal roughly framed.  They were perhaps casually examined by me.  As I made a closer analysis of them as to how they would work, as to how they would be operated, and I asked myself what <Col N="346" /> kind would the tribunal be, would there be farmers on it, would there be technicians on it, would it be a tribunal of all technicians, would it be one of part technicians and part farmers or would it consist of all farmers, am I to be accused of a breach of faith if, on a closer examination of this problem, I failed to find a satisfactory answer to these questions?  I do not mind being accused, but I do not think it is fair to accuse me of a breach of faith in any way.</P>
    <P>I have before me a report of a discussion in this House which took place some time in 1942 when my predecessor established the Post-war Agricultural Committee.  I have here the Parliamentary questions which were addressed to him by Deputy Hughes and Deputy Cogan suggesting that that committee was composed largely of technical people.  The whole discussion that took place goes to show the dissatisfaction that was displayed by these Deputies because, as they said, there was not any practical farmer on it. Suppose, as I tried to explain yesterday, I were to set up a committee of technicians, what would farmers say? Suppose I set up a committee of technicians and farmers would there not be a constant struggle between the two. There would not be an intelligent technical discussion or examination of a particular problem but a wrangle between the two sections as to which of them would get the best out of it: as to which of them would secure the recommendation that would be most favourable to a particular class.</P>

I have come to the conclusion that the course which I propose to suggest to them is a more <Col N="347" /> feasible one.  It is one in which I have faith and I have that faith in it after the most careful examination that it was possible for me to give to the setting up of this machinery and trying to see how that machinery would work. I believe that the machinery which I am suggesting should be set up will work much more efficiently and satisfactorily both from the point of view of the farmers and the general community.</P>
