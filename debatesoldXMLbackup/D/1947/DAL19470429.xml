      <P>Deputy Mulcahy has given me notice of a question relative to an alleged violation of the privileges of the House.  As such matters take priority, I am allowing him to put that question now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say that, in the papers of yesterday, there is an account of a speech by the Minister for Local Government which makes serious allegations against the Chair.  In the report in the <i>Irish Press</i>, at three separate points in his speech the Minister makes these remarks:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This Assembly is becoming a place where Parliamentary immunity is availed of to license slander and where the coarse tongue of a corner boy can precipitate a brawl with but the weakest intervention from the Chair.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Later, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I cannot help reflecting how regrettable it is that those responsible for controlling the proceedings of Dáil Éireann should have permitted him and his friends to cover their contempt for the courts with the privileges that attach to the proceedings of that Assembly.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Finally, towards the end of his speech, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Unfortunately, those responsible had been allowed too much licence by those sitting in the Chair.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question arises: if a Deputy can so criticise the Chair with impunity, the House is in this difficulty, that no self-respecting member of it will ever take the Chair or can easily remain in it if he takes it.  I want to submit that <Col N="1528" /> the Ceann Comhairle, as an officer of this House, serves a vital function, that everybody in the House is interested in the manner in which he is treated in his office, that this is a matter of concern for the whole House and is entirely above Party.  The Ceann Comhairle is the sole judge of order and, in that matter, he is not subject to direction or control by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or the majority of this House or any other power or body.  He can be criticised only by substantive motion moved here.  I suggest that, if any Deputy in the House can, with impunity, criticise the Chair in the manner in which the Minister for Local Government has done, a problem is created of which there can be little hope of solution.  I suggest that a person who offends in this particular way should not be able to serve in the House until such time as he shall have tendered a suitable apology to the Chair for his action.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the matter on the understanding that the matter could be settled by appreciation on the <Col N="1529" /> part of the Minister of the problems involved for the House.  I did not think that it would be necessary to put a motion before the House on a matter so clear and so simple.  If the matter cannot be resolved without putting a motion before the House, I have a motion which I would ask the Government to take.</P>

      <P>Regarding the statement made by a Deputy, I am reluctant to intervene, being personally concerned in this case.  It concerns the whole House as much as it concerns the Chair or the Vice-Chair. Ministers have a right to be heard unless they are actually suspended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That in view of his speech, reported in the daily papers of Monday, 28th April, in which the Minister for Local Government criticises adversely the conduct of the Chair in the Dáil, the Dáil is of opinion that the Minister should be suspended from the service of the House until he has made a suitable apology in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Though questions of privilege take precedence I suggest that an interval would be advisable. Time might then be afforded as early as possible for its discussion.</P>

      <P>Surely, where a Minister or a Deputy&mdash;I do not want to prejudge the issue&mdash;gives utterance to a statement such as that by the Minister for Local Government, the question is a matter that must be settled now, as to whether he should take part in the business of the House or whether the Chair can allow him to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I object personally to sitting in a House where a Minister of the Government criticises the Ceann Comhairle in the terms in which the Minister for Local Government has criticised him and I appeal to the Leader of the Government, to the Taoiseach, to realise the position in which the House is put if we are asked to sit here to-day feeling that the Ceann Comhairle is in the position in which he has been put by the Minister for Local Government.  I had this motion drafted here, preparing for an emergency, but I think that emergency is here now and that now, a quarter past three, is the time to discuss this matter.  Can we not have an acceptance by the Government that business cannot be carried on here if any Deputy in the House, not to speak of a Minister, and with a prepared statement carefully circulated to all the Press, sets out at three different points of his speech to criticise the Chair?  I say it is above Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a rule that those who come to seek equity should come with clean hands.  I could not help, as I listened to Deputy Mulcahy, thinking of the position of another very important functionary of the State. He is not fortified or in the same position of dealing with the matter as we are in to-day.</P>

I am aware, however, that there is difficulty and delay in obtaining this country's full requirements of tractors.  Every possible action has been taken with a view to securing speedier delivery.  As the distribution of tractors within this country is not subject to official control, I cannot assist any particular individual to obtain his requirements out of the supplies becoming available, and inquiries in this direction should be pursued through normal trade channels.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that some kind of vehicle which was used to draw artillery during the war is readily convertible into a tractor for agricultural purposes, but has been refused permission to enter duty free as an agricultural tractor because the Revenue Commissioners have determined that it comes within the description of a vehicle?  Would the Minister look into that, with a view to directing the Revenue Commissioners to review that decision, in the light of the acute shortage of tractors that prevails, where they are satisfied that the farmer really means to use such a vehicle as a tractor?</P>

Od. a ton loaded on lorries; that this offer was refused as quotations would not be accepted other than f.o.r. at the nearest railway station; if he is further aware that lorry owners in this area, who had saved turf, were not allowed petrol to draw turf to railway stations, the petrol issued to them being ear-marked for the purpose of drawing county council turf from distant parts of the county; and if he will take timely steps to avoid losses in turf depreciation by ensuring that petrol will be made available this year for the transport of turf cut by private citizens.</P>

      <P>Privately produced turf &mdash;whether in Kerry or elsewhere&mdash;is normally purchased by Fuel Importers, Limited, on a f.o.r. basis.  It is not practicable to buy on a loaded-at-bog basis.  During the summer and autumn petrol is made readily available to lorry owners for all haulage to railhead, except where the lorry concerned has been hired on a whole-time basis for the haulage of national turf.  From November to June, petrol allowances are not granted for the movement of turf to private individuals.  A remunerative market is assured for all <Col N="1535" /> privately produced turf of good quality, but the question of making transport available at any particular time must be considered in relation to the volume of turf offering for movement and the necessity for providing for the requirements of domestic consumers in the non-turf areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

The combined cost of the operations (e), (f) and (g), i.e., from railhead to ricking in the dumps is 8/10½; this figure cannot be broken down, as the operations in questions are ordinarily covered by one contract entered into as the result of competitive tenders.  These figures do not include any provision for overheads.

      <P>I am not aware that the water supply a Ballinamore is unsatisfactory and inadequate.  The scheme was completed in 1937 at a cost of £6,300 and was designed to deliver 30,000 gallons daily, representing 35 gallons per head of the population.</P>
      <P>A complaint was addressed to my Department in July, 1945, to the effect that a section of the town was receiving water during portion of the day only.  On inquiry it was learnt that the limited allocation of fuel oil then available for pumping was not sufficient to supply the higher levels continuously. The allocation of oil was subsequently increased, and no further representations in regard to the matter have been addressed to me.</P>

      <P>In June, 1945, the Westmeath County Council submitted, as a post-emergency scheme, draft plans for connecting 198 labourers' cottages in the town of Mullingar to existing sewers and watermains. These plans included the 40 houses at Springfield Street referred to in the question.  The plans were the subject of discussion in October, 1945, with the council's engineers, and certain improvements were suggested.  In December, 1945, the council submitted draft lay-out plans for the provision of 84 houses at Springfield Street.  These plans provide for a new 6-inch watermain and a new 9-inch sewer.  On the 2nd September, 1946, I informed the county council that a report from their town planning consultant should be obtained on the development of the area in order to ensure that any housing proposals would be in conformity with planning developments.  It will probably be found possible to provide for sanitary services to the existing cottages at Springfield Street when the new area is being developed.  I am writing to the local authority with regard to the extension of sewerage and water facilities to the remaining labourers' cottages in Mullingar and for the views of their town planning consultant as to the future development of the Springfield Street area.  No proposals for the financing of the scheme have been passed by the council.</P>

The price at Cappoquin forest was raised from 32/- to 46/- a cord following the recent general price increase of firewood.  This increase compensates to some extent for the Department's extra expenses due to increased costs in recent times including wage increases to forestry workmen which preceded the price increase by some months.

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The House discussed the section at great length on Friday and pleaded with the Taoiseach to answer some of the question that were then raised.  The Taoiseach seemed to indicate that he would do that in his own time.  I would like him, when replying to the questions that were raised on Friday, to answer this question: sub-section (1) of this section says that on the passing of this Act, all further proceedings in the pending action shall, by virtue of this section, be stayed and he makes his general case for section 10 that to take any action other than to pass this section and to take this matter entirely out of the courts, would squander money.  In column 1754 of the Dáil Debates of the <Col N="1550" /> 11th March, dealing with the introduction of this measure, the Taoiseach says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...the present Sinn Féin organisation proceeded to take action in the courts.  They issued a plenary summons in which both the Attorney-General and Judge Power were cited as defendants.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then I intervened and I said: &ldquo;When was that?&rdquo; and the Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;About the end of 1941.  In December and January at that time there were some communications and I would say it was in January, 1942, that the plenary summons was issued. Considerable expense was incurred by the defendants in preparing the material necessary in order to deal with the case.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So that this case was taken up either at the end of 1941 or in January, 1942, and it was not until March, 1947, more than five years later, that the Taoiseach, whose point now is that this Bill is intended to prevent the wasting of money, brought in this Bill.  I would ask him if he can justify the grounds which he now puts before the House for this section and for taking out of the courts a case which has been in the courts for the last five years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are entitled to know what is the purpose of the machinery set up in Section 10.  The machinery set up in Section 10 is to prevent this case from going into the courts, the Taoiseach says, in order to avoid money being frittered away.  Now, the specialist in misrepresentation throws a new light on the matter.  He says that is not the purpose at all.  He says the purpose of this Bill is to provide a fund out of which the victims of Black-and-Tan tyranny in this country may get some assistance.  If the Minister is right in the matter, the Taoiseach has been deluding us and fooling us all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the abusive mouth-organ of the Party is being let out to tell the country an entirely different story.  He tells us that the purpose of the Bill is to provide some sum of money to relieve cases of distress among people who were victims of Black-and-Tan tyranny.  Is that the purpose of the Bill?  I do not believe for one minute that it is the purpose of the Bill.  I think that is a subtle little subterfuge on the part of the Government in order to get themselves out of the legal difficulties involved in this matter.  They probably said to themselves: &ldquo;In order to kill this Bill we will pretend that the real purpose of the money is to relieve distress among people who have suffered and for whom every citizen in this country has very considerable sympathy.&rdquo;  I suggest that the real purpose of this Bill is not to make these funds available for the victims of Black-and-Tan tyranny but to keep the Taoiseach and members of the Government out of the law courts, having regard to all the ghostly stories that may be told of the past and all the compromising political utterances that might be adduced there in all their old-time nakedness and of the embarrassment that might flow.  If the Minister for Local Government is right in his assertion, I want to ask the Taoiseach if he contends with any process of reason that this country and this Legislature could not make available to-morrow, if it so desired, £1,000,000 of money for the purpose of <Col N="1552" /> relieving distress among victims of Black-and-Tan tyranny.  Is there any difficulty in doing so if we want to do it?  Have not we got an abundance of paper money to do it?  Had not we a declaration here a few years ago from the present Uachtaran when he was Minister for Finance that there was an abundance of money in this country for every worth-while object.  If we have an abundance of money for every worth-while object in this country, if we have sterling assets worth £400,000,000, cannot we quite easily introduce a simple Bill in this House setting aside £1,000,000 to be administered by an impartial committee among victims of Black-and-Tan tyranny or among those who suffered loss in the fight for freedom and who might not be covered by the strict interpretation of our pension code?  There is no difficulty in doing that.  The only difficulty I see is that the Government will not do it.  It is dishonest for the Minister for Local Government&mdash;deliberately and patently dishonest&mdash;to seek to give to the country the impression that the purpose of this legislation is to make these moneys available to relieve distress among people who were victims of Black-and-Tan tyranny.  That is not the purpose of the Bill at all.  It is a subtle, dirty little trick.  The Minister for Local Government knows perfectly well that by the time this Bill is through, and all the consequences flowing from this Bill have to be paid, there will be very little money available for those who might otherwise present a claim on this fund.  Even though the sum available will probably be in the vicinity of £10,000 or less, is that the best we can give them?  Does that represent the measure of our gratitude or the measure of our desire to help those who suffered?  If we are going to have an honest debate on this Bill we ought to know definitely who is correct in his statement.  Is the Taoiseach correct when he says it is to prevent moneys being frittered away or is it the Minister for Local Government who, apparently thinking that the Taoiseach was not making a sufficiently good job of this Bill, thought that his talents were necessary in order to clarify the position?  He went on the rampage last Saturday night and <Col N="1553" /> delivered the type of speech which, in any well conducted country, would result in his being sent out of the Cabinet on Sunday morning.  I want to try to get the basic truth as to what is the purpose behind the Bill.  Is the Minister for Local Government right or is the Taoiseach right?</P>

I invite him to end it now in the certain knowledge that all sides of the House will combine with him to make equal provision from the Exchequer as might have been made from the remnants of this fund for whatever body of persons the survivors of the old Sinn Féin movement rightly wish to assist.  Nobody in this House feels more strongly about these matters than I do.  Doubtless many feel as strongly.  Feeling as deeply as I do about it, I would be glad to see it disposed of on those terms.  That is not because I have any reluctance to fight this matter out to the bitter end.  I am ready and willing to do that.  I would sooner see an end made of it now <Col N="1554" /> before more damage than has already been done is done.</P>

That is the proposal in this section.  I think it is certainly another misfortune that that should be the position <Col N="1557" /> we have reached.

It was never allowed by the Chair in this Assembly even to pass a remark about a case which was <i>sub judice.</i>  All previous precedents have gone by the board and all previous rulings are completely inoperative in face of the upset that has come to a well-established precedent as to proper procedure and the propriety of Dáil action, in face of this particular section.  Not anticipating any motion which comes before the House to-morrow, but merely to make a point to indicate the reason and the justification for my opening remarks, another misfortune is the fact that a Minister of State so far forgot himself when discussing this Bill outside of this House that he used a political platform, a public hall, a Fianna Fáil ceilidhe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to make an attack on the Chair and the impartial administration of the Chair.  What are we proposing to do?  We are proposing to take from out of the custody of the Irish courts a sum of money that is there awaiting the decision of these courts, and that proposal is made by one of the parties to, not one, but two of the three splits that reduced that organisation to what the Taoiseach now describes as a position of insignificance. It would not be so bad, it would not be so improper, and it would not be so distasteful and nationally degrading if we had a Taoiseach and a Government supported by a Party over there that did not happen to be the principal in the discreditable dog-fight or dog-fights that took place between parties and peoples 25 years ago.  But imagine the quite natural resentment of any one of those parties who had been in conflict <Col N="1558" /> with other persons and other parties, and whose treasurers and trustees, with a sense of decency as to the proper thing to do, had consistently refused to break up the swag amongst any of the warring elements, no matter whether they were mighty or insignificant. When funds had been placed in the custody of the courts for anybody who could establish a claim to get the funds or to get their portion of the funds, was that the time for one of the principals in all those splits and dog-fights to come in by weight of a political majority and say: &ldquo;I am taking over the funds to be disposed of in accordance with my decision&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>The impropriety and indecency of such a course should be apparent to the Taoiseach, seeing that he was one of the principals in all those disputes and divisions and controversies and splits. To use a democratic institution, to use a Parliamentary majority for such a purpose is steamrolling completely any of the commonly accepted principles of democracy and is certainly trampling in the dirt any ordinary standards of fair play.  Is it the Taoiseach's contention that a Parliamentary majority, no matter how dumb, how disciplined or how regimented, can justify anything that is done by virtue of that majority? There was a time when it was contended that a majority had no right to do wrong.  Is it now the contention that the majority has a right to do anything, has a right to trample on the courts, has a right to snatch from the courts something that is entrusted to their custody for distribution or for safeguarding?  I think we have reached a point where it is not the amount of money that matters&mdash;if it was a ha'penny or a million; it is the principle of the thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is neither conscience nor decency nor principle associated with the particular proposal that is made here.  I do not claim by any manner of means to be a constitutional authority, but I claim as an ordinary citizen and as a plain Deputy the right to say that the Constitution of this country is a sham, a worthless sham, if it makes it possible and admissible for one rump of a political split, when it gets a <Col N="1559" /> majority, to wade, like a gang of gansters, even into the courts of Ireland and take from the custody of those courts the funds of that organisation, merely because others have not got a Parliamentary majority, merely because they are insignificant, merely because as a result of a split and splitters they are, comparatively speaking, powerless.</P>
    <P>What is our constitutional remedy? To appeal to the President to submit it to the Council of State.  And what is the procedure before the Council of State?  To refer it to the Chief Justice to see whether it is proper or improper, constitutional or otherwise.</P>

Does not even Deputy O'Connor see the impossible tangle that has been created by this particular Bill, impossible for the courts, impossible for the President, impossible for the Council of State, impossible for the insignificant persons or body that had the audacity to look to the courts of Ireland for justice, to look to the courts of Ireland for impartiality, merely to find a political body wading in to take the money and to distribute it amongst camp followers? That is the point we have reached.  No wonder the Taoiseach lost his head, no wonder the Ministers lost their heads.  Their heads were lost before that Bill was drafted.  There is every evidence of that on the face of the Bill.  I hope that even at this stage wiser counsels will prevail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy was accused by the Taoiseach and by his Ministers, inside and outside this House, of having been bullied by his legal colleagues into opposition to this Bill.  Does the Taoiseach suggest that the legal colleagues of Deputy Mulcahy bullied other individuals and every other Party in this House?  Does the Taoiseach think that the influence of <Col N="1560" /> those legal colleagues of the Deputy is not only able to throttle and humiliate a man of the standing and courage and character of Deputy Mulcahy, but that it is so great that they can make potboys out of an Independent Deputy like Deputy Dillon, the Leader of the Labour Party, the Leader of the Farmers' Party, the Leader of the Clann na Talmhan Party?</P>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach get away from his jaundiced, political bias, and will he not see that here, with the exception of a regimented pack, a Party where there is no will but the will of one man, every free Deputy and every free Party in this House is disgusted and nauseated by the intentions in this particular Bill, concentrated in this particular section, and will he show himself sufficiently democratic to bow to the free will and the independent thought of the overwhelming majority of free Deputies in this Dáil?</P>

      <P>The suggestion is that there is something extraordinary proposed in this Bill.  That is not true.  In several cases already the Legislature has come in to deal with matters which have been before the courts, even when they were decided by the courts, and to say even that the law was not as it was interpreted by the courts, but was deemed to have been different.  One would imagine that this was the first place in which there was a question of retroactive or retrospective legislation. That is not so.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At any time.  This Parliament has sovereign authority to make the law except in so far as its <Col N="1562" /> power is limited by the Constitution. As I said, in the earlier stages, if there is anything in this Bill which is contrary to the Constitution that matter can be settled in the usual way.  I am confident that there is nothing in this Bill which is in any way contrary to the Constitution.  It is not unusual for the State to introduce Bills of this kind.  There have been, in every book dealing with matters of this sort, instances of this kind.  It is the right of the Legislature to pass retroactive legislation. The one thing which it is forbidden to do in that particular way, under the Constitution, is to declare acts to be criminal, to be crimes, to be illegal, when they were not so at the date of their commission.  That is the one single obstacle that is put to retroactive legislation by this Parliament. In other Parliaments where they have no written Constitution, certain conventions have come to be regarded as governing their actions but legally they are sovereign and their acts cannot be legally questioned, as Acts of this House can be under the Constitution.  There is nothing unusual then in that sense in legislation of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is right of course that in any appropriate case a question should be raised as to whether a Bill is repugnant to the Constitution.  It is desirable that on a matter on which representatives of the people in Parliament will naturally have different views such questions should be raised but, as for suggesting that there is some extraordinary question of principle involved here, that is simply not true.  That objection is not based on anything sound.  It has been urged that it is the highest function of democracy that we should give way to the views expressed on the Opposition side.  I do think that in a deliberative Assembly if some of the people present put forward views from their side, even though these people may be split up into different Parties, consideration should be given to them but when due consideration is given to all the points raised, are we to say that if the Opposition plead principle the Party in power must necessarily to give way to them?  It is very easy to plead principle but am I <Col N="1563" /> to be regarded as such an innocent that I must believe that every one of the arguments to which I have listened here was made in good faith?  I have lived a certain length of time in this world.  I have listened to arguments under a variety of circumstances and there has been more make-believe, in my opinion, in the arguments that have been put forward from the other side during the debates on this Bill than in any other matter I have had anything to do with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is saying something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It does say a great deal.  Democracy, as I understand it, means that the people of the country elect their representatives in representative assemblies.  The idea in this Assembly is that every individual who is elected by the people stands on the same level here and that a vote on one side of the House is as good as a vote on the other side of the House, but the working of democracy is that when there is a difference of opinion and that difference comes to be resolved by a vote the majority vote should prevail.  Of course, Deputies on the opposite side say that because they are split up into several Parties, their vote should count for more.  I deny that.  Each one counts for what he is.  That is democracy.  The suggestion is that because a large section of the people or a large organisation elect a majority belonging to a particular Party, the votes of the members of that Party should not be regarded as equal to the votes on the opposite side.  We know that if the people on the opposite benches are split up into several Parties, it is because they have not a policy on which they could agree.  If they had a common policy on which they could agree, they would be one Party. Would they suggest that if they were one Party their votes should not count as much as if they were separate?  I think the whole thing is nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know what democracy means here.  We have a law-making institution, which is this House.  The duty of the Oireachtas is to make the law. <Col N="1564" /> The duty of the courts is to interpret the laws as they are there at any particular time.  They have never suggested that they should be allowed to make the laws.  If at any particular time the law is not what it should be, in the common interest, then it is the duty of the Legislature to make the situation accord with what the common interest demands.  You have, as I have said, the Legislature to make the laws. You have the courts&mdash;to do what?  To interpret the laws as they are there at any particular time.  It has never been denied by the courts, or never been held as any derogation of their position by the courts, that the Legislature should come in and exercise its proper function at any particular time.  There is no interference with the courts or with the independence of the courts in that.  The courts have their own proper function and they are allowed to carry out that proper function.</P>
    <P>We have, in addition, the Executive. The Executive here is subject to the day-by-day control of Parliament.  It can only exist as an Executive, if it has the support of the majority.</P>
    <P>I have no qualms whatever about this Bill.  As I said at an earlier stage, these funds were subscribed by the nation in a national struggle and the greater part of the nation subscribed to them.  When the divisions came, they were put into the courts and they have remained in the courts for the past 23 years.  A situation arose, as I have already informed the Dáil, in which the treasurers had died and in which the representative of the last treasurer came with a proposition that these funds should no longer be allowed to remain there.  I indicated willingness to deal with them by legislation, as was suggested, and it was only when the Legislature, so far as the Executive part of it is concerned, was seized of this particular matter, that an attempt was made to block it through the courts.  Are we to have the position in the future that, when the Legislature is about to deal with any matter which may affect the rights&mdash; and nearly all legislation does affect rights of one kind or another&mdash;of individuals or sections of the community, the Legislature can be brought to a standstill by the simple process of <Col N="1565" /> somebody affected running to the courts and trying to put in an action there?  When it became known that the Executive was about to bring this matter before Parliament, the courts were used in this particular way.</P>
    <P>The question then was: should we go ahead?  I thought that perhaps the matter would be tried quickly and that, if the expenses were not going to be very great, that was perhaps the best way to deal with it, but the years began to pass and then the defendants, the Attorney-General and Judge Wyse Power, pressed for a hearing of the case and took legal steps to bring it about and then we had other actions taking place.  It was suggested here that we should have intervened.  We could not very well have intervened to get a date set down for hearing, so long as this other side issue was being tried, and the trouble with all these cases is that motion after motion can be brought in to delay and cause extra expense.  It is not merely the plaintiffs who undergo expense in this case. Those who are defending the funds have to incur expense also, and, if they really mean to defend the funds, they have to take every possible care to make sure that the people who, in their opinion, are not entitled to them should not get them, and, consequently, you have expense after expense piled up.</P>
    <P>I must say that when I asked what expenses had been incurred, I was shocked, as members of the House have been shocked, by the figures given to me.  I did not ask that anybody should exaggerate or give me an exorbitant account as to the sums spent, but I saw that a position would be reached in which we were going to have the old situation, in which the amount which those who succeeded in a litigation for those funds would get would be trifling, because the moneys would, in the meantime, have been lost in legal costs, no matter which side judgment was given for.  On the previous day I said that if this case went for hearing it was a case which was likely to last for three or four weeks, inasmuch as the proving of continuity or whatever else might be in it would have involved going through the history, in a sense, of the <Col N="1566" /> past 20 or 25 years, and that the expenses up to the present would be doubled by the time the hearing was over; that there was then almost certain to be an appeal and that the appeal would cost about an equal sum, with the result that, by the time that process of law had been completed, about £20,000 out of the £24,000 would have been spent.</P>
    <P>I felt that it would be a shame that moneys subscribed originally in the way in which these moneys were subscribed should be dissipated in that manner and it was for that reason that I said: &ldquo;Very well; we have waited long enough&rdquo;.  If we are to have cases like these which were being brought forward, where a solicitor held on to the papers which the other side wanted and there were then to be motions, if we were to have that sort of thing continuing with the variety of side issues and motions that could be raised, it was better to cut our losses at that stage and take action.  That is what is done here.  We have decided that the losses should be cut at the particular stage at which we have arrived, that no further expense should be allowed and that in order to see that that would be made effective, the case should be decided here by the Legislature.</P>
    <P>I believe, as I said at the start, in view of the way in which these public funds were subscribed, by subscribers all over the country in very large numbers, many of whom have died, that the original subscribers cannot be appealed to in the ordinary way. If we had a long list of the subscribers of the particular sums, what would naturally be said is: &ldquo;All right; the people who subscribed this money may not, in present circumstances, desire the moneys they subscribed to be used in a way quite different from that for which they were subscribed originally&rdquo; and a decision could be taken to give the money back to them. It is quite obvious that the money could not be given back and therefore this body, as representing, in the main, the majority of the Irish people, should say what should be done with the funds.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by one speaker that we were capturing these moneys and <Col N="1567" /> using them for our own purpose.  There is no truth whatever in that.  There is no truth in any suggestion that our political Party is capturing the money. The money, which was subscribed for national purposes, is being used for a national purpose, and can be so used, only if this law is passed.  It will be suggested that because we happen to be the majority in the House, we are doing so and so.  I cannot help misrepresentations.  If most of us, in the course of our lives, were deterred from doing something we thought right because it was going to be misrepresented, many a proper thing would be left undone.  There has been misrepresentation both of our purpose and of what it is proposed to do.  To my mind, any shame in that is on those who make these misrepresentations. If the courts have been brought in here in any way which is derogatory to them, then that is not the fault of the Bill.  It is the fault of those who used an occasion like this for such a purpose.  That could happen in the case of any Bill in which it was proposed that a member of the judiciary should act in any capacity in accordance with the provisions of the measure.  Henceforth, it will be very difficult to ask a member of the judiciary to accept any position except such as he is compelled to accept by law or by his office.  Up to the present, it was of great value to this Assembly to be able to ask an individual who might, by common consent, be regarded as impartial to act on any board which was being set up in any capacity in which impartiality was obviously valuable. We have had judges brought into Bills in one way or another in the past. We had that accepted in the sense in which it was proposed.  It will be extremely difficult in future to ask a judge to do anything of that sort, because he will naturally ask himself whether, under one pretext or another, his office or his views will be brought up in this House and discussed.</P>
    <P>As I have said, democracy is working and will work here so long as we regard each person in this Assembly, elected by the Irish people, as having the same weight when it comes to a <Col N="1568" /> vote.  There is no other way of dealing with the matter.  I am not going to admit that, if somebody on the other side claims that this is a matter of principle for him, we should give way.  As the matter has arisen here, the right of the Legislature to act in a matter of this kind is, in the opposite direction, as much a matter of principle &mdash;more important, in my opinion.  I have been asked the details of a number of cases.  I have read them, but it would take a considerable time to deal with each case.  I have the summaries here, but I have not memorised them.  I have satisfied myself, in going through them, that they were examples of cases in which the Legislature did not hesitate to come in and declare the law to be different from that which the courts had declared it to be and to provide that it should be deemed to have been different.  The Legislature also provided that the aid which was sought by litigants should not be given to them and that the rights which they were deemed to have possessed should be declared not to exist or to have existed.  That is all that is contained in this measure.  Therefore, it is not novel.  Where you have retroactive or retrospective legislation, you have, of course, a different set of circumstances in each case.  We are not likely to have a case exactly the same as the case we have here but, fundamentally, the principle would be the same&mdash;that the law can be declared by the Legislature whether a matter is to come before the courts, is in the courts or has been decided by the courts.</P>

      <P>Like the Taoiseach, some of us have lived a long time and, like the Taoiseach, we are not as innocent as to accept all that.  We have had too many evidences to the contrary, in relation to matters of far greater importance, even than this or what is at stake.  The Taoiseach, through the course of his speech, in a much more subtle way, of course, than his Minister performing on Saturday night, tried to allege that it was the Opposition who were bringing the courts into disrepute.  The Taoiseach said that it was not the first time judges have been brought into Bills.  No judge has ever been brought into a Bill before in a capacity similar to the one in which the Chief Justice is brought in now.  Judges&mdash;and the Chief Justice, perhaps, on occasion, and though personally I cannot remember a case, that does not mean it has not happened&mdash; have been brought in on more than one occasion to preside over committees. We have had very recent examples of that, but not in relation to anything such as we now have before us.</P>
      <P>I tried to look on this as an ordinary layman.  As any plain man, I want to know why the case cannot be determined by the courts, why the courts cannot be allowed to hear the facts stated by both sides and determine to whom the money belongs or what is to be done with it.  This House is to decide.  Every argument which the Taoiseach used in the course of the statement he has made just now, in relation to this particular matter, can be used to take any case out of the courts.  He asserted here the principle that the Legislature has the right from day to day to take any case out.</P>

I am not concerned with the merits of this case and I do not care whether it is 8d. or £8,000,000 that is at stake.  I am not concerned very much as to who receives the money but I am concerned that this principle which is now being applied to the Sinn Féin organisation or what is left of it can be applied to-morrow morning to any individual citizen or to any group of citizens, whether they are a trade union, a trade association, a farmers' association or any other association of citizens which may feel obliged to go to the courts to have their rights asserted.  That is now laid down by the Taoiseach as fundamental truth.  If the constitutional position is as the Taoiseach now tells us it is, then his Constitution, so far as the citizens' rights are concerned, is not worth the paper it is written upon.

I am making the point that this is a matter that affects every citizen and every group of citizens.  What is being done to-day in relation to Mrs. Buckley, &ldquo;Sceilg&rdquo; and others can be done to-morrow in relation to any citizen or group of citizens, by a majority of the House.  That is a sad state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach went on to another point which he very often resorts to when he is not too sure of his ground or too comfortable.  He gave us a little lecture on democracy.  He stated that we all stand equal in this House and that democracy will survive as long as we have equal rights in the House&mdash;each and every member of it.  Did he hear his first lieutenant on Friday last tell one of the oldest members of the House, a man who has been elected and re-elected over and over again for one of the principal constituencies in the country, that he had cheek even to mention one word about these funds or the organisation that is claiming <Col N="1576" /> them?  This is not a matter of the Sinn Féin funds.  It goes far beyond that. The principle that is at stake is far greater.  I do not know what the Taoiseach's reasons are, and I am not concerned with them&mdash;whether it is that he does not want to go into court or stay out of it.  That has nothing to do with it or should have nothing to do with it.  The net point for this House is whether or not we are not embarking on a most dangerous principle, and that is interfering with the courts in administering the law of the land.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;the said appeal from the judgment and order of the High Court in the said action was pending in the Supreme Court;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>And whereas on the 12th day of June, 1937, a consent in the said action was entered into between the said governors and the Attorney-General of Saorstát Éireann setting forth the agreement arrived at <Col N="1577" /> between the said governors and the Attorney-General of Saorstát Éireann with a view to ending the said litigation, saving further expenditure, and providing for the application and future administration of the said endowments;</P>
    <P>And whereas by an order of the Supreme Court made in the said action dated the 23rd day of June, 1937, the court on reading the said consent ordered that the hearing of the said appeal and all further proceedings be stayed&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>not on the <i>ex parte</i> application of the Attorney-General supported by an Act of this House and nothing else, but on reading the consent.  Is it any wonder that Deputy O'Connor shot out of the House as the Erasmus Smith Act came in?  Deputy O'Connor is an officer of the High Court of this country.  By virtue of his membership of the solicitors' profession he is himself, in a sense, an officer of this very court which, for the purposes of his own political Party, he chooses to traduce by saying that the procedure in the Erasmus Smith Act is identical with the monstrous, shameful and outrageous proposal contained in the Sinn Féin Funds Bill.  Every evil that is in this disgusting Bill was anticipated and provided against in the procedure adopted in the Erasmus Smith Act.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whereas by an order of the Supreme Court made in the said action dated the 23rd day of June, 1937, the court on reading the said consent ordered that the hearing of the said appeal and all further proceedings be stayed;</P>
    <P>And whereas it is expedient to empower the said Governors to carry into effect the agreement contained in the said consent, and to set at rest all doubts with regard to the administration of the said endowments, and to provide for the future administration thereof;</P>
    <P>And whereas the purposes afore-said cannot be effected without the authority of the Oireachtas;</P>
    <P>Be it therefore enacted by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What hateful thing is there in Fianna <Col N="1578" /> Fáil, that once a man joins that Party, all the standards common to the profession to which he belongs, or to the job he ordinarily does, seem to go by the board and if he is summoned to the fray, everything must be jettisoned and cast overboard in order to back up whatever the machine proposes to do? Deputy O'Connor is back now.  I trust he will read the Erasmus Smith Act which I read out for him.  He was deeply involved in the Erasmus Smith litigation on behalf of one of the parties that believed itself to be a beneficiary under the trust.  Here is Deputy Walsh, a Sinn Féiner of 40 years' standing, certifying to the House that the executive of Sinn Féin is still in existence, to his knowledge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But, when we come to another case&mdash;Leatham and Quinn, I think it was&mdash;in which the Legislature did stop proceedings, what were the circumstances there?  Under an international agreement between this country and Great Britain, Great Britain maintained the thesis that every subject of this State had a right to have decisions of our Supreme Court reviewed by the British Privy Council. The Irish Government held that that was not the correct interpretation of the international agreement and that we entered into that agreement with the British Government on the understanding that no citizen of this State had the right to go beyond our Supreme Court.  Our Government may have been right, our Government may have been wrong, but that is what they believed and they said before allcomers: &ldquo;Believing that to be so, we intend to give effect to that and if anyone tries to go beyond the decision of the Supreme Court, we will pass legislation declaring the law to be what the Supreme Court says it is, no matter what they declare, whether we like it or dislike it, for the purpose of preventing persons, in effect, bringing the Supreme Court of Ireland before the British Privy Council.  We shall protect the Supreme Court with the necessary legislation to make that operation both expensive and ineffective on the people who do it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What analogy is there between that procedure and this?  Produce the rest of your cases and I defy you to find the case&mdash;I defy you to find any case in any civilised community which acknowledges an independent judiciary&mdash;in which a citizen of the State goes into court to claim her right under the law and where the Executive claims the right to reach into the court, take her by the throat and throw her out and say: &ldquo;Whatever your rights are, you are not going to get them because we are going to make up our minds what we would like you to get and we are <Col N="1580" /> going to change the law and until we have time to change the law we are going to prevent you proceeding under it and if you do proceed under it in our despite, while we are changing the law, we fix you with notice that we will take from you your decision.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a category of cases in existence in which this can happen&mdash;it commonly happens in connection with Finance Acts.  We pass a section of a Finance Act which we believe to do a certain thing.  It is worth somebody's while to brief high-power attorneys and high-power barristers and they succeed in punching a hole in our Finance Act in the court and getting a verdict for their own benefit which we did not believe the law as we made it would allow.  The moment that verdict is handed down, 10,000 people start actions and it is quite a common practice in that state to say: &ldquo;The man who has got his verdict shall retain it; he is entitled to it; but we fix all others with notice that if the way in which we drafted the law begot that verdict from the courts, we will redraft the law because we did not mean it to mean that when we passed it.  We will not step into the court while the citizen is in there looking for his statutory rights and stop the proceedings of the court for fear the court would decide in a way we did not want them to decide, but we fix all other citizens with notice that, if the verdict goes against us, it is not because there was any doubt in the mind of the Legislature; it was because there was a doubt in the mind of the Parliamentary draftsman and it was a doubt that our best assistance has been unable to remove, but, now that we know what words they were that gave the judiciary an impression different from that which we wished to make upon their mind, we will change those words&rdquo;.  In that sense you prevent the other 10,000 who have instituted proceedings benefiting themselves by the loop-hole created by the first litigant.  But surely no rational Deputy will draw an analogy between that and a person who goes in to seek the relief that Mrs. Buckley seeks at the present time.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach sometimes throws a searchlight upon this famous heart of <Col N="1581" /> his into which, from time to time, he looks with such catastrophic consequences. Carried away on the tide of his own vehemence to-day, he said: &ldquo;That is what we have to do now, to make a law.&rdquo;  There is the very root and essence of his sinning.  It is no part of the function of this Legislature to make a law.  Our duty as the Legislature of a democratic State is to make the law, the law for all the people, not a law for one man and another law for another man.  The very essence of freedom is that the Taoiseach and the dustman live under the same law and that there will not be a law for the Taoiseach, a law for Deputy Dillon, a law for Mrs. Buckley and a law for somebody else.  The day this House accepts the proposition that our duty is to make a law, for Mrs. Buckley or for anyone else, then we accept the principle that all men are not equal before the law and, when we accept that, we accept the principle that individual liberty and justice and freedom have perished in this land.  Does the Taoiseach challenge that proposition?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does he think it right that we should make a law for Mrs. Buckley or does he think that our task is to make the law which should apply to every man?  The Taoiseach admits that when the scheme was first put before him his reaction was to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This smells a bit.  I do not like it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He told us so to-day.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When this first was brought to my attention I thought if the expense was not too high the court action was the best method and that the best way to dispose of this business would be to let it go to judgement.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was it about this procedure that he did not like?  Why did he think the best method was to let it go to judgment? He is not the kind of person who makes snap judgements.  He is not the kind of person who rushes into decisions.  He had plenty of time to think this thing out and his own testimony is that when this plan was first proposed it smelled a bit.  He did not <Col N="1582" /> like it.  He thought the best method was to let it go to judgement.  Why? If he bared this bleeding heart of his we might find common ground altogether in this capacious Chamber. Buried therein is the deep conviction that this whole procedure smells a little, but with sufficient oratorical perfume he hopes to get it through.  He is mistaken.  That kind of smell that he got when this proposal was first made to him is penetrating and enduring. We may sprinkle it with all the perfume you please, we may hold as many plebiscites as you like, we may get 90 per cent. majorities and public demonstrations but when people begin to assassinate liberty the instrument whereby they stop that operation smells a little, but penetratingly.  The Taoiseach's first instinct was right. His nostrils did not deceive him and I do not believe that they deceive him now.  He knows it smells a little of corruption&mdash;the corruption born of liberty dying.  The Taoiseach is trying to force more than one person in the House into the assertion that he has designs on this money, for himself, his Party or whatever else you please.  Let us go on record about that at once.  I do not believe the Taoiseach has designs on this money for himself, for his Party, for his friends, or for anybody else but he just wants to get the best of Mrs. Buckley.  He is just determined that Mrs. Buckley is not going to bring him down and cross-examine him in the courts, and scandalise him, and ask him about what he said in 1924 and 1926, and make a hames of him. That is what all this is about.</P>
    <P>I was amused to hear the Taoiseach tell the House how the necessity for this Bill arose.  Here was the insoluble problem!  The people who had subscribed to the fund could not be found. Many of them were dead.  The primary purpose of the fund was no longer there to be served.  What were we to do?  How out of this dilemma except by a Bill?  I saw Deputy O'Connor shift uneasily in his seat.  His years of studentship in the Incorporated Law Society and of practice thereafter had taught him to know that the poor, rigid, incompetent old courts of law had evolved a procedure for just that <Col N="1583" /> contingency so long ago that the judges were still talking French.  That difficulty arose 800 years ago, when some old dafty left money for a preposterous purpose, on trust, and the preposterous purpose shortly afterwards ceased to exist and the old dafty was in Heaven and could not be reached, and somebody said: what are we going to do? We cannot ask the old dafty what she wants done with the money now, and the poodle for whose maintenance she left the money is dead and buried. What now to do?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think he does, but any time he cares to enlighten me I shall be glad.  The courts of equity of that day said to themselves: &ldquo;This is a situation which is likely to occur from time to time and it is a situation in which we shall have to devise a method which will be equitable and just,&rdquo; and they evolved the doctrine of <i>cy pres.</i> That doctrine has grown into a formidable body of law the existence of which is fully recognised by the Statute which created the Commissioner of Charitable Donations and Bequests who, not infrequently, has to direct the attention of the courts to the existence of such a fund, and the courts have to be asked in that situation what is to be done with the money.  In such circumstances, the courts will consider all relevant matters, prepare a scheme, and, subject to objections that interested parties or parties who think they are interested, can make, after a given time, they finally settle the scheme and the trust moneys are diverted to the new purpose.  It is nothing new.  It is as old as the law. But it was not invoked in this case, <Col N="1584" /> because Mrs. Buckley might have gone after the Taoiseach and she was not going to be let.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach returns gaily to the proposition that in the last analysis in a democratic country the will of the majority must prevail.  Agreed.  The Taoiseach forbore, with his accustomed delicacy, from referring to the fact that his Party constitutes an absolute majority of this House.  I declare it does.  What is more, he stands at the head to-day of the most freely elected Government in Europe. There is not a Government in all Europe with a better title to function as the Executive of the State in which it acts as the Government of this country.  We will give him all that. But he deliberately avoids one matter in that connection to which I sought to draw his attention.  I said again and again, even to the disedification of the Ceann Comhairle, that where the Government side of the House stand on principle and the Opposition stand on theirs, I entirely agree that the Government side of the House should prevail. It is the only solution when both sides have had their say.  But, suppose the Government themselves say and believe that there is no question of principle involved, that their Bill is founded merely on a desire to devise expedient machinery to give effect to a purpose about which there is no dispute in principle and suppose the Opposition say, even wrong-headedly, but <i>bona fide</i> and honestly that for them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If he believes that I have been trying to pull his leg for the past two days, he is just playing.  I have a heavy cold and I am speaking under great difficulty.  I am doing it because <Col N="1585" /> I am deeply concerned.  The Chief Justice is a man for whom I have the warmest affection and I wish to think that I enjoyed his friendship.  I have never discharged any more detestable and painful duty in my life than to be the means of involving him in a controversy of this kind.  I do not want to express the slightest regret for having done it.  I would do it again if I had to.

      <P>My submission is that where he is satisfied in his mind that we, a minority, stand on principle and that no principle is involved for the majority, it is the essence of any democracy for the majority to say: &ldquo;We gladly give way&rdquo;.  But, where we are arguing about the way, whether it is the most expedient way to do the thing, and the Government have a way of their own, the Government need not give way.  That is a fair rule.  That is, I suggest, the only rule which it is desirable for a democratic Parliament to pursue.  I have pressed that as far as I can.  To tell the truth, I think about as much has been said on this Bill, certainly by some of us, as could be usefully said.  On the Fifth Stage, there will be something more to be said and in the Supreme Court I trust the matter will be tested and our instinct in this matter vindicated by the judiciary.  For everybody's sake, I would much sooner see this Bill dropped and the method advocated by me for the solution of this problem adopted.  It does not seem likely that that will happen now.  I assert that that is the right thing to do.  I am certain that it will be a blessing from every point of view.  I am certain that it will avoid occasions where a man like Deputy O'Connor, himself an officer of the High Court, comes in here and tries to persuade his colleagues that there is an identical principle underlying the Erasmus Smith Act, where there was an agreement between the trustees and the Attorney-General and where the agreement was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am trying to find out where Mrs. Buckley's consent is contained in this Bill.  I have argued that it is strange that Deputy Moran and Deputy O'Connor, both officers of the High Court, inasmuch as they are solicitors of the High Court and members of that great profession, should come in here and tell their non-professional colleagues that there is an identical principle underlying the Erasmus Smith Act and this Bill, when to demonstration there is not.

I must confess that I had almost forgotten it, but I have some recollection that it applies only in this way, that where there is a general charitable intention and also a particular intention and that the particular intention cannot be carried out, the courts will settle a scheme.

      <P>The gentlemen on the opposite benches have been complaining all day of misrepresentation from this side of the House on the issues involved in this measure, and Deputy O'Connor and others have stood up to confuse the issues still further by introducing a number of irrelevancies.  The Taoiseach to-day misrepresented the law, the constitutional law in relation to this whole issue, and I want to direct his attention to the fundamental rights of the citizen, guaranteed to him under the Constitution.  Article 40 (1) states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Article 40 (3) says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The State guarantees in its laws to respect, and as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizens.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Article 40 (3) also says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack, and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name and property rights of every citizen.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I hold that these matters are in issue and are brought directly into issue by the introduction of this measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the section, which endeavours to set aside the personal right of every citizen to have direct access to the courts in any matter in which he feels that he has a right cause of action.  I am here to defend that right and that right only. I am not concerned, as I said on Friday last, with the merits of the action, with the facts in issue in the case before the courts relating to the Sinn Féin funds; I am concerned solely with the right of the citizen, or any group of citizens who feel they have a grievance and who seek in ventilating it to have access to the courts.  That is the fundamental issue and the basic principle that we have been discussing.  But a number of side issues have been dragged in to confuse the public mind.  I said on Friday last, and I repeat, that there is no question of the public interest being involved in this measure.  I say again, as I said on Friday last, that the common good is not served by any particular section or sub-section of this Bill.  As I argued last Friday, the common good dictates that this Bill should be withdrawn.  The common good dictates that the citizens who regard themselves as the lineal successors of the old Sinn Féin should have the right to go to the courts and fight the case to a conclusion there. These are the fundamental issues we have been fighting.  That is the big principle that is involved.</P>
      <P>A number of cases and previous Acts have been quoted by the Taoiseach as precedents for this measure.  May I say that not one of them has any analogy or bearing on this issue?  The Lynam and Butler case, which led to the Land Act of 1931, and the various copyright cases&mdash;the Stokes' case&mdash;all were fundamentally different.  In one case the issue was whether or not our citizens should have the right of appeal to an alien jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>If there is any analogy between the <i>cy pres</i> doctrine and the present case, my recollection of the <i>cy pres</i> doctrine is that where the physical objects of a trust fail and the original intention cannot be carried out, then the court will endeavour, by the application of the <i>cy prés</i> doctrine, to formulate a scheme which will go as nearly as possible to carry out the original intention of the trust.  Here it would have been very difficult for the court to carry out the original objects or the original intentions of the trust, if we regard the Sinn Féin funds in that light, but it was not beyond the competence of the court to have suggested that a scheme might be agreed upon between the parties and that effect might be given by legislation to such a scheme.  That is one way of dealing with the matter.  It would have been a very simple matter to have a scheme drawn up by agreement between the parties&mdash;the Taoiseach laughs.</P>

      <P>The point is that although there was no hope of agreement, the Taoiseach, as representing one Party, took it into his hands to come to this House with this measure to give effect to what his Party considered should be done with the money. Is that not what we are getting?  The Taoiseach has been talking democracy all the afternoon.  I am beginning seriously to thing that we should spell democracy with a capital V instead of the &ldquo;m.&rdquo;  It is the Taoiseach's ego that counts in this matter; it is the Taoiseach's will.  &ldquo;I am the supreme arbiter in this matter; I am going to decide what is going to be done with the money and nobody else shall have that right.&rdquo;  Other issues are brought in as red herrings.  The fundamental issue here is that, rightly or wrongly, these people have made up their minds that they have a legitimate claim to these moneys and they have <Col N="1594" /> had recourse to courts to decide that case.  If they are foolishly embarking on litigation of such an expensive character, if they have a frivolous case, I say that they should be made pay for the consequences of their folly but at least they should have the right of appeal to the courts.  That seems to me to be fundamental if our courts are to function in an atmosphere of independence. On the other hand, I understand the Taoiseach to say that they might have a reasonably good case, and that the courts might not award costs against them.  If that be so, there is all the more reason why the case should be allowed to go to the courts irrespective of what becomes of the money. Does anyone seriously suggest that £24,000 is going to solve the grievances or salve the wounds of the many people mentioned as beneficiaries, if this measure were passed?  A sum of £24,000 will be a fleabite in dealing with many of the cases I know of which were not compensated under previous measures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the frittering away of the money comes under this section.  I am suggesting that it is &ldquo;codology&rdquo; to talk of this money being set aside, as the Minister for Local Government did last Saturday night, to compensate people for their losses in the Black-and-Tan war. These are, I suggest, red herrings dragged in to confuse the public as to the fundamental issue.  The fundamental issue is that a group of citizens, feeling they have a grievance, think that that grievance should be ventilated in the courts.  In pursuit of that policy, they have made a claim and they have asked the court to decide that claim for them.  They are entitled to that and they cannot be gainsaid in any way. Every group of citizens has the same right.  Unless the proceedings are entirely vexatious or frivolous they should have the full protection of this House in seeking that redress.  The common good does not demand that this measure should be passed and that these people should be prevented from seeking the measure of relief which they are seeking through the courts.</P>

If the Taoiseach made the case that perhaps these people might use these moneys for subversive purposes, for purposes contrary to the public interest and particularly contrary to the security of the State, one could sympathise with him introducing a measure of this kind, but that case has not been made.  It is clear to me that if these people get these funds, they would be free to use them for political purposes.

Most of them were cases in respect of which legislation was introduced to stabilise judgements of the Supreme Court and oust the jurisdiction of alien courts, and particularly the British Privy Council.

      <P>Then do not interrupt as if there was a point in it.  Is it not clear that the Erasmus Smith Act of 1938 was founded on a consent? Is there consent here?  There is not. Is that not a complete difference between the two cases?  The Deputy shakes his head.  What is the difference other than that?  That is the big difference.  Day after day, solicitors and counsel go into court and move consents and they are accepted by the courts.  Not very often but now and again the consent is dragged out and made the foundation of a legislative Act.  That is the Erasmus Smith case. Fundamentally, they are the same thing&mdash;consent was the basis.  May I read one paragraph from Section 10 which we are discussing?  It says: &ldquo;On the passing of this Act all further proceedings shall be stayed&rdquo;&mdash;without the consent of the parties.  That is the big difference&mdash;that is the enormous difference.  That is the difference between having courts of justice and <Col N="1599" /> having a Dáil which pretends to be a court of justice.</P>

      <P>I am not talking about minor differences of detail.  The Deputy knows the difference between going into court and saying, &ldquo;I agree&rdquo; and being dragged into court by somebody else who says, &ldquo;I have power from the legislative body to stop you going any further&rdquo;.  That is the big difference and not any pettifogging nonsense about points of detail.  The foundation of the one is consent and the pivot of this is the objection by one party to relinquish its rights and what the Taoiseach has called this sovereign court, if you please, Dáil Éireann, coming in now to adjudicate upon the merits of a case at hearing before the courts.  Will there be any more nonsense talked in the way of an attempt to make an analogy between the Erasmus Smith case and this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connor has brought in the public bodies' mutual assurance business and the very phrase he read out was to the effect that the second Bill was brought in with regard to future decisions.  Has this to do with future decisions?  Not at all; it is the present case.  I was partly responsible for the Insurance Bill.  I appeared as a witness in court and Judge Davitt held that that piece of legislation was not properly framed.  We left it there. We accepted his decision and people paid costs and people suffered by being mulcted in costs as a result.  Certain people got their costs out of it and we did not come to their assistance. But we said: &ldquo;We failed in our objective; we have given a piece of legislation to the courts upon which the judges could not give the decision which it was the opinion of this House they should give.  For the future, here is the new legislation&rdquo;, and we again threw it out to the courts to interpret and we never interfered with the decision of the court.  I should be very strong in upholding the right of this Dáil, on any occasion on which it passes legislation and when the courts have come to a conclusion opposite to <Col N="1600" /> the views of those who passed the legislation, to say: &ldquo;As from a certain date, we will re-establish our viewpoint&rdquo;, but that is not taking away from people the rights they have already gained.</P>
    <P>I do not know how often that has happened in connection with the income-tax code, and the Finance Bill year by year is built up in this way, that the Revenue Commissioners seek to close gaps which taxpayers had found in the code up to that date, but they do not go in and say that such and such an action shall stand dismissed. They leave the people with what they have gained by their appearance in court and, if the revenue loses, it suffers the loss for the time being. It may make it up by extra taxation during the year, but the Revenue Commissioners do not change the law to swerve a judgement away from the person who has got it and to prevent a man from pleading in court a case which he has started there.</P>
    <P>I asked for a case to be brought to my notice in which a piece of legislation has stayed all further proceedings, that piece of legislation&mdash;and this is an important matter&mdash;being brought in to deal with a pending proceeding.  I have said that there is no such case.  I know that there is no such case.  The Lynam and Butler case has been referred to here, though I gather that that has been repudiated.  That was a case in which it was provided that there were to be no appeals to the Privy Council. Appeals were to go no further than the Supreme Court.  If we had not declared that to be the law, we would have been regarded as unnational.  We provided for a final decision by the highest judicial tribunal we had and people were warned, before they commenced litigation, that they would not be allowed to go further than the Supreme Court.  We interrupted no pending proceedings to take the matter out of court and into what is called &ldquo;this sovereign Assembly&rdquo;.  I need not labour that point further.  Deputy O'Connor knows what a consent judgment is.  This is not a judgement of that type.</P>
    <P>We ask our citizens to believe that the Constitution really has meaning <Col N="1601" /> and virtue.  When they go along to a certain stage, we stop them and say: &ldquo;You may have thought that you had only the courts to deal with; we have another trick up our sleeve; we have the sovereign court of the Dáil; it is not in the Constitution as a court but we shall make it one and establish its action as the judgement of a court.&rdquo; I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>The Minister's statement, when introducing this Estimate last week, was at once interesting and challenging.  It was interesting inasmuch as it foreshadowed important improvements from the programmes in Radio Éireann and it was challenging inasmuch as the Estimate represented an increase of £128,000 over that of last year, this increase being mainly for the purpose of providing buildings, equipment and organisation for the new high-power, short-wave station in Athlone, from which, on the Minister's own admission, people from this country will derive very little benefit.  I put a question to the Minister to-day to elicit information as to the total cost of buildings, equipment, staff and programmes of the new high-power station.  The reply I received was that precise figures <Col N="1602" /> of the cost of the new short-wave station cannot be given at present as the buildings, equipment and staffing organisation are only in course of being provided.  I was told that approximate estimated figures of cost under the headings specified would be circulated in the Official Report.  I have obtained that statement.  Surely, the Minister obtained an estimate of the cost of this new service before he proceeded with the work.</P>

      <P>Two years ago, the Minister told the House that it was his intention to introduce a Supplementary Estimate for this additional service and that that Estimate would give Deputies an opportunity of discussing the details.  What was responsible for the change of policy in the meantime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that there has been any change of policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>At that stage, the Minister regarded this as an additional and separate service.  Now, he proposes to assimilate this service to the existing service from Radio Éireann.  This additional service will involve expenditure of £227,000, plus whatever may be spent on two further aerial systems. Presumably, the total expenditure will reach £300,000 or £400,000.  The Dáil should have been given an opportunity of discussing the inauguration of this additional service.  It should have been told what the policy of the Minister was in regard to it and how we proposed to recover this expenditure in the years to come.  The Minister has made no statement of that kind, nor has he given any worth-while details in the statement made last week.  At the outset, he referred to the expenditure of £44,000 for the organisation of this new service but he has given the Dáil no indication of the type of organisation  <Col N="1603" /> he proposes to build up.  He has not shown how it will differ from the existing organisation of Radio Éireann or how it will differ from the organisation of the B.B.C. or radio systems in other countries.  I submit that the Dáil is entitled to much more information in connection with the establishment of this new high-power station than the Minister has thought it worth while to give so far.  I suggest to the Minister that, when replying to this debate, it will be his duty to give an exhaustive statement regarding this new high-power station and the policy he will pursue.  He should tell us what the estimated costs will be and give us all the other details which are relevant and important.</P>
      <P>I am rather at a loss to understand some of the figures the Minister supplied. Last year, provision was made for £91,600 for equipment.  This year, there is provision for additional expenditure of £198,000.  Further down the statement, the Minister states that £63,000 of the voted moneys represents a re-vote.  That sum, I take it, is included in the amount provided in the Estimate this year.  I suppose that the figure supplied in reply to my question &mdash;£227,000&mdash;will represent the total expenditure on this new service up to the end of the financial year, and that it is not the intention of the Minister to proceed this year with the erection of the two further aerial systems he has mentioned in the footnote.  The cost of these additional aerials will, I presume, be provided for in subsequent years.  The Minister, I take it, is satisfied that this expenditure is justified in the present circumstances of the country.  I have grave doubts that an expenditure of £300,000 in this way is justified in present conditions.  This high-power station may be regarded as in the nature of a luxury service.  We could have afforded to wait another few years until the present world circumstances and the economic circumstances of this country were somewhat better than they are, before proceeding with the establishment of such a service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree wholeheartedly with the plans the Minister is making to improve the service.  People are entitled to as good a service as the circumstances warrant <Col N="1604" /> and there was room for improvement. This short-wave station will serve people outside the country and the people in the country will derive no benefit from it.  According to the Minister's own words, it is intended to give our exiles and other sympathetic listeners in every country the best music and speech programmes it is possible for us to supply.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Director of Broadcasting have certainly improved the musical services distinctly on those we were accustomed to a few years ago.  There has certainly been a marked improvement in that respect and I have no doubt that, as long as the Minister remains in charge of the Post Office, he will pay particular attention to the musical side of the programmes from Radio Éireann and the new high-power station.  However, I am interested to know what he means by the speech programmes.  I hope the station will not be used exclusively for broadcasting Fianna Fáil propaganda and telling the world what a wonderful individual the Taoiseach is and the miracles the members of his Government have achieved.</P>

Many Deputies here to-day complain that they are not getting a fair showing from Radio Éireann, that there is discrimination on some occasions.  I sincerely hope the same complaint will not have to be made regarding the new station.</P>
      <P>Last year, we were told the Minister hoped to have this new station working in April.  Now we are told he does not expect it to be ready until the end of the financial year.  I assume that the delay is due entirely to the difficulty in procuring equipment for the station and material for the buildings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>In previous years, reference was made to the revenue made by the station from advertising.  I notice that this year it has increased from <Col N="1605" /> £15,000 to £41,000.  That is a very substantial increase.  I do not object to a judicious number of advertising programmes, but there is always a danger that this feature will be overdone, to the exclusion of the legitimate numbers.  I am not speaking of programmes like those regarding the Hospitals Sweeps, but of other types that are purely advertising programmes. We would not like to see Radio Éireann degenerate into a second Luxembourg.  While it is important that the revenue would be earned in this way in order to reduce the cost of the service to a minimum, I suggest seriously to the Minister that he should not allow the service to degenerate into an advertising service so that people would come to regard Radio Éireann as a more important medium for carrying advertisements than newspapers.  After all there is a medium for all the business people to advertise in, if they wish to avail of the daily newspapers and the weekly newspapers, which should be more effective than Radio Éireann.  In any event, they are the legitimate channels in which to advertise goods in this or in any other country.</P>
      <P>Radio in every country is intended, I think, to provide the people mainly with amusement and education.  It is very hard to define exactly the true functions of radio.  Some people maintain it is to provide entertainment, while others maintain its primary function should be education.  Others say there should be a judicious blend of both.  In any event, the present service is a fair blend of both.  It certainly has improved during the last few years and the musical programmes have improved.  They have cut out that type of jazz music and foreign music to which we were so much accustomed, and I think that is a decided advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I complained last year that enough prominence was not given to agricultural subjects.  The Minister replied that he was quite conscious of the fact that our main industry was not represented as it should be in Radio Éireann and that he was trying to organise that service in such a way as to provide interesting and educative programmes. I fully appreciate his difficulty.  We have a good example in the talks on <Col N="1606" /> gardening by Mr. Sherrard, which are both interesting and instructive; and if the Minister took that pattern, he should be able to devise a series of lectures on agricultural subjects which would be just as attractive and interesting as those by Mr. Sherrard on the kindred subject of gardening. Despite what the Minister said last year I have not noticed any improvement in this respect.  Many of the talks on agriculture are rather heavy, laborious and weary.  They could be made brighter and more interesting and the brighter and more interesting they are the more beneficial they will be to the people.  I agree that it is not every agricultural expert who has a voice suitable for broadcasting purposes and the field of selection may be more limited in this country than in Great Britain or European countries. Nevertheless, it should be possible for the Minister to find experts from agricultural institutes who would be able to put across on the air interesting and instructive talks on subjects of importance to our farmers.  If the Minister keeps on trying, I have no doubt he will succeed eventually in devising a programme that will be both entertaining and instructive and one that farmers generally will look forward to on the night on which it is given.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to learn that Mr. Brennan, the present director, is retiring from the service and I would like to join with the Minister in paying tribute to his services.  I think every Deputy must recognise the fact that, under his management, care and direction, the service has undoubtedly improved.  I personally regret that he is leaving the service, as I do think that, now that the Minister is about to add to the responsibilities of a radio director, Mr. Brennan's loss will be keenly felt.  I only hope that the new director, about whose record I know nothing whatever, when he is appointed will be equal to his responsibilities.  I would be inclined to say that for the future the Minister would require a director of exceptional ability and experience. There are some people inclined to doubt whether the new director has that experience or ability which would enable him to undertake successfully his new responsibilities.</P>

      <P>There are a few minor points that I wish to bring to the Minister's notice.  During the past week I tabled a question about the bad reception in the Ballinrobe district. The Minister left me under the impression that from the reports that he had received, there were no grounds for my complaint.  As a result of further inquiries, I want to say that there are definite complaints in that district, due, I think, to some electrical disturbance caused by the use of machines in the locality, or the want of condensers on those machines.  That is given as the cause of the trouble. There is a complete blot-out with a noise resembling that of the stuttering one hears at machine-gun practice.  I think the Minister should find some device that would remedy this matter. I can assure him that the complaint made to me appears to be very well founded.</P>
      <P>I also want to suggest to him that during the spring, summer and autumn months there should be an early morning broadcast, say between 9 and 10 o'clock, giving the weather forecast. That would be an immense benefit during the haymaking and harvesting seasons to those engaged in agriculture. Complaint is also made that the cattle market reports are not regularly broadcast.  Some weeks they are missing altogether.  That should be remedied.  I agree with the last speaker that instructional matter on agriculture, our principal industry, should be broadcast regularly.  That is particularly desirable at the present time when there is such a need for increased food production and when our imports are relatively so small.  Instruction of a suitable nature should be given at least twice a week on some agricultural subject.  A good deal could be said over the radio in two or three minutes.  The people, I am sure, would eagerly await the reception of such instruction.  I feel that the Department of Agriculture would be willing to assist the Director of Broadcasting in arranging for the broadcast of useful and seasonal instruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Almost a year ago we had a commemoration in the County Mayo in honour of one of the greatest Irishmen <Col N="1608" /> that the West has produced&mdash;Michael Davitt.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Mulcahy, Deputy Dillon and myself were invited to speak.  Some 12 or 14 days before I, at least, received notice that I would have to send in the script of my speech seven clear days before the meeting was held.  I did not do so, and I presume that Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Dillon did not do so because they did not speak at the ceremony.  I want to say for myself that I was not allowed to speak because I did not submit the script of my speech.  I considered that the demand made on me was just in keeping with what appears to be the general policy of the Government at the present time.  It is travelling more and more along the road towards a dictatorship.  I was three years a member of the House at the time the commemoration ceremony was held.  I wonder why was I asked to submit the script of my speech.  I do not think it is a usual thing.  I see that the Minister shakes his head.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason why I was not allowed to speak in Mayo was quite plain.  It was simply because of the <Col N="1610" /> Party of which I was a member and leader, and because of the failure of Fianna Fáil in regard to the land policy.  It struck me as very fitting to hear the Taoiseach on that occasion broadcasting and bringing back memories of Michael Davitt, the man who did more to raise the peasantry of this country from slavery than any other man.  He certainly did more than Fianna Fáil did with all its promises. I think that is the kernel of the whole situation.  He was standing there in the middle of a district and broadcasting from it, a district in which I am ashamed to say poverty is rife.  After 25 or 26 years of self-government we are still in almost exactly the same position as we were under the landlord system.  There was absolutely no need to enforce such a rule.  The Miniister is sheltering himself behind the fact that there was such a rule.  The Director of Broadcasting had not the power to make any such rule.  I am sure that if he suggested any such rules they would have to get the sanction of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">

      <P>Has it been the Minister's experience of me since I became a member of the House that I am a red revolutionary and that I was going to go out deliberately to embroil the Taoiseach and the Government in some embarrassment or in a row with, probably, the neighbouring country across the water?  Is that so?  The Minister smiles in a shame-faced way, but it is nothing to be proud of.  Suppose the Taoiseach were in opposition and went down to address his constituents in the County Clare or the people in the district where he was born and that a Fine Gael Government, a Labour Government or a Clann na Talmhan Government prevented him from speaking unless he submitted the script of his speech seven days before the meeting, I wonder how he would like it? I know that if I were the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, or if I had any say in the Government, I would not do it.  This is only another example, an indication of the road which the Government are travelling and that is towards an absolute dicatorship.  The <Col N="1611" /> Minister need not laugh.  It is very clear, I think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to bring two matters to the Minister's notice.  I understand that two members of the news staff in Radio Éireann are members of the National Union of Journalists.  I believe that in a short time these two members will come under the control of the Civil Service and that thereupon they must cease membership of the union which caters for journalists.  I want to put it to the Minister that the Civil Service staff organisations at present do not cater for journalists because they are not conversant with and would not be able to deal with the various problems that confront journalists in their profession.</P>
      <P>Apart from that fact, I would remind the Minister that the two persons of whom I speak have been in the National Union of Journalists for the last 15 years and that it would be very hard on them to have to forgo the benefits they have built up for themselves during that period.  I would ask the Minister, therefore, to allow these two members of the news staff to remain in their union and also, when he recruits the other members he mentioned in introducing the Estimate, that he will allow these also to become or to remain members of the National Union of Journalists because, as I have stated, their problems can be dealt with only by a union which caters exclusively for journalists and the Civil Service staff organisations cannot cater for that profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand, the Minister said he had appointed reporters throughout the country, that the news staff has been increased and that a system of local correspondence is being built up.  If I may presume to speak on behalf of journalists, I would ask the Minister how many news correspondents he has appointed, and the districts in which they have been appointed, because my information is that he has not journalists doing these jobs at the present time at all and that people giving commentaries on the day's sport and the weekend's sport from Radio Éireann depend mainly on information collected from Garda stations and local people who <Col N="1612" /> have nothing at all to do with journalism. In my estimation that is not fair and I would protest against the system of collecting news and sport items from people who are not members of the profession, from post offices, Garda stations and from summaries made by country members of the Gaelic Athletic Association.  I would suggest that in big provincial towns and other districts the Minister should contact recognised journalists and recognised news correspondents and make arrangements with them for the supply of news items and the other information that is required by Radio Éireann.  The Minister at present is taking the bread and butter out of the mouths of members of the profession.</P>
    <P>I still maintain the view I expressed last year, the first occasion I had to speak on this Estimate, that Radio Éireann is one of the best broadcasting stations, at least in the British Isles, but I would suggest that Radio Éireann should avail more of the talent which is in the country and that some improvements could be carried out.  In the winter evenings Radio Éireann should broadcast Grand Opera, or light opera and musical comedy.  About seven or eight years ago some very admirable broadcasts were made of the comic operas of Gilbert and Sullivan. Gilbert and Sullivan operas may not be as popular on the stage as they were a few years ago but I think that is due, not to the music, but to the libretto.  I remember broadcasts from Radio Éireann of recordings of Gilbert and Sullivan operas, with commentaries. We do not want to be bored by the outdated libretto of Mr. Gilbert but the music is still extremely good and extremely popular and, in my estimation, very entertaining.  The winter evenings would be a very suitable time for that type of broadcast.  There should be some system of broadcasting records of Grand Opera, light opera, musical comedy and the various popular musical plays.</P>
    <P>I would also suggest that in conjunction with Question Time on Sunday evenings, local concerts should be broadcast.  The body or society under whose auspices Question Time is run take it on themselves to employ the very best local artistes to fill the concert <Col N="1613" /> bill that usually follows Question Time.  If Radio Éireann availed of the opportunity to broadcast such concerts, they would be getting down to the heart of the country and would afford an opportunity to local talent to express itself.</P>
    <P>I wish to offer my congratulations to the Minister on his decision to enlarge the Radio Éireann orchestra. That is a very admirable step and I understand that he has in mind the formation of a national orchestra, which is something we have sadly lacked in this country.  I would suggest to the Minister that there is highbrow music, low-brow music and also &ldquo;middle-brow&rdquo; music.  Middle-brow music, as the term implies, caters for the ordinary mass of the people.  We do not want to go down to la-da-di-dah or boo-boop-bi-dooh or up to Beethoven, but there are types of opera, musical comedies and overtures which Radio Éireann could broadcast to a greater extent.  When we want that type of music we usually have to switch to a British station.  Radio Éireann should give a little more of that type of music. In that connection also the Minister should avail more of the services of the Army bands.  The Army bands can compare with any of the bands in England or in the world, and I do not think we hear enough of them.  The Minister also referred to the matter of employing a full-time company of actors.  I would like to know what sort of a response he got to that.  I would like to know if he got a good response. In my estimation the acting profession in Ireland has gone down considerably. How anybody in the Minister's Department expects to get good Irish actors at the salaries offered beats me.  We have admirable acting ability in this country but unfortunately many of our actors and actresses go across to the Denham Studios and to the different film-making studios on the other side.  We have actors in the Lord Longford Company in the Gate Theatre, in the MacLiammoir-Hilton Edwards Company, who can compare favourably with any British actor and who, if they liked, could work on the films but who are, nevertheless, content to <Col N="1614" /> remain over here in Ireland for the sake of acting.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why we cannot avail of the services of those actors and actresses.  I think I am right in saying that the best actor in this country could not earn more than £500 per annum from Radio Éireann and that the rates which would be offered would be absolutely miserably low.  I think I am right in saying that the Department did not get any satisfactory response to this appeal for actors and actresses simply because their rates were too low.</P>
    <P>I wish to make some further observations on this matter.  I know that when some of these actors applied some time ago one of the queries they were asked was what was their knowledge of Irish.  I claim to be as good a supporter of the Irish language as anybody in this House, or in the country for that matter.  I am always ready to take an opportunity of speaking on behalf of the Irish language, but it is absolutely unfair to debar good actors of 40 and 45 years from broadcasting from Radio Éireann simply because they have not a sufficient knowledge of Irish.  I could give the Minister the names of at least five out of the ten best actors and actresses in this country who do not know two words of Irish.  It is not their fault that they do not know the language.  Because of their age they did not have an opportunity of learning the language as well as Radio Éireann would like them to.  Such people should not be barred from broadcasting from Radio Éireann. I met a gentleman last Sunday night who, I suppose, would be rated as among the first five best actors in the country.  He is pro-Irish but he does not know the language.  He did not get the job because he had not a sufficient knowledge of the language.  I can give the Minister the name of this gentleman.  I must say I think the whole matter is deplorable.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the new short-wave station from which it is proposed to broadcast to America.  We are going to give the world a better idea of how we in this country live.  We are going to demonstrate our talent, our music and our acting ability to North America <Col N="1615" /> and to the world in general.  I do hope that Radio Éireann will not misrepresent the Irishman.  I hope that we will not have the Irishman represented as being one who goes around in a green knee breeches waving a shillelagh and says &ldquo;begob&rdquo; and &ldquo;begorra&rdquo;.  We have too much of that from the American stage, from the British stage and from the British broadcasting stations, and I hope that we will not do so too. I would not be a bit surprised if we did, but I sincerely hope that we will not get that type of stage Irishman represented to North America and the other countries of the world.</P>
    <P>I do hope, with further reference to this new station, that we will introduce, if only very subtly, the question of Partition.  I know the subject is contentious even in this House and that different Deputies have their own opinions as to whether Partition will ever be abolished or not but I think the suggestion is worth considering. We do not want red-roaring revolutionary speeches about the Border and about Partition but I think we certainly could put our case to the world through this short-wave station.  I will not attempt to suggest what particular lines or views should be adopted but I think we should exploit this new short - wave station in the matter of Partition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that we are going to have this short-wave station erected and that it will soon be utilised for the purposes for which the Minister intends it to be used.  Deputy Corish has referred to one matter in which I am very interested and for which the radio should be mostly used and that is to convey our manner of life here to the people who are living outside this country and to other nations&mdash;the way we live, our democratic system and, in particular, our problem of Partition. I always maintain and shall continue to maintain that we in this country require more so than ever before a Minister for Propaganda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That particular Ministry would be more equipped now for fulfilling its duties than ever before, seeing that we are now going to have this station to which the Minister has referred.  I think <Col N="1616" /> it would be one way of conveying to the people outside this country the position in relation to Partition and of letting them know the circumstances of this unnatural division which was imposed upon us so many years ago. Outside Ireland itself it has always been impossible to tune into Radio Éireann.  A number of other stations seem constantly to interrupt the music or the speaker or the announcer.  It is nearly always impossible to hear whatever is coming over the air.  We are told by the Minister that that will not be so in the near future.  That being the case, this is a golden opportunity for the Government and the Minister should encourage the Government to establish a Ministry or Department of Propaganda in order to convey the truth over the radio.  There is no doubt about it, the facts about the position of this country are misrepresented abroad&mdash;even in the case of our neighbour, Great Britain.  It is surprising how little the people in that country who are living so close to us know about our position: how ignorant they are of how we in this country live.  This is one way of destroying the poisoned pen of those who engage in the type of misrepresentation in which they do engage in Great Britain and outside Great Britain.  The radio is a powerful weapon, and I think it could be used to undo the harm which has been done by those who are engaged in building up a false impression so far as this country is concerned.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I think the radio should be used to give more information to the people in regard to agriculture.  For a great part of the day it is closed down when it could be engaged in giving useful information.  It is very rarely that you hear lectures on agriculture on the radio.  There are a lot of other things which could be conveyed on the radio which would be of benefit to the people.  We are a young country so far as the freedom of the country is concerned.  In this part of Ireland which is free we have only had our own Government for 22 or 23 years. There are a lot of things which could be pointed out to the people, such as matters in relation to civic duty and civic spirit.  I think the radio to-day, if properly used, is a greater weapon <Col N="1617" /> even than the Press, because in rural Ireland many people are unable to buy newspapers as they live at a distance from a town and are unable to go in to buy the papers.  They avail of the wireless in the evenings.  It is a source of company to those who cannot avail of the pictures or dancing or who cannot get the newspapers.  It brings to them news not only in relation to this country but to matters outside this country.  There are many ways of entertaining the people with a view to helping them to be better citizens.</P>
    <P>I am not sufficient of an expert to say what type of music we should have.  I listen in to the music on the radio and I do not find any fault with it.  I am no judge as to whether it is good or bad.  We should also use the radio to help to develop the Irish language more than has been done in the past. We could use it to help people to realise the benefits which would accrue from the Irish language.  Because it is pointed out to them time and again that failure to develop our own tongue means putting a limit to our nationality and our freedom a lot of people look upon it as a joke, while it is the truth. The radio could help to remove that false impression.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it would be of benefit to the agricultural community if the radio could be used for conveying to them information in regard to the price of cattle and things of that kind. It would be of immense importance to people who are unable to get the newspapers to have the news conveyed to them over the radio.  Sometimes the radio refers to certain things and then announces that the full information will be published in the papers the next day.  Does the Minister seriously think that the people are going to walk into a town and purchase a newspaper to find out what will be published in it?  I can well understand the radio becoming a very strong competitor of the newspapers from that point of view.  Nevertheless, we cannot consider that.  The interests of the people must come first, rather than the fact that you may harm the circulation of the newspapers.  I can well understand that if you give over Radio Éireann important announcements in detail people are not going to go to <Col N="1618" /> the town to buy the newspapers.  If the newspapers are to offset that, they will have to make it their business to see that the papers are delivered to the houses of the people who are desirous of reading them.  Otherwise, Radio Éireann will take the place of the Press.  I think it is wrong just to announce that such-and-such a thing will be published in the next day's papers and not to go the whole way and give the full details of the matter, whether the announcement has reference to price control or whatever else it may be.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, since I came to this House I have felt very strongly about the necessity of developing Radio Éireann with a view to bringing a certain amount of comfort not only to our people here but to Irish exiles abroad.  I can assure the Minister that there will be none so pleased as the Irishmen and Irishwomen who live outside this country when the new short-wave station is working.  There will be none so pleased as these Irish men and women who live across the Channel, and I assume the same thing applies to those who live in America and other parts of the world, when they will be able to tune in to Radio Éireann without being interrupted by somebody talking about the Scandinavian countries or other countries.</P>
    <P>If in the start-off of your new station you are unable to give satisfaction in regard to musical items and items of entertainment and news it will be a bad thing.  It would be better to wait six months or even a year before starting, because if the start is bad, and if those who are interested and who have been waiting for a considerable time for this short-wave station find that it is lacking in something that they expected, it will create a bad impression and it will take a very considerable time to undo the harm created.</P>
    <P>I advise the Minister not to open the station until he has everything as near perfection as possible so that when the station is opened we will be able to create the impression expected by those who have been waiting anxiously for it for a considerable number of years.  As I said, none will appreciate it so much as those who live outside the country.  Many times, when I lived outside <Col N="1619" /> this country, an announcement was made that on St. Patrick's Day or some other day the head of the Government or some other person would speak, but, when you tuned in, you could only hear a few words here and there.  That was very disappointing. I have had the experience of asking English people to listen in on such an occasion, but they found they could not hear anything and I felt ashamed. That will not be so in the future.  Let us hope that when the station is opened we will be able to give to the people outside this country the satisfaction we should like to give them, that the Minister will avail of the opportunity to use Radio Éireann with the object of bringing to the outer world the true position in relation to Partition.  The radio would be a great weapon and would have tremendous effect in that respect.</P>
    <P>Let us look back on the effects of radio during the war and consider its reactions on the people then.  The radio during the war was just as important, in a sense, as an army.  It had a terrible effect in many ways and also a demoralising effect upon the various armies and the peoples engaged in the war.  We all listened at one time or another, I am sure, to the gentleman who has now passed into the next world and who was known as Lord Haw-haw.  You can well imagine the effect his broadcasts had from the propaganda point of view.  He was subtle and capable in putting over his stuff on behalf of the German régime. If we could only have a man who would put over, not the type of thing that he broadcast, but the real truth, with the same power that he possessed, look at the impression it would create in other countries.  I believe it would go a long way in bringing home to the peoples of other countries the position in which we are placed.</P>
    <P>We all know of the poisoned pens of journalists in England and outside England with reference to this country. We know how we have been misrepresented&mdash;devilishly and deliberately misrepresented&mdash;by these gentlemen who are paid for doing so.  We all know the strength of the pen.  We <Col N="1620" /> could use Radio Éireann to undo all that.  That is why I strongly urge that we should have a Department of Propaganda.  If we are in earnest in our efforts to destroy the poisoned pens of these journalists who stoop to that type of propaganda, and if we are at all anxious to remove from the map of Ireland the mark of Partition, we should make very effective use of our radio station.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that when I first looked at this Estimate in the Book of Estimates I was very pleasantly surprised, because I saw that under sub-head A the salaries, wages and allowances have gone up from £41,000 to £97,000, an increase of £55,000 on the original £41,000, which is well below the one-third, or so, that is represented generally in these Estimates.</P>
      <P>My pleasure was not very long-lived, because I gather that £44,000 of the £55,000 is for a new organisation.  I do not pretend that these figures are, therefore, exact, but it would appear that the increase in salaries for the old staff comes to £11,000 on £44,000&mdash;that is, about 25 per cent.  If that is the case, then this is a scandal, because the old £41,000 has now, if taken in comparison with 1939, a purchasing power of about £20,000 divided amongst the staff.  Compared with 1932 it has a purchasing power of about one-third of the £41,000.  It is now proposed to add £11,000, and even if that has a complete purchasing power of the amount it is supposed to represent, they will have £26,000 instead of the old £41,000.  So that by a little manipulation of the currency we have so many of these people in the Government service, which ought to be setting a good standard to the rest of employers, fooled out of £15,000 in the year.</P>
      <P>That is something the Minister ought not to be ready to have broadcast over the new station.  If that is to be the authentic voice of Ireland, it will be a very whining voice and he will get nothing but complaints if he allows that situation to develop and become permanent, so far as the salaries of the people who are connected with the broadcasting station are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1621" /> Some of these days I hope repetition will get this matter clear, that at the moment the £ buys about 10/- worth of what it bought in 1939.  I do not propose to follow this down through the various members of the staff, from the so-called highly paid to those at the end of the list, and ask you to try to imagine what the homes that these moneys are pouring into are like with the salaries reduced by half.  That is what has happened, but I think the real picture is something worse.  Kings in the old days clipped coins.  At a later stage they manufactured money for themselves.  We have found a better method.  We keep salaries low and allow prices to rise, and having given people about a quarter of an increase on their salaries we ask them to do more work than what they did before. I cannot understand the conscience or the reason behind that, and as for the optimism that better work will be done for a lesser salary&mdash;that passes my understanding.</P>
    <P>Comment was made by Deputy Blowick&mdash;and I want to emphasise what he said&mdash;on this matter of censorship or guardianship of what people say when they are invited to broadcast. I was invited to do so only once and my experience was such that I would never willingly accept an invitation to do so again.  It was an occasion when it was thought a good idea to have different people expressing their opinions on the Budget which had been introduced. I presented myself to the broadcasting station and I was promptly asked for my script.  I had not got one, but I had an envelope with a few notes jotted on it.  For a moment there was a very embarrassing pause and it looked as if the whole thing would be called off, but it had been generally understood that certain people would speak over the radio and that I was chosen by my Party to do so.  Eventually, under these circumstances I was allowed to speak&mdash;that the director faced me when I faced the microphone and he stayed there with full control of the signals to those in charge of the transmission, so that I could be cut off at any moment if I said anything of which he did not approve.</P>
    <P>I could only believe it was that; I could not imagine that I had been <Col N="1622" /> asked to broadcast and that there was an impression that I might say something disorderly or rude, without thinking at all of things that were obscene or indecent, over the radio. But the appearance of the director as he faced me was that of a man ready for the worst and the only thing that assured him to allow the broadcast to go on was that there could not be more than one or two evil words getting away.  Why should anyone be subjected to that indignity?  If a person is in a representative capacity as a member of the Dáil, if a person is in the literary movement&mdash;anybody who has merit enough to reach the position that he is chosen by various people to represent them&mdash;why should he not be allowed to speak over the radio without suffering such indignities?  I am not so enamoured of the diction of some of the prepared stuff that comes across the radio.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to an address being ruled on from the point of view of style, but surely the Minister will realise that, if a person is asked to broadcast and if he is going to be ignorant, coarse or loutish enough or bad enough, if he has any of the vices that might prompt him to say improper or undesirable things, with the audience he has over the radio he is going to suffer much more himself than anybody else.  I should imagine that one effort of that sort would be sufficient.</P>
    <P>In any event is there not enough trust in the people who are asked to speak over the radio to ensure that they will be allowed to say freely what they want to say and that nobody is going to look for the manuscript to see whether it requires any censorship or touching up or somebody standing by to cut them off, with the guillotine ready to fall in case some undesirable words should escape?  As I say, I had one experience and I certainly do not want another.  I certainly say that people of a representative type, such as those who were invited to speak in connection with the Davitt and Davis celebrations, should not be subjected to interference of this kind.  The back-ground or the justification of it is that you want to prevent people from saying anything that may be offensive on <Col N="1623" /> a current topic.  None of these things was in the minds of the people who operate these guardianship ideas.  This was clearly an attempt to use the Davis and Davitt celebrations as an occasion for Government propaganda, and unless the broadcaster was prepared to fit his broadcast into the framework arranged, he was not welcomed. The view of the station, apparently, is that they are better off without such people.</P>
    <P>That may be a good policy for the time being but it is a bad policy when one considers the ultimate result, and that we are parading ourselves before the world as a reasonable community where people with varying views are allowed to express these views and can express them in a way that will not give offence to others.  They may have strong views and express them strongly but at least they should be given the credit of knowing how to express them without causing undue pain to others. There is no doubt the main idea on the occasion of the Davis and Davitt celebrations was to organise them in such a way as to get further worshippers to crowd around the shrine at which the Taoiseach sat, and if it was not going to serve that purpose, it did not matter about the feelings of the individuals concerned.  I understand this difference was made, that whereas other invitees to the Davitt meeting were asked to give a script of what they intended to say, it was sufficient in the case of the Taoiseach to ask for the notes.</P>

      <P>I think if there is any person from whom a script should be demanded, it should be the Taoiseach because the Taoiseach's words have to be very carefully looked into. If you want to look for the cloven hoof, if I might mix the metaphor, you certainly must look for it in the case of the Taoiseach's broadcast. While other people are in a position to recognise what they intended to say, in case there is any question afterwards, it can scarcely be said in connection with the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Deputies have referred to Partition in connection with the new broadcasting station.  The Taoiseach, through our broadcasting system, addressed the people of America, or our people in America, on St. Patrick's Day.  I wonder was that spoken from a script?  If he went down with a full script of the broadcast and the chief director made a demand to see it beforehand, I doubt if the Taoiseach would have given it to him.  If the director did ask to see it beforehand, I wonder why one particular allusion was not cut out.  The Taoiseach likes to pose before the world as one who is learned in international affairs.  His comment in this instance, as far as I remember, was that on two big questions, recently before the world, Partition had been discouraged as a remedy, that Partition had not been accepted.  These two cases were Palestine and India.  It is a pity that he said that as he may have to eat his own words or else explain them when it may not be so easy to do so.  It would look now as if the two distinct cases in which Partition will be a remedy will be both Palestine and India.  Of course, the Taoiseach always likes to display his learning but the Taoiseach may well be cited as outstanding amongst the number of examples of where a little learning is so completely dangerous.  The main point I am making is whether the Director of Broadcasting demanded and received the <Col N="1625" /> script of what the Taoiseach said before it was delivered.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I must say that I shudder when I see that the new broadcasting station is going to be so arranged that news bulletins will be broadcast regularly so as to present a continuous picture of Irish events and activities.  If these bulletins are going to be a reproduction of the stuff we get as an explanation of what happens in Dáil Éireann on occasions, I would ask that they should be cut out.  It may be a good Party script but it is not a good news script.  It is not a script that gives anybody an idea that there is anything in the way of reason going on in this House other than what comes from the Government Benches.  If we are to get a continuous picture of events and activities broadcast constantly, is it going to be a Party description, because that is what we have through the news bulletins?  You do not get much Party colour into the stock exchange news, but once it comes to anything that is capable of colouring, the colour is undoubtedly given.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roddy had queried this new broadcasting station from the special point that the Minister years ago promised a full and detailed estimate of what was intended and an itemised cost of the carrying out of whatever was intended.  That was certainly promised a couple of years ago but we are still in the stage of being told, in the phrase of the Minister, that the station is almost entirely equipped. Deputy Roddy got a reply from the Minister which suggested that the nearest he could go to an estimate was that the station would cost anything between £250,000 and £300,000 or £400,000.  I remember the phrase that was used before, that we were going to hear the authentic voice of Ireland on a short wave.  Deputy Corish thinks that the phrase means&mdash;I do not think so&mdash;that we would have a picture of life in the Irish community as lived to-day.  Is that really intended?  Are we going to get a picture of life in this community as it is lived to-day? because if so, wisdom would suggest how urgent it is that we should not have a broadcasting station.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1626" /> Do we want the authentic voice of Ireland picturing community life at the low level at which we have it in Ireland to-day?  Is that something we want advertised?  Do we want that broadcast? Do we want people to understand and hear the situation to which the people of the country have been reduced?  Would that mean, for instance, that the Minister would broadcast details about emigration, or would that be regarded as something awkward, something we had better close our eyes to?  I presume that, when he talks of the authentic voice of Ireland, it will not be the same old repetitive dullness of the céilidhe band which we have regularly from Radio Éireann.  If it is only that, it will not do so much harm, though it may bore people, but as to the authentic voice of Ireland telling about community life as lived in this country, I suggest that we are not in a state in which that is a desirable project at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his opening statement, said that the improvements which are proposed would be very desirable for the home service, even if the inauguration of an overseas service was not being embarked upon.  Why not try it on the home dog, so to speak, first? Why not let us have these improvements? So far as it is a question of increasing the strength of the orchestra, getting in outside conductors and going ahead generally on the lines of the symphony concerts and so on, that is all good, and let us who are paying the licence enjoy a little more of that at home, but why not test out the new scheme at home?  What about giving us at home a little more of the authentic voice of Ireland and the life of the community as it is lived here first and seeing the advantage of it?  So far as I understand, it will not make any difference in cost because we propose to go in for this expenditure and we are told about £150,000 is being gathered in between licences and advertising and the whole matter is to cost about £370,000.  We will not get any money from those who will receive the authentic voice of Ireland abroad. Why not have a year in which our own people will be given this and nobody else&mdash;try it out on our own people first &mdash;and have a poll from time to time to <Col N="1627" /> see how the thing is working, whether the items are representative, whether there is a sort of artificial parade of a prosperity that is not here, whether the thing approaches reality or whether the reality is so grim in fact that we would rather have a little silence in respect of the whole thing for some time until we have a chance of getting on our feet again?</P>
    <P>I wonder would the Minister consider allowing, say, these new actors, this new troupe of actors he is going to get attached to him permanently, instead of the people who give us their services casually, and, say, the new orchestra at the new salaries, an evening per month in which they could broadcast of their own free will, particularly about the station and about those who run the station, with special advertence to the conditions under which they are asked to live and some little sideline which might be given on the artistic temperament and how it finds itself cribbed and cabined, or else, loosened up, by the conditions of permanent association with Radio Éireann, instead of having their chances to make something casually and give casually to Radio Éireann. Even if the Minister will not allow us licence holders to listen in to that broadcast, can he not do it privately and let himself and his staff listen and learn from the criticism of those who are suffering under the particular spreading of the money in this Vote?</P>
    <P>The way the new service is run has for a long time been objected to, and we had a special outbreak in that connection in respect of a particular announcer who had to leave the service of Radio Éireann because he took a political line that was opposed to the Government.  What political inhibitions are put upon those who broadcast? Is it one of them that they may appear on no platform except a Government platform, or is there any limit to the mild criticism they may utter of Government, if they decide to affiliate themselves with some Party other than the Government Party?  Is there a line drawn and are the announcers, the compéres and so on given a completely clear view of where and how far they may go before they decide to <Col N="1628" /> enter the service of Radio Éireann?  It is quite clear to anybody who has considered the circumstances in this connection that a very strict prohibition is put upon them, that it is again with the idea of attaining the same objective as was sought to be attained when Deputy Blowick and others were asked to send in their scripts, and that it is a Party angle that this whole thing is viewed from.  The only excuse given is the excuse which the Minister has given, not in the House but on occasions from platforms, that once you belong to the Party he represents, you belong to the State, the State is the authority and all the rest of it.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered, when I listen to things on the radio, whether there is sufficient imagination about the matters broadcast to us.  Deputy Corish, I notice, has an admiration for Radio Éireann.  I put myself on the other side&mdash;I do not like it.  I do not at all agree with this wholehearted criticism of the station that nothing good ever comes from it.  That is not so, of course, but as to whether I get value&mdash;and I am not neglecting the difference in the fees which may be paid on the other side and the resources of broadcasting in America, England and on the Continent when it was open&mdash;I can think of some very small stations which would not be paraded as an outrageous comparison with what we have here, from which one derives more enjoyment than one derives from the station here.  Whatever is done here is rather stereotyped. There has been a little attempt to get variety in recent years, but the imagination which carried the thing a little forward appears to have then waned and there is no further drive to get new situations developed.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Corish is right when he says that there is artistic talent enough in the country.  The only thing we have to recognise&mdash;and I am sure Deputy Corish recognises it&mdash;is that a tremendous amount of the talent we have here is not harnessed up to Radio Éireann.  Some of the people who have this talent do not readily allow themselves to be recruited by Radio Éireann, and that is because, I think, of the conditions of service.  When one tunes in to programmes from elsewhere <Col N="1629" /> and listens to people there, whether it be music, something in the way of drama, news or anything else, one hears voices which one feels that, with a little daring in the way of expense, could have been captured for this country, and one feels that these people could have been associated with Radio Éireann instead of being associated with some of the stations elsewhere.  That is only an aspect of what we have got all through life here at the moment.  A great many of the people of worth and talent here are flying the country because they cannot see any great future for themselves here.</P>
    <P>In connection with trade matters here, I often wonder if Radio Éireann would ever think of enlightening the people about certain things happening in the background.  They could give us enlightenment on certain important matters.  Take the case of Córas Iompair Éireann.  One knows that, in connection with railway economics, there is an old business about trying to charge what the traffic can bear.  I should like to be allowed to listen in through the radio to a meeting of the board of directors of Córas Iompair Éireann when they are deciding what rates they will charge.  The general view is that they charge what the public will stand, or what they think the public will stand, instead of what the traffic will bear.  I have often been intrigued&mdash;I have talked to colleagues in Dáil Éireann about it&mdash;by the thought of what happens at a board meeting of the Central Bank when they come to decide on the rate of interest to be paid on bank accounts here, or generally how they are going to establish the finances of the country and what they do in that connection. If there was an amount of learning and argument and if very heavy matters were discussed at that meeting, it would be worth while letting the outsider know just what is discussed. Again, of course, the common view is that somebody calls for a copy of the London <i>Times</i> to see what rate is struck in England, and then they decide that is what we shall have here.  We should be let into some of these secrets, and allowed to know something that would illuminate the <Col N="1630" /> life that we have to lead here.  In that connection, I notice that recently a &ldquo;Question Time&rdquo; was run by the <i>Independent</i>, and one of the questions asked was what the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;not worth a rap&rdquo; was.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the interval, I was speaking on the difference between the precedents, or alleged precedents, quoted and what is before us in this Bill.  I was making the case that it is quite proper for Dáil Éireann, on occasion, to say, in respect of legislation it has passed: &ldquo;The courts have shown by their decision that they do not appreciate the mind we had on this particular matter.  We shall let the people who obtained a decision reap the reward of their enterprise but we shall, by Act, try to establish for the courts a new system and introduce phrases which they will interpret so as to give effect to our intention.&rdquo;  That is a normal proceeding.  Nobody can object to that.  In the phrase he quoted in relation to the Local Authorities Mutual Assurance Bill, Deputy O'Connor showed that that was quite clearly what was intended to be done.  The court came to a decision not in accordance with a view of the Dáil and, for future cases, the Dáil re-established its view.  That went before the courts and the courts took a view in accord with what Dáil Éireann intended. Thereafter, the matter proceeded accordingly. It is open to the Dáil from time to time to do that and nobody can object to it.  Here, we are writing in a provision to prevent people from getting a decision.  We are dragging the matter out of the courts and into what the Taoiseach calls &ldquo;the supreme court of this Dáil&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put in contrast two things. We are living under the Constitution of the year 1937.  In the earlier part of that Constitution, it is stated that there are different powers of Government and they are divided into the ordinary three branches&mdash;legislative, executive and judicial.  Those three <Col N="1631" /> branches are followed in those divisions through the Constitution.  We come to the Article which deals with the courts in Article 34.  There are previous references to the courts, but this is the article which establishes the court system.  In the Constitution under which we invite the people to live, we say that there are to be three types of functions to be attended to&mdash; judicial, executive and legislative.  In Article 34, we tell the people what we propose for them in the way of courts. We say in that Article:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Justice shall be administered in courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by this Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The remainder of the paragraph deals with the question as to whether justice is to be administered in public or not. That is not relevant here.  Justice is to be administered in courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by the Constitution.  At a later point, we divide the courts into courts of first instance and a court of final appeal.  In paragraph (3) of Article 34 we say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The courts of first instance shall include a High Court, invested with full original jurisdiction in and power to determine all matters and questions whether of law or fact, civil or criminal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are further provisions but that gives in a skeleton way the situation of the courts in connection with justice. The people were told, that, under that Constitution, we were going to see that justice would be administered and that there would be no question of the Executive interfering with the courts.  We were going to see that the courts would be independent of the Executive because they would be presided over by judges appointed in the manner provided by the Constitution.  They were to be the people to administer justice.  Later, in reference to the judges, by a device that has come down through history, we established that situation of the independence of the judiciary.  We tell them that we expect them to be independent. We tell them that they cannot be removed save under very peculiar circumstances and for reasons <Col N="1632" /> such as misbehaviour or incapacity.  We give them tenure for a particular period and we guarantee that their emoluments will not be reduced during their period in office.  We ask the judges to take an oath when they enter upon their work.  The oath prescribed for judges appointed under the Constitution, which covers the higher courts, is in the following terms:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the presence of Almighty God, I &mdash;&mdash; do solemnly and sincerely promise and declare that I will duly and faithfully to the best of my knowledge and power execute the office of &mdash;&mdash; without fear or favour, affection or ill-will towards any man and that I will uphold the Constitution and the laws.  May God direct and sustain me.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In that very solemn way, we establish courts with independent judges whom we bind by an oath to behave in that way.  Then, we say to the people: &ldquo;Any time you want justice, go to those courts with the knowledge that they are presided over by judges whom we cannot sway by changing their salaries or by removing them from office.  We have appointed them because we believe they will carry out their trust and we have put it beyond our power to penalise them by dismissal or reduction of emoluments so as to give them a free hand to do their work.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We say of them that they are to be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions, in Article 35; so we tell them that they are to be independent and we provide them with the means of securing that independence. Then we turn to the people and say: &ldquo;If you have a case, go plead it in our courts, for you will get independent judges.&rdquo;  We tell them in the forefront of the Constitution that there are three types of function in any case&mdash;legislative, executive and judicial.  Go to Article 34 and what follows it and you will find what is meant by the courts. In those circumstances, people go to the courts asking to have decided a simple question, a question that is certainly simple for the courts to decide &mdash;they have decided many things like it often before&mdash;whether the people who claim these funds really merit them and are entitled to them.  When <Col N="1633" /> that case has stayed there for some time, the Taoiseach comes in here with this piece of legislation and its effect is that, on its passing, all further proceedings shall be stayed.  Then, to prevent the High Court having any independent view of this, we find: &ldquo;The High Court shall, if an application in that behalf is made <i>ex parte</i> by or on behalf of the Attorney-General, make an order dismissing the pending action without costs.&rdquo;  Then there is provision for the payment of the costs.  After that, we find that: &ldquo;No action or other proceeding shall, save as provided by this section, or Section 11 of this Act, be brought or instituted in respect of the court funds or the moneys on deposit in the bank.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, having taken that money out of the court, it is to be distributed in accordance with the other sections of the Bill.  What is to be substituted? A committee of people will be nominated by the Government.  That committee will be presided over by the Chief Justice or someone nominated by him and from that committee there may be removed from time to time such people as a group of three outside the court nominated by the Chief Justice may determine, on the application of the Attorney-General&mdash;and that is no question of competence, although the Taoiseach tried to make out the other night that it was.  It says: &ldquo;If it is thought desirable to move him.&rdquo;  This group of non-judicial people, as shown in the Bill in any event, is then to distribute the funds.  They are to decide their own procedure; they can decide what evidence they will have before them, what records will be kept of the evidence; and the money will be paid out.</P>
    <P>Now, may I make the contrast?  All the things that make for independence in the judiciary are absent from the new body.  It is not to be thought that the Chief Justice becoming chairman of this remains Chief Justice, or at least is Chief Justice in relation to the position.  He is not; he has no judicial oath to bind him, he is nothing in respect to these disbursements.  The committee are to be nominees, not judicial people.  All the rules of evidence may go by the board.  Records that ought to be kept, so that people <Col N="1634" /> could thereafter say that somebody got those moneys who was not entitled to them&mdash;all that is to go.  Supposing one were thinking of a real racket.  Supposing a gang of people with the worst minds in the world got together and said they wanted to think of a group who would distribute some funds to friends of that group, what would they, if they wanted full freedom of action, think of doing?</P>

      <P>This Section 10 stops the court proceedings.  Think of the audacity of people who, in any country, step into the court and stop the court proceedings.  Having done so, they have to put in something instead of the court and they decide immediately: &ldquo;We will have our own pals in this and in case the courts might look in afterwards and there should be any arguments, we will have none of that nonsense of keeping records: let the people apply here orally and we will have a rough and ready examination and we will give out the money&rdquo;.  Then they might say: &ldquo;That would be too much of a <Col N="1635" /> scandal.  We ought to cloak it in some way&rdquo;.  Then they will have someone in another position and get him in, in order to put a gloss, something in the way of a fair-seeming appearance, over the whole matter.  I suggest that that is what is being done here and that that impress is on the whole set up of what it is proposed to substitute for the court proceedings which are to be stayed under Section 10.</P>
      <P>I come back again to why the proceedings are being stayed.  We have gone to some trouble to establish courts in this country, and an attempt has been made to build up an institution of which we could be proud.  We have gone ahead without constituting new and wonderful devices.  We have put in what would appeal to the common man down through the ages as the fortification of the independence of the judiciary.  The Taoiseach cannot let it be thought that he is afraid of the courts, yet we are going to stay the proceedings, after the passing of this Bill, on the application of the Attorney-General.  I have gone through the debates, in so far as they came to my hands, and that brings me up to last Friday, to see what arguments had been used.  I want to deal with them very briefly.  The first is delay. Are we to take it that the Taoiseach's view is that, in any case hereafter in which there is delay in bringing proceedings to a head, he will intervene with legislation?  His language is general enough to suggest that that is the general policy.  He could make no argument on that, as there need not be delay if the parties to the action are vigilant.  There certainly need not be unreasonable delay.  The courts are open to an application by a group of defendants to hear a case, after a certain time has elapsed, when there is power in any defendant to give notice of trial and bring an unwilling plain-tiff into court.  Therefore, no great case can be made on unreasonable delay, as the courts have their own devices against that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case, the only thing that could be said is that the reason why that procedure was not adopted was that there were no people who, even after four or five years, could get the <Col N="1636" /> courts to declare that the action was one fit to be set down there and then for trial, on the application being made.  Hence, that procedure was avoided and another was adopted. One party to the action applied to have the matter dismissed out of court for want of prosecution.  That was tried and the courts have not granted the dismiss, so there cannot be such great unreason about the delay as is represented here.</P>
    <P>Then, there is the Taoiseach's point that these courts might give an unreal decision, decisions that were narrow legalistic ones, or might not be in possession of the facts.  He talks of bringing the action to the &ldquo;sovereign court of justice, Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.  That is certainly a surprise to anyone who reads the Constitution.  No one yet ever proffered the Dáil as a sovereign court of justice that was to evaluate any claims as between parties to litigation. The Dáil has often been paraded as the proper party and the only party in this State to pass legislation, but to pass legislation in the main with an eye to the future.  But this is brought to the sovereign court of justice, the court which can decide upon the essential justice of what is proposed.  Every act of ours here, everything we do here, is to be judged by this fundamental justice&mdash;that is, justice from the point of view of the well-being of the people as a whole and the common good.  That, I take it, is supposed to have reference to the preamble to the Constitution, that part of it which speaks of seeking to promote the common good with due observance of prudence, justice and charity, so that the dignity and freedom of the individual may be assured.</P>
    <P>Remember that one of the matters caught up in that part of the preamble is that there shall be due observance of justice, and that we assure the dignity and freedom of the individual.  However little he may have thought his words would be regarded, the Taoiseach takes the view that seeing that certain people are insignificant folk that was an argument for cutting across the rights that they propose to test in a court action.  Deputy Dillon made the proper observation on that, that constitutional guarantees are probably not required by people who <Col N="1637" /> are of great significance because they may get their way anyhow.  Constitutions are always supposed to be specially regarded by people who are insignificant and of little worth.  Their rights are supposed to be respected and they are given guarantees of a constitutional type.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach thinks this is a proper matter to bring into the sovereign court, and that we will be judged by our attitude towards it to the common good.  We have to stand or fall by this Bill on the basis that it is for the common good.  He said that we were doing substantial justice in dealing with these moneys in this way:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no fear that the people will be scandalised or that they will feel that an attack is being made on the independence of the courts or anything of that sort.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later he says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have no hesitation in saying that it would be substantial injustice &mdash;no matter how formally it might appear to be true&mdash;if these people were to get the money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later again he says that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The representatives of the Irish people here, in whose cause and for whose fundamental purpose these moneys were subscribed, comprise the most equitable body to decide how the funds should be used.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that we are not merely the sovereign court of justice, but, as representing the Irish people, we have the right to decide how these moneys should be used.  The only argument made derogatory of the courts is that the courts are not capable of deciding this case on proper lines.  Therefore, we are going to cut across the courts. I say that you may succeed in your action over this Bill.  If you carry your measure you will get these moneys and you will get them without any documentation in a way that no one can challenge in court.  You will have a number of people benefiting by a prejudiced and partial distribution of these funds.</P>
    <P>That is what the people who pride themselves on having brought in the Constitution are proposing to do.  The Taoiseach and his followers are seeking-to wreck it frequently and at important <Col N="1638" /> points.  Through this activity, the Taoiseach is cutting completely across the ordinary division of powers that there is in the Constitution&mdash; judicial, executive and legislative.  He says that this legislative body is the supreme court of justice.  If that is going to happen now, Deputy Dillon made the point: What is to prevent it happening again?  The people who make that argument in this case can equally make it in another case.  If a majority here like to deem this the supreme court of justice, then they can take anything out of the hands of the courts.  The only background to that is the constitutional right that people may ask the courts to decide whether what we are doing is constitutional or not.  I wonder will the Taoiseach be very happy.  Supposing a case is brought as a test case to the courts as to whether or not this legislative body has any right to act as a court of justice, and he gets a decision that it has the right, where are your courts of justice after that?  That certainly opens the door for any kind of legislative activity in connection with any action that is before the courts.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Taoiseach wants to put it so far as that, but that will be inherent in the judgement he gets in his favour in this matter, that once you go to that point you are back again at this: that a Party, with a majority in this House, can deride the courts, and all the grand things that are written about the appointment of judges and giving them independence will appear as so much nonsense, because on any and every occasion on which somebody brings in a piece of legislation he can lift a matter out of the hands of the courts and decide it here according to the view of the supreme court of justice.  I suggest that is not a conclusion that anyone should like of the constitutional position. It is not a position that anybody should lightly seek, but that is the result that you are going to get if this thing is pursued.  As against that, there is the court which is controlling these proceedings, a court that nobody here has impugned except the Taoiseach.  We are all in favour of leaving this to the courts to decide. How anybody can say that anyone in <Col N="1639" /> opposition to this measure has sought to deny the powers of the courts or sought to criticise anyone belonging to the courts, I cannot understand.</P>
    <P>There is one final point.  During the week-end the Minister for Local Government gave his version of how these funds came into being.  I want to ask: Is this anything near the truth?  His view is that these moneys are public moneys.  I query that right away. The Minister explains that they are moneys that were provided in 1921 out of the funds of Dáil Éireann to maintain and strengthen the Sinn Féin organisation of the day which, the Minister says, was then as closely associated with the Ministry of Home Affairs as, for example, the Dairy Disposals Board is with the Department of Agriculture to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the origin of the funds be related to Section 10?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.  These are the funds we are dealing with.  The Minister makes the argument that these are public moneys and goes on to tell us why he believes there should be no court action at all:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Like moneys voted by the Dáil to-day to meet the cost of the public Departments, the Dáil Éireann moneys, if they were not spent on the purposes for which they were voted, were to revert to the Treasury of the then Government, the Republican Government of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If that is the case, or anything like the case, then, of course, it is not a question of asking for the action to be dismissed.  The Government should claim these moneys as belonging to the Treasury.  The Minister further goes on to say how the moneys arrived in court that they were now going to take out and put into a fund.  He said it was agreed that it would not be right or just to use the moneys in question&mdash; that is those which he says are Dáil Éireann funds&mdash;for any sectional purpose and he says &ldquo;the honorary treasurers of the Sinn Féin organisation duly carried out their instruction&rdquo;. That instruction is supposed to have been given by the Sinn Féin organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1640" /> Surely the Taoiseach will agree that that is so much nonsense, or does he accept what his Minister has propounded to the country as the true version of how these moneys came into court?  He says they came there on the instruction of the Sinn Féin organisation, that the honorary treasurers acted on these instructions.</P>
    <P>I suggest that these are not public moneys.  I suggest they are not any thing like moneys voted by the Dáil. I suggest they do not revert either to the Republican Government of Ireland, whatever that was, or to any other Government of Ireland.  I suggest the moneys were lodged by the people who did lodge them under entirely different circumstances from what the Minister describes, and are there awaiting the judgment of the court, and that the court should be allowed to pronounce that judgment.  I say there is no argument arising either on the heading of delay or on the heading of what the court might do with these moneys. The court should be allowed to adjudicate upon the funds in the ordinary way.  I think it will be a day that this Dáil will rue if they break across the whole purpose and spirit of the Constitution and, now that moneys are there awaiting decision in the court, step in and take them out of the hands of the people who are to administer justice and bring them back to this, which is a legislative body and never was intended to be a judicial body, never was intended to interpret justice as between parties, and has no right or title to interfere in this action.</P>

      <P>A great deal has been said on this section in this House. I listened this afternoon with a great deal of interest to what the Taoiseach had to say, hoping for an explanation for the insertion of this section in the Bill.  I might say this section is the Bill.  The Taoiseach did not give any clear explanation as to why this section was necessary or why this Bill was introduced.  We are a legislative Assembly.  It is not the function of this Assembly to decide issues.  It is our function to make laws.  That is where the Taoiseach has got mixed up. He said several times: &ldquo;We have the right to make laws.&rdquo;  Of course we <Col N="1641" /> have the right to make laws.  Nobody else has the right to make laws in this country.  But we have not the right to decide issues and, in this matter, we are not making a law, we are deciding an issue.</P>

      <P>I have been wondering what is the exact definition of a law, and I am sure there are lawyers in this House who can tell us, but I would say that one of the characteristics of a law is that it has general application or plural application.  This Bill has not either general application or plural application.  It cannot have it. It deals with one particular instance, the exact circumstances of which probably will never be repeated.  This Bill arises out of the peculiar circumstances surrounding this particular sum of money that will never exist again in this Dáil.  Therefore, it is an issue and, as a legislative Assembly, we are doing a bad thing when we confuse the deciding of an issue and the making of a law.  For the sake of £20,000 we are arrogating to ourselves a position which no legislative Assembly has succeeded in persuading legal minds that it has any sanction to arrogate to itself. I regret that this matter should have come before us.  I had hoped the Taoiseach would give us some valid explanation, but there was nothing in his statement this afternoon that could persuade an unbiased and balanced mind that we were not embarking on a very dangerous and bad line of conduct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He dwelt on Section 10. As Deputy McGilligan has just pointed out, he dwelt at length on the source from which the funds came and the goal to which they ought to be oriented.  He must have been very welcome at the céilidhe, discoursing on the history of these funds and the constitutional procedure which should accompany the disposal of the funds.</P>
      <P>But we must remember that he was Minister for Finance for ten years. Despite all his vanity he was custodian of the financial affairs of this country for ten years.  He has gone on record last Friday night as saying that, in his judgment, the nature of these funds was such that were they not exhausted by the trustees of Sinn Féin for the purpose for which they had been granted by the First Dáil they should accrue back.  I cannot persuade myself, silly as I know him to be, that he went out with the deliberate intention of telling these people at the céilidhe a falsehood.  I will give him credit for believing what he said to be the truth.  But if he believed what he said to be true how is it that he, as custodian of the Exchequer for ten or 12 years, knowing all the time that these funds were outstanding and that under the law as he knew it they belonged to the Treasury, knowing that they were in the hands of a trustee who was at all times ready and willing to comply with the law, knowing that all he had to do was to tell the trustee or trustees at any time during his tenure of office as Minister for Finance that there was upon them a legal obligation to turn over these moneys to the Treasury and they would be turned over at once, why did he not do it?  We are in this dilemma.  Either he went to the céilidhe on Friday night with the deliberate intention of telling a lie&mdash;that is, of course, unthinkable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  We are forced back to the conclusion that for ten years, well knowing that a substantial sum of money for the safe keeping of which he swore an oath as a member of the Government&mdash;if he did not he certainly staked his personal honour&mdash;that he would look to it and protect it for the benefit of the Exchequer of which he was the custodian, remained unprotected: that he went into office knowing it to be there and remained in office ten years all the time knowing it to be there.  He never approached or asked the trustees or he never acquainted the Government that the trustees held these funds belonging to the Treasury of this State.</P>
      <P>Surely the Taoiseach has a duty, as head of the Government, to send for that man and say to him: &ldquo;I held you out for a number of years as being the responsible Minister for Finance.  You have now publicly declared that, well knowing that moneys belonging to the Treasury were outstanding in the hands of individual trustees, you never bothered to bring them into account and but for Mrs. Buckley it looks as if you never would have.&rdquo;  What will the reply of the minister for Local Government be?  It cannot be that he told a lie, because that is unthinkable.  Is it that he is incompetent, or lazy, or what?  Surely somebody speaking on behalf of the Government ought to tell us.  If we continue to discuss this Bill, especially in respect of Section 4 and Section 10, half the Government Deputies will be in the soup.  The Taoiseach is in the soup.

It is not too late to restore some measure of mutual confidence in this House. I suggest to the Taoiseach that it would be much more desirable to restore it than to inflict upon us the ordeal of calling in the Minister for Local Government to explain to this House how it is that during his ten years of office as Minister for Finance he did not bring into account these moneys which he now says it was his duty to collect and hold for the benefit of the Irish Exchequer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. B. Maguire Mr. B. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in this debate from a few points of view. One is that I think the matter of the ownership of the fund should be permitted to be decided in the courts. Firstly, for the reason that there are many claims to that fund.  People all over the country have made claims for compensation for services given.  These claims over the years have been refused for one reason or another&mdash;I do not know for what.  But, obviously, however justifiably their claims could be maintained, the claimants have not had an opportunity of bringing their cases into court because there was no declared owner of these funds.  Accordingly, a serious injustice has been done to genuine claimants to whom moneys are due for services to Sinn Féin at the time and who have a lien on these funds.  It is an injustice to deprive them of having a declared ownership of these funds so that they may have the right to make their case and claim what is due to them.  I consider it is quite unfair that these people should be deprived of their right to what is their due and, in the ordinary way, having it determined who are the owners of the funds.  The justice of their claim should be determined in the ordinary way by the courts.  That is a form of confiscation which is unjust and accordingly I oppose it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the second place, I am opposed to the proposal because I feel that it is a matter that the courts should decide. Whether the funds belong to those who are claiming them is a matter as to which I am not offering an opinion.  But <Col N="1646" /> interfering with the ordinary processes of the court is a matter which I oppose on the ground of liberty.  I have no doubt that the Taoiseach and his Ministers fully considered the implications of this and that they had probably at the back of their minds a justification for the course that they have adopted. But these facts, for some reason, have not been disclosed to the public.  In the absence of evidence of justification &mdash;I am speaking genuinely as far as public opinion is concerned&mdash;this proposal to take the case out of the courts is certainly causing an immense amount of disquiet amongst a very wide section of the community.</P>
    <P>Whatever the causes which prompted the Taoiseach and his advisers to decide on the action they have taken, it is not sufficient that they should have had a realisation of the necessity for that course merely to justify them in the steps they took.  In order to ensure the confidence of the public in the utility of the courts, the justice of the courts, and the right of individuals to use the courts, they should have been in a position to disclose the information which guided them in coming to their decision.</P>
    <P>The courts are a necessary part of our institutions and interference with them is a serious matter.  There is a duty which every individual who claims the right of citizenship is bound to observe. To the extent that we observe that we may expect from the community an equivalent return.  If in the head of the Government and amongst Ministers there is absence of that good citizenship, in so far as they will withhold information which prevents an injustice being brought to the notice of the courts and tried out there, to that extent public opinion is stifled and confidence in our justice is destroyed. No matter what explanation we may make of good intentions in regard to the distribution of the money in the interests of the needy and the poor and those who suffered at a certain time, it is of no importance.  If there is a lien on these funds by claimants who gave services and who have a moral claim on them, those persons' claims should come first and no interference by the Government should prevent the claims being heard.  Taking <Col N="1647" /> this case out of the court is wrong and that wrong is only equalled by the lack of citizenship which the Taoiseach has shown in preventing the courts from hearing grievances, a thing which is necessary for the establishment of justice and fair play.</P>

      <P>The supreme issue in this Bill and in this section is the dignity and the independence of the courts and their prestige and effectiveness in serving the people.  It is because of the constitutional point involved in the matter and the steps which may have to be taken, if this Bill passes through both Houses of the Oireachtas, to invoke the Constitution against the terms of this measure that I want to comment upon the attitude taken by the Taoiseach this evening when he quotes a large number of Acts passed through the Oireachtas that are alleged to be precedents for what is being done in this Bill.  The Taoiseach was asked to name the actual cases affected by these Acts which were on a par with the case being dealt with in this Bill and he was not able to do it.</P>
      <P>I protest against the Taoiseach's action in throwing a smoke-screen over the whole situation and trying by innuendo to build up a case that what has been done here is an ordinary thing, and that it has been done before and trying to create the idea that there is no constitutional issue involved or likely to have to be considered in connection with this.  I ask Deputies to refer to column 1441 of the Official Report of 24th April where the Taoiseach is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is because I know the facts of this case are so well known that I have not the slightest fear that anybody in the country will think we are going to establish a precedent by our action here.  This is a unique thing in so far as this State is concerned. It is going to be unique and remain unique....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 24th April, five days ago, the Taoiseach was asking us in relation to this measure to accept it as absolutely unique and without precedent; that it was going to remain unique in that nothing like it was ever going to <Col N="1648" /> happen again.  I want to emphasise that and to sweep away the suggestion that the Taoiseach tried to make to-day that this is a normal matter.  This is not a normal matter.  The Taoiseach indicated that this is the court in which it is proper to have this thing tried because we have all the facts here.  I hesitate to add to any of the facts that we ought to know here because, as I said last Friday, I so resent the whole proposal here that I do not want to add to the facts; but, to show that there is some kind of a case being removed from the court, I would like to quote a short sentence from a speech made on the 14th March, 1929, by the Taoiseach.  In column 1398 he made a speech which began:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are asked to state clearly what our attitude towards this House is.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And then he explains why he came into the House, and in column 1400 he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Those who continued on in that organisation which we have left can claim exactly the same continuity that we claimed up to 1925.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach, in March, 1929, could state in debate that the people he left behind him in the Sinn Féin organisation could claim exactly the same continuity that he claimed up to 1925, then there is some kind of a shred of a case out of his own mouth that shows that the people who are claiming these funds in the courts have a case to make.  The fact, as has already been made patent here, that the defendants have gone to the extent of spending about £5,000 preparing material for defence, shows also there is a case, and it is because there is a case that has been admitted to that extent by the Taoiseach and that has been faced to the extent of an expenditure of £4,000 or £5,000 by the defendants, that we claim that it is an outrage to step in by an Act of the Oireachtas and quash an action that is in front of the courts.</P>
    <P>Let us recall what the Taoiseach stated here to-day in a long and very important discussion.  His argument to-day was that this is not such a unique case at all, that it is in accordance with a voluminous amount of precedent. If we accept that at its face <Col N="1649" /> value, then we might have a very serious discussion on certain matters; but the only thing I want to concentrate the debate on is the setting aside of the courts by the Oireachtas, even by a majority, and quashing a case that is in front of the courts without giving the courts a chance to deal with it.  I have asked the Taoiseach why he steps in with this Bill in 1947 when, through his own admission, this case was brought into the courts in January, 1942?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first occasion on which I have had anything to say in relation to this Bill and I would not consider it worth while saying anything were it not for Section 10.  I think it is only right, even though I am a layman who possesses very little knowledge&mdash;in fact, none&mdash;as far as law is concerned or how it is administered, that I should say that the one thing established in the minds of the people is that no matter what kind of Government we may have, so long as the law courts remain as at present constituted we can always hope for and seek protection from them.  If we are to establish a precedent of the kind here before us in Section 10, whereby the head of the Government seeks to prevent a decision of a court, I think such action would be unwise.  One cannot help wondering at such a development coming from a Party leader who has constantly talked about the liberty of the individual and the right of plain citizens here and elsewhere.  On various occasions he has raised his voice with reference to interference with the freedom of the people.  He is now determined to set an example by interfering with a decision of a court. He does that by introducing this Bill. I consider it a shame and a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government could present a reasonable excuse for this&mdash;though I as a layman cannot imagine any excuse that could be described as reasonable&mdash; particularly in connection with seeking permission from the House to interfere with the judiciary or to prevent a justice from giving his decision, the position might be different.  I know of no reason which could be given for seeking the support of the House to nullify a court decision.  In this instance the <Col N="1650" /> case is actually before the courts and in the normal way a decision would be given, but this Bill seeks to take away the action from the courts.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the Taoiseach has introduced this Bill to save his face, to avoid having to appear before a court of law where he would be crossquestioned by the counsel concerned.  I could hardly believe, even if the Taoiseach had to appear before the courts and no matter how badly he might come out of his cross-examination, that he would dare come here and seek the authority of the House to do what he is asking us to do.  I suppose this Bill will be steam-rolled through the House, no matter what may be said in opposition to it.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Maguire said, there is uneasiness abroad.  The people outside, even ordinary well-educated citizens, are unable to follow the arguments put up here by eminent men, men whom even the Taoiseach admitted are an authority on constitutional law and legal matters generally.  To my mind they have put up a sensible and reasonable case against this Bill.  Even though they are unable to follow all the arguments that have been put up for the last four or five days, nevertheless, they are capable of recognising that there is danger that if this Bill becomes law any future Government or even this Government can always point to it as a precedent for interfering in any other case which may be of an embarrassing nature in so far as the Executive of the country is concerned. We should not allow such a precedent to be established.</P>
    <P>I say without any prejudice and for no other reason than that I think that the Taoiseach is undermining the morale of the people, in so far as their rights are concerned, this section should not be passed.  We were led to believe that not only under the Irish Administration, but even under the British Administration irrespective of circumstances, every person, rich or poor, simple or gentle, had the protection of the law courts and that we could always avail of the law courts and the best counsel in the land to defend ourselves.  The Taoiseach is evidently determined to steam-roll Section 10 through this House.  There is <Col N="1651" /> no doubt that should he be allowed to do so, a claim in which the people not only of Ireland but across the water took great pride, namely, that the poorest citizen of the land could always seek the protection of the court and would have to accept the decision of that court, will no longer have any validity.</P>
    <P>This section, to my mind, should never have been introduced.  As other speakers have said, the only justification put forward for introducing it was the saving of a few miserable thousands of pounds, which the Taoiseach thought should not be squandered in legal arguments.  I want to tell the Taoiseach that that is a very poor argument.  It is a poor foundation on which to base his argument for the introduction of such a unique measure, as he himself described it.  It is unique because no other Executive other than the Executive led by the present Taoiseach would dream of interfering with the courts in the way in which the Taoiseach is apparently determined to interfere.  The Taoiseach has not been able to point to any similar measure being passed&mdash;at least he has not done so&mdash;through the British House of Commons or any other Parliament which is a democratic Assembly.  It is no wonder that he has described it as a unique measure and that he feels that a similar measure would not be introduced again.  We cannot accept his word for that.  It may not be done by other Executives but we cannot accept his word, as he may not be tempted on other occasions to do likewise.  It is for that reason that as a layman I am opposing this section.</P>
    <P>I say that we should leave matters of this kind to be dealt with by the courts which are appointed for that purpose so that Parliament could devote its time to matters which are more vital to the people.  The Taoiseach is failing in his duty to this House and to the people <Col N="1652" /> in wasting the valuable time of the House by asking it to deal with a matter such as this.  I want to register my protest and to express my disgust that we should descend to such a level that the head of the Government who has been in public life for over 30 years should use his office to try to induce this House to pass a measure of this sort.  I have made my protest but I realise that it will fall on deaf ears. I recognise that at the back of the Taoiseach there are men who disagree with his action but I also recognise that, as members of the Party, they will walk behind the Taoiseach into the Lobby on every single section that will be challenged in this Bill.  At the same time I say, not only to the Taoiseach but to every member of his Party, that this is a matter which is of such a serious nature that Party loyalty should not be considered.  No matter what promises or pledges Deputies opposite may have made to the Leader of their Party, if the Leader of the Party is determined to do something which they in their consciences believe is a deliberate infringement of the constitutional rights of the people, a deliberate mockery of the law and a deliberate insult to the intelligence of the ordinary simpleminded person in the country, I say that Party loyalty, pledges or promises should no longer oblige members of the Government walking behind the Taoiseach to deprive the ordinary people of the country of the rights which they possess.  I want to protest against the time wasted and against the impudence of the Taoiseach in coming here and asking his Party and the House generally to consent to a Bill of this nature, in which he is creating a precedent for other Executives and perhaps for use by himself in the near future.</P>

      <P>The words of the section are as clear as any paraphrase of mine could be.  The section says that the High Court shall, on the application of the board, made <i>ex parte</i>, make an order directing the court funds to be paid to the board.  That deals with the court.  The second sub-section relates to the bank and states that &ldquo;The bank shall, on the application in writing of the board, pay to the board the moneys on deposit in the bank&rdquo;.  I do not think that I could give any paraphrase which would explain more clearly than those words the meaning of the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a matter to which I should like to direct attention. Now that Section 10 has been passed, a very pretty situation has arisen. Under Section 10, it is not mandatory on the Attorney-General to move to have this action dismissed.  The action can be allowed to remain as it stands at the moment.  It can be left there <i>ad infinitum</i> without any application being made to have it dismissed.  This section proposes that the moneys lodged in court shall, on the application of the board, be transferred to the board.  That may be done, apparently, although the Attorney-General never does anything about the pending action and does not move to have it dismissed. We have had a great deal of talk about <Col N="1655" /> saving the cost of lawyers.  That taunt has been thrown up against the lawyers inside this House and, by a Minister recently, outside this House, in a matter which will be the subject of comment to-morrow.  Here, this Government, which is out to save the cost of lawyers and to save the fund from the depredations of lawyers, saddles that fund with two applications&mdash;(1) an application by the Attorney-General to dismiss the action &mdash;a futile, ridiculous and unnecessary proposal&mdash;and then an application, presumably by solicitor and counsel again, with attendant costs, to get the moneys transferred from the court to the board.</P>

      <P>Section 11 provides that, with proceedings pending in court, the Attorney-General can romp into the court, abstract all the funds in respect of which the proceedings are going on and go off with them in his hip pocket. The court will then continue the proceedings, the funds having disappeared. I am not saying that that is going to be done.  But that is the Bill as it is before us.  That is the statute we are going to make.  We are going to do that because we are too lazy and too incompetent to draft sections in such a way as to ensure that a situation cannot arise in which the processes of the High Court will briskly proceed in respect of funds which all parties in court know are no longer there.  Many aspects of this Bill <Col N="1656" /> tend to bring the judiciary and the courts into ridicule, but one can imagine the feelings of a judge on the High Court bench before whom this statute is quoted.  He will learn from it that it has now become the custom of this Legislature so cavalierly to treat the judiciary that we are quite prepared to create a situation in which the judges would be required to continue proceedings in their own courts in respect of funds which they themselves had paid out.</P>

I want merely to expose the incompetence of the Government in connection with this Bill.  The position is that, under Section 11, the board can apply to the court for an order transferring the funds.  The costs of that will presumably come out of the funds, in accordance with a subsequent section, if it is passed.  Therefore, you have the costs of that coming out of the funds which are dealt with by this Bill; but the previous section, Section 10, which we have passed, makes it incumbent on the taxpayers to pay the costs of the Attorney-General to stay these proceedings.  It is not the fund, which has been the cause of this pother and this Bill, that has to pay to stay <Col N="1659" /> the action, but the ordinary taxpayer. Why is Section 11 different from the provisions of Section 10 as regards costs and why should the taxpayer have to pay anything?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What trusts or rights there are I do not know except the rights of the original subscribers to have the money applied as they intended.  If there is any person who is charged with defending the trust individually, I am that person, because by a vote of the only body competent at the time to do it I was appointed sole trustee.  I accepted that trust at the time.  Because of the circumstances, I did not ask the treasurers of the organisation to hand over the moneys <Col N="1660" /> which they held at the time, to me in accordance with the resolution of the body which declared me trustee.  The treasurers of the body had these moneys in their immediate control. What obligations of a trust character were imposed upon them or should appear naturally to be imposed upon them by their office I do not know, in view of the motion that was passed, except that they held as treasurers of an organisation, not trustees, moneys which were subscribed to that organisation and were held by them at the disposal of the proper authority of the organisation of the time.  The treasurers, no doubt anxious about the position and their liabilities, put these at that time in court, where they have lain for the past 23 or 24 years.</P>
      <P>These are the circumstances and what is said here is that if I&mdash;I had no physical possession of these moneys at any time&mdash;in accordance with the resolution that was passed, have any trust obligations, or if the treasurers or their surviving personal representatives have any obligations, they are freed from those obligations by this clause and any trusts that were there implied or otherwise are discharged.</P>

      <P>Is it not quite apparent that this sub-clause (a) of Section 12 raises the whole issue of the principle of this Bill?  In effect, it says that whoever has any claims upon this fund, they will no longer have any claim whatever after this Bill is passed.  It is not a question of giving a discharge to a particular trustee who may have been trustee at a particular time and who may wish to have his legal position cleared up.  What is proposed to be done by this clause is to clear the fund from all claims of every kind, class and distinction, not merely against trustees as such in reference to the discharge of their duties as such, but in reference to the objects for which they were originally subscribed, in reference to any claim that may be made against them by any person, including the plaintiffs in the present action, and against any possible claim that might be made by any subscriber to get back his subscription. That is comprehensively what is intended to be done by this section and it is not merely that casual, formal <Col N="1661" /> thing the Taoiseach has endeavoured to suggest is being inflicted by this sub-clause.</P>

We are told, further, by that Minister that &ldquo;like moneys voted by the Dáil to-day to meet the cost of the public Departments, the Dáil Éireann moneys, if they were not spent on the purposes for which they were voted, were to revert to the Treasury of the then Government&rdquo;. That takes the whole matter away out of the trust altogether.  That Minister thinks that the moneys ought to go back to the Treasury.  Therefore, for 15 years, the Minister for Local Government, who at one time was Minister for Finance, did not realise that he should have tried to get these moneys in earlier.  The Taoiseach's new point&mdash; I may have taken him up wrong&mdash;is that if there is any trust he is the only person who knows what it is.</P>

The Taoiseach is now asking that this Dáil, which has already been described as the sovereign court, should decide on this, because he says: &ldquo;I am the only person remaining who was a trustee at any time and who knows what the objects are; I can tell the court what they are.&rdquo;  Is that the situation that we have now revealed? Can I be referred to any piece of legislation in which a declaration of that sort has been made referable to funds that are before the court and the subject-matter of an action?  I do not think there is any reference that can be given.</P>

Because a person is appointed a trustee does not mean that he is the only person who knows.  I was appointed a trustee with the responsibility that would flow from being a trustee for the guardianship of the funds&mdash;to keep them for disposal by the body to whom they belonged and dispose of them in accordance with the constitution of that body.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position with regard to the trusts so far as I was concerned, was this, as I have said already, the funds did not come effectively into my hands.  Therefore, I was in no position for exercising any judgment with regard to how they should be disposed of, or whether the methods proposed were in accordance with the constitution of the body to which I would be responsible.  These moneys, as I have said, were subscribed for the benefit of an organisation which at that particular time had become the civil arm of the Government.  It was helping the military on the other side to establish that body and keep it in a <i>de facto</i> position in the country.  I would not agree with the argument stated to have been put forward by the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People may differ as to the interpretation of a situation.  In my opinion, the moneys belonged to that body, to be used by it in accordance with the purposes for which they were subscribed.  The fact that they belonged to that body and that it was using its resources to establish the Government of the day&mdash;to get it into a <i>de facto</i> position&mdash;did not necessarily mean, as is reported as being the view of the Minister for Local Government, that these funds were strictly Dáil Éireann funds.  They were funds that were being used by way, if you like, of supplementing the funds of <Col N="1663" /> Dáil Éireann which were being used more directly in regard to the Government activities of the day.  The Sinn Féin organisation was an auxiliary.  It was the civil arm of the Government, and being an auxiliary I do not think it was bound to hand over its funds to Dáil Éireann.  It is not difficult for a person to mix up the two things.  I only want to say that I do not agree with the view attributed to the Minister for Local Government.  I have not seen the statement.  If the statement is as was stated in the House, then I have no difficulty in saying that I do not agree with it.</P>

      <P>The trusts are now capable of a declaration, but I would not like to be the court or the judge trying to decide what were the trusts after the Taoiseach's lucid explanation. He appears to think that it was a satisfactory explanation of the trusts attached to these moneys.  Why would he not give it in court?  Is not that what the courts are there for&mdash;to have other minds brought to bear on the type of evidence that would be given by people who purport to say that moneys were collected for a purpose and that trusts were attached to them?  The Taoiseach finds it easy to say here what the trusts are.  I asserted before that what is being evaded is that he does not want to go before the courts of justice and have the Bible put into his hands and made tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, and then say what the trusts were.  That would not suit because it means undoubtedly a whole lot of the parade he did between 1924 and 1926 would be shown up.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, in answer to me in connection with that matter of giving evidence in court as to what the trusts are, says that it is only quibbling for me to introduce into this House this point, that the defence with regard to these trust funds is that the organisation to which the plaintiffs claim to be the successors was defunct in 1924. I personally would like to see the Taoiseach standing over that statement after having been sworn in court because of what we know of his performances down to the spring of 1926. The answer made to me on that is, I know very well, that you must deny. That is more than a denial.  That is a positive statement put on the defence files.</P>

The only defence of any real type that the plaintiffs have to meet is that they could not be the successors of Sinn Féin because Sinn Féin had lapsed before 1924&mdash;that is, according to the Attorney-General&mdash;and there are many people who are ready to go to court, I understand, and to produce letters and their membership tickets and invitations and summonses to a meeting, signed by the Taoiseach acting and parading himself as head of the Sinn Féin organisation.  So, he would be brought in to aid them, they having a knowledge that one of the pleas they have to get over is that the organisation had become obsolete, defunct, had gone out of existence, prior to the year 1924, and they would have a very good aid if the Taoiseach would say down in court what he has said here in a public way.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that Sinn Féin had ceased to function in 1924; the Taoiseach is non-committal and Deputy Larry Walsh is a whole-hogger for 1947.  Now, I am the last one to give <Col N="1667" /> testimony on it for I know nothing about it, but as a Deputy it is my obligation to make up my mind in the light of the statements made by those in a position to know, and these are three separate gentlemen, all of whom have from the point of view of an ordinary observer an equal standing of authority in a matter of this kind for testimony on that particular fact.  Very well, then.  The second fact that emerges and which is peculiarly affected by Section 12 is the trust.  The ex-Minister for Finance of this Government stated at a céilidhe on Friday night that these funds were voted by Dáil Éireann in 1921, passed over to the Taoiseach ultimately as the final trustee with an obligation attaching to them which devolved upon the Taoiseach to return them to the Irish Exchequer if and when the purposes for which they had been voted by Dáil Éireann in 1921 ceased to call for their employment.  That is his story.  His story is that for the last number of years the Taoiseach has been in breach of trust, that he had a duty on him to do a certain thing or to see it done and that he did not do it.  The story of the ex-Minister for Finance is that he had a duty as a Minister to collect for the Irish Treasury funds that he knew belonged to it but he did not do it.  He does not say why but he did not do it.  That is his story.  Now the Taoiseach comes along and he says that is all wrong, no such trust as that alleged by Deputy MacEntee attached to these moneys and that if he thought even such a trust attached to them, he is wrong.  But there did attach to these moneys those very trusts that Mrs. Buckley says attached to them.  They belong to Sinn Féin, and so long as the purposes of Sinn Féin continue in existence they should be used by Sinn Féin.  That is what Mrs. Buckley says. But observe this interesting fact, that half of Deputy MacEntee's story is denied by the Taoiseach and, therefore, his whole contention must fall to the ground.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Local Government speaking as ex-Minister <Col N="1668" /> for Finance.  Half of his tale is disbelieved by the Taoiseach.  Therefore, he is swept into the ash-can.  Half only of Mrs. Buckley's story is disbelieved by the Taoiseach.  Therefore, into the ash-can with her.  Sceilg's version is not acceptable.  Into the ash-can with him.  Deputy Larry Walsh had better be careful.  But the truth of it is that it is hard to take all this seriously because the purpose of every section in this Bill, no matter what they purport to do under it, is to make it sure and doubly sure that so far as the Taoiseach is concerned, neither at the invitation of the Attorney-General nor of Mrs. Buckley nor of Sceilg nor of anybody else will he have to go into the witness-box with a Bible in his fist, and all the talk of trust is so much eye-wash, but it is a disagreeable thing that this House should be called upon to use its power to sweep aside by statute that which in any civilised community is regarded as one of the most sacred of all things &mdash; trusts, things held in trust.  It is a nasty thing to have to do and it is a bad precedent.  I would remind the House again to remember the quotation provided by Deputy Coogan from <i>Junius</i>&mdash; precedents, bad precedents, are dangerous things, and so surely as they are accepted will be used for worse purposes at a later date. I hope that on this section where the House for the first time declares its intention of sweeping trusts away without even pretending to know the nature of those trusts, there will be a division so that some of us at least may go on permanent record as decrying this method of procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make one suggestion to the Taoiseach which he will probably not regard as helpful. I would direct his attention to the fact that there is one trustee mentioned in this section to whom it is very properly proposed to give immunity from all actions, proceedings, costs, expenses, claims and demands arising out of the administration of this trust.  If this Bill were proper it would go through.  I gather from what the Taoiseach stated some little time ago that he himself was not merely a trustee but for some time and some unspecified period the sole trustee, and doubtless very magnanimously <Col N="1669" /> the Taoiseach is leaving himself open to actions for breaches of trust, to action for damages and he is not getting any money at all.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon, of course, is running over the whole gamut again trying to make out that there is a difference of opinion. Deputy McGilligan comes along and again uses his knowledge as a lawyer to confuse the minds of people who are not lawyers.  Deputy McGilligan knows perfectly well that if the Attorney-General were to put up an effective pleading against the claim of the plaintiffs and if he were not going to accept as admitted everything they said he would have to deny it and anything he did not deny would be admitted. If they were going before the court the duty of the Attorney-General would be to put them on proof and make them prove and substantiate what they claim, that is, that they are the body entitled to get these funds. In order that that would not go by default it was absolutely necessary for the Attorney-General to deny it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <P>What?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing whatever to do with the correctness or incorrectness of what the Attorney-General has done.  I believe that he is competent, that he knows his business and that he did it in the most effective legal way to put the plaintiffs on proof so that they would be required to substantiate their claim.  The Deputy wants to make it out <Col N="1670" /> that I would go into the court as a person with a thesis &mdash; that I would go into the court as a witness.  My duty would be not to maintain a thesis, not to act as defendant, but simply to give the facts as I hope I know them.  I have, however, the right to see that the views which I hold are in the public interest and that these views should be maintained.  It would be for the court to decide this question but I believe that the public interest demands that it be decided here and that is the whole purpose of the Bill.  Everybody knows that these funds were subscribed under a special set of circumstances here: that the organisation to which they were subscribed was split at least in two very soon after the time when, in view of the possible split, I was made trustee: that after that an effort had been made by me to reorganise the organisation and to try, if possible, to get it back to its previous position, to get the support of the Irish people for it: that at a later period there was another change of a substantial character in the organisation and that following that change the position so altered from what it was some 25 years ago that neither does the body that is claiming the funds now in my opinion represent the views of the people who subscribed nor is its position substantially the same.  It is because the position has completely changed that I say that the main body of the Irish people who subscribed these moneys could, if their names were on record, do the very thing that has been suggested by Deputy Costello &mdash; come in and make claims against these funds if they were not debarred by, let us say &mdash; I do not know enough, I will have to depend upon the Deputy to put me right &mdash; a statute of limitations, barring claims after that length of time.  I will answer Deputy Maguire by saying that I do not know that any debts which were due by the organisation at that time could be paid out of these moneys at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was an attempt made, on the same lines as the Erasmus Smith case that has been quoted here, to get agreement and if there was agreement I am not going to suggest that this Bill would be quite the same coming before the Dáil as it is in its present position.  Each one of us here can express <Col N="1671" /> his opinions and his view.  I am expressing mine and I am responsible only for the views I express.  I may be wrong.  My views are that if I were able to get agreement amongst all the parties, and say &ldquo;This is an agreed matter&rdquo;&mdash; I do not know whether in that event it would be necessary to come before the Dáil, but simply go to the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a lawyer but to my mind it is the common-sense view. I forget the circumstances now exactly which made the Erasmus Smith case a subject of legislation.  It probably was in order to provide that certain things which were in the agreement were effected.  I have not had time to look at it but I do know that one of the moving factors which brought about the agreement in the Erasmus Smith case was precisely to prevent the wasting of the funds lodged.  The case had gone on for a lengthy period.  All the parties concerned saw themselves faced with the prospect that they might continue their law proceedings and at the end the whole of the money would be spent in legal costs and nobody would have it at the end.  I think that a sum of £30,000 or £40,000 &mdash; I forget the figure &mdash; had been spent and they were wise enough to come in and cut their losses at that stage and try to get a settlement for the future.  I wish to goodness there was some prospect like that in this case; I would be very pleased with it.</P>
      <P>It was suggested, these moneys having lain in court over that long period of 23 years with no active claimant coming forward, that it was time to dispose of these moneys, now that the second treasurer had died, the second person who was responsible. The personal representative naturally wanted to be clear of any implications in regard to that trust as far as he was concerned.  Having despaired of any hope of agreement with any people who might feel they had a claim, I tried to get an agreement even on the method of disposal of these moneys by the body who were actively in control of them back in 1922 or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1672" /> Deputy Dillon, of course, tries to twist what I said.  I did not care for this particular method of using the funds.  I would have preferred, on a sort of <i>cy pres</i> doctrine, if you like, that they should be applied to some purpose that was common to the original organisation, to the reorganised organisation in my time, and to those who may regard themselves as belonging to that association or organisation to-day.  As I said, I did not see any hope whatever of getting that. But I was anxious that those who still survived of the executive at the time when the organisation was in its original form should agree upon the purpose to which the funds should be devoted.  This present method of disposal was suggested to these and, so far as I know, there was a disposition to agree.  In order to make the agreement as effective as possible, it was proposed or intended that there should be a meeting of that body, irrespective of the different views of various members, and that that meeting should, if possible, agree upon a scheme for the disposition of these funds, it being understood that the Dáil, by legislation, would cut the knot and make these funds available.</P>
    <P>That is the position as I see it.  I have no doubt in my own mind anyhow that, substantially, these are national funds and that to do substantial justice these funds had best be dealt with here by this Parliament.  Unfortunately, political tactics, in my opinion&mdash;I may be wrong &mdash; have suggested that this should be approached in quite a different way.  I cannot help that.  In a democracy you have to take the good with the bad; you have got to face this.</P>

Every opinion he gives here loses its value as given by a legal person because it is completely coloured by his political views.

      <P>That is a different thing.  We do not try deliberately but, as with other people, it may be found that our view of the law is not the Supreme Court's view.  That has happened <Col N="1674" /> and will happen no matter how able the legal advisers are and no matter how able the Government of the day are.  But the protection of the citizen is in the written Constitution which has to be interpreted, not here, but by the proper authority for interpreting it. Anybody who thinks that we are trying to pass here an unconstitutional measure, whether a Deputy or an affected party, has his remedy.  I asked some Deputy this evening who was talking about law, what was law.  I was rather anxious to know what his view was of law and what it means.  I have not had time to look up any authorities, but it seems to me that when we make laws we determine rights in one form or another; that the making of laws is the determination of rights and that when we pass any measure here we affect the rights of one section of the community as against another; that every Act &mdash; I will not say every Act, because it may happen that some particular Act does not, though I find it difficult to think of an example &mdash; but, normally, we do alter rights by means of our Acts in so far as we judge between the rights of one section of the community and another section, or I would say, even in the case of an individual, that we are acting broadly as a court of justice in regard to the rights of one section of the community as against another and that we do that with the ultimate purpose of the public good.  It is in that sense I said that in my belief we were a court of justice here and that we are determining rights.  We have to have regard to fundamental justice and equity as between those who are affected.</P>

      <P>I do not want to develop the Taoiseach's arguments on Section 12, but it struck me very forcibly that the arguments he made in support of the section were not adequate.  I respectfully suggest that the Taoiseach should reconsider the whole matter. It is quite plain that while he was speaking he was labouring, and labouring very heavily.  He was not quite happy, and I submit that he was making a case which he is not just in love with.  That is my view.</P>
      <P>It is true that trusts have been established in this country from time to time in the national interest and among these trusts the Sinn Féin funds trust was one of the most important. The trust the Taoiseach now proposes to establish is also a very important one, but I suggest he has taken a very peculiar line.  In this section &mdash; paragraph (b) &mdash; he indemnifies one member of the trust completely and he does nothing to indemnify the legal successors of the deceased trustee. By the vagueness of this section the Taoiseach has opened up a line in which the legal representatives of the late Eamonn Duggan can be sued, and there is a precedent for that in the income-tax code, under which, down to the sixth or tenth generation, people can be sued.  I do not see why the Taoiseach or his legal advisers, when they were framing this section, put only one person in.  I do not see why they did not indemnify all the trustees.</P>

      <P>I am not going to get into any acrimonious discussion on the matter, but I will put this point to the Taoiseach.  There is another fund in this country, of equal importance to the Sinn Féin funds, in which I have a right.  Will it mean that when I take the legal steps I am entitled to take as a citizen to get repayment of the money in that fund belonging to me, if I take that case into court the Government or the Parliamentary majority in this House can bring in a motion or a Bill to deny me my rights?  If they do, there is neither law nor equity.</P>
      <P>I am a free citizen of this country, having all the rights and privileges and responsibilities of a citizen, and I submit nobody can take them off me. But a Parliamentary majority over there claims the right to do it.  I say that they should not and that they should be very careful before they take any rights from citizens.  It is true they can do things for the good order and good government of this country, but once they infringe on my rights as a citizen there will have to be very grave reasons why they do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say the Taoiseach is making a very grave mistake.  I am not trying to play any political trick, nor do I intend to say one word more after this in regard to this matter.  I suggest the Taoiseach should very carefully reconsider this whole matter.  I have given him a hint that there is another fund of equal importance, with perhaps more money in it, and, if he establishes this precedent here, then he is interfering with my rights as a citizen <Col N="1677" /> and I will try to resist him to the best of my ability.</P>

      <P>It has its uses. I was only following humbly in the footsteps of the Taoiseach when I looked up the definition of that word in that dictionary.  It says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The body of rules, whether proceeding from formal enactment or from custom, which a particular State or community recognises as binding on its members or subjects.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the definition of &ldquo;law&rdquo;.  I said that a law must have universality or at least widespread application; that, I think, is inherent in that definition. The definition, let me repeat, sets out that &ldquo;law&rdquo; is &ldquo;The body of rules.... which a particular State or community recognises as binding on its members or subjects&rdquo;.  This is not binding on all cases; it is binding on a particular case, but it is establishing a bad precedent which may afterwards be used in all cases.</P>

      <P>It is a good thing, even at this late hour of the night, to get the Taoiseach's agreement as to the very clear distinction there is between what happened in the Erasmus Smith case and what happens here.  I was hoping that Deputy O'Connor might have remained in the House because he had made a statement earlier on this matter.  In any event, the Taoiseach has agreed that the Erasmus Smith legislation was a matter of consent. This is not.  I take it that we shall hear no more about any analogy in connection with the Erasmus Smith legislation after the Taoiseach has given a hint to his Deputy.</P>

There probably was a dissident part of Sinn Féin to which the Deputy belonged.  It might well have been that a good deal of money could have been saved, if the two branches of Sinn Féin, the dissident and those who remained at headquarters, came together and arrived at an agreement, but they did not and the courts are therefore asked to administer justice as between these two people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am relating my remarks to the Erasmus Smith case to which reference was made by the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach has rather lamented that we could not get an agreement of that type.  Let him have his lament but what emerges from the necessity for that lament is that we did not get agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the distinction between his case and the Erasmus Smith case.  That is clear.  The Taoieach has attempted to counter another point I have twice made with regard to the trust fund, that on the file there is a pleading by the Attorney-General, that the organisation known as Sinn Féin was defunct &mdash; I am not pretending that that is the exact word used but that is the effect of it &mdash; prior to the moneys being lodged in court.  The answer I have to that is that I know from the legal angle that one must deny anything made in a pleading, otherwise it is taken as admitted but they have done more than that here. What the plaintiffs have said in their statement of claim is that they were the inheritors of the old Sinn Féin Party.  The traverse that is required to that is merely: &ldquo;You were not&rdquo; but for some reason that I do not know the Attorney-General of the day went on to say: &ldquo;Sinn Féin died before 1924.&rdquo;  That is more than a denial. That is an averment which they will have to prove.  It is certainly carried beyond the ordinary denial.  That is why the applicants say that they have a very strong witness in the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hardly possible that the Taoiseach could go into court and give evidence of any value to the people who make that plea, that the organisation died before 1924, when dozens of people can come before the court carrying membership cards of Sinn Féin with a summons from the Taoiseach to a meeting in the spring of 1926 &mdash; the summons <Col N="1681" /> being signed by him as president of Sinn Féin.  Did that not happen? The Taoiseach knows it happened.  It would be an interesting situation to see the plaintiffs bringing the Taoiseach into court if it were only to meet that simple point.  Whatever it may have to do with the substance of the case, here is the point on the pleadings, a point which the plaintiffs had to meet: &ldquo;Sinn Féin died in 1924&rdquo;.  Then we shall have the Taoiseach summoned to the witness box and asked: &ldquo;What was the last day on which you operated as president?&rdquo;</P>

If there be raised as an entry on the pleadings the point that Sinn Féin died in 1924, then at least some opportunity should be given to the plaintiffs to take the Taoiseach into court to prove that he promulgated himself as head of Sinn Féin as late as spring 1926.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  The trusts have to do with the section and allied to the question of the trust is the question as to who are the survivors of the original representative of Sinn Féin.  The plaintiffs claim to be that.  The Attorney-General says that Sinn Féin ceased to be in existence in 1924 but there was one great man who <Col N="1682" /> paraded himself as head of the Sinn Féin organisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sure I am be-labouring the point but there are some back benchers who do not seem to undersand it and I want to make it clear that the plaintiffs would have a valuable light in the Taoiseach on that point.  It would be a matter of relevance to the court&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Have I mentioned the word &ldquo;fear&rdquo;?  I may be working up to it but I have not mentioned it yet.  Let the Taoiseach wince when he is really wounded but not in anticipation. Would it not be an interesting thing and a relevant thing if three or four dozen people came into court and each said: &ldquo;I attended a meeting of that organisation in the spring of 1926.  I was summoned there.  Here is my card.  I know the Taoiseach's handwriting, and that is it, and he is described there as President of Sinn Féin.&rdquo;  It may have nothing to do with the action, but it at least kills the point that the organisation was dead in 1924.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

      <P>That is another side of it.  All that these people are countering at the moment is the suggestion that the organisation to which they belonged, called Sinn Féin, was dead in 1924.  If the Taoiseach likes, he can go in and say: &ldquo;I really was hawking a bit of a corpse around the country and trying to breathe life into it, but that is the situation and let the court judge of it.&rdquo;  I would agree that the substantial matter, the gist of the action is: did Sinn Féin survive?  Are there any trusts discoverable?  Has the purpose for which these moneys were <Col N="1683" /> subscribed for Sinn Féin survived and if these people be the successors, are they the people properly entitled to discharge the trusts?  Surely that is the gist of the action.  Were there trusts to which these moneys were attached? If so, who is to distribute them and to what purpose?  Surely on any of these considerations the point will arise: do we know about the original trusts?  Do we know who originally got the moneys?  Is there a line of continuity? Are these people in the line of succession?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly no difference, except that it is a material point, according to the Attorney-General, because he makes the point and makes it beyond a traverse.  There in any event were the issues to be decided. Why could the courts not decide them? I want to know what is the reason for saying that the trusts attached, if any such trusts were attached, to these moneys, are to be discharged or deemed to be discharged?  What is there amazing about this case that makes us take this amazing attitude towards it?  The courts often decide trust matters.  They often have to decide whether people are the legitimate successors of old-time trustees and often have to decide whether it is possible to discharge the trusts attached to a particular fund, and they certainly could, on an application made to them in this connection, be asked to arrange a scheme, if the old purposes are no longer open.  Having arranged a scheme, they could be asked to administer the trust along the lines of the scheme, and, if they were asked to do that, we still keep inside this book which is so much thought of at times, the Constitution.  We are still having justice administered in courts and by judges made independent under the <Col N="1684" /> Constitution and asked to discharge their independent functions in accordance with the Constitution.  There is nothing hard about that.</P>
