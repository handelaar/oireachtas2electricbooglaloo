      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that tillage farmers and their workers in County Dublin, who travel to the city markets with vegetables, and who are on the road from early morning until late at night, were generally supplied with sandwiches in the various licensed houses along their routes; and if, in view of this, he is prepared to grant an allowance of bread to publicans to enable them to provide the people mentioned with at least a reduced supply of sandwiches.</P>

      <P>I am aware that certain licensed premises supplied sandwiches to customers.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether any action has been taken by harbour authorities or by his Department to implement the provisions of the Harbours Act, 1946, concerning the decasualisation of dock labour; and whether, in considering any scheme of decasualisation, he will propose that control of the scheme be not administered by existing port authorities, but that its administration be entrusted to a national joint body, drawn in equal numbers from the two sides of the port transport industry, to which should be added an independent element consisting of a chairman and two other members appointed by the responsible Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that any action has been taken by harbour authorities in this matter.  I have referred the question of decasualisation of Dublin dockers to the Labour Court, under Section 24 of the Industrial Relations Act.  I understand that a register of Dublin dockers has already been agreed to by employers and employees.  This part of the scheme is, therefore, outside the competence of the port authority.  I cannot say anything further on the second part of <Col N="352" /> the Deputy's question until I have received the recommendations of the Labour Court.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is in a position to give a list of the agricultural holdings in the country according to valuation; if he will take steps to see that such information will be included in the Statistical Abstract, 1946; and if he will give the reasons why such information has been omitted from the abstract since 1938.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest year for which the information referred to in the Deputy's question is available is 1937.  The figures were published in the 1938 Statistical Abstract and repeated in the issues for 1939 to 1942.</P>
      <P>The normal method of collection of agricultural statistics provides for the classification of agricultural holdings by size and it was not deemed necessary to depart from this method since the year 1937, as the normal method of collecting the returns by size groups has always been regarded as of the greater importance for consideration in relation to the production of crops and live stock.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is now in a position to state what provision has been made for the roadmen employed by the Dublin County Council whose services were dispensed with on reaching 70 years of age; and if they will be covered by the proposed Superannuation Bill for employees of local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the Deputy's questions on this subject to which I replied on 23rd October and 7th November, 1946, I have had this matter discussed on a number of occasions with the commissioners administering the affairs of the Dublin County Council. The matter has been very fully considered, but it has not been found possible to make any provision for those road workers of the council who <Col N="353" /> have reached 70 years of age and whose services were recently dispensed with, other than by offering employment to their sons where this has been practicable.</P>
      <P>As regards the latter part of the question, I would suggest that the Deputy wait until the text of the Local Government (Superannuation) Bill is available.  I propose to move the introduction of the Bill at a very early date.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that, some years ago, the county surveyor for Longford submitted plans to the Office of Public Works and to the Department of Local Government for the deepening, widening and dredging of the Rivers Camlin, Fallen and Ballyminion; that the surveyor's report described these rivers as being closed by sand banks, trees and slipped sides and incapable of receiving and carrying even surface water and also stated that they were a public menace; if he is now prepared to adopt these plans and have the work executed during the spring and early summer, especially having regard to the fact that there are sufficient men in the district to carry out these works which have a high labour content, would relieve unemployment, and alleviate the plight of the farmers in the area.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the consent of An Ceann Comhairle, to take questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that farmers in County Longford, in common with others throughout the country, have suffered losses as a result of the abnormal flooding which occurred last year.  I have not received any details of these losses, and, in any event, there are no funds at my disposal out of which compensation could be paid to the persons affected.</P>
      <P>The rivers mentioned by the Deputy are included in the Longford and Keenagh drainage districts which, under the provisions of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, the County Council of Longford is empowered to maintain. While the question of carrying out a comprehensive drainage scheme under that Act for the Longford catchment area, as a whole, will be considered in due course, I cannot say at this stage when the area is likely to be reached in the course of the drainage programme.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the facts?  When this case came before the court it was stated on behalf of the claimant &mdash; the youth who was dealt with in this reprehensible way &mdash; that he was compelled to sleep in a barn on planks laid on creels, that he had to sleep on a manure cart on which an old mattress was laid and in a shed in which manure was stored, that he contracted pneumonia living under those conditions, that the pneumonia was subsequently diagnosed as tuberculosis and that, as a result of the conditions under which he was compelled to sleep, he had to spend three years in a tuberculosis hospital in Manorhamilton?  Is the Minister aware that the trial judge, in giving a verdict for the claimant, asked whether there was no organisation to look after the interests of those boys and protect them when sent out into the world? Does the Minister realise that it is quite undesirable that boys from industrial schools should be farmed out in this way on wretched pittances, masquerading as wages, with no means of supervising them because, in the main, they are employed in areas where it is not easy to supervise them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The report of the Dublin Cattle Market supplied by the Department of Agriculture is given in full in the second news bulletin at 6.30 p.m. on Wednesday.  The report is almost invariably broadcast again in the last bulletin but it has sometimes to be given in a condensed form.  There is great pressure on the news time available for the latter bulletin, particularly when there is general news of importance as well as proceedings of the Oireachtas to report.  In these conditions almost all items have to be given in a very summarised form.  I think the Dublin Cattle Market is reasonably well catered for under existing arrangements.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Before fixing the price of wheat for the 1947 crop full consideration was given to all the relevant factors and it was considered that a price of 55/- per barrel for wheat of the highest grade was fair and reasonable. In the circumstances, it is not intended to increase the price already fixed.</P>

      <P>Of course, a subsidy of this nature must come to an end at some time, and surely the Deputy will realise that the availability of artificial manures and the price at which they are available must have a bearing upon whether or not it would be justifiable to pay such a subsidy?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not denying the importance of making the growing of wheat in the present circumstances attractive, but this subsidy was provided by the Government at a time when artificial manures were scarce and very costly and surely it is not unreasonable to say that, in the changing circumstances, with more artificial manures available at a different rate, since the subsidy must be brought to an end, as a subsidy given for that purpose, that it is in these circumstances that it should come to an end?</P>

      <P>It does not appear that there is any appreciable decline in the quantity of milk available for Dublin from the normal sources of supply, but the supplies available from creameries not registered under the Dublin District <Col N="372" /> Milk Board are rather less than normal, due to the unprecedented long spell of unfavourable weather.  The present shortage is estimated at approximately 3,000 gallons per day, representing 6½ per cent. of requirements, and is mainly due to the fact that consumption has substantially increased of recent months.  Save in the months of January and February when production is at its lowest, supplies are more than adequate.  As much milk as possible is being purchased for the district by the milk board.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) (i), page 4, to insert the following new paragraph&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="377" />&ldquo;an auction of fresh fruit, vegetables and flowers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Minister omitted to include in this section people who sell fruit, vegetables and flowers because I think they come more or less into the same category as people who sell fish.  Most of them sell comparatively small quantities of these products and the value of the amount sold would in no case exceed £2,000. Their receipts would in no way fall within the £2,000 deposits contemplated in the Bill or the value of the property which they handle on different occasions would in no case reach that figure. I suggest to the Minister that in view of the fact that a number of these people actually sell their own produce in the Dublin fruit and vegetable market or sell for farmers who regularly supply them, they should be excluded from the operations of the Bill.  Because of the system which has been adopted, it has been found convenient over a number of years for farmers to trade with particular individuals for comparatively limited amounts.  I think, therefore, the Minister should accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference between these people and those who sell fish.  The Minister for Agriculture intends to bring in legislation dealing with the sale of fish and that is why fish is not dealt with in this Bill.  The whole idea of the Bill is to protect the general public and to ensure that people who get money from the general public will have something to cover that money in case of default.  I am informed that they sometimes hold quite a considerable amount of money. There is some reason for including these people in this Bill and I do not see that I could accept the amendment. The sale of fish would have been included except for the fact that the Minister for Agriculture intends to deal with the sale of fish in a separate Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2) (c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (c) excludes from the operations of the Bill certain classes or types.  One of the weaknesses of the measure I think is that quite a number of classes are excluded from the obligations of this Bill.  I freely admit that a number of the exclusions are necessary and I do not think that any reasonable person would insist that they should be included and brought within the full scope of the Bill.  On the other hand I am sure the Minister and the House are anxious to see as far as possible that the main object of the Bill is not defeated by excluding from its operations certain people and by allowing them to operate without either a licence or a deposit.  Sub-section (2) (c) says that a person who acts as agent for the owner or lessee of a house in the collection of rent and the general superintendence and management of the house and who, as an incident thereto, acts as the agent of such owner or lessee in the sale or letting of the house, shall not be obliged to take out a licence.  I think the sub-section as it stands is open to grave abuse and I think it can be abused.  I do not think it is any great load on any estate manager or estate agent, if the needs of the estate warrant it, to oblige him to take out a licence and to make the necessary deposit.  A person excluded under (c) from the operations of the Bill might be dealing with and handling far larger sums of money than many auctioneers or house-agents who will be obliged to comply with the terms of the Bill.  That is one end of the scale.  The other end of the scale is that a person need merely collect rent for a couple of weeks to enable him to act in either the letting or sale of a house or houses, in the case of a particular estate.  I ask the Minister to agree to the deletion of this section and I ask the House to support my amendment for that purpose.  Far from weakening the Bill in any way or weakening the purpose he has in mind, <Col N="379" /> the Minister will strengthen it by this deletion.  I believe that allowing it to remain in the Bill will leave it open to certain abuses which he is trying to stamp out.</P>

I understand that a valuer is occasionally engaged by local authorities and other public bodies to value land which is to be acquired and is sometimes asked to negotiate the purchase of land.

I am objecting only to opening it so wide.  I have no objection to giving these powers to a Minister of State or to a Department or branch of a Department which can be made answerable in the House, where we will have some hold on them, but to give it to a person whom we might not be able to call to account is another matter.

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2) (a), line 33, to delete all words after the word &ldquo;applicant&rdquo; down to the word &ldquo;application&rdquo; in line 35.</P>
      <P>This is a principle which I think the Minister might consider as to whether an applicant should have to go to court each year or not.  If the amendment were accepted in principle, it would mean that, when an auctioneer gets his first licence, he could continue in practice until something else happens under another part of the Act.  It is most unfair and unjust that he should have to go to court each year.  It involves advertisements in the Press and representation by a solicitor, and no other section of the community is forced to go to court each year for the purpose of getting a licence.  If a man has a licence, he should be allowed to continued to be licensed.  He will not get a renewal of that licence each year unless he has a deposit in court, and the fact that he has a deposit in court should be sufficient evidence that nothing has happened in the previous year which would necessitate his making another application.  As it is, he must go up each year for renewal of his licence, but I can see nothing in the Bill to compel the district justice to examine an applicant's accounts. The district justice can know nothing about him or his business unless he has done something wrong the previous year, and one licence should be sufficient, seeing that he is covered for the future by a bond.</P>

      <P>If that is not the objection I do not see what the objection is.  While it undoubtedly means trouble and expense, apart from anything else, I personally should like to see it left in the Bill, for the reason that the intention of the Bill is mainly to direct the light on certain people who are operating, or trying to operate, in this country.  The fact that these people know that they have publicly to appear in court every year to get a renewal of their licences and know also that any citizen, by merely giving seven days' notice of his intention so to do, can appear in court and object, may make many people who are perhaps not too careful at the moment a lot more careful.  I know that there are objections to doing that every year, but, on the whole, I should prefer to see the section left in the Bill.  Speaking for myself from what knowledge I have and from the point of view of what the Bill is attempting to do, I think that to take this out would be to weaken, rather than to strengthen, the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey has spoken with authority from the point of view of his own profession.  I should like to support the point of view he puts forward, from the point of view of the public.  This requirement of annual application coupled with the necessary formalities is a great safeguard for the public interest and for those private individuals who have to employ auctioneers from time to time.  It is not correct for Deputy Allen to say that auctioneers would be the only section of the community who would have to make this yearly application.  My recollection is that bookmakers, publicans, moneylenders, pawnbrokers, owners of dance halls, owners of places where music and dancing are carried on and quite a number of other sections of the <Col N="383" /> community have to make it.  I do think that all the requirements of a cognate character in respect of those particular classes of the people are designed for the protection of the public and that the public protection does require the section as it stands at the moment.</P>

      <P>No, it is not.  It was certainly not a farce in connection with moneylenders' licences in the last few years.  Certain moneylenders found themselves opposed and evidence was brought showing that they were in a subterranean fashion contravening the provisions of the Bill and great public good was done by objecting to their licence.  If there were anything of that kind&mdash;I do not anticipate there would be&mdash;the provisions of the section would be a public safeguard.  This would give an opportunity to the Guards, who can get information from any individuals concerned and who can make the objection, and it is only when there is an objection that the section operates, but the very fact that there is an objection will act as a very potent safeguard.</P>

There is nothing to prevent anyone from being an auctioneer provided he is honest.  I take it that the purpose of this Bill is to ensure that auctioneers will meet their obligations and liabilities.  That is the only meaning of all these sections.  That is the idea of the Minister in operating this section.

I <Col N="386" /> have seen more than one example of that and perhaps it is the most effective machine that could be devised, far more effective and more practicable, perhaps, than the court itself, from the point of view of the public.  My only regret is that we could not get something similar from the Minister in relation to this Bill.  There is no use in talking about that now.  Deputy Allen quite rightly talks about the protection of the public.  He seems to imply that unless the deposit is touched in the course of the year we must assume that the auctioneer and everything he did was above board.  It does not follow at all.</P>

      <P>I could give the Deputy, not one example, but dozens of examples of what is happening in this city in the case of so-called auctioneers and house agents every day in the week, to the detriment of the public and which could not be brought into court and in respect of which they could be nailed on their deposit.  It is to provide against some of that kind of thing that is going on and that has gone on, and some of which has found its way into the courts, that this Bill is before the House at the moment.  I or any member of the Auctioneers' Association am no more anxious than Deputy Allen is to have to go to the trouble and expense of going into court every year and applying for a licence, and running the risk of forgetting all about it.  However, does the Deputy not agree with me that one of the most effective safeguards in the Bill is the fact that any person who feels he has been victimised or treated unfairly or that an auctioneer has done something wrong, has a right to lodge a complaint and substantiate it with the Garda Síochána in the district, or that he himself can go into court and object before the district justice and give a reason for it?  Then the district justice has discretion, judging the weight of evidence on the application, either from a private individual or from a member of the Garda Síochána, to renew or refuse to renew the licence.  On the other hand, if a person who is practising as a house agent or an auctioneer <Col N="387" /> reels there is no need to apply for a renewal, it is possible that he may not be so careful or so scrupulous.</P>

      <P>In this case, the Opposition is on my side, and with very good reason, too.  This is a most important provision.  As Deputy Morrissey very clearly pointed out, a person who might be inclined to be careless will have to be more careful.  The vast bulk of the auctioneers will find this provision only a matter of form and for them it would not be necessary at all.  This is to cover those who may not be all right and who may be a bit shaky.  They are the people we want to make sure of. Therefore, this provision, with that in the next amendment, is necessary.  As Deputy Costellor told Deputy Allen, there are several other classes of citizens who have to go annually to renew their licences in the same way as is proposed in this Bill.</P>

      <P>That point also occurred to us and the Minister has met it by bringing in an amendment, that the person objecting must give at least seven days' clear notice to the court and to the applicant.  As the Bill stood before that, there was no necessity to give any notice.  A person could simply walk into court on the morning of the application and make an objection there and then, without the applicant having had prior notice.  That is covered now in amendment No. 11.</P>

      <Col N="389" /> (f)  If the applicant has not been permanently resident in Ireland for a period of five years prior to the date of the application.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to prevent auctioneers coming in from outside the country, particularly Great Britain, and setting up as auctioneers here.  There is no national or residential qualification in the Bill.  In other professions, an apprenticeship is necessary and if that were so for an auctioneer I would not be proposing this amendment.  I suggest to the Minister that it is undesirable to leave it open to any auctioneer from England, who thinks it might be good business, to come over here and apply for a licence and start right away.  We ought to keep to our auctioneers the right that only people residing here for five years may start up in opposition to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is a good case for that.  There might be reciprocal treatment of our nationals going to England.  A person setting up as an auctioneer now has to get a certificate from the court.  If we introduced the qualification proposed now, it might have repercussions and there might be restrictions on doctors and engineers.  If we were to allow people to come in and start without giving an account of themselves, it would be a different matter, but as it is they must go to the court and get a certificate, so there is a safeguard.</P>

      <P>While I can see some force in the Minister's objection, I think there is a very good case to be made for the amendment or something like it.  The Minister is probably aware of what has been happening, even in the last couple of years.  To some extent, the Bill has stopped some <Col N="390" /> of the type of business for which those people were brought across here. There are some things happening that one knows about but cannot prove and that one does not like to talk about in public.  There is room for a tightening in many directions that may not be possible, even when this Bill becomes law.  If the Minister cannot accept Deputy O'Connor's amendment in its present form, he might look into the matter between now and the Final Stage to see if he can get some form of words which will safeguard the position, at least to some extent.</P>

      <P>On the section, the reasons for disqualification are not made mandatory.  The section says that &ldquo;an application may be refused on any of the following grounds&rdquo;.  I suggest that the provisions should be made more mandatory than that.  As the section is, it would be open to the district justice to give a certificate, if he thought fit, to a person under 21 years or to a bankrupt or an arranging <Col N="391" /> debtor.  I think that that is leaving too much to the discretion of the district justice and that the provision should be made mandatory.</P>

A similar position might arise in the case of arbitration proceedings.  When the Minister mentioned that the President of the High Court had suggested the change, I hesitated to speak lest it should warrant any inference that the suggestion of the learned President was not correct.  Before the Minister had mentioned the President of the High Court, I had intended to direct his attention to the position which would arise under the amendment.

      <P>On the section, I should like to direct the Minister's attention to a matter which I have been asked to mention.  It arises on the paragraph which we have been discussing&mdash;paragraph (d) (ii).  The deposit required can be made either in cash or by means of a bond guaranteed by an insurance company.  It has been suggested that the paragraph as drafted is so wide that an insurance company would hesitate to give a bond.  Auctioneers who had not the actual cash available might, in that way, be placed in a difficulty. According to this paragraph, the insurance company will have to guarantee</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the due performance by the depositor of the obligations incurred by him as a licensed auctioneer or licensed house agent in relation to the receipt and payment of money and the safe custody of property.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The words &ldquo;safe custody of property&rdquo; appear to those who asked me to mention the matter so wide that they would hesitate to give a bond for that amount. I ask the Minister to ascertain if the words &ldquo;safe custody of property&rdquo; are necessary or whether some other form of words could not be introduced.  I do not know whether or not these words are used in relation to the purposes for which the £2,000 is to be guaranteed.  I can see the point of the matter.  Auctioneers are entrusted with moneys from time to time and it is essential that there should be some security to the owners of those moneys that they be forthcoming or that the deposit be available to meet them.  At the same time, the words &ldquo;safe custody of property&rdquo; may be too wide. The view of the people who asked me to mention it is that representative insurance companies are afraid of the <Col N="393" /> words.  Perhaps the Minister will have the matter examined.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4) (a) Judgments, orders and decrees mentioned in sub-section (1) of this section shall be a first and paramount charge against the deposit and shall, notwithstanding anything contained in any other enactment, be payable out of the deposit in priority to any other claim against the defendant.</P>
      <P>(b)  All such judgments, orders or decrees shall rank in equal priority and shall abate rateably in the event of the deposit not being sufficient to satisfy them in full.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to make it quite definite that the deposit shall be available, in the first instance, to any people who have claims against the auctioneer arising out of anything done in the course of his business.  In Section 14 the only thing laid down in connection with the deposit was that it should be under the control of the High Court.  If the Bill were allowed to remain in its present form, it is possible&mdash;I am not quite sure about it &mdash;that other debts might be payable out of the deposit and that there would be the same rule of law in regard to priorities as there is in regard to insolvent estates.  If I am right in that view, claims for such things as arrears of income-tax would be payable out of the deposit in priority to a claim by a person dealing with the auctioneer in his business. The same thing would apply in the case of claims for rates.  The amendment I suggest may not be in the best form. I did not spend much time over it, but I think that some such provision should be inserted so as to make definite the rights of the different people who might be making claims against those deposits.</P>

There is some substance in what Deputy O'Connor has said and I do not think that it should be left to the court to interpret the section.  The matter having been brought to the attention of the Minister, he should take a decision one way or the other.</P>

It was never meant that this deposit of £2,000 should become available to meet ordinary debts.  I do not think that was ever the Minister's intention or the intention of anybody else.</P>

      <P>This power of arrest in the section is taken word for word from an Act that was passed in 1845. We have made a lot of progress since then.  The offence set out in the 1845 Act was a revenue offence.  The object was to collect revenue for the Crown. There is no such provision as this in any of our recent legislation.  Suppose, for example, the driver of a motor car or a hawker fails to produce his licence, he is not liable to any penalty such as that laid down here.  I do not think there is any need for this provision. We know, of course, that 102 years ago the revenue authorities of that time were very careful about the King's revenues, and that very big offences against the revenue were punishable by death.  We have progressed a lot since then.  There is no necessity for this provision, and I think it should be sufficient, as I am providing in my amendment, if the licence is produced within seven days.</P>

    <Title>In Committee on Finance. - Customs-Free Airport Bill, 1947&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  An explanatory memorandum has been circulated already to Deputies in which the main provisions of the Bill are explained.</P>
      <P>The Bill marks a further stage in the development of Shannon Airport into what we hope will be one of the best and most up-to-date airports in the world.  As Deputies are aware, it is intended to provide at Shannon all the facilities which the International Civil Aviation Organisation considers necessary at a main transatlantic airport. The expenditure involved represents a substantial commitment for a country of our population and size, and our willingness to undertake it shows that we recognise that the country's geographical position imposes on it a special responsibility in providing facilities of the high order required for a transatlantic service.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a free airport at the Shannon is a logical development of the aviation policy that has been followed since the decision was taken ten years ago to build an airport there.  The runways being laid down will take the largest aircraft in commercial operation and the terminal building to be erected and other facilities to be provided will be worthy of Europe's main transatlantic airport.</P>
      <P>By this Bill we are making the Shannon Airport the first free airport in the world.  The customs-free airport is, in a sense, an Irish invention and for that reason I should, perhaps, say something on how the idea originated.  Air travellers have always found the delays imposed by customs and other formalities much more vexatious than travellers proceeding by sea or by rail.  Air travel is much faster than surface travel and the delay involved in clearing customs, currency and passport requirements may represent a big proportion of the time taken on an air trip, whereas it is a relatively insignificant part of a sea journey that may take many days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At an airport like the Shannon, where most of the traffic in passengers and goods is transit traffic, there is a strong case for cutting down to the <Col N="401" /> minimum the time taken by these formalities.  The Government are in full sympathy with the air companies and others interested in civil aviation when they urge that a relaxation of customs, passport and other restrictions imposed upon international travellers is essential in developing the full potentialities of air transport.  The Government have, therefore, been concerned to ensure the most favourable conditions in that respect at Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>Under the Paris Convention, which has governed the international relations of some 33 countries, including this country, in the sphere of civil aviation for the past 25 years, there was no provision for the setting up of customs-free airports.  In 1944 a new convention was drawn up at Chicago to replace the Paris Convention.  We availed of the opportunity to secure international recognition in principle for the establishment of customs-free airports.  Our representatives took the initiative in laying down requirements for customs-free airports at a number of meetings of the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organisation at Montreal where a special division was set up to consider measures for the facilitation of international air services. Having secured international agreement on the concept and requirements of a customs-free airport, we proceeded to prepare plans for Shannon.  This Bill is designed to translate these plans into action.  The Bill provides that goods and passengers in transit through Shannon airport will not be subject to customs examination.  Passengers landing at Shannon eastward to Europe or westward to America will not have to present their baggage for customs inspection.  Goods brought by plane to Shannon will be free from all customs restrictions so long as they remain within the boundary of the free airport. There will be no customs officials within the free airport and compliance with any customs regulations that may still remain in force will be secured not by officers of customs and excise but by officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Besides the customs regulations applied at customs airports in common <Col N="402" /> with sea ports and land frontiers, the staff of the Revenue Commissioners enforce other restrictions such as those designed to safeguard the public health and to prevent the spread of animal and plant diseases.  In addition there are certain articles the importation of which is prohibited in pursuance of international conventions to which this State has adhered.  There is provision in the Bill for the making of regulations reimposing these safeguards and prohibitions at the free airport and for continuing the present currency control so long as it may be necessary. The regulations required will be made in consultation with the other Ministers concerned and compliance with the regulations will be enforced by officers to be appointed for that purpose.</P>
    <P>It is recognised, however, that the establishment of the free airport while conferring great benefits on air travellers and on those sending goods by air, also offers temptations to persons seeking to defraud the revenue.  Accordingly, powers of search are provided.  One of the chief difficulties experienced in drafting the Bill related to local traffic passing through the airport and to visitors at the airport.  We did not want to impose customs examination on sightseers or on people travelling by air from Shannon to Collinstown.  The problem has been met by setting aside as a customs area a portion of the terminal building and part of the landing field adjacent to it.  Persons travelling by air from Dublin to Shannon will disembark in that area and will not have to undergo customs examination unless they wish to enter the airport to join an aircraft for a foreign destination.  Visitors coming to the airport as sightseers or to meet their friends arriving by air will be allowed into the customs area, without examination.  The accommodation in the customs area will include a lounge, a restaurant and an open space in which the operations can be seen.  In order to prevent abuses it will be necessary to segregate transit passengers from disembarking passengers and from local visitors.  The confining of visitors and disembarking passengers to the customs area will achieve that purpose. <Col N="403" /> It will be possible to make special arrangements for persons who have particular business in the free port area to pass from one section to another.</P>
    <P>Passengers or goods entering or leaving Ireland via Shannon will pass through the customs as at present. As goods may be brought free of duty into the customs-free airport from abroad and stored there, it is thought it may be of advantage to the United States and other commercial interests to set up depots at the airport from which delivery may be made by air, to meet urgent orders from any of the many parts of Europe and North America which have direct air communication with Shannon.  It is also hoped that some manufacturers may find it desirable to undertake within the free airport the packing, processing and rehandling of goods.  Developments on these lines will be welcomed and every reasonable facility will be given to exporters and manufacturers who desire accommodation there. Already, even before the establishment of the free airport, a fair amount of freight is passing through Shannon. Some of the cargoes despatched from there have a very particular interest for this country.  Deputies will remember, for example, the racehorses which were shipped to the United States and the shipment of greyhounds to France.  It is difficult at present to assess the prospects for the carriage of freight by air, but there certainly are possibilities.  It will be clear that we are anxious to encourage this development.  Shannon, as I have said, is equipped to take the largest aircraft at present engaged in freight services.  The developments contemplated will ensure that it will continue to be able to cater for all types of cargo aircraft that may be employed for many years to come.</P>
    <P>As there is no similar legislation in existence here or elsewhere, some provisions of the Bill may have to be amended in the light of experience. Quite a few problems have arisen in drafting the Bill but it has been possible to surmount them because of the co-operative spirit in which they were <Col N="404" /> approached by all concerned.  In that connection, I might mention that the Revenue Commissioners have taken a large part in the study, by the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organisation, of the general question of facilitating international services, as well as in drawing up plans for our free airport.  I have no doubt that the same co-operative spirit will enable us to overcome the difficulties that will arise in putting into effect the provisions of the Bill.  I should say that all the air lines operating through Shannon have been most helpful in working out a satisfactory scheme and we can, I think, count on their continued collaboration. I am confident that if the Bill is passed, we shall be able to show the way in relieving air traffic passing through Shannon airport of some of the restrictions which air travellers all over the world are united in deploring.</P>

      <P>We are glad to know that it is possible to make arrangements to make it easier for travellers passing through this country to land here and to get away with as little inconvenience and trouble as possible, and we welcome a movement in that direction and hope it will extend. I should like to hear from the Minister approximately what area it is contemplated will be assigned for this airport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Bill says that only lands which are State lands will be used as the customs-free airport at present.  I should like to know approximately what the extent of the customs-free airport will be and approximately what is the area of State lands which would be available, if it were necessary to extend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister indicates that a certain amount of business will be transacted, either for purposes of storage, as an <i>entrepôt</i> trade, or for purposes of processing. That suggests that buildings of various kinds will have to be set up there, either by the Government or by bodies to whom the Government would <Col N="405" /> lease land, and I should like to know whether it is the general idea that the persons who require buildings there would erect them and, if that is so, whether, in leasing lands to them, the leases would be subject to the State Lands Act.</P>
    <P>As regards the developing of any processing business there, could the Minister give us any idea of what kind of processing he has in mind?  Is it contemplated that a motor car assembly business, a machinery assembly business, or a furniture assembly business of one kind or another might be started there?  What exactly is it contemplated might happen in the first year or two in regard to the development of processing there and are there any particular commodities in respect of which he knows that an <i>entrepôt</i> trade will start there straightway?  It would be interesting to have any information the Minister has on that point.</P>
    <P>With regard to access, will access by the various airlines to the customs-free airport be governed by any particular international agreements or by any general inter-nation agreements, or will access be open to any airlines at all?  There is so much talk about the strategic aspect of the world in relation to the new outlook on war that we should like to hear if the Minister has contemplated how the use of the free airport would be affected by a war situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I personally am very glad to see this Bill.  A customs-free airport can be very valuable to this country.  I notice that, in the explanatory memorandum, it is stated that the free port cannot be exempt from currency restrictions, and I should like the Minister to enlarge on that and explain it for us.  I can see that, as well as being of considerable benefit to the country, a customs-free airport &mdash;the same, I presume, as a customs-free port&mdash;would require to be extremely well managed.  The whole scheme would require to work very smoothly and very efficiently from the legal aspect and the physical aspect. Otherwise, we might be bringing something <Col N="406" /> into the country which might, in the long run, prove a source, perhaps, of corruption to some of our citizens. In other words, there might be great opportunities for smuggling in and smuggling out, and unless the whole running of that free airport were thought out in the very best fashion, we might find that we had created something here which would provide opportunities to certain international or perhaps national smugglers who wish to evade laws.  I daresay the Minister has considered that, and I personally wholeheartedly welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, Shannon Airport comprises approximately 800 acres.  Provision is made in the Bill for the extension of the area of the free airport, should it become necessary, and should additional land be required for the purpose.  The actual area of the free airport would include the whole of the present airport, minus the part which will be set aside for the customs airport, a small area adjacent to the terminal building, through which local traffic and disembarking passengers will pass. Persons requiring buildings for any industrial process within the airport area may either erect them themselves or lease them from the State, as circumstances may dictate.  Any land leased will, of course, be subject to the general provisions from time to time enforced in legislation concerning the leasing of State lands.  The only development, so far, has been the establishment of a repair and overhaul depôt by an aircraft company, and in that case the buildings are being erected by the Department and are being leased to the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is impossible to forecast with any confidence the type of business that may develop as a result of the establishment of the free airport.  I should think it unlikely that the assembling of motor cars or machinery, or commodities of that kind will be attracted to Shannon Airport, because clearly it is only commodities which gain in value by rapid transportation which will be concerned with air transport for some <Col N="407" /> considerable time to come.  Probably any business that may develop in the immediate future will rather take the form of the storage of goods for distribution to markets as required.  A transit shed is being erected at the airport by the Department to facilitate that type of traffic.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy's question concerning the use of the airport by any airline raises the whole question of the regulation of international air traffic. At present international air traffic is regulated by bilateral agreements between countries which desire to facilitate the development of air services between their respective territories. We have made a number of these bilateral agreements, as the Deputy is aware, and others are being negotiated.  By these agreements we give to the airlines of other countries the right of commercial entry and the various freedoms of the air, as they are called, in return for the concession to our air companies of similar rights in other territories.  It may be that at some stage there will be a multilateral agreement giving some or all of the freedoms of the air generally and without any bilateral bargaining but, as the Deputy will remember, the movement in that direction which began in Chicago was not successful and such development as has taken place in the meantime has been facilitated by bilateral agreement. Consequently, no airline would have the right to use Shannon Airport for traffic purposes unless given under Governmental agreement negotiated for that specific purpose.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the danger of undesirable goods being smuggled into the State is greatly increased by the establishment of a customs-free airport at Shannon.  I cannot see that the Revenue Commissioners will have any greater difficulty in guarding against that danger at Shannon than they have as present at the land frontier or at most of the sea ports.  I think in fact the limited area of the airport and the presence of Government officials within the airport, who will have certain functions to which I have referred, will make the risk of Shannon less than <Col N="408" /> at other frontier stations.  It will be necessary, of course, to extend to the airport a number of the regulations in force.  We are aiming to make the airport as free of formality as possible but, clearly, the restriction on the importation of animals or plants which might bring disease here cannot be safeguarded without there being specific regulations in force at the airport and there are, as I have mentioned, international conventions, relating to certain undesirable traffic, to which we are parties and which we must enforce and which will continue to be enforced at the airport by officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It is not possible to release air travel from all restriction but the aim of the Bill is to release it from the restrictions which have proved most irksome and which are unnecessary from the point of view of the protection of our own interests.</P>

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,450 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the <Col N="410" /> year ending 31st March, 1947, for Compensation and other Payments in respect of Personal Injuries sustained by persons, not as members of State Services, as a result of the dropping of bombs by foreign aircraft and of kindred incidents while the State is not engaged in war (No. 19 of 1946).</P>
    <P>A Supplementary Estimate was taken last year to enable compensation for personal injuries, recovered from the German Government, in respect of the Campile bombing on the 26th August, 1940, to be distributed amongst the individual claimants.  In each of three of the cases, two persons were interested in the distribution and in these cases it was necessary to get their formal proposals as to basis of the division between them.  Owing to delays by the claimants in formulating their proposals and having the necessary legal agreements executed, the Paymaster-General's Office was unable to issue the awards until after the close of the financial year 1945-46. The current year's Vote could not bear fully the additional expenditure thus thrown on it and recourse was had to the Contingency Fund to meet the payments in the first instance.  A Supplementary Estimate for £1,450 is necessary to complete the repayment to the Contingency Fund.</P>

Can the Minister give us any information as to the value of the property owned by either the Axis Government or citizens of the Axis countries in Ireland and into whose possession those properties or moneys passed?  Was any part of them transferred to our Government here for the purpose of meeting any of the damage done as a result of bombs dropped by any of the Axis countries?</P>

I think it was stated here on many occasions that <Col N="411" /> certain sums due by our nationals to Germany were collected and used for the purpose of compensation and for other Exchequer purposes.  If the Deputy puts down a specific Parliamentary Question, I can give him the answer, or if he likes I will communicate with him by letter.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the work of Compántas Amharclainne na Gaeilge, I would like to ask the Minister whether it is intended that that would be confined entirely to Dublin or whether there is any proposal that the compántas or part of it would bring some of their performances to any other part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the additional grant to the Cumann Béal Oidis and I think that it shows that there is increased appreciation of that work on the part of the Government.  However, I do <Col N="413" /> not think that work of the Irish Folklore Society is sufficiently appreciated, or that its enormous importance is realised.  This grant was given originally by the Government in 1935 and it is only as the work accumulated and developed that its real importance became disclosed.  The additional grant now proposed is not at all sufficient to meet the work to be done. There is something like 11 persons in all being paid out of the total grant. Some of these are at headquarters and others are at various points throughout the country.  I know of only three collectors&mdash;one in Donegal, one in West Kerry and another in South Kerry.  They are doing the most extraordinary work under the most extraordinary difficulties.  When they started they were paid £150 a year and expected to keep themselves on that&mdash; and their families, too, if they had them&mdash;and pay for their travelling as well.  They took their notebooks or carried an ediphone around on a bicycle or some other means of transport. They went to the old people in the Irish-speaking districts and recorded the stories and the traditions of the localities.  No one not in touch with the districts can understand what that means, or the enormous amount of work done by the paid collectors and by the individual assistants helping them throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Between descriptions of local life and the traditions carried down so faithfully by the old Irish speakers, so much material has been collected that the cream of it alone would, if published, take about 300 volumes.  I have seen something like 90,000 index notes, which represented only 5 per cent. of the collection which has been made. The Minister says that part of this additional grant is to go to increase the pay of the present collectors and that part is to be applied to the employment of additional collectors in other districts.  When one considers the enormous amount of work done and that, from Donegal town and Teelin down to Castlegregory, on the whole of the coast, including County Galway, not a single paid collector is working, one can see how much remains to be done.  We should all be grateful if the <Col N="414" /> Minister, when putting his main Estimate before the Dáil, would give us a summarised appreciation of the work being done by the society and of the work which remains to be done. Because it is called the Irish Folklore Commission and because part of its work is the collection of old stories, there seems to be an impression that its work is concerned only with the collection of highly imaginative folk tales, with a certain amount of linguistic curiosities.  These tales are being collected, it is true, but they are the transmitted, oral literature of a people who have been speaking this language for 2,000 years and who have been speaking a language which has been the language of Irish written literature from its inception.  In itself, it has remarkable qualities as a language, while the stories have remarkable qualities as literature.  It carries on the mentality of a people who were one of the original civilisations of the world.  As well as that, the whole character and life of our people are expressed in reminiscences, stories of the land and sea and stories of how the people got their living.  The thought and philosophy of the people are enshrined in the stuff which is being taken down by the collectors.</P>
    <P>We pay great homage to our Irish architecture and literature but here is being collected the living spark that can light up our history, conveyed in our written literature and in whatever comes to us from our study of architecture and archaeology.  The people who were doing this work used to be paid £150 a year.  Then they got £100 to run a car but they had to buy and keep the car themselves.  I think that there are three of them working who are now in receipt of £280 a year. What are they doing?  They are living and moving amongst the Irish-speaking people and collecting from them their stories, reminiscences and local traditions.  It is a remarkable thing that all that matter which has been dictated by Irish-speaking people has not cost a single 1d. in narration. You have cases of a collector who goes to a man, as I have known in one case, and occupied his time for a couple of days in taking down on the ediphone more than 20 stories dealing with the <Col N="415" /> traditions of the place.  That collector was not paid sufficient to enable him to stand the old man a drink on the next occasion he would meet him or to offer him a bit of tobacco when he went into his house.  These collectors are dealing with tremendously hospitable people and they are so badly paid that, when they have collected the material in a particular district, they are almost ashamed to meet those from whom they have collected it at a fair or patron because they have not the wherewithal to stand them a drink or offer them refreshment or engage in any of those social courtesies that mean so much, particularly to a generous and hospitable people.  I should like the Minister to tell us that those collectors, who are working in the front trench, will get sufficient to enable them to maintain themselves and to meet other expenses&mdash;if they are to get an allowance for expenses under the new arrangement.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicates that some work is to be done in Scotland.  I understand that links have been developing between the Folklore Commission here and the comparable body in Sweden and between the commission and some of the remnants of our Irish-speaking race in the States and Newfoundland. I understand that the Swedes are to send a man here, probably to University College, to follow up some of the work being done here. I think that a number of our people from the Folklore Commission visited Sweden and established close contacts with those who are doing that type of work there.  They are very far advanced in the doing of that work.  It would individualise people too much if I were to mention the academic qualifications of people who are working for even less than £280 a year.  But I think the Minister would have appreciation of what is being done and of the kind of people who are doing the work, if I were to do so.  He should have appreciation, too, of the extraordinarily generous spirit of the people who have this material and who are surrendering it free.  I think that those who are collecting the material should be put in a position in which they would not be ashamed to meet those <Col N="416" /> from whom they are collecting.  There are, I think, about 450 collectors throughout the country who are doing a tremendous amount of work voluntarily.</P>
    <P>The commission would require to be housed in some place.  At the present time the commission is housed in University College, which itself has been described as an academic slum. At any rate, it is so overcrowded that you hear descriptions of students sitting on the hot pipes during classes because they have no other place to sit.  The rooms are absolutely overcrowded. Yet, a great institution like University College, which is so overcrowded and so short of space for its own particular purposes, has given the commission a couple of rooms to do this work.  I would like to know from the Minister whether any arrangements are going to be made to provide the commission with a house of its own to store its enormously valuable material in, and to enable its headquarters workers to do their work with reasonable comfort and efficiency.  At the present moment they are completely crowded out by the amount of material that they have collected around them.  I would particularly ask the Minister whether, in presenting us with his Estimate for next year, he will cause, for the information of the House, to have the whole work of the commission reviewed, and particularly the class of work that remains to be done in order that we can save completely the magnificent harvest and heritage that is there.</P>
    <P>There is another thing that I would like to raise.  A lot of this work has been collected simply by notebook and pencil, and recently a lot of it by the dictaphone.  You have some of the most extraordinary people and most extraordinary minds in Western European civilisation among the people of the Irish-speaking districts at the present time.  I was down in Dunquin in the early part of this year.  There was a student there from Switzerland.  He had spent three months in the district. He had spent a considerable part of that time in the company of old Peg Sayers and was mystified at the mentality and the character of that old <Col N="417" /> woman that he found living there in the most western part of Ireland and of Europe.  He said that he had failed to plumb the poetic depths of her mind.  We are in the position that we have people of that kind here.  Yet, in spite of all the up-to-date machinery there is for recording voices and the speech of the people, no up-to-date machinery has been made available to the commission to take records of the actual speaking voices of the people who are living there; of people who, like her, are there and in parts of the Gaeltacht like Cul-aodha, Ballyvourney, Connemara, Donegal and parts of Clare.  I ask whether something is going to be done, and done urgently to give us&mdash;in the form of adequate and perfect records of the modern type&mdash;some samples of the speech of those people before they go&mdash; of the really monumental character and minds of those people who are going and going very quickly.  The matter is urgent, and I urge on the Minister to realise that the resources at the disposal of the director and staff are not anything like meeting the big and very urgent work that is to be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephHallide" hpid="Mr. Halliden Mr. Halliden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Deputy Mulcahy in his plea for more intensive work in this connection.  I had considerable experience myself collecting folklore in the North Cork area.  I agree with the Deputy when he says that the matter in question is being conducted too slowly.  It is also disappointing that those who are collecting it have to live on miserable salaries.  The poor stipend allocated does not provide much of an incentive for them to do the work.  They are doing extraordinarily good work, and it is regrettable that the return they get for it is so small.  I agree with Deputy Mulcahy that the work should be speeded up.  I would like to know from the Minister if any publications have been issued by the Folklore Commission, and if not when we may hope to see some.  I appeal for better financial help for those who are engaged on this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy has referred to the importance of the work of the Folklore Commission.  I should like to endorse what he has said, and welcome his appreciative remarks. <Col N="418" /> This is the kind of work that is not, perhaps, as well known as it should be. There is scarcely any work that could be carried out, dealing with our cultural past and the lives of our people, that could be of more importance than this work is.  The work has, as Deputy Mulcahy has said, acquired an unrivalled reputation.  The workers employed, from the director down to the most newly appointed part-time collector, are all persons of special qualifications, several of them holding university qualifications as well.  Their work is known, of course, in Sweden and elsewhere where special attention is given to folklore and folk tradition. The Government would like to assist the commission as far as they can, but I think it is not entirely a question of finance.  There is the question of getting suitable collectors.  These have to be specialists.  They have to have a certain type of personality to make them successful in their work in going amongst the old people in collecting folklore, and I dare say the number of such persons is limited.  Moreover, up to the present it has not been possible to arrange that the commission should be made permanent.  When it was established originally it was thought that the work that it put before itself might be completed within a period of years. There was great urgency at that time as everyone realised that the old Irish speakers were dying out, and that there was the danger that the store of folklore which they had might be lost. Thanks to the work of the commission, to the energy of the director and of his collaborators and of the members of the commission itself, a great deal has been salvaged, but probably something has been lost.  The Irish National Teachers' Organisation also gave valuable assistance.  The teachers, when they were asked by the commission to help in the work, got the schoolchildren interested, and even in areas that were not Irish-speaking a great amount of valuable material was collected, not alone stories, but matter bearing on the lives of the people, and particularly upon the social history of the country during the past 70, 80, or perhaps 100 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The collectors, naturally, would like that their positions should be made <Col N="419" /> permanent, but I think I would be correct in saying there is a difficulty, and there will always be a difficulty, in getting the fine type of worker required in an enterprise of this kind to remain on if opportunities are given to him to improve himself and to get a permanent position in some other walk of life which may suit him.  At any rate, the present condition of the finances of the commission will enable them to do something more for the collectors. Leaving out the indoor staff, I find the outdoor staff are paid salaries ranging from £250 to £300 a year.  In addition, they receive emergency bonus and, according to their circumstances, they are allowed certain maintenance and board allowance for the period when they are at work.</P>
    <P>Before I pass from the general point, I should like to ask all those interested in the preservation of the records of the generation that is now ebbing so quickly from us, and which is the last of its kind that we shall have, to give us some assistance.  I have in mind those people who, with not a great deal of formal education, nevertheless carry with them a great repository of old Irish legend and story.  There are not very many of them left and it is necessary that every one of us who is interested should help the commission in its work to gather in what remains to be collected and also extend the work, not only through the Irish-speaking districts, but through all the other areas of the country as well.</P>
    <P>As regards the housing of the commission, I agree the present accommodation is, perhaps, not suitable.  It is in the upper part of the University College building and is not easy of access.  On the other hand, I think from the point of view of the director, and probably the commission, they have the feeling that since they were associated with University College, Dublin, they would like to maintain the association. If the commission would be prepared to change, in view of the growth of their records and work, I would be very glad to examine the possibility of trying to provide accommodation for them elsewhere, subject to the fact that Government Departments, which are increasing in number and size, are also looking <Col N="420" /> for accommodation.  There is also a keen demand for accommodation by the public and by commercial firms, so it is not easy to get the accommodation, but I think it should be possible to secure alternative accommodation for them and it is a matter we will not lose sight of.</P>
    <P>As regards the gramophone records, a number of these were made during the period of office of the previous Government.  I understand they were not very satisfactory; perhaps it was that the technique had not been developed at that time, but, from the point of view of using them in schools, they were not at all what the inspectors would think the right material.  If, on the other hand, we wish to keep the records merely as records, which is what the Deputy has in mind, I shall be very glad if a machine is provided and I think Radio Éireann is the organisation which ought to have the machine, which is a rather costly one.  If they have not already procured it, I shall certainly speak to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and remind him that if he gets the machine he could also do work to assist the Folklore Commission and in that way we would have permanent records of old Irish speakers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Halliden perhaps is not aware in the same way as I am of the difficulties in getting even Government printing done.  The difficulties in that connection are at present very great. The printers seem to be altogether cluttered up with work.  The Folklore Commission has a very large amount of material which they are preparing gradually for publication and recently I received a copy of a journal&mdash;I think it was the 1945 copy&mdash;that is published by a different body, but they are substantially the same persons&mdash;the Folklore Society&mdash;as the Folklore Commission. It is the same kind of material and the director, Professor Delargy, is responsible in both cases.  It is a great achievement that they have been able to keep their journal and have it published, though not at regular intervals, in somewhat the same manner as we were accustomed to before the war.</P>
    <P>As soon as the printing position improves, I am quite sure the material the commission has in hand will be <Col N="421" /> published.  The important thing, and what the commission itself has always stressed, is that the work of collecting is far more important and more urgent and all their efforts should be concentrated upon that.  At the same time, they can make the necessary arrangements. They have a staff in Dublin which has prepared a good deal of matter for publication and if the printing difficulties are got over I am sure we will have a fairly normal stream of publications coming from them.</P>
    <P>I do not know that there is anything else except as regards the Compántas going outside Dublin.  Séard adubhairt siad féin i gcúntas i rith na bliana seo caithte ná: &ldquo;Cé go bfuaireamar cuid mhaith cuireadh dul faoin dtuaith, níor éirigh linn freastal díobh ach teaspántas i gCeatharlach i nDeireadh Fomhair, 1945.&rdquo;  There was no reference to the Compántas touring the country or going outside.  The expenses that would be involved going down the country are very great and I do not know whether the members of the organisation could travel, unless at certain times, as they have their ordinary occupations to attend to.  I will remind them, if it can be done, that the opinion has been expressed in Dáil Éireann that people in the country might like to see what they could do.</P>

      <P>The Minister questioned whether it was possible to get collectors of the proper type and whether it might not be hard to keep them if they can get offers of a better position.  I think the Minister will probably find by experience that there are persons doing this work who could have got much better positions elsewhere. In fact, the work becomes a kind of vocation and attracts people to it as a kind of vocation.  If the finances of the commission were improved, I do not think he would have any difficulty in getting the type of people who would do the collecting work.</P>

    <P>Fé mar a mhínías im ráiteas agus mé ag tabhairt isteach meastacháin mo Roinne don bhliain airgeadais atá ann fé láthair (22ú Bealtaine, 1946, Col. 555), ghnítear soláthar anois i gcóir deontas chun a chur i gcumas bamisteoirí Scoileanna Saothair gnáthdheisiúchán agus gnáth-fheabhsu ar a gcuid foirgnimh scol a chur i ngníomh. Ach do thárla dhá chás éagoiteanta nach mbeadh na gnáth-dheontais sáthach mór dóibh, agus is mar gheall orthu san atá sé de riachtanas orm an Meastachán seo a'iarraidh.</P>
    <P>Is é atá sa chéad chás díobh sin ná ath-thógaint Scol Saothair Naomh Iósef do Chailíní i gCo.  Chabháin.  Fé mar is eol do chách, bhí sé de mhí-ádh ar an tsean-scoil gur dódh go talamh í, i mbliain a 1943.  An coimhthionól ban rialta a bhfuil an Scoil Saothair faoi n-a gcúram, do chinneadar go dtosnófaí láithreach ar fhoirgneamh nua scoile a dhéanamh i ngar d'áit na seanscoile, agus do bhí ceadú le n-a aghaidh sin acu ón Dochtúir Sár-Urramach Ó Liatháin, Easpog na Cille Móire.  Tá an foirgneamh nua déanta anois, agus do thuillfeadh 100 páiste ann do réir na gcaighdeán áiseanna a meastar anois a bheith riachtanach.  £42,000 an costas iomlán a bhí leis an bhfoirgneamh nua so, agus is í an tsuim iomlán atá ag na mná riaghalta ina chóir sin ná £27,000 &mdash;£13,382 d'árachas ar an tsean-scoil agus £13,674 d'airgead suncáilte atá acu féin go príobháideach.  Fágann sé sin go bhfuil £15,000 d'fhiacha le n-íoc. Táim cinnte go mba dheacair, agus gur dócha nárbh fhéidir don Choimhthionól na fiacha troma sin a íoc; agus mar gheall ar an tionóisc mhifhortúnach agus mar gheall ar na árdchostais atá ann fé láthair, táthar ag brath £7,500 de dheontas speisialta a thabhairt&mdash;is é sin leath na bhfiach úd atá luaite agam.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an gcás eile ina bhfuil cabhair speisialta airgeadais ag teastáil, <Col N="423" /> is é atá ansin ná Scoil Saothair nua do bhuachaillí a dhéanamh in aice Bhaile Átha Cliath.  Scoil Saothair Ard Aidhin agus Scoil Saothair na Cairrige Léithe, an dá scoil atá in aice Bhaile Átha Cliath, táid le roinnt bhlian, róbheag don méid buachaill ba mhian leis na Cúirteanna a chur chucu.  Ar an ábhar san, ba riachtanach do na breithimh, ina lán cás, buachaillí a chur chun Scoileanna Saothair a bhí i bhfad ó bhaile (e.g., go Dún na Séad, Co. Chorcaighe agus go Tráigh Lí.). Ní sásúil a leithéid sin de shocrú agus fé mar is eol do chuid de Theachtaí Chathair Bhaile Átha Cliath bítear ag cur ina aghaidh agus ag casaoid mar gheall air.</P>
    <P>Ó thárla nárbh fhéidir an scéal a leigheas tré fhairsingiú na scol atá i mBaile Átha Cliath fé láthair, do hiarradh ar na Bráithre Críostúla Scoil Saothair breise do bhuachaillí a bhunú i gcomhursanacht na cathrach.  Do gheall na Bráithre go toilteannach go ndéanfaidís é sin; ach do chuireadar in iúl nach leigfeadh ard-chostais na haimsire seo dóibh dul ar aghaidh leis, mura bhfághthaí cabhair airgeadais lena aghaidh.  Mar sin de, do gheallas do na bráithre go n-iarrfainn, in am trátha, ar an Dáil leath an chostais cheadaithe a thabhairt dóibh ina dheontas go mbeadh maximum áirithe mar choinníoll air.  Ar fháil na geallúna sin do na Bráithre, do rinneadar cuartú agus scrúdú cúramach ar na tithe móra a b'fhéidir bheith ar fáil i gcomhursanacht Bhaile Átha Cliath, agus ba é a meas gurb í Páirc Oakley, in aice Chill-Droichid, an áit is oiriúnaí.</P>
    <P>Do cheannuigh na Bráithre an teach mór sin maraon leis na 156 d'acraí talún a bhaineas leis, agus tá cuid den ullmhú déanta acu air cheana.  Tá £19,548 caite acu cheana.

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will divide it into three parts.  The main purposes of the Bill are to continue Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts in force for another year, that is, up to 31st March, 1948, and to amend the Acts in a number of respects as a result of the recent decision to retain the Marine Service, which was organised during the emergency, and to rename it the Naval Service.  The amendments in relation to the Naval Service are largely a matter of terminology.  The Acts, as they stand, are of a purely military nature and it has been necessary up to the present to deal with members of the Marine Service and Naval Service on a military basis.  Now, however, that a permanent naval component of the Defence Forces is to be maintained, it would be anomalous that its members should continue to be described as soldiers; that their service should be Army service; and that all the remaining terminology affecting them should continue to be that which by tradition and usage has always attached to land forces.</P>
      <P>The changes proposed are administratively desirable and should have a psychological value in regard to serving personnel and to the recruiting prospects of the Naval Service.  The amendments will not, however, affect the fundamental legal status of members of the service under the Acts and the service itself will not be a new force or a separate entity but will be a component of the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 3 and 5 the hitherto prescribed marine ranks and ratings will become naval ranks and ratings. <Col N="426" /> Otherwise these sections generally follow with the exception of an alteration in the military commissioned ranks to which I shall refer later Sections 17 and 18 of the No. 2 Act of 1940 and Sections 9 and 10 of the Act of 1942, which they replace.  Section 6 is in substitution for Section 3 of the 1942 Act.  It is similar in wording except for the substitution of the word &ldquo;naval&rdquo; for &ldquo;marine&rdquo;.  Section 8 provides for the adaptation of terminology which I have already mentioned.  The Act of 1923 and the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, refer to military defence forces and this necessitates the amendment shown in the Schedule and the provision contained in Section 9 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputies will notice that in the table of commissioned ranks&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that</i> 20 <i>Deputies were not present; House counted, and</i> 20 <i>Deputies being present</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that Deputies will notice that, in the table of commissioned ranks at the end of Section 3, provision is made for the rank of lieutenant-colonel.  The present senior ranks of commandant and major in the Defence Forces are the equivalents of major and lieutenant-colonel, respectively, in other armies.  There have often been misconceptions of the status of our commandants and majors in their contacts with officers of foreign forces and it would be desirable that these should be removed as far as possible. It has been decided, in this connection, to substitute the rank of lieutenant-colonel for that of major.  The rank of commandant, however, has historical associations, and while its substitution by the rank of major was contemplated, it was felt that, on the whole, sentiment would generally favour its retention as a senior rank.</P>
      <P>Section 4 makes the necessary provisions in relation to officers who, at present, hold the rank of major.  The only other matter to be mentioned in connection with the Bill is that in the Schedule of Repeals, provision is made for the repeal of Section 7 of the Act of 1942 which suspended the right of a soldier to be discharged during a period of emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before entering upon a detailed statement regarding the matters which <Col N="427" /> have given rise to the motion, I feel bound to say that, while I have no objection to the matters in question being discussed by the Dáil, I see no reason why either the Government or I should have been expected to consult the Dáil about them beforehand, seeing that they are, in the main, matters of administration which are my responsibility and the responsibility of my advisers and that they are covered by the Acts and by the regulations made under the Acts.  The Dáil might equally well expect to be consulted, for instance, about groups of promotions arising out of an emergency as about groups of reversions arising from the termination of an emergency. Subject to that, however, I feel no particular objection to making a statement. Even if this motion had not been put down, I would have thought it well to make a statement, if only to remove any public misconception of the position caused by badly-considered comments and criticism.</P>
    <P>The matters at issue are the proposed reversion of a number of officers and non-commissioned officers to their substantive ranks; the proposed retirement of certain officers in the interests of the service; the proposed discharge of a number of non-commissioned officers and the reorganisation of the reserve.  All these matters have been the subject of a good deal of mistaken comment and speculation, an instance of which is the reference in the motion to the disbandment of the reserve.  It is, of course, ridiculous and untrue to suggest that the reserve is being disbanded. All that has been done is what was foreshadowed in paragraph 16 of the White Paper of May, 1945, on the Demobilisation and Resettlement of the Defence Forces in which it was stated that it was proposed to amalgamate, as far as possible, the various existing classes of the reserve of officers and reserve of men into a post-emergency first line reserve.  The necessity for this simplification of the reserve organisation had become apparent during the emergency.  All eligible and suitable personnel of the existing classes were given an opportunity of accepting appointment in the new First Line Reserve. The remaining personnel were, <Col N="428" /> if officers, afforded an opportunity of resigning their commissions.  Where they did not choose to do so, I had no option but to request the Government to advise the President to direct the relinquishment of their commissions. Non-commissioned officers and men who were not eligible or suitable were discharged.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, provides that the reserve shall consist of the reserve of officers and the reserve of men.  The reserve of officers and the reserve of men are still in existence.  They are composed of the personnel of the first line and of the personnel of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil, which is the second line component of the reserve.  In the near future, a second line naval component will be added in replacement of the Maritime Inscription.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the reserve reorganisation first, with a view to comparing the actual facts with the type of misrepresentation which has occurred, even in the wording of the motion itself. I now propose to address myself factually to the other matters.  In confining myself to the facts, I am making no specific reference to the various charges which have been levelled at the administration such as that of a &ldquo;purge&rdquo;.  I feel confident that the facts themselves, once they have been made known, will, for all fair-minded persons, prove a sufficient answer to the charges.</P>
    <P>As regards reversions, I may commence by reminding the House that, during the emergency, the Defence Forces expanded enormously.  This necessitated the promotion of many officers, non-commissioned officers and privates to higher rank.  It was realised, however, that when the emergency came to an end, with the accompanying return to a peace-time establishment, many of the promoted personnel could not possibly be retained in their higher ranks and, accordingly, the vast majority of promotions during the emergency were made on an acting or temporary basis.  I think I may say that the fact that the promotions were designated as &ldquo;acting&rdquo; should have made it clear to all so promoted that they held out no guarantee of permanency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> The peace establishment has now been promulgated and has been fixed at a figure of 12,860 officers and other ranks, excluding Construction Corps personnel.  It is not, however, capable of absorbing all the promoted personnel in their acting higher ranks.  Amongst other things, the emergency divisional organisation has disappeared and the number of brigades has been reduced. Changes such as these entail the reversion of a number of senior officers to their substantive ranks.  The task of selecting the officers for reversion was an invidious one but it had to be faced. In making these selections, all the relevant factors were carefully considered. Actually the number of officers selected for reversion is small in comparison with the large number of promotions made during the emergency.  It consists of four acting colonels reverted to the substantive rank of major, ten acting majors reverted to the substantive rank of commandant, ten acting commandants reverted to the substantive rank of captain and two acting captains reverted to the substantive rank of lieutenant, or a total of 26.  In the non-commissioned ranks, the total number of reductions to lower rank because of the lack of suitable vacancies in the establishment is 37.</P>
    <P>As against these reversions, 16 acting colonels, 41 acting majors, 155 acting commandants and 144 acting captains, or a total of 356 officers have been or are being confirmed in their acting ranks to which they attained during the emergency.  The number of non-commissioned officers who will retain their temporary ranks is 1,170.</P>
    <P>Five of the officers selected for reversion are over the retiring ages applicable to their substantive ranks.  These officers are availing of the option given to them of retiring voluntarily in their higher acting ranks and will be eligible for retired pay based on such ranks. Seven of the remaining affected officers have also applied for, and have been given, permission to retire in their higher acting ranks.  These officers will likewise receive retired pay based on the higher ranks.</P>
    <P>In the cases of those who, on reversion, are remaining in service, every effort has been made to mitigate the <Col N="430" /> financial difficulties arising from their reversion by permitting them to retain the pay of their higher rank for one-sixth of the period of their service in the higher rank, i.e., for two months in respect of each year of such service. After that, they will be paid at the maximum rate applicable to their substantive rank.  The non-commissioned officers who are being reduced because of the lack of suitable vacancies will, like the officers, retain the pay of their higher rank for one-sixth of their period of service in the higher rank.</P>
    <P>That reversions have to be effected is, of course, regrettable but it is also inevitable.  It occurs in every army at the end of a period of war or emergency. The feeling in the Army would, I imagine, be one of satisfaction that a larger number of reversions was not found necessary.  Before passing on from the question of reversions, however, I feel it incumbent on me to say that, as the reversions arise from the lack of suitable vacancies in the establishments, they are in no sense whatever a reflection on the ability of the officers concerned.  Some of them, indeed, are very promising young officers who have been selected for reversion only because they were junior in their acting ranks.  It is my hope that, with the passage of time, it will be possible to reinstate many of the officers in their higher ranks.</P>
    <P>The reports as to the officers recommended for retirement in the interests of the service have been somewhat exaggerated as regards the number, ranks, ages and length of service. Actually, the number involved was 13, made up of two majors, one acting major, one commandant, three captains, one acting captain, four lieutenants and one second lieutenant.  Of these, however, the acting major has requested and been given permission to retire voluntarily.</P>
    <P>It is unusual and, as Deputies will appreciate, almost invariably undesirable, to make any statement with regard to the retirement of officers in the interests of the service.  In saying that, I am influenced by the fact that in this particular case, in my opinion, a discussion is not in the best interests of the officers themselves, all of whom I <Col N="431" /> would say should make good in other walks of life.  Briefly, some of the younger officers have shown themselves to be unsuited to Army life.  Of the remainder some have failed to retain their interest in the service, whilst others have not kept up with the advances which have taken place in their profession.</P>
    <P>These are some of the considerations involved in the cases under review.  If I am reluctant to discuss the matter, it is because I am not prepared to disclose here, with regard to any individual officer, which of the considerations or what combination of them, applies to his particular case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister have available the length of service of the officers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I can supply that. I can say this, however, that, on consideration of the reports made to me by the appropriate military authorities, I was satisfied that there was no alternative to the termination of the service of the officers concerned and that retirement in the interests of the service was justified.</P>
      <P>Here, I may say that retirement in the interests of the service of the officers concerned enables them to be given more favourable treatment than could be provided if they were retired for any other reason.  The officers who are being so retired are all below the normal retiring ages for their ranks. Under an amendment of the Defence Forces (Pensions) Scheme which will be placed before the Dáil soon, they will, if they have 20 or more years' pensionable service, be credited, for retired pay purposes, with a further five years' service or such lesser period as they would have had to serve to reach normal retiring age.  They will all receive six months' pre-retirement leave with full pay and allowances. Under the proposed amendment of the pensions scheme already referred to, non-commissioned service will count in full as pensionable service instead of half as heretofore.  This will affect a number of the officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned, two of the officers involved held acting rank&mdash;one the <Col N="432" /> acting rank of major and the other the acting rank of captain.  The acting major, as I have indicated, has expressed the desire to retire voluntarily. As he is taking this course, he will receive retired pay on the basis of his acting higher rank, but he cannot be given the added years' pensionable service; a provision of this nature could not be related to voluntary retirement. Neither can he be given pre-retirement leave, which is not a privilege accorded in the case of voluntary retirement.  The other officer, who has not elected to retire voluntarily under the conditions governing such retirement, is being required to revert to substantive rank before being retired.  He will, however, under the existing pensions scheme, be credited with five years' added service for retired pay purposes.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that retirement in the interests of the service is inconsistent with the fact that the officers received promotion during the emergency. While that may be so, it may also be true to say that an officer's capabilities cannot always be accurately gauged until he has been promoted and all officers do not live up to the promise shown by them before being selected for promotion.</P>
    <P>There are 142 non-commissioned officers who, on their records and on the reports of their superior officers, are regarded as unsuitable for retention in their ranks, even if suitable vacancies for them existed in the peace establishments.  Here again, there has been considerable exaggeration as to the number and scope of the reductions. In some cases, there will be reductions of more than one rank.  For instance, a sergeant-major cannot, generally speaking, be reduced to the next lowest rank of battalion quartermaster sergeant.  His training does not render him suitable for that rank and he must be reduced to the rank from which he was in all probability promoted, i.e., the second-next lowest rank of company sergeant.  Similarly, a battalion quartermaster sergeant cannot ordinarily fill the next lowest rank of company sergeant but must be reduced to the rank of company quartermaster sergeant.  Apart from cases such as these, the number of <Col N="433" /> reductions by what can properly be described as more than one rank is small. It consists of one sergeant major to sergeant; one battalion quartermaster sergeant to sergeant; four company quartermaster sergeants to corporal and three sergeants to private or a total of nine.</P>
    <P>In addition 199 non-commissioned officers are being discharged.  They are men who have rendered long service; they have all, in fact, at least 21 years' service and are being discharged on pension.  There is no connection, such as has been suggested, between their discharge and the recruiting position. Their discharge was decided upon a considerable time ago on grounds such as those of age and medical grading.</P>
    <P>That is a factual statement with regard to the various matters involved in the motion.  I think I can claim to have shown fairly that the relatively small number of reversions from acting rank is unavoidable in the light of the return to a peace-time establishment after the maintenance of the Defence Forces for several years at emergency strength.  I hope I have shown, too, that the decision to retire a small number of officers in the interests of the service&mdash;13 out of a total officer strength of more than 1,100&mdash;was not taken lightly.</P>
    <P>In case the decision may still be felt to have been unduly severe, I should like to place a few considerations before the House and I am sure that nobody will disagree with them.  It is most important that the officer corps should be highly efficient.  The efficiency of the Defence Forces, in fact, largely depends on the efficiency of the officers and our soldiers have the right to be led by only the most capable officers.  It was necessary, therefore, that on the reorganisation of the Defence Forces on a more permanent basis than that which has existed for some years past, action should be taken to ensure as far as possible that all officers are fit for their appointments and possess initiative, energy and ability as well as balance and a sense of responsibility appropriate to their ranks and appointments. That is the standard which is being set and, even if it is high, nobody will, I think, quarrel with it on that account.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="434" /> I note that it is desired that a statement should be made on the Government's defence policy and on the organisation, recruitment, training, equipment and cost of the Defence Forces in relation thereto.  Actually, I made statements on defence policy last year in the course of the debates on the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Bill and the Army Estimates, and the question was very fully discussed on each occasion.  I can now do no more than repeat generally what I then said.</P>
    <P>The desirable&mdash;and, in fact, the only possible&mdash;defence policy for this country is clear.  It may be summarised by saying that the country must possess a defence force capable of operating in defence of the national territory and that the strength, composition, organisation, training and equipment of the force must be such as to enable the Government to assume complete responsibility for the defence of the country.</P>
    <P>The questions of strength, composition, organisation, training and equipment have been under examination for some time past but obviously so many considerations are involved that decisions cannot be taken hurriedly.  These considerations include the experiences of the emergency which has just ended; war developments in organisation, training and equipment and the general world-situation.  A good deal of progress has been made, however, and in particular the Government have been able to decide upon a strength for the permanent force of 12,860 all ranks, excluding Construction Corps personnel.</P>
    <P>The basis of the pre-emergency permanent force was the maintenance of a small force of specialists&mdash;a hard core of highly trained personnel around which, in an emergency, a large army could be built.  It was envisaged that every member of the permanent force would be trained in duties and responsibilities above his rank and would be capable of playing his part in the speedy organisation and training of the expanded Army.  This result was not fully achieved.  The permanent force was altogether too small; the garrison and other routine duties inseparable from Army organisation left insufficient time for specialist training and the force proved unable to deal as quickly <Col N="435" /> as was desirable with the large influx of recruits in 1940.  The Government have, therefore, decided upon a permanent force which will be sufficiently large to enable routine duties to be carried out otherwise than at the expense of training; which will assist in the training and development of the reserve and which will fit into the scheme of defence.</P>
    <P>The new territorial organisation consists of three commands with, in addition, the Curragh Training Camp. The permanent force is provisionally organised, under the peace establishment, into the cadres of three brigades, together with the various staff establishments, depôts, schools and a number of other miscellaneous formations. The brigade cadres, with their reserves, would ensure that, on mobilisation, three brigades, or the equivalent of a division, would be immediately available.  Each brigade would, in addition, be capable of forming the nucleus of a division, if necessary.  The permanent force also includes the Naval Service and the Air Corps.</P>
    <P>The Dáil is already aware of the steps which have been taken to increase the officer strength of the permanent force.  The strength on the 31st December last was 1,115 officers as against an establishment figure of 1,356.  The recruiting campaign which has been in operation since September last and is still continuing has already produced 1,900 recruits which, I may say, represents a greater influx than for any comparable period during the last 20 years, the latter portion of 1940 excepted.  The strength of other ranks on the 31st December, 1946, was 7,574 as against an establishment figure of 11,504.</P>
    <P>The considerations which I have already mentioned render it unlikely that a war establishment will be prepared for some time to come.  A simplification of reserve organisation has, however, been effected, the details of which I have indicated earlier in my statement.</P>
    <P>Training, again, is a matter which needs careful consideration.  A number of officers have already undergone, and are undergoing, courses in Great <Col N="436" /> Britain, and it is contemplated that additional officers will be sent on such courses in the immediate future.  Some of the officers concerned are filling senior appointments and others are intended for the Military College and for the various corps schools.  It is proposed that the training of officers will commence at the corps schools as soon as possible, and it is also hoped that the command and staff school will open before the end of the present year.</P>
    <P>Annual training will be resumed this year for the first line reserve.  The training of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil will also proceed and it may be mentioned that the peace establishments provide for, approximately, 100 officers, 200 non-commissioned officers and 50 privates, who will be occupied exclusively or mainly on duties connected with An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil.  It is intended to organise courses of instruction for officers and non-commissioned officers of the force itself, who will then be in a position to take over responsibility for a good deal of the local training of the units.</P>
    <P>The question of equipment presents certain difficulties.  It would be pointless, at present, to incur heavy expenditure on the purchase of equipment which might in a very short time be found to be obsolete.  It is reasonable to assume that post-war developments with regard to equipment will soon be apparent and it is only on consideration of these developments that our requirements can be decided.  There appears to be no doubt but that considerable expenditure may have to be faced.</P>
    <P>The Army Vote for 1946/47 is £4,576,310 and I propose to introduce shortly a Supplementary Estimate of approximately £630,000.  For 1947/48 I am asking for £4,600,000.  I cannot at this stage give any firm indication of what the cost of the Defence Forces is likely to be over a long period.  It, obviously, depends on a number of factors. I may say, however, that while every precaution will be taken against unnecessary inflation of the cost, there is a point below which it cannot be kept if the defence policy is to be seriously implemented.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Dáil declines to give a Second Reading to the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1947, until it shall have heard and shall have an opportunity of discussing a statement on behalf of the Government on its general defence policy and on the organisation, recruitment, training, equipment and the cost of the Defence Forces in relation thereto.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When the Minister gets £4,600,000 next year, he will be running the most expensive ostrich farm there ever was.  I had hoped, when I heard that the Minister was to make a statement on defence policy, it would not be necessary to move the amendment.  I find it necessary to do so.  The Minister says that he explained the Government's defence policy last year and that he has nothing to add to that statement.  He told us last year that the Government had decided to have a permanent army of 12,500 men and that the reason he wanted a force of that kind was that there was an enormous amount of routine work to be done in looking after barracks and stores and in doing sentry work and that he was determined that that type of work would not interfere with the work of training for the real military purposes for which the Army is kept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of putting down the amendment to the Minister's motion is that the Government will tell us for what purpose the Army is being kept, and in the light of that purpose what its strength and its equipment ought to be.  I think the least the country is entitled to know is what the Army is there for.  If it is there for a particular object the people ought to be given an opportunity of realising what sum is worth spending on its size, equipment, and training.  They ought to be given an opportunity of understanding that they have the money to spend on it, and that for the purpose for which the Army is required in relation to the country&mdash;its social, national and economic life&mdash;it is worth spending <Col N="438" /> that money on it.  I say that the Minister is going to be in charge of the most expensive ostrich farm in the world, because both he and those who are advising him with regard to his present general proposals, must have their heads in the sand, at any rate in relation to their responsibilities to our people and to the Parliament.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the Army was not strong enough in 1939 to do its work.  Surely to goodness, as events transpired, we built up too big an Army in the end for the work that it had to do.</P>

      <P>At any rate we knew that at the end of the period. The Minister says that he is basing his proposals now on our experience in the emergency.  What were our experiences and what did we observe during the emergency and during the last war that dictates to the Minister now that he should ask the country to bear, in 1947, 1948 and 1949, the cost of an Army of 12,500 men?  My point is that we are here to discuss that matter, and to try to find that out.  As I said when we were discussing this last year, it would be a most undesirable thing for this country and for the Army if the Army should become the subject of mere Party politics, and it is not in any way necessary, any more than it is desirable, that it would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ought to face frankly what are the conditions in the world, and what are our home conditions that dictate to us that we should spend as much as £4,500,000 or £5,000,000 a year on the maintenance and equipment of the Army.  I submit to the Minister that, while he may appear to throw his statement to us rather summarily, he is not carrying out his responsibilities as Minister set up to look after the Defence Forces simply by coming here and saying: &ldquo;We have decided that we are <Col N="439" /> to have an army of 12,500; we have consulted our military advisers on the one hand and the Government have agreed to it on the other, and we are not going to say anything more about it.&rdquo;  I ask him: &ldquo;If you were starting again in 1939 to build up this country and prepare it for its defence, would you do exactly what you did then?&rdquo; I have said before that after the Government were given all the emergency powers that they could reasonably want, every power in the world except the power of taxation and conscription without the permission of the Dáil, the Army was mobilised without any reference to any of the other Parties in the Dáil.  Following that we approached the Government.  We told the Taoiseach that in our opinion the economic position would be more serious for us at that particular time than the military position, and that mobilising the reserve even at that time meant taking men away from their normal avocations and income, that it disturbed the family economy of quite a large number of people as well as disturbed industry and commerce when it was not clear that we were going to be directly affected in a military way at all: that there was time enough to face up to that, but that it was perfectly clear that our agricultural industry was starting off when it was caught on the wrong foot as a result of the difficulties under which it had laboured during the economic war, that, instead of putting another £2,000,000 into defence at that particular time and in mobilising the reserve, everything possible should be done to spend as much money as possible on strengthening our agricultural economy at that time.</P>
    <P>If we were facing that position again to-day would we not commence by collecting money and materials, fertilisers, the commodities that we require for housing and for the clothing and feeding of our people and secure them in that way?  Would we not have done that before we had moved to mobilise the reserve? I ask the Minister to throw his mind back to the time when France fell in 1940.  What were we looking for then? Simply for another 10,000 men for the Army and for a local security force. <Col N="440" /> The Government did not even then want a Local Defence Force.  It took some weeks on the part of the Government to listen to logic because it was simply logic we put before them: that if the Army wanted 10,000 men and if the emergency was such that the Army wanted 10,000 men full-time, that then at least the young men throughout the country who could not give full-time service in the Army should be given a certain amount of opportunity to get military training so that they might be of assistance to an Army of X plus 10,000, and if called upon would be ready for duty.  Even away back in 1940 the Government's mind on the situation at that time was that it had to be perfectly convinced of what we require to do now&mdash;to strengthen our economy, to harmonise our social conditions, to build up and strengthen our education so that we will know that there is something to be fought for if our country is attacked in any way, and that we will not be led simply blind-folded into the defence of the country because we have an Army and have spent money in building it up: that having done that we must stand for our rights and the Army must fight.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the recruits that we are getting into the Army.  I questioned him in October on the recruits that were going into the Army.  I asked him for the number of men who had been turned down for reasons of health and lack of education. I was told that out of the total of 1,917 men who presented themselves to join the Army only 811 were accepted; and 1,106 were rejected&mdash;583 of these were rejected because they were below the physical standard for the Army and 240 were rejected because they were below the educational standard.  In the Dublin area, one-third of those who came forward were below the physical standard; in the Curragh area one-fourth were below that standard; in the southern area one-fourth were below that standard and in the western area one-fifth were below the physical standard.  In the Dublin area one-tenth were below the educational standard; in the Curragh area one-fifth; in the southern area <Col N="441" /> one-tenth, and in the western area one-fifth.</P>
    <P>There is no country in the world facing its security future that is not deciding to-day that until it strengthens its economy it does not know whether it will be able to do the work necessary for defence and we should realise, from our experience, that we need to strengthen our economy if our people are to exist in a world at war.  We should surely learn the lessons that were plain to be learned as a result of war developments during the past six years.  The Minister says that our defence organisation must be such as to enable the Government to assume complete responsibility for the defence of the country.  I wonder does the Minister know what were the developments in arms during and at the end of the last war, and I wonder what comfort it will be to us, having spent £4,500,000 a year on the empty occupation of training-in armies, if the circumstances of the next war will be for us much as the circumstances of the last war were for Japan.</P>
    <P>A prominent United States general said, within the past few days, that the opening 24 hours of the next war could easily mean that 24,000,000 or 25,000,000 citizens of the United States would be wiped out by atomic bombs. Other United States generals, commenting on the development of armaments, have indicated during the past 12 months that the atomic bomb is not necessarily the most violent or dangerous weapon in war.  They suggest that developments in rockets and the advances with a certain type of aeroplane can easily be much more effective in death-dealing than even the developments with the atomic bomb. Has the Minister watched the discussions proceeding in the world between the great Powers that feel they are particularly interested in war because they have the responsibility for getting into it and for bearing the brunt in men and arms and equipment?  Has he been examining what they have been saying with regard to developments?</P>
    <P>One of the most obvious things with regard to the development of military thought in the world is that there must be regional conceptions of defence policy and you have the Canadians, <Col N="442" /> South Africans and Australians declining to be participants in any broad defence policy for the Commonwealth of which they are members because they consider that in defence matters there will have to be regional arrangements and even these regional arrangements have, if possible, to be linked with an outlook on defence matters organised by a body such as the United Nations Organisation.  He will see that comparatively recently in relation to their own defence matters, and even before President Roosevelt died, legislation has been introduced into Congress for the purpose of enabling the United States to rearm and re-equip all the States in Southern America and that definite defence arrangements have been entered into between the United States and Canada on the ground that it is only by mutual understanding they will be in a position to defend their countries.  In the same way you have Australia and New Zealand in the position that they have to co-operate and take a major part in looking after regional defence in the South Pacific.</P>
    <P>You have other military thinkers who say that the whole centre of gravity of any defence plan, even for the defence of Great Britain, Australia or Canada, must be based on South Africa, because of the nature of the equipment and the nature of the warfare that the next war, if it comes, will bring.  There are people who think that Great Britain would be completely out of court as a place from which to wage or sustain any kind of effective military operation, and the idea is held that South Africa will provide the ground for manoeuvres in any serious world organisation for defence or for any organisation that will enable the British Commonwealth of Nations to defend itself.</P>
    <P>There is no Government in the world that is looking at its defence problems to-day in the same astounding way as our Government is looking at them; that is, that our arrangements, as we are told, must be such as to enable us to assume complete responsibility for the defence of the country.  The idea of spending £4,500,000 a year and taking the abilities and the intelligence of the 12,500 of our men from productive occupations in order to train them in <Col N="443" /> arms to wrap themselves up in that delusion and in that kind of pride is a fantastic and a mad business, even if war was going to appear in five years' time.  Surely, everything in the world situation dictates to us that we should forget war for the moment and concentrate our efforts on building up our social and economic life and improving our education.  Even if we had to meet war in the future, we should realise that it is only by bringing our resources to bear on strengthening our economy that we would be able to fit ourselves to meet it.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated last year as reported in column 2127 of the Official Debates of the 7th March, 1946:-</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I want to tell the House, whatever they may feel regarding the purchase of warlike stores in the future, that the Army is at present underequipped. If we are to have an Army and a Local Defence Force, we shall have to equip them.  The alternative is for this House to tell the Government that it does not want an Army or that it wants the Army to be greatly reduced.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are different things for which we may want an army, big or small. You may want it just as a symbol of the State's sovereignty, as a kind of State sword, or as an auxiliary to the police force in internal matters.  You may want it as a major weapon of defence in serious war work.  If we want the Army as a major weapon of defence in serious military work, then it is too soon for us to be able to make up our minds what kind of war is going to arrive, if and when it is to arrive, what kind of weapons are going to be used against us, and what kind of weapons we are going to use in defence. If we are going to be involved in a major war our circumstances are going to be what they were in relation to Great Britain at any rate in the last war, that is, that it is Great Britain's power of defence, both by air and by its navy, that will protect us.  These were the forces which kept us in the security which we enjoyed during the last war.</P>
    <P>Doubts have been expressed as to whether either the British Navy or Air <Col N="444" /> Force would give us the security they did in the last war.  If they cannot, then we are not sufficiently trained imaginatively to decide what is going to protect or defend this country in the next war.  Whatever the situation will be, we cannot dissociate our defence here from the defence of Britain but it is much too early for us to say what kind of co-operation is necessary in actual arming or training.  Even the Prime Minister of Great Britain said early last year that there were too many unknown factors in the situation to enable the British to say what kind of plans or organisation or what kind of equipment they wanted in any war that might come upon them, so that everything in the situation dictates to us that the Army can very well be maintained as a maintenance party here, as a study group, in which we would have the best men we could possibly get at the head of our Army and in charge of our various services, to study intensely both political and military developments in the world.  They would be in close touch with the study carried out by those people most closely associated with us and without whose assistance we cannot defend ourselves&mdash;that is the people of Great Britain on this side of the Atlantic and the people of the United States on the other.</P>
    <P>Instead of spending £4,500,000 on a rather elaborate police force of 12,500 men, that can be nothing but a police force, we should see to it that we had a small army in which we would provide the best training and the best study we could get on the top.  I urged last year that instead of trying to build up an Army by looking for an additional 600 officers and another 6,000 men to replace the men who are being demobilised, the Minister should content himself with carrying out the demobilisation of whatever number of officers and men were going out and then maintain the Army services on whatever number was left.  The men that were left were good enough in the situation that arose in 1939 to recruit, train and keep in good morale and discipline over the long period of six years, a very difficult thing in an army, the additional 35,000 men recruited at that time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> The men who were good enough for that would be good enough to stand by in this waiting period while we were watching what was going on in the world and making preparations to organise our Army on whatever lines and with whatever kind of outlook the future might show to be necessary.  I said last year, as reported in col. 2158 of the Debates of the 7th March:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Surely we ought to regard this as a period of pause when we can sit down and examine our defence problem without committing ourselves to any military organisation save the Army at present in being and the equipment we have.  We could examine the problems of a defensive nature that are likely to come our way in future and see what kind of organisation we require to meet them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what kind of consultations or what exchanges of opinion have taken place between our military authorities here and the authorities in Great Britain with regard to the future say of equipment and organisation and whether any similar exchanges have taken place between ourselves and the military authorities in the United States because it is simply sinning against the light and sinning against ordinary intelligence to tell us that we must go on spending £4,500,000 a year to keep an Army of the kind we have? We have a very serious and difficult economic situation to deal with.  We cannot afford this money and we particularly cannot afford to develop a military spirit here in a world that is trying to banish it.  Whether we are going to have a war in five years' time or 15 years' time, whether the United Nations Organisation is going to succeed in bringing about a situation in which war can be avoided, we are extravagantly foolish and childish to spend £4,500,000 per year on an Army. We are being badly served politically in an important matter like this when we have the Minister coming in to the Dáil and telling us simply: &ldquo;We are going to have an Army of 12,500.  We said last year that we are going to have it and we are going to have it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I feel the Dáil should pass the <Col N="446" /> motion in the names of myself and Deputy Dr. O'Higgins because without a more satisfactory statement of what is in the Government's mind or some more information as to how they arrived at their present conclusions, it would be criminal on the part of any public man at the present time to vote money to maintain an Army of the size and the kind indicated here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment, and I do so in very much the same spirit as that in which we have appealed to the Minister for Defence year after year.  The amendment can come as no surprise to the Minister or to his advisers.  Year after year for a very considerable number of years back, we have pressed on the Minister the advisability and the necessity of being frank with the Dáil and the country, if he intended to come to the Dáil to take more money from the country for the purpose of paying and maintaining soldiers.  We impressed on him year after year that every Minister for Defence, every Minister for War, in any normal Parliament throughout the world, when asking for increased moneys for the provision of more soldiers and a greater army, was always prepared to come before Parliament and to lay down simply and clearly what the defence policy of the country was and why a greater army strength was required.  I should venture to  that Haile Selassie, the Emperor of Abyssinia, makes a more intelligent and intelligible statement to the Abyssinian Parliament with regard to the Abyssinian Army and its defence requirements than ever we have elicited from the Minister or his predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister comes in and asks for three times as much money as was required pre-war to pay the Army annually in the post-war years of peace. He just ambles to his feet and says: &ldquo;I want three times as much money for the coming year's peace as ever I required for previous years of peace.  I am going to keep an Army two-and-ahalf times as great in numbers as ever we had in the previous years of peace&rdquo;. He is asked the reason why and he appears to resent any Deputy asking the reason why, when they are asked to mulct the taxpayers in an extra <Col N="447" /> £3,500,000 per year.  He does not feel called upon to give the reason.  It is sufficient merely to say: &ldquo;There are guard and sentry duties and other routine duties to be done and I do not want these duties to interfere with training, and, consequently, the Government, the General Staff and I have decided that we want more&rdquo;.  It is not the Government, the General Staff and he who provide the millions and the people who provide the extra millions asked for are at least entitled to know why and for what purpose the extra millions are required.</P>
    <P>An army has a number of functions and some of these functions are similar in every country throughout the world. An army in every country is there as an armed supporting force for the police in case such a situation gets too dangerous, too difficult or too big to be handled by the police.  In other words, armies are maintained for the purpose of keeping the peace internally, for dealing with rioting and similar classes of activity.</P>
    <P>Armies are also kept to act, as it were, as the ceremonial sword of State, to supply the trappings and trimmings, the pomp and ceremony, which is a more or less essential part of a free and independent State and armies, in addition, are kept for purposes of war. When armies are kept for purposes of war, they are designed to be at least as great, or as nearly as can be as great, as whatever force is most likely to attack it, or as whatever force they are most likely to find themselves in conflict with.</P>
    <P>So far as external dangers go, armies which cannot build up their strength so as to be equal, or as nearly as possible equal, to any threat which might confront their people meet the deficiency so far as possible by entering into alliances, offensive or defensive, so that their own force, plus the allied force, will be sufficient to give their people a sense of safety and a degree of confidence in their capacity to defend their people.  We here are an island people, a people living on a tiny island with a dwindling population, with no internal production sources of the materials of war&mdash;we do not make a bullet; we do not make a gun; and it would be true <Col N="448" /> to say that we scarcely make the wheel of a carriage or vehicle used in war&mdash; and our policy is and has been to keep out of all wars.  In that set of circumstances and in that atmosphere, the Minister asks for three times as much money for the Army as ever was asked for previously in times of peace and he makes that demand for three or four million pounds without giving any statement, any reason or any explanation.</P>
    <P>I do not care to what Party Deputies belong, unless they fancy themselves as a lot of bosses of the people, an organised set of thieves, there is a responsibility on them to search, to press and to inquire when a sum of this immense amount is demanded from the people and there is a responsibility on them to satisfy themselves that in fact it is required and that nothing less would meet the situation.  If that responsibility is on Deputies, there is certainly a far clearer responsibility on the Minister to be vocal, to be at least sufficiently vocal to let us know why three times as much money is required in coming years.  If he is not prepared to make that statement, if he is not prepared to make that clear, we must only assume that the same old game is to go on, but in a bigger way&mdash; the game of playing around with soldiers, of merely shifting them, changing their titles, altering their uniforms, passing the time with new schemes of reorganisation and shifting them around like a little boy on the drawing-room carpet at Christmas.  We must assume that the appetite is developing, that they are tired of the old soldiers, that there were not enough of them, that they are weary of some of their faces and weary of the old type of uniform, that a new toy is wanted and that the new toy, keeping abreast of the fashion of the times, has to be far more expensive than the old toy.</P>
    <P>Is it that we require more soldiers &mdash;three times as many&mdash;in order to fulfil the ceremonial functions in association with the State?  Is that one of the reasons?  Is it because there is far more internal unrest?  Is it that there is far more internal danger, far more danger of riot, of rebellion, than there used to be?  Is it because that second purpose of the <Col N="449" /> Army requires greater expenditure? Is that why the increased demands are made?  Or is it because the world war that was boiling up for a number of years past has come to an end and the world is militarily exhausted and thoroughly and generally disgusted with war and the very thought of war that we want three times as many soldiers and mulct the taxpayers for three times as much money?</P>
    <P>Is the whole model, the whole plan of this Army, that is to be three times as expensive as the pre-war Army, to be designed on the old lines at a time when the greatest military experts in the world will admit that they do not know from day to day whether or not armies will be entirely worthless in a year or two?  The latter months of the war in Europe were proving very conclusively that unmechanised land forces were figures of history, that their day had been and gone and that they were a thing of the past.  The last couple of weeks of the war in the Far East made it appear that armies were matters of history and, had that war continued for another couple of months, it might have been made clear to all military men, here and elsewhere, that the greatest folly a nation could commit was to concentrate its manhood in any type of formation, armies or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Statements have been made and published from time to time by people elsewhere who could claim to be military experts, not only in theory but in practical experience of two great world wars.  Read their statements. Read their prognostications.  There is not one of them who could say that the future of armies is that they have to be three times as numerous, three times as costly but designed on the old lines of infantry soldiers.  When the whole world, including the greatest military experts, are guessing, Minister Oscar Traynor can walk in here and tell us exactly what the requirements are, not to the nearest 1,000 but down to the very last figure, down to the very last orderly, and down to the very last half-penny.</P>
    <P>It is not here he should be.  He should be directing the world because he is the only Minister for War or Minister for <Col N="450" /> Defence under God's sun that can talk in that simple way.  It is because we are not serious about defence and never have faced up seriously to the matter of defence that we can bring in Bills to change the rank of our officers from major to lieutenant-colonel.  That is our defence work.  That is our defence policy.  We start playing around with uniforms, with ranks, with paper organisation, because we are not doing the serious heavy solid work of thinking in terms of defence.</P>
    <P>Seventeen years ago the Minister for Defence that was over there came to this Dáil year after year asking for authority to maintain a very tiny army, costing comparatively little, and year after year he asked for less and less from the taxpayers of this country. Very clearly it was stated that, as the internal position of this country quietened down and internal disorder and organised lawlessness internally became less and less, the demand on the taxpayer would be less and less. The policy directing the Army and the reason for asking for the money was clearly and fearlessly stated year after year.  It was stated: &ldquo;We want the smallest possible Army to preserve internal order, to maintain peace within our shores, but we want a highly trained, efficient Army of the very smallest type that can be rapidly expanded and that can build a greater Army around itself.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The recent war and the previous war have shown us that soldiers can be turned out when they are wanted as quickly as sausages can be turned out through a sausages machine.  A man behind the counter to-day may be fighting in the ranks of an army in two months' time.  Does anybody think that France, Britain or any of these greater countries that are called on to play a major part in any war that comes along would ever presume to say to Parliament, in between times: &ldquo;We have to keep an immense standing army because some day, somewhere, somehow, there may be another war&rdquo;? Every one of them knows that armies are built when armies are wanted and sound policy in any of these countries is to keep the smallest, the cheapest but the most expert army in between times that will be capable of expanding <Col N="451" /> rapidly and officering a much greater force.</P>
    <P>That was the policy in this country when another Minister was over there but that did not satisfy Deputy Traynor or Deputy Aiken or Deputy de Valera when they were over here. According to them, £1,000,000 was a shocking amount to be taking from the people, even with armed thugs around the streets outside, with armed bands moving around the mountains.  It was shocking extortion to be taking £1,000,000 a year for a tiny army of 5,000 men, and if we had any sense at all we would have a militia, a volunteer force, and we would have a standing army merely big enough to maintain barracks.  We were told that that policy was put up by them after very close study and full consideration and that it was honestly advanced.  Now you have not the armed thug outside your gate nor the organised bands moving around the hillsides; you have no leading politicians encouraging all that kind of cod; but still you want three times as many soldiers, costing three times as much.  That is so at a time when the one thing necessary is that we rebuild ourselves after the seven years we have gone through.</P>
    <P>If these extra millions of pounds are wanted, it should be possible for someone over there to show the reason why. If the particular Minister is incapable of doing it, some other member of the Government should come along and tell us what there is in the situation, present or future, to require a much larger Army for the peace ahead and the peace behind and to require much more money from the people.  That is not asking a whole lot.</P>
    <P>The Minister divided his statement into three portions&mdash;the Bill, the recent events in the Army, and what he called the defence policy.  The three portions, taken together, contain a considerable amount of figure&mdash;figures which might be of importance in the course of the debate.  I would suggest that, when a Minister comes in here to read slavishly a carefully worded document, prepared by his Department, then as a matter of courtesy, where it contains figures, it should be made available.</P>

      <P>It is difficult for a Deputy to retain all the figures in his memory.  However, with the Bill I am not concerned.  In the main, it merely repeats the Defence Forces Bill, which is an annual one.  There are some new things in it, such as changing the rank of major to that of lieutenant-colonel and rating naval men as naval men.  If it gives any pleasure to the Minister or to the people in the Department to play around with further alterations in the rankings, well, it does no harm.</P>
      <P>On this question of reductions in rank and compulsory retirals, the Minister seems to think that, if injustices are done and done only to a small number of people, then the injustice itself is of minor importance.  If an injustice is being done by Ministerial action, it is the injustice that is important and not the number of people affected.  If 13 officers are being treated unjustly, deprived of their livelihood and their career through any Ministerial evasion or quibble that rides round the Acts there to defend their position, then the number affected does not matter one whit.  Acts of Parliament give discretionary powers to Ministers.  That is usual: it is done on the assumption that the Minister will never do an unjust act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most rigid society in any country, where the rules are hardest, is a military service, where the rules of discipline apply.  There are very many ways within the military code where an officer who misconducts himself, commits any offence, can be dealt with and there is a certain simple machinery laid down to protect that officer.  If an officer commits an offence, even of such a nature as might not be regarded as an offence at all in civilian life, there is a method of dealing with him&mdash; charge him, try him, punish him.  If an officer is negligent in his duties&mdash;and. remember, there is an expensive inspectorial staff working all the time, day in and day out&mdash;or if an officer is inefficient in his work, an adverse report against him at any time can have him dealt with.  The only protection for the officer is that the adverse report must be passed to him to sign <Col N="453" /> stating that he has seen it.  Then he can be dealt with.  Even on grounds of misconduct, of indiscipline or inefficiency, an officer can be punished&mdash;dis missed, retired or called on to resign, or put out on half-pay.  But in any of these sets of circumstances, there is responsibility on the Minister to point out the reason.</P>
    <P>There is another way in which an officer can be got rid of, all his rights trampled on and all the protective machinery removed&mdash;that is, by the phrase stating that the President has no further use for his services.  That is a direct flow of the stream from the king of this country that now calls itself a Republic&mdash;a phrase that was never heard and never used, in law or outside of law, except in countries that inherited it from a king.  Now, apparently, we mean to anticipate a further change in the title of the gentleman in the Park.  He was elected to an office: he has assumed another office, that of President of the Irish Republic, and if we are to follow and read into the future from the action taken in the Army to get rid of officers without charge or trial, kingship is going to be the next claim.</P>
    <P>I put it to Deputies that, whatever their profession or business, it is their career, their livelihood, and it is through that profession or business they hope to maintain themselves and their wives, to rear a family and launch a family on life.  The most terrible misfortune that could happen to any living man with any sense of responsibility to wife and children is to find himself suddenly deprived of his livelihood, suddenly robbed of his career, thrown, in the fifties, out into the world, untrained for anything but the profession he had adopted.  Whether the number is one, 13, or 17, it is a brutal thing to do and should not be done by any man with any Christian feelings.</P>
    <P>Does not every one of us know that, in every civil service department in the world and in every army in the world, there is a small percentage of inefficient officers and that there are any amount of dull, monotonous, routine jobs in every service and every army which do not require ability, initiative, or alertness and that, in those old side <Col N="454" /> alleys, both civil servants and army officers and other ranks are allowed to finish out their time until retiring age, their livelihood protected?  It is a very serious thing for Parliament to sanction the dismissal of any officer except for reasons stated.  The person who has the right to hear the reasons is not a member of Dáil Éireann but the individual officer himself.  If a crime is being committed or if an injustice is being done, do not try to bury it by giving extended benefits by way of pension. If the man is a bad officer, then there is no reason why he should get a better pension than a good officer.  If the man is a rotten servant of the State, there is no defence for giving him better retiring conditions than a man who is an excellent and efficient servant of the State.  If no charge can be brought against an officer, if there are no adverse reports on which he can be judged, then I say that the action of the Minister is entirely unworthy, unjust and unfair.</P>
    <P>Army reorganisation and get rid of men just because you cannot fit them in! On what does the Minister base his opinion that the individual is inefficient or unworthy and should not be carried any longer in our Army? These individuals obtained acting ranks, meaning that, after years of service, the Army should know the quality of the individuals, their character, calibre and efficiency, in face of what the Minister regarded as an appalling military emergency.  Some of these individuals were given acting promotion, with greater responsibilities, so that the people and the Army would be relying on them more than they previously relied upon them.  There cannot be two heads on the coin the Minister tosses.  Either they were efficient officers and deserving officers when they were promoted to acting rank recently and have since &ldquo;dirtied their bibs&rdquo; or they are still efficient officers.  If an officer &ldquo;dirties his bib&rdquo;, the Minister and his staff have a code of regulations and these regulations must apply if discipline is to be maintained in the Army and if there is to be any respect for Army regulations. A man must be charged and tried.  He must be given an opportunity of defending himself and then take the consequences. <Col N="455" /> There is no middle course. This business of going to the Phoenix Park and looking for a person miles removed from the Army so as to hang your coat on that peg and make that individual the scapegoat is not the way to handle an army.  It is unfair to the individual in question and it is unfair to the people being dismissed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has explained the position with regard to the Army reserve. He says that, as already stated, there is to be a different type of reserve and that, so far as possible, officers and other ranks of the old reserve will be fitted into the new reserve.  May I ask the Minister if any of them are not being fitted in?</P>

      <P>Do you never find an inefficient man who digs with the right foot?  There was no inefficiency amongst the administrative officers who were political playboys before they got the appointments and are now going to get ten years' added service.  When it comes to efficiency, who is to be the judge?  Is it reasonable that, unheard, people, who do not get an opportunity to defend themselves, should be graded at a desk in Parkgate Street as inefficient? I believe that some sanctity still attaches to the law of contract, that there should still be left some respect for the honour of a contract and that that implies an honourable obligation on both sides to keep the contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="456" /> How did your Army reserve first arise?  It arose at a time when it was necessary, in the public interest, to reduce taxation as rapidly as possible, at a time when the Minister's colleagues were over here clamouring for a reduction of Army expenditure and of the strength of the Army.  A pledge had been given by the then President of the Executive Council that no further demobilisations or retirals from the Army would take place except for reasons specifically stated&mdash;misconduct or disciplinary offences.  At the same time, it was necessary to reduce the Army in order to reduce the cost and a reserve was built up.  The inducement given to officers and other ranks to leave the Army, in the public interest, was that they would get so much a year as reservists and one month's full pay every year when they reported for duty.  The officer, non-commissioned officer or soldier weighed up his position as any other man would. He said: &ldquo;If I remain in the Army, my pay will be so much; I have a life job; I have been guaranteed security as long as I conduct myself.  If I meet the requirements of Parliament and the Government and resign my job, I will get so much a day as a reservist and a month's pay every year I report for duty.  I will carry that annuity until I reach the age laid down in the regulations.&rdquo; Numbers of them decided to retire from the Army on those conditions. By a stroke of his pen, the Minister decides that he will break his side of the bargain, that he will deprive them of their position in the reserve, that he will strike a financial blow against them at the peak point of their expenditure, when they are in the fifties&mdash; touching up to the sixties&mdash;and when they can least afford to meet so serious a blow.</P>
    <P>Did he ever read the way these things are done elsewhere, in countries where there is a sense of decency and of fair play towards individuals? Has he not often read of forces being amalgamated, one with another, or disestablished, but that as regards individuals already there of their being allowed to finish out their period of service and to draw whatever little annuity was coming to them?  The Minister says inefficiency. <Col N="457" /> Is there not a rule or regulation in the Army that, when an individual is adversely reported upon as a result of inspection, he will get a copy of that adverse report, and will be asked to initial it before it will be put on record and used against him?  Is the Minister prepared to state in how many cases, where he has dispensed with men as being inefficient, such reports have been made and the regulations complied with by the reports being submitted to the individuals concerned?  In how many cases in which he has compulsorily retired individuals, has that procedure been followed?</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his opening statement, said quite bluntly that the Dáil has no right to the information we are seeking, and no right to the information sought in this Private Member's motion.  The Minister, like a number of his colleagues, seems to forget the fact that he is a servant of the Dáil, and that we are all servants of the people, and that whatever the State service is, whether it be the Army, the Civil Service or anything else, Parliament is entitled to know the reasons why any particular action is taken other than a purely administrative one.</P>
    <P>The third point is the matter of acting ranks.  Leaving out the present situation for the moment, there is no Army precedent that has been more abused in this Army than the precedent of acting ranks.  An acting rank, generally, is a rank given to an individual either while he is temporarily holding the position of a higher officer or while he is undergoing a period of probation.  Acting rank was never intended as a kind of military cat and mouse Act where, instead of doing the right thing in the right way, you add the word &ldquo;acting&rdquo; to the new rank and in ten, 15 or 20 years later you deprive an individual of it on the ground that it was only an acting rank: that you would have the right to deprive him of that higher rank without stating any reason.  Not only recently, but for years back, the most abused thing in our Army was the abuse of the position of acting rank.  Surely, when a man has been for four, five, six or ten years in a rank there should be enough competence in the Department of Defence to decide that he is <Col N="458" /> fit to hold it.  If he holds it for five, seven or ten years and is then deprived of it, surely that puts the brand of incompetence on the Department of Defence for having allowed him to hold it for so long, if he was unfit to hold it.  If he was a fit person to hold it, well then he should have been confirmed in the rank long ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>He should be confirmed after a couple of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Men have held acting rank for a great number of years.  The Minister gave figures to show the numbers in higher acting ranks who are being reduced to their substantive rank.  He merely explained that on the ground that in a peace-time army organisation, compared with war-time, it would not be possible to fit all these officers into positions carrying the actting rank.  Well, in the first place they were considered fit to carry the acting rank right through the emergency and in the critical years through which we have passed.  The Army, the Minister and the people had to have sufficient confidence in them to carry that higher rank with ability and efficiency during that period.  Now they are being reverted, and the Minister's case is that in the peace establishment there is not room to fit them in.  That might be a fair case, but I would ask the Minister how many temporary officers recruited only during the emergency as temporary officers have been fitted into this new establishment as permanent officers?  How many of those temporary officers have been confirmed in a higher acting rank?  Does he consider that he can have anything except seething unrest, criticism, discontent, disappointment and disillusionment when temporary men are taken in and jumped over the heads of regular officers with long service and of the greatest efficiency: that when the emergency is over men with long service and with no mark or record against them are reduced from the rank which they held for years, while temporary men are not only altered in their conditions of service so as to become permanent men but are made permanent officers at a higher rank than some of the unfortunates who have been forced to evacuate?  On analysis, I think that <Col N="459" /> broad justice is not the rule to-day in the Army.</P>
      <P>I think there is enough evidence of cliques controlling Army life, of favourites getting advancement and of people who are not favourites going down, some because of their political affiliations and others because of their social affiliations.  But there is the feeling right through the Army that fair play is not being administered all round, and that there is not the same Army law for all irrespective of affiliations and irrespective of associations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As everybody knows, I speak on this matter purely as a civilian. I am not sure that in matters of this kind a civilian is not in a better position to take a somewhat detached view.  I confess that when I read first of the decision of the Government to invite a number of officers to retire, with notice that if they did not accept the invitation they would be compulsorily retired, my mind went back to an experience I had shortly after I went to America to learn my business. I was first apprenticed to a large department store which had recently hired a very expensive new manager. The atmosphere still obtained in that establishment when I got there which had been created by his first executive act.  He summoned the very large staff together and he invited those who had been more than 20 years in the service of the firm to declare themselves, which they did in the confident anticipation that some special mark of appreciation was about to be conferred upon them. But the new broom informed them that they were all sacked; there was no room in this go-ahead organisation for old men or old women.  I think most decent people on hearing that story were disgusted.  They felt that someone who was brutal, short-sighted and vain was giving an admirable example of the reaction on swine when pearls are cast before them.  In a vain search for efficiency he was throwing away loyalty and devotion, intangible assets which he simply was not competent to appreciate at their true worth.  I think that man did a great wrong; he made a great mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know who is responsible for this departure in our Army, but I am <Col N="460" /> told that about 20 senior officers who have had service of over 20 years are being compulsorily retired.  When I heard that I asked myself two questions. I first asked myself, what is going to become of these men?  Opportunity in this country is pretty limited. Most of us have experience of one walk of life or another.  I put it to any Deputy that, suppose he found himself confronted with a man of about 50 years of age with pretty considerable family responsibilities and a pension quite inadequate to provide any reasonable abundance for that family, and he was asked to find employment for that man, where and to whom would he turn to get a berth into which that man would fit?  Remember that in Great Britain, a country with vast Colonial services and great industrial enterprises and 101 walks of life in which character and reputation for responsibility and solidity are material assets, it is comparatively easy for a man with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, colonel or major to walk out of the army after 21 years' service and find a position where the very qualities which his long service in the army have conferred upon him will help him to secure a post that a younger and possibly more energetic man would not suit so well.  But what posts of that character are to be found in this country? I ask Deputies, if they were confronted with the problem of placing such men in the kind of employment that these men could reasonably be expected to undertake at their time of life and in their position, what would they do?  The total number we have to deal with is about 20.  Deputy Davin seems to treat this matter as a joke.  I do not think it is a matter to joke about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not joking about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Brady and Deputy Davin are inclined to treat it as a joke.  I do not think it is a joke.  It is a horrible business, because I feel most deeply for men in that position.  I do not accept the proposition that the Army of this country will be utterly disorganised if we have to carry 20 men who are not in the full sense of modern army organisation highly efficient. If those men cannot be deemed <Col N="461" /> to be the most highly efficient officers is it not right that we should carry them by finding occupations with the organisation which could have been attended to by men of lesser rank, but which, in the special circumstances, it was determined should be attended to by men of rank out of all proportion to the nature of the work which we had available for them?</P>
      <P>Remember the kind of men these are. Many of them are men who were with the Army since its institution.  It is very probably true that the training they got is not the kind of training which would fit men to be the most highly efficient type of officer in a modern mechanised army.  But that was not the kind of training we wanted when they came to us.  When they entered the service of this State they had the qualities we wanted and they had qualities which this House would have been glad to pay any price they cared to name, because without these qualities this State would have perished.  Now they are to be told, not only within the discreet privacy of their own professional circle, but <i>coram populo,</i> that they are worn out and are no good and that they had better get out.  And that is because the executive authority of the Army tells us that 20 officers must be disposed of.</P>
      <P>I am looking at this thing from the point of view of a layman, not a professional man at all.  Nothing but the probability of serious and irreparable injury to the Army would, in my mind, justify the heartless indifference to the welfare of these men that this course of action unquestionably is.  I am not sure that anything that we do here now will repair the damage that has been done.  I cannot help feeling that these men have been offered an affront which they should never have been offered.  I want to remind the House that it is just as my American friend in a very different sphere discovered, that he had thrown away something infinitely precious in a vain search for an illusory efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So, in our Army if we treat men who have a long and honourable service in that way, I think we are throwing away something which I have good authority for saying is the most precious asset that an army can have.  Certain Deputies may have <Col N="462" /> recently read studies by Field Marshal Lord Montgomery, an Irishman, and I think generally admitted to be one of the most successful and resourceful commanders in the recent world war. When he became an instructor on the staff college at Quetta, those who listened to the first course of lectures which he there delivered, said that they could be boiled down to this: The most essential thing, the most fundamental thing and the most precious thing that an army can have is morale, morale, morale.  He said that morale derived from, and was built upon, the confidence of men in their commanders, and that that went for privates, sergeants, sergeant-majors, lieutenants, captains, majors, all the way up.</P>
    <P>What are the officers and men of our Army going to feel if they see before them the example of 20 of their colleagues, who have given the best part of their lives to the service of the Army, thrown out because that is what it is supposed to be, albeit with additions to their pensions and concessions, but none the less thrown out, because we think they are out of date? I put it to this House, are these the foundations upon which to build morale?  Is this the way to persuade men in that Army to believe that those who are responsible for them will defend their legitimate interests before all-comers, that they can give their commanders and superiors that unquestioned loyalty and full confidence which is in fact the foundation of what Field Marshal Lord Montgomery has described as the only thing that really matters when building up an army, morale?</P>
    <P>There are members of the Minister's Party who are out of date.  There are members of the Minister's Party, who, I am sure, are a considerable embarrassment to the leaders of the Party from time to time.  How long would the Party last, if those who had spent most of their lives in its service, grown old in its service, made very substantial sacrifices in its service were told: &ldquo;Because you have got old, you are out of it.  Get out, we will give you a small job or a sinecure that will keep you from starvation, but you are no good any more.  Get out&rdquo;?  I think <Col N="463" /> honourable men would reply: &ldquo;We do not want your sinecure; all we wanted and believed we were entitled to, was to be allowed to judge for ourselves what was the appropriate time to get out and not to accept from those with whom we soldiered the public affront of being told that we were worn out and no good any more.&rdquo; Is there any Party in this House which would say to its oldest veterans: &ldquo;Get out, you are no good any more&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I do not think they dare do it.  Why then should we do it to men who have served in the very special circumstances in which these men have served?  It is so silly to do it.  We are throwing away something fundamentally precious&mdash;morale&mdash;in a futile attempt to make a gesture of efficiency when, in fact, efficiency might have been secured and morale preserved intact by a more human approach to this problem and by the employment of these men, for the comparatively short time that remained of their ordinary service, in routine duties about which there need never have been any special inquiry.  Should there happen to be a special inquiry, their long and valued service would have provided ample explanation. For what might have appeared to be an incongruous arrangement a full explanation would be forthcoming. Is there anything wrong or impracticable or anything silly in advocating that we should deal with the servants of our people as human beings, not as ciphers, to be pushed about and affronted at our sweet will? I do not think there is.  I think we make a great mistake if we fall into the error of believing that those who served the people should be treated in an entirely different spirit from that in which any of us would dream of treating those who serve ourselves or the organisations for which we are responsible.</P>
    <P>If, however, this most regrettable course has to be pursued I think those officers&mdash;I speak now of the men with long service&mdash;are entitled to expect of the Army that if they retire now, or are retired, they will be treated as men who have served their full term, and who will receive pensions on that basis <Col N="464" /> and that, in so far as in our power lies, they will be put in a position in which they can carry on, even though they fail to find suitable employment with which to supplement the pension to which they become entitled under the existing regulations.  In that connection, it is relevant to observe that these pensions are based on many of the assumptions that held good in 1922 and 1923, but in the post-war world in which we find ourselves we must recognise that such pensions to-day are a far less generous provision for these men than they would have been when they were first worked out 20 or 25 years ago.</P>
    <P>I think it is a mistake to overstate this case, because I believe that every responsible man and officer in the Army recognises that, after the emergency expansion which took place, the post-war contraction was inevitable, and that did mean inevitably the surrender of certain acting ranks and did mean, I think, inevitably, that certain non-commissioned ranks would inevitably have to step down one or two grades.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it does not seem possible to me to have the same number of officers and non-commissioned officers in an army of 6,000 or 7,000 men which you had in an army of 40,000 men.  Is that not a reasonable assumption? So it seems to me, and I think most reasonable men would take that view.  All these men are in this position, that the fact that they step down a grade involves no reflection whatever on their efficiency or their usefulness to the Army.  It is merely the inevitable consequence of the ordinary and expected contraction of the Army's size.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their case is far different from the non-commissioned officers and commissioned officers who are being pushed out as being worn out and of no use. The affront we offer to these men humiliates me.  I should be dreadfully ashamed to meet them.  When I think of the flowery language we employed, when I think of the generous promises we made and when I think of us going around the country protesting our unalterable resolution that those who manned the Army, who organised it and built it up, would be forever our creditors and that nothing would be <Col N="465" /> too good for them when the crisis had passed, I declare that, if I had to meet these officers, I would be ashamed to look them in the eye.  Hurt as many of them may be, it should be some consolation to them to know that if there are people who should feel humiliated, if there are any people who should hang their heads in connection with this business, it is those who have offered them this gratuitous insult and not they who have to accept it, because, whatever may be said about them&mdash;that they are inefficient or worn out or no good&mdash;they know that all of us in this House know, whether we admit it or not, that there was a time when they were the best this country could hope to get, the best this country could hope to have, and that there were few people who are not grateful to the Providence of God Who provided them for our protection and for the protection of the nation as well.</P>
    <P>My reaction to this situation is to attempt the impossible, that is, to communicate to these men the deep sense of humiliation which many of us in this House feel that we have ever lived to witness the offering of such an affront in public to them, and, to attempt the impossible again, to seek to communicate to them that this treatment is in no sense a reflection of what this House feels and that those who truly understand the nature of the work they have done, and still could do, would be ashamed to face them at this time, and only hope that faithful servants may forgive those who make so poor a return for duty honourably done.</P>
    <P>Now, I turn to the bland announcement that we are to have a standing Army of 12,000 men which is to cost us £4,500,000 per annum in order to provide that hereafter, alone, we are capable of undertaking the defence of the national territory.  Is that not manifestly hot air and ballyhoo&mdash;hot air and ballyhoo which is to cost us £4,500,000 per annum at a time when we cannot provide the kind of social services which the majority of the members of the House think ought to be provided on the ground that we have not enough money to provide them?  Is there any Deputy who believes that an Army of 12,000 men will maintain the <Col N="466" /> defence of the national territory unaided against all comers in the years that lie ahead?</P>

      <P>I can never place the Deputy.  He is from some part of Cork in any case, and I do not blame the poor man for thumping his tub down there, waving his hand and asking: &ldquo;Where were you in 1916?&rdquo; and: &ldquo;What did one want then but a tenfoot pike to stand by Cathleen Ní Houlihan in her hour of need?&rdquo; That is grand, and more power to the Deputy who does it, and gets his £480 a year for it.  That is not too expensive.  But, <Col N="467" /> when it comes to £4,500,000, then I think it is time the hot air was turned off.  £480 a year is plenty for hot air but £4,500,000 is a little too expensive, and it is to no useful end.  But, suppose we succeed in gathering these 12,000 able-bodied men to engage exclusively in army activity.  Do Deputies realise the situation in which we find ourselves at the present time?  There is in Great Britain at the present time an acute shortage of man-power.  At this present moment thousands, and tens of thousands, of the best young men and women in this country are being swept out of the country into Great Britain.  You cannot get men to work on the land or to do any work. They are not to be had.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If we take 12,000 men out of an already seriously attenuated labour force and anticipate the occupation of such a number in the Army for years, instead of being a contributing factor to the national wealth, constituting themselves into an annual charge of £4,500,000 on the public purse, I say that that is doing something which is a material contribution to the destruction of the country, that it is going to cripple the country.  At least half of those 12,000 ought to be employed at work which would increase the national wealth and build up the country instead of being engaged for 22 years in the regular Army on manoeuvres and army work of a character which, should the impact of war ever come upon us, will have no value whatever.  What we are obviously going to do with an army of that character is that we will start preparing to the best of our ability to fight the last war, carefully averting our eyes <Col N="468" /> from the prospect of the next war because we know perfectly well that we have neither the equipment nor the resources nor the means of taking any active part in any kind of war that is likely to be fought in the generations that lie ahead.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My argument is that for defence&mdash;for defence&mdash;the maintenance of large permanent armies by small countries is the purest nonsense.  That is not to say that we should not have any army at all but it is a very strong argument, in my submission, for making up our minds as to what kind of army we are going to have and what its dimensions should be.  I have no hesitation in going further than the Minister for Defence would seem prepared to go.  He said: &ldquo;I have declared the Government's policy twice before and I am not going to repeat it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I put it again to the Minister that our object should be to have a small body of highly trained men, a guards battalion or a guards division&mdash;to speak in terms of British army usage&mdash;that is to say, a body of soldiers with the highest standard of training, discipline and morale, that we can evolve and, side by side with that, an air force trained in the latest types of fighter aircraft, albeit we know we cannot maintain the quantity of aircraft which an effective air force would have to use in time of war, but assuming that, if there is a war, we will not find ourselves alone confronting one of the great powers of the world but will find ourselves allied to some group of powers resisting some attempt at aggression which in our judgment is unjustified and that, in that situation, the highly trained personnel of our air force would have placed at its disposal by one of the powers allied to us the aircraft with which to use their acquired skill in the defence of this country and such other things as common cause might call upon them to defend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is practical politics.  I know perfectly well that there is no Deputy in the Fianna Fáil Party who does not know in his heart and soul that in any future war if we are allied to Great <Col N="470" /> Britain and the United States of America we will come out of the war virtually unscathed and that, if we are not, we will be blown clean out of the ocean.  That is the plain fact.  Of course, nobody will admit it.  It would be political madness, in this country, to admit that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said we got out of it by the goodwill of two men&mdash;the late President Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill.  I will not go beyond him for that and, if Deputy McCarthy wishes to do so, he can slip out now behind the Speaker's chair and ask him if he said that, and I am sure the Taoiseach will spend an hour and three-quarters explaining to him that, although he did say it, it had a subtle meaning and only a true child of Cathleen Ní Houlihan could understand its true meaning.  But if Roosevelt's and Churchill's grandchildren do not come up to scratch in the next war, we will be blown out of the Atlantic Ocean.  I have not the slightest doubt they will come up to scratch.  America is our friend, and although at the moment they are telling us to eat yellow meal, I believe they will come round in the end.  The old friend is the best friend and temporary misunderstandings will be overcome, and when the time comes we may look to her confidently for alliance and help. I believe that in any cause in which she is concerned we will find ourselves concerned as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it is unpopular and politically imprudent to say that, in the future, it is highly likely that any cause on behalf of which the people of England are embattled will be a cause that commends itself to us.  Now, I know the people of England sentenced my grandfather to death, I know the people of England put my father in jail and I know the people of England did a lot of things in this country which it would be a great deal better if they had not done.  I know the British people are capable of doing very savage things and I know our own people <Col N="471" /> are capable of doing very savage things: but I am not talking of the centuries gone past.

      <P>And the centuries, too. I am thinking of the fate that awaits our children and our children's children, and I envisage that, in any case hereafter where these two great nations are embattled, this country will find itself more in sympathy with them than with whatever antagonism confronts them.  If that is so, then, if this nation conceives it to be its duty to take an active part and help Great Britain and the United States of America, it is from Great Britain and America we will get the equipment wherewith our people will repel that attack&mdash;because we cannot get it from our own resources, and we never will.</P>
      <P>The object, then, in the event of such a situation arising where it became our duty to take our part in preventing an attack being made directly upon our territory, should be to have men here competent to use the weapons necessary effectively to resist that attack&mdash; and the only such weapons, as I can see it, would be aircraft of a character designed to keep bombers at bay.</P>

It is for those who come after us that I believe our present sense of citizenry must be principally exercised. I think it is reasonable to take the limited precaution which I have indicated, but to go beyond that is to waste our manpower at a very important stage, to undertake financial burdens which are going very seriously to embarrass this country in the years that lie ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I beg of this House to remember that, unless we can make this country <Col N="472" /> a fairly attractive one, the vacuum for labour developing in Great Britain will draw two-thirds of our population away, at higher wages, better conditions and greater opportunities.  If we are further going to embarrass our ability to build this country up and offer those who stay in it material attractions not measurably comparable with what will be pressed upon them from Great Britain, we will see this country denuded of population and in much the same position as a State like Australia finds herself to-day, clamouring for people, for foreigners to come in and inhabit it, and quite unable to find anyone willing to accept the invitation. Mind you, it would be a queer fate for Ireland if her people turned their backs on this country and moved over <i>en masse</i> to Great Britain&mdash;and something like that has been happening for the last three or four years.</P>

      <P>Yes, Sir.  If you are going to place upon this country a burden of £4,500,000 a year, an obligation to maintain 12,000 of the best men in the country in wholly unproductive work, I think you are going to place the whole future of the country in very serious peril.  When we recognise that that is all done for no other purpose than to promote the kind of hot air Deputy MacCarthy is shooting off his mouth, I want to suggest to this House that it is too dear at £4,500,000 a year, that £480 is quite enough for that.  It is a grave injury to the country and a grave disservice to a young Army, with a high reputation, that they should be manceuvred into the position of becoming a burden on the community, when heretofore they had been its protector and its creditor, albeit the debt we owe them is being paid to some of their members in very strange coin to-day.</P>

      <P>It is not too easy to bring ourselves back from the distant and somewhat uncertain future in which we have been dealing for the past half-hour and come down from the high heaven in which Deputy McCarthy and Deputy Dillon have been represented as sitting with white wings, to deal with the prices of commodities in use by the common people.  I was saying last week, when this debate was adjourned, that I did not consider the Motion before the House as being a wise and appropriate step towards the solution of the difficulty of high prices. I was saying that I regarded the amendment as a more prudent suggestion and one that might be capable of giving good results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and <Col N="474" /> Commerce spent a considerable length of time last week in trying to convince us that there had been no profiteering during the emergency.  He made ample and adequate use of all the statistics upon which he could lay his hands.  No matter how many figures a Minister may quote and no matter what complicated statistics he may lay before the people, he can never convince the ordinary man in the street that there has not been a considerable amount of exploitation and profiteering.  No ordinary citizen of this city or of the country but has personal experience of either being exploited and robbed himself or of being a witness to other people being exploited and robbed.  Much was said here about the high cost of living. I do not think that any Deputy mentioned the high cost of dying, but a case came to my notice some time ago of a small farmer who was stricken with a fatal illness.  His wife, being a prudent woman, went to town, while he was still dangerously ill, to purchase the last garment in which to clothe him for the grave.  Having selected a habit which was considered suitable, the price was much higher than she had anticipated and she was forced to defer the purchase for about six weeks.</P>
    <P>When her husband died, she returned to the same shop and found exactly the same habit for sale.  She had taken careful note of it and she found that, while the same garment was there, the price was 100 per cent. higher than when she attempted to purchase it six weeks before.  No amount of reasoning or of argument and no figures or statistics could convince that woman that she was not being robbed and exploited.  I do not wish to condemn the shopkeeper in that case.  He might say that, though he had this article in stock, he was justified in raising the price in proportion to the general increase in prices.  He might reason that, if there were a collapse in prices later, he might have to mark down the price of some of his stuff. Even Deputy Dillon, who professes to know everything about the distributive business and who, I am sure, does know a good deal, more or less admitted <Col N="475" /> that there was profiteering when he said that competition is the only way to prevent profiteering.  We know that competition, has, to a great extent, been suspended during the past six or seven years.  Regardless of what the Minister may say, there is widespread profiteering.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that the Minister and Deputies Norton and Larkin were justified in trying to drag the farmer into the dock and make him appear as one of the principal culprits in regard to the increase in general prices.  It is true that agricultural prices have increased since the beginning of the war.  It is true that, as compared with prices in 1938, they have increased somewhat more than the official cost-of-living figure.  But it must be remembered, that in 1938, the balance between the cost of living and agricultural prices was not fair to the farmer.  The cost of living figure in 1938 stood at 173 as compared with 100 in 1914. Agricultural prices, taken at 100 in 1914, stood at 183 in 1934 and had declined slowly to 111 in 1938.  That is to say, agricultural prices were 62 points below the cost of living figure in 1938.  If that disparity between agricultural prices and the cost-of-living figure has been partially rectified since 1938, the farmer is not to be blamed or condemned. I say that the disparity between farming prices and the cost of living, generally, has not been completely rectified.  We know that the basic year for fixing agricultural prices was shifted from 1914 to 1938, while the basic year for the cost-of-living index remains at 1914.  I have made some calculations and I have put the two figures on a par.  I find that agricultural prices stand to-day at 220 as compared with the figure for 1914.  That is an increase of 120 since 1914.</P>
    <P>The cost-of-living figure, however, stands to-day at 295, as compared with the figure for 1914.  That is an increase of 195.  Therefore, we find that the cost of living is still substantially above the agricultural prices.  That is borne out also by the fact that the cost-of-living figure, based on food items only, is very considerably below the cost-of-living figure, based <Col N="476" /> on all items.  It is in the price of necessary goods other than agricultural products that the real increase has taken place.  I am not going to put any class or section of the community in the dock in regard to that increase.  Anybody with a spark of intelligence must realise that there was a very substantial increase in the price of manufactured goods which had to be imported.  There was a very considerable increase, in fact an enormous increase, in the price of the raw materials required both for agriculture and industry, but what was a much more important contributory factor in the increase in prices was the inability to secure certain essential raw materials for agriculture and industry.</P>
    <P>Some of the things which contributed very much to an increase in prices were not the things that could be purchased at a high price but the things that could not be purchased at any price, and for which substitutes had to be provided in a very expensive way. There are many such products in industry, and one outstanding essential commodity of that kind in agriculture &mdash;artificial fertilisers.  The farmer could not obtain these in sufficient quantity at any price.  That added enormously to his costs of production by reducing the output of his land.</P>
    <P>These were factors which could not have been overcome or avoided, but a factor which could have been overcome, and which should have been avoided, was the factor of profiteering.  The proposals in the motion before the House suggest a very simple manner for dealing with profiteering.  That is to put the entire community into a strait-jacket and regiment and regulate the entire community, and regulate and regiment all prices.  I do not consider such a method possible of success.  I do not think that, even if we had a totalitarian State here in which everybody would be controlled and regulated, that conditions would be perfect. As long as human beings inherit the weaknesses and the vices which are common to humanity, there will always be exploitation and a certain measure of profiteering, and I am sure that in the most rigidly controlled totalitarian States there is profiteering, not profiteering <Col N="477" /> perhaps in the matter of prices, but that you have selfish sergeant majors and higher officers in such States who manage to appropriate for themselves most of the good things of life.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by some Deputies that there should be a rigid Standstill Order in regard to prices while no similar control would be exercised in regard to wages.  I do not think that such an approach to the problem would get us anywhere.  Wages and prices mean exactly the same thing.  Wages represent the price which the worker obtains for his work, and prices are the wages which the manufacturer, the trader and the farmer get for their work&mdash;and for their industrial enterprise.</P>
    <P>If you are going to have a Standstill Order in regard to one you must have it in regard to all.  I think there are wiser and more prudent ways of approaching this problem than by rigid and complete control.  Profiteering, as I have said, is due to the fact that keen competition is not able to operate as freely as when goods are in plentiful supply.  Shortages tempt certain people to take advantage of the rest of the community, and as far as it is possible for the State to prevent that it should be done, but no action should be taken which would completely disorganise production and distribution.</P>
    <P>The Minister, as it is natural for Minister, was very keen in seeking suggestions.  I am going to submit a few to him which, if adopted, might help to protect and safeguard the interests of the people until supplies of goods again become normal.  I am going to support, first of all, the request made in the amendment for a public inquiry into all matters relating to trade and distribution.  I think that a public inquiry would help inasmuch as it would bring to the knowledge of the common people facts which they are anxious to know, facts regarding the supplies available, the prices at which they can be obtained wholesale, and the prices charged for them in different parts of the country.  Facts of that kind are available, and the more knowledge the public have of them&mdash;the <Col N="478" /> more light is thrown on the operations of those who seek to exploit the public &mdash;the better it will be for those who want to have these matters remedied.</P>
    <P>My second suggestion is that there ought to be close co-operation between the people, the Press and the Government in directing and pressing forward a publicity campaign against foolish spending.  There is nothing that would be more helpful in the matter of bringing down prices than if the people could be induced to refrain from buying, wherever possible.  During the past week there has been in the Press a strong public campaign against the high cost of living and in favour of some action to relieve the situation.  I think it is regrettable that side by side with that campaign in the Press we have appeals, inducements and incitements in the advertising columns of the Press to the people who buy this, that and the other thing.  The woman who reads the articles pointing out the extent to which profiteering has developed, as well as letters in the newspapers from &ldquo;Hard-pressed Housewife" and other such people, may be deeply impressed and may make a strong resolution to avoid buying, wherever possible, until prices come down.  But immediately she turns to the advertising columns and sees that a delightful frock or an exciting hat or a glamorous new shade of lipstick is to be had all her good resolutions evaporate. I am prepared to bet at least 5/- that no newspaper will publish that suggestion, that newspapers should refrain from publishing advertisements urging people to buy things which they could do without, but I think such praiseworthy action on the part of the Press would give a lead to the people and would, I think, be helpful.</P>
    <P>I am in favour, although it may not be a popular thing to say, of certain essential foodstuffs being subsidised in order that the poor may be able to obtain them at a reasonable price.  It is sound policy to give certain essential things to the poor, such as foodstuffs and boots, which are so necessary to health, at less than the cost of production, where that is possible, just as it is often good policy to tax whiskey and luxuries and give them to <Col N="479" /> certain classes of the public at more than the cost of production.  That is a policy which is sometimes described as feeding the dog on his own tail.  I do not so describe it.  I think it is more a policy of helping those in real need, partly at the expense of those who have money to spend on luxuries.</P>
    <P>I have a suggestion to make which is more or less in the nature of an experiment. It has often occurred to me, having regard to the limited facilities which many working people in the cities and towns have for cooking vegetables or porridge and food of that kind that requires a good deal of cooking, if it would not be possible for some non-profit-making organisation to undertake the cooking of such commodities. That idea was suggested to me by a citizen of Dublin and it is a sound one.  I believe it would be helpful and would relieve the poorer elements of the community in the matter of cooking essential food.</P>
    <P>When the House last adjourned I was urging the Minister to relieve the fuel situation by organising an extensive drive for the production of firewood until turf again becomes available, which may not be for six or seven months.  A move of that kind would be helpful in meeting the basic needs of working people generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I think all Deputies recognise that the Government's attempt to control prices has failed.  The Minister attempted a justification of Dublin butchers receiving an increase in the price of meat on the ground that they have to pay 72/- per cwt. for prime cattle.  He forgot to inform the House of the number of butchers in provincial towns up to 100 miles from Dublin who pay farmers 72/- per cwt. for prime cattle and we have provincial butchers often charging more for their meat than what is charged by the Dublin butchers, although they pay only half wages and half rates compared to city dwellers.  Dublin in that respect is the guide for the rest of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Potatoes are controlled at 1/8 a stone in Dublin.  When you controlled the price for Dublin, why had you not provincial areas in mind, and why did you <Col N="480" /> not regulate the prices for provincial areas?  Potatoes were being sold at 1/- a stone not 50 miles from the Dublin market, but immediately you controlled the price here, the country price went up to the same level and now people are paying 1/8 a stone for potatoes not 500 yards away from where they are grown.  The same price prevails in the country districts, where wages and rates are not up to city levels.  The Minister may argue that the agricultural wage has increased by 84 per cent. In such circumstances as I have described, how can you expect the poorly paid worker in a rural area, on the bog, under the county council or engaged in forestry, to exist?</P>
    <P>I will instance for the Minister the cost of keeping patients in Grangegorman Mental Hospital, one of the best managed institutions in Ireland. In 1938 the cost per patient for food, not including attendance by nurses and doctors, was £11 8s. 7d. per year. In the year 1945-46 it had risen to £21 6s. 5d.  In that institution the food is not purchased from small shopkeepers, but is obtained, through contracts, in bulk and all middlemen's profits are eliminated.  Notwithstanding that, the cost of food has doubled in a few years.  The worker in the rural areas is expected to purchase the necessaries of life although his wages have been increased by only 84 per cent., according to the Minister's figures.  How can he exist when he has to purchase in small quantities and compete against highly-paid workers?</P>
    <P>Something should be done to control prices more effectively.  I am not attacking Irish manufacturers, but I suggest some of them are taking advantage of the situation.  I fully realise the serious position we would have been in if we had not produced certain commodities here during the war.  We may not be able to control the price of what is imported.  I am disappointed, knowing the good officials we have in the Minister's Department, that they are so easily deceived by arguments put up by the manufacturers.  The Minister referred to the boot trade.  A shopkeeper showed me a pair of boots suitable for <Col N="481" /> a child of six years.  The wholesale price was 19/6 and the retailer was allowed to charge £1 for the boots. He told me there would be 2/- worth of leather in the boots, the heels and uppers, but the rest was composed of hard-pressed paper.  When the Minister allowed the manufacturers a certain profit they declared that they would supply the best of leather, but apart from the uppers and heels, the boots are composed of compressed paper.</P>
    <P>What is the position in the rural areas now?  A man may be earning £2 or £2 10s. 0d. a week.  He has to buy sufficient food for his family. How can he buy clothes and boots for his children?  He has to pay £1 for boots for one child and, according to the retailer, the leather in the boots is worth 2/-.  This shoemaker also informed me that, although the Minister has controlled the price of leather at 3/- per lb., that is leather sold by manufacturers here in Dublin, if a poor man goes in to purchase a few ounces or ½ lb. of leather to sole the boots of his children, he is charged at the rate of 4d. per ounce.  Excess profits are, therefore, extracted from the poor person who can ill afford to pay that price.</P>
    <P>No matter what the Minister may have done to control prices these traders are getting around his Orders. I think it would be better to have an arrangement such as existed in 1920 under which there were voluntary committees in each area, the members of which knew local circumstances. They allowed certain profits after taking into consideration rates and expenses in each area.  At present one sees the same article marked at different prices in different shops.  In the case of clothing, one will see a suit marked at £20 in certain streets, presumably to meet the requirements of English visitors, while the same suit is sold at a lower figure in other streets.  Yet the same wage is being paid to the workers who make these suits in the various streets and the fact that a suit is sold in a particular street should have no influence on the price.  During the last month we saw <Col N="482" /> a number of sales here in Dublin at which articles were sold at less than half the controlled price.  I am sure the drapers of Dublin were not giving away these articles or that they were not working at a loss for the benefit of the Government or the public.  If they were not selling them at a loss, they must have been making huge profits up to the time of the sales.  We are told that wages have increased and that they are responsible for the increased cost of various commodities, but the fact is that the highest increases that have been given are not sufficient to overtake the increase in the cost of living.  The Government will have to take the matter more seriously than it has done up to the present because no matter what increases are given in wages, if the Minister is not able to control profits, certain individuals can charge what they like so that there is absolutely no use in workers getting increases in wages.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point that the Standstill Order in regard to wages had been removed but that has not happened in regard to wages paid by public bodies.  Although the Minister gave an assurance that the Minister for Local Government would consider sympathetically claims for increases by road workers and men in pensionable jobs, I am aware of a number of cases in which public boards unanimously passed resolutions requesting the Local Government Department to sanction increases of wages to enable these workers to meet the cost of living, but no action has been taken in the Department and apparently no action will be taken until the men go out on strike to enforce their claims.  Again we see the unfortunate old age pensioners to whom increases were promised and to whom no increases have yet been granted.  When one sees the figures showing the increased cost of maintaining patients in institutions, one must wonder how these unfortunate pensioners are able to exist.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan made some reference to some people here advocating a totalitarian State but I do not think anybody in the House suggested that <Col N="483" /> method of dealing with the situation. We have merely suggested that the Government should take immediate action to inquire into the methods whereby huge profits have been earned in certain trades.  I am sure no Deputy objects to any manufacturer obtaining a fair profit on any of his products; what we do object to is the method by which different prices are charged in different shops for the same article. I do not want to delay the House unduly but I should like to point out to the Minister that his method of control has failed, particularly in regard to rural areas, and that when he was regulating the price of commodities in Dublin, he was merely giving encouragement to the man living 100 miles from Dublin to increase his prices.  I am well aware that the farmers in County Wicklow are not receiving prices for their cattle which the Minister suggested were being paid for prime cattle here in Dublin where purchasers have to meet the competition of foreign buyers.  I would ask the Minister to make some arrangement whereby there might be a differentiation in prices outside the City of Dublin.  There is a completely different set of circumstances in the country to those obtaining in Dublin, where high wages are paid and where plenty of foreigners are coming in, well supplied with money which they are anxious to get rid of.  The unfortunate worker of a local body down the country has to compete with the purchasing power of these people in the cities.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that the middle classes, men who are trying to live on salaries that have not been increased to any great extent, are also seriously hit by the constant increases in the cost of living.  The facts and figures that the Minister or anyone else may produce will not change the opinion of the person who has only a few pounds to draw upon to meet the huge increase in the cost of living.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the position not alone from the point of view of the cities but also from the point of view of provincial towns and rural areas so as to ensure that, when regulating profits in future, he will consider especially rural areas where the rate <Col N="484" /> of wages is much lower than in Dublin. When considering profits in these areas he should also remember that employers there have not to pay the same rates or taxes as those in the city and that considerations which apply to manufacturers in Dublin are not applicable to manufacturers throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the first thing to recognise in this situation is that certain factors are outside our control and that in so far as these factors influence the cost of articles required here, we cannot do anything about them.  The price of certain commodities which we have to import or are importing, have gone up and may go up much further, but these prices are governed by conditions over which we have no control.  Nobody will find fault with the Government on that head.  In connection with the sphere of activity, however, over which the Government has control, I think the House and the country are entitled to a better explanation and a better outlook for the future than that presented by the Minister last week.  I think it should be recognised that our first duty here is to provide for those sections of the community who cannot, or who are least able by reason of their small incomes, to make adequate provision for their essential requirements.</P>
      <P>We have to remember that the general increase in the price of commodities has resulted in these commodities being placed outside the purchasing power of the ordinary citizen in many cases.  The particular classes I refer to are those depending on old age pensions and on relief, and, above those, the class whose wages are controlled, whose wages, subject to certain increases during the emergency or since the lifting of the Standstill Order, have been controlled or who have been in some occupation where they received no increase.  These people find themselves faced with an ever-rising burden in respect of essentials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first matter we should consider is food, and while the Minister has quoted extensively to show that the cost of certain commodities, including <Col N="485" /> clothing, has risen I think we should inquire carefully into the situation which has developed in connection with meat and the situation which is likely to develop in connection with bread and flour.  Since the Minister spoke last week, people have come to me and have informed me that meat in Dublin has gone up in the past two weeks by as much as 2d. per lb. and that this increase does not relate merely to the choicest cuts, legs of lamb or ribs of beef, but is being imposed by many butchers on all qualities of meat sold. It is recognised that these butchers have had to meet an increase in wages recently, and, in addition, have been obliged to pay an increased price for fat cattle in the Dublin market.  These two factors have, without any exorbitant profits being made, forced butchers to put up the price of meat, but when that situation has arisen and has brought about such a rapid increase, we have to inquire how long increases in wages which mean an increase in prices can be permitted.</P>
    <P>I listened with great interest to Labour Deputies who spoke and I think they recognise fully that any increase in wages which means an increase in the price of an article is practically useless.  The bulk of the workers in this city and in the country realise that wage increases which result in increasing the price of the article they produce or manufacture, if it does not directly affect them by bringing about an immediate rise in the cost of living, will in a short time do so.  I think that workers realise fully the situation which has developed, but whether that situation is appreciated to the same extent by employers is not quite clear.  I think that many employers, the moment there is any claim for an increase in wages, say they have to increase their prices.  All during the emergency, the control kept on wages, apart from the comparatively mild amounts granted under Bonus Orders, was by and large far more severe than any control in respect of the margin of profit allowed to manufacturers, with the result that in most industries there was a margin, when the wages standstill Order was lifted last September, which in a number of <Col N="486" /> cases would have permitted an increased wage to be paid without a resultant increase in the price of the article.</P>
    <P>So far as that is concerned, the first thing to inquire into is whether increases in wages are going to result in an increase in the price of the commodity manufactured, sold or handled. The first people in the House to recognise the effects of that situation are the representatives of the trade unions.  The Minister is inclined to think that, relatively, increases in wages should not mean a similar increase in price.  Meat may be a bad example, but certainly the increase in wages, coupled with the increase in the price of cattle and sheep&mdash;particularly cattle&mdash;has resulted in a substantial increase.  Turning to flour, one notes that the increase proposed to be paid to bakers will mean, according to the Minister's figures, an increase of not less than 2d. per loaf.</P>
    <P>Faced with that situation, the first thing the Government and the Dáil should do is to inquire into all State expenditure, which could either be reduced or eliminated.  Taking the figures in the Finance Accounts for 1938-39, and the figures for last year, I find that the deadweight debt has gone up by £19,000,000.  That alone means that, in interest charges, a sum of £500,0000 or&mdash;adding interest and repayment charges &mdash; approximately £1,000,000 a year is necessary to pay off the charges.  On the basis of that figure, the House must realise&mdash;certainly many Deputies will realise&mdash;that public expenditure has risen by leaps and bounds.  Anyone who considers the increases in the prices of essential commodities or imported articles realises that, if these increases are due to factors outside our control or to the fact that better prices are being paid to farmers, there is nothing we can do about them.  There is no method of reducing the expenditure or limiting the burden which will fall, as a result, on the community, but when we see unessential expenditure getting preference and priority and when we see the energies of the Government and certain <Col N="487" /> Departments being directed in particular to what I describe as luxury expenditure, the first thing to do is to see how much of that luxury expenditure can be eliminated, or to what extent it can be reduced.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to tourists. Nobody objects to the tourists coming in, and in fact most people recognise that their influence on the position is not as great as it is sometimes said to be; but when we find the Tourist Board contemplating vast expenditure in the coming year&mdash;not merely expenditure to assist or to enable existing hoteliers or proprietors of guest houses to improve their facilities but large-scale expenditure on the acquisition of large premises which subsequently are to be run as hotels at prices which the average citizen cannot pay&mdash;one realises that here is one example of expenditure which should be limited.  Again, we should consider the proposal to continue expenditure on industrial alcohol &mdash;a project which was originally designed as a method of using up surplus potatoes&mdash;to provide an industry which is to seek raw materials elsewhere because sufficient potatoes are not available and which, having got the raw materials, having processed them and having produced the commodity it was established to produce, will sell that commodity at something like 3/6 per gallon.</P>
    <P>There are a number of minor examples of a similar kind in respect of which certain people may argue that only £5,000 or £6,000 is involved in one case and £10,000 in another.  I have in mind, particularly, the Institute of Advanced Studies.  In the position in which this country finds itself at the moment, we cannot permit ourselves to indulge in luxury expenditure.  We cannot permit ourselves to indulge in any form of unnecessary expenditure and the argument that any one of these items of expenditure is relatively small is, in my view, a dangerous argument, because it has arisen out of the tendency here during the emergency to regard high expenditure as necessary, to regard high expenditure on defence and other protective measures as essential, as expenditure we should not <Col N="488" /> avoid committing ourselves to.  But if we aggregate the cost of all these luxury services or institutions and add to them the cost of an increased Civil Service, an increase which is bound to take place with the establishment of two new Ministries and on top of that the cost of an army amounting to something like £4,500,000&mdash;an army which, having cost that amount, is, according to the Minister, to be badly equipped because he cannot say at the moment what equipment will be available&mdash;we see how not merely has the cost of essentials, the cost of subsidising meat or flour or turf in order to reduce the price in the cities, but the total cost of Government has steadily mounted over a number of years, that total cost being secured by increased expenditure, by borrowing or by some other method.  Then we see the situation in which we find ourselves.  There is a headless spiral of inflation in which wages rise and then the price of the commodity rises or, as happens most often, the price of the article rises first and wages are brought up so that they may bear some relation to the resultant increased cost of living.</P>
    <P>The cost of essentials and of luxuries and State expenditure in every branch and section have risen and, therefore, despite the cessation of the emergency in many quarters, this year we have a higher Budget and, as far as we can see, there will be a still higher burden to meet in future.  In that situation, the first thing to do is to cut out luxury expenditure.  On examination it will be found that the taxation which has been imposed for the purpose of luxury expenditure would be sufficient to subsidise meat or flour or any other essential foodstuff that would require to be subsidised. While in the normal way subsidisation is regarded as having a directly inflationary tendency, we have in this country, in comparison with the small amount devoted to subsidisation, mounted expenditure on all kinds and types of schemes directly or indirectly promoted or sponsored by the Government, all of which have increased the burden on the citizen.  Even the most ardent supporter of that type of expenditure would be prepared to admit that such expenditure could be reduced and <Col N="489" /> the money so saved, when aggregated, would be sufficient to subsidise both meat and bread and any other essential food stuff that it was found necessary to subsidise.</P>
    <P>It has been argued here that the public should co-operate and that, so far, public co-operation has not been what it might be.  That is a matter of opinion.  Some people consider that traders found guilty of breaches of licensing or rationing laws have not received adequate punishment.  It is a matter for this House to fix the penalty for breaches of its regulations and it is the duty of the district justice to inflict the punishment, but to suggest that the courts have not been doing their duty is in a way a reflection on the legislative penalties laid down here.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the public can co-operate by not paying higher prices, by refusing to pay if overcharged. Deputies should realise that the ordinary woman who comes from the suburbs to shop in town or who comes from one part of the city to another, has something more to do than to travel from one shop to another in search of commodities at a lower price.  Everyone knows that transport difficulties are sufficient burden on the housewife and shopper to prevent them from undertaking further journeys in search of low prices.  The first thing to do is to inquire into cases where overcharging is reported, to ensure that all cases of overcharging are brought to light and that proper and effective measures are taken forthwith, to have an inquiry instituted into black market operations. Chocolate has been mentioned as an article sold on the black market. Chocolate is not a very essential commodity but it is obvious that there is a ramp in chocolate.  You cannot come out of a football match, a race meeting or the pictures without being inundated with offers of good chocolate at a high price, but if you go to a regular sweet shop you will find supplies are sold out, not merely at the beginning of the month, but all the time.</P>
    <P>I think the public have co-operated <Col N="490" /> as well as they might be expected, in view of the difficulties under which they are labouring.  If the public are expected to co-operate they are entitled to co-operation from the Department and the general impression is that price control is not as effective as it should be.  It is generally recognised, I think, that manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers should have a fair profit and that the incentive to anyone in business is a profit, and that unless a person can make a profit he will not engage in the particular business.  But over and above a legitimate and fair profit, if the manufacturers are making a profit on essential articles of food or clothing, then it is the Department's responsibility to inquire into that matter and to see how these profits are made, to see how expenditure might be cut down and how the burden on the community can be reduced.</P>
    <P>I had occasion, in view of this debate, to inquire into the price of certain articles of clothing.  This may be a bad time of the year from the point of view of clothiers because there is generally a reduction in prices after Christmas. I found one article marked down from 39/10 to 29/6, another article marked down from 25/- to 22/6, and another from 2/4 to 1/9.  I give these as examples. If shopkeepers are able to reduce the prices, particularly as much as 10/-, then the responsibility is on the Government and the Department to inquire into the regulations and to inquire into the original fixed price.</P>
    <P>The Minister has suggested that this is a matter on which we should pool our wisdom.  Deputies have suggested that it is a national problem and that the entire wisdom of the Dáil should be concentrated on it.  I recognise that it is necessary in a matter of this kind that there should be a pooling of wisdom.  I will say that the Minister has an entirely different mind and mentality from many of his colleagues in bringing Bills before this House but generally if the Government can steam-roll a measure through, they steam-roll it, and if they are in a fix they ask for co-operation.  I submit that if co-operation is to be expected, the House should get co-operation from the Government <Col N="491" /> in fair weather as in foul.  If we get it in fair weather we will be prepared to give it to the Government in foul weather.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephHallide" hpid="Mr. Halliden Mr. Halliden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>The rising cost of living has become the most serious and significant factor in the social and economic life of this country.  The position demands that we should approach the matter with stern realism and deal with the difficulties in a factual way. During the past six years there were shortages of practically every commodity. That upset the national balance. There were shortages of food, fuel, clothing and so on.  In spite of that, we find that the volume of direct taxation has grown to an alarming extent. We have the position, therefore, of increased taxation coincident with a decline in production.  That cardinal fact is one of the most serious reflections that could be made upon the ability of the Government to control prices.  We are anxious to find out exactly where the profits come in.  It has been the custom in most industrial concerns to emphasise in their reports the small percentage of profits on each article sold.  The kernel of the problem lies in finding out how far the charges on the article go before a profit is returned.  There are some factors which are very serious in upsetting our position&mdash;wages, profits and hours of work.  The public is entitled to find out from the Minister in regard to industries and firms, particularly tariff industries, what the profits are and to what extent wages have gone up commensurate with the increased costs and increased production.  Rumours have it that bonuses are being issued and that many firms have floated their companies with very fictitious and unreal amounts of capital, that some of them are, as a matter of fact, dependent on goodwill and tariffs for their existence. The Minister should tell us to what extent that has influenced the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To reduce costs, the Minister must be prepared to adopt a bold plan, based on national requirements.  He told us the other day that there were two factors principally responsible for <Col N="492" /> the increased cost of living&mdash;the high cost of imports and the high prices paid to farmers for their products.  In fair play, the Minister should have mentioned that the cost of every article the farmer buys for the conduct of his business has gone up by over 200 per cent.  He should have told us why there is a shortage of milk and butter in Dublin and throughout the country. In fact, this evening in Leinster House the waitresses found it difficult to get sufficient milk for their purpose.  Why? Because the farmers feel they are not being properly paid for milk.  The Minister should have told us, too, that during the past year our export trade of cattle decreased by 100,000 as the farmers could not see their way to feed the calves, since it did not pay them. These factors influenced the cost of production very materially.</P>
    <P>When telling us of the contributing factors for the increased cost of living, the Minister should have gone into more detail and not exactly blame the high cost of production on the farm alone.  I would like to know if any undue profits have been made by certain tariff industries and, if so, to what amount.  Has capital been increased in certain companies by fictitious devices? Unless we find out all the factors which have led up to the increase in the cost of living, we are only on the surface of the matter.  If we want to find out the truth, we must examine every factor to the very hilt.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance should have been here to listen to the views of the speakers on this motion, but he was conspicuous by his absence.  It reminds me that we were told in school that Nero fiddled while Rome burned. In this crisis that is exactly what is happening.  We are waiting for some disaster to overtake us before we wake up and take serious notice of the hardships our people are undergoing, due to the little they are able to get for the £, especially in food and clothing. I appeal in all sincerity to the Minister to fix the prices of essential food and clothing, and not at present prices. I would not like prices to be pegged at the present figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should do what has been done in other countries.  Only this morning I had a letter from an Irishman in Paris who sent me some cuttings from the Paris papers.  One of the headings is: &ldquo;New moves in Blum's last week: his Cabinet plan to lower prices&rdquo;.  M. Blum has asked all people selling goods to reduce their prices by 5 per cent. and he has got a wonderful response to his appeal throughout the country to prevent inflation extending.  Instead of attacking those who have goods to sell here, if we made an appeal to them it might bring about good results.  The Minister for Public Health should be here to explain to us the effect it would have on people who have only £1 to spend.  There are some thousands in this country with only £1 to spend. Take the National Army man who has come out of the Army after 24 or 25 years' service.  He has got £54 a year &mdash;a little over £1 per week&mdash;for himself and his family.  With £54, he finds himself unable to get employment. He has just £2 a year over the amount which would entitle him to get work under any of the distress grants given by the Government.  While getting only a miserable allowance, he is <Col N="494" /> debarred from getting public work.  I suggest that the prices of food and clothing in this city&mdash;other Deputies have spoken for the country&mdash;have gone too high already.  Take the schoolboy of ten to 14 years of age. From the pair of shoe laces he wears to the cap on his head, there are greatly increased costs.  The shoe laces are four times the price they were in 1938&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall conclude very quickly.  I know that others are anxious to get in and, having suffered in that way myself on some occasions, I shall make my remarks short.  The cap of the schoolboy is five times the price it was in 1938.  His boots are three times the price they were then and, owing to the quality of the leather, they have only half the life which boots before the war had.  I implore the Minister to do something quickly in this matter.  Let him call the business people together and appeal to them.  If the appeal does not succeed, let him later take whatever steps he thinks necessary to see that those living on minimum wages will be supplied with their food requirements.  He promised me he would make a statement a few days ago when I asked him to introduce legislation to see that children would get subsidised clothing on the lines of the subsidised boots.  I am speaking of the children of the unemployed and of orphans and other members of families in receipt of small allowances. I join sincerely with the other members who put forward a very reasonable case to the Minister for urgent action.  It is unfair to the Minister that he should be sitting on the Front Bench with 11 or 12 of his colleagues absent.  They should be here to assure the House that everything possible will be done to see that inflation will not extend and that people will be able to buy at reasonable prices the necessaries of life.</P>

      <P>On this motion, we had again a very lengthy and analytical speech from the Minister.  We had a lengthy exposition of the elements which go to determine price-levels and we had a fairly lengthy review of price movements during the past six or seven years.  Totted up, the speech could be said to be comprehensive but I think it could be said to be something more. It was, probably, the bleakest speech the Minister has delivered since September, 1939.  When the Minister's speech is analysed, it simply amounts to this: that he believes the price-control methods of the past have been satisfactory, that we are extremely lucky to have those prices, that it is almost a privilege for us to pay them and that, so far as he is concerned, he can do nothing whatever to reduce prices from their present inordinately high level.  The thing that struck me was that, while the Minister has usually a very realistic approach to problems and is not ill-equipped with daring in dealing with realities, we saw none of the Minister's war-time resourcefulness manifested in the speech he delivered last Thursday.  The Minister, in fact, admitted that, so far as existing price levels were concerned, he was absolutely powerless to effect a reduction.  He went further and indicated to the House that folk have pretty well to steel themselves to meeting further increases in prices.  And this 18 months after the war in Europe has ended, when everybody had been expecting that the Government's powers would be utilised for the purpose of curbing the rapacity of profiteers as evidenced over the last six or seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most disturbing portion of the Minister's speech, so far as I was concerned, was that in which he almost took the field in justification of existing price levels.  That, with the knowledge which must be at his disposal of the enormous profits that must have been made by many manufacturers and distributors during the war years, he allowed himself to be jockeyed into that position, is more than I can understand from the present Minister.  It must be abundantly clear to himself and his Department that many folk, during the past six or seven years, have <Col N="496" /> got richer than they ever dreamed they would be, that they have made profits larger than they ever dreamed they would make and that they are to-day wealthier than they ever dreamed they would be.  In a situation such as that, in which wealth is now becoming almost arrogant in this city, we hear the Minister make a speech which, in effect, is a justification of existing high-price levels.  A striking aspect of this debate is that no member of the Government Party has thought fit to intervene to say publicly what I am sure members of that Party have been hearing their constituents say to them. Persons of all political complexions complain to me of high-price levels. Strong supporters of the Government ask if it is not possible for the Government to do something to force down existing price levels.  I am sure that what is being said to me is being said to members on the Government Benches.  I do not think that they can hope to do anything effective as regards price levels by remaining silent during an important debate of this kind.  The ordinary men and women in the cities and towns and in the countryside simply cannot pay present prices on their present rates of income.  Instead of being offered some hope of early deliverance from the economic plight in which they are thus placed, they get in this House a lengthy review of price-problems from the Minister, seasoned with the implication that, so far as the Minister can see, not only is there to be no fall in price levels but they have got to accustom themselves to the inevitability of further increases in prices.</P>
    <P>No matter what the Minister says, I want to tell him&mdash;I believe Deputies of his own Party could say the same thing to him, if they have not already said it at Party meetings&mdash;that the public believe they are being shamefully overcharged.  When you have that opinion so unanimously expressed by the public, the Minister ought to pause and inquire whether or not the foundations of his price policy are correct, whether the public, with the keen interest they must have in price levels, have not, in this matter, a more realistic approach to the problem than the Minister has.  One has only to take <Col N="497" /> up the papers to realise what has happened during the past six or seven years as far as commercial and industrial activities are concerned.  Shares which were worth only a few shillings in 1938 and 1939 are worth to-day 18/- and £1.  Shares which were worth close to £1 in 1938 are worth more than £1 10s. Od. to-day.  The cause of that is the profit which these companies are capable of earning with their enhanced turnover and the dividends they are able to pay.</P>
    <P>Many of these drapery firms before the war had shares which were value for 2/- each.  These shares to-day are value for close on £1, simply because during the war years these firms were able to make inordinately high profits. They were able to do that because of our faulty method of regulating prices. Not only have their shares gone up enormously in value, but they are still going up in value.  The investing public is still being told to buy these shares&mdash;that they are worth still more &mdash;because it is realised that on present price levels and with the ratio of profit allowed&mdash;a glimpse at the balance sheets of those companies during the past six or seven years shows what those profits were&mdash;an investment in them will yield a substantial return to the investor.</P>
    <P>I said to the Minister, in the course of my speech moving the motion, that in my opinion he ought to peg prices at their existing levels, not because these are reasonable levels&mdash;I think they are still extortionate levels&mdash;but that is a beginning, so far as a prices policy is concerned, he ought to say to all types of producers and distributors of goods or services, that they are not going to get more for their goods or services than they are getting now, and that these folk ought to be made pay whatever increases of wages have to be met out of their accumulated profits made during the past six or seven years.  If they say that they cannot do that&mdash;and that may be the case in respect of a few firms or a few industries &mdash;then they should be called upon to make their case in public to show why that cannot be done.  Bearing in mind what they got away with during the <Col N="498" /> past six or seven years, if they cannot pay the increased wages out of their accumulated profits, as well as out of their existing profits, they ought to be dragged into public and be made substantiate their case for increased prices before the bar of public opinion.  It is only when that has been done that the question of increasing prices ought to be considered.  To permit those people to do what they are doing with the utmost impunity to-day&mdash;clamping on increases in wages to existing prices of goods or services&mdash;is simply not protecting the public from the inevitable spiral in prices which is the natural consequence of a policy of allowing them to proceed in this unbridled way.</P>
    <P>In 1941 the Minister had no compunction whatever in pegging workers wages to the then existing levels.  He said to the workers: &ldquo;No more increases so far as you are concerned.&rdquo; In due course the workers had to make a strong and sustained case, a case that had to be vigorously put, in order to dislodge the Minister from that attitude. If that was good policy to apply to the wages of the workers&mdash;and a week's wages is the only thing that separates many of them from the workhouse&mdash;surely it is a reasonable policy in present circumstances to apply a similar practice in respect of prices, especially when we know that out of the accumulated profits made by manufacturers and distributors there is a substantial pool of reserves available to pay increases in wages, and available also, I suggest in many cases, to plough down price levels.  When the workers pleaded the inadequacy of their wages in 1941 and said that they were not able to make ends meet on them, it did not beget from the Minister, or from the Government, any response in the form of permitting wage increases.  The Government said &ldquo;No; it is not in the national interest to allow you to get more wages; we cannot permit wages to go up because we do not want the volume of money in circulation to go up&rdquo;, but an entirely opposite policy was adopted in the case of manufacturers and of the producers and distributors of goods or services.  I suggest to the Minister that the policy applied to wages in 1941 should now be applied to prices so as <Col N="499" /> to enable the Minister to get the reins of price control in his own hands&mdash;to enable him to determine the direction in which prices are going to move in the next few years.</P>
    <P>There was one aspect of this matter on which the Minister was strangely silent, namely, as to what is going to happen to the excess corporation profits tax which is being remitted.  In the current year the Minister for Finance says that a sum amounting to £3,500,000 in excess corporation profits tax is to be remitted to a number of firms.  He says it is to be remitted this year.  It has been remitted from the end of December, so that the field has been opened further for the exploiter.  This excess corporation profits tax, which was formerly a medium of taxation for the State, is now going to go wholly into the coffers of manufacturers or large distributors. We have had no indication from the Minister that he is going to insist that those who are now going to pocket what was formerly a medium of taxation will utilise that money for the purpose of reducing existing price levels.  I say to the Minister that it is outrageous to permit those who have made untold wealth during the war to pocket this excess corporation profits tax as an additional profit to themselves. The Minister should have availed of this debate to say to those people that this excess corporation profits tax must be ploughed back in the form of lower price levels so far as the community is concerned.  I want the Minister to ask himself whether he contemplates with equanimity permitting folk who made these enormous profits during the war years, to put into their pockets during the next few years the additional profits which were subject to excess corporation profits tax during the war years?  If he lets these folk get away with the swag in that way, in addition to what they have already got, then it will be a crime against the people.</P>
    <P>We are told by the Minister that meat and bread prices are likely to rise.  If they are, that will be an outrageous imposition on people who are struggling to make ends meet in the <Col N="500" /> present situation.  To permit bread and meat prices to rise over their present levels is simply going to strain seriously the resources of every working-class family and of every person who has to live on a small income, people with no satisfactory means of equipping themselves with the wherewithal to meet a further rise in prices. Whatever machinery is resorted to, I suggest to the Minister that, so far as bread and meat prices and the prices of other necessaries are concerned, that every device must be resorted to to prevent them going still higher because a further rise would have a crippling effect on the community. The Minister ought to have availed of this debate, and I hope he will avail of the reflections of the debate, to set his face definitely against tolerating a further increase in prices.  He must insist that present price levels are already too high, and that not alone is he not going to permit further increases but that he is going to explore every possible method of effecting a reduction in present price levels.  If present price levels remain, or if prices rise further, then inevitably you will have demands for further increases in wages, because that is the only way the worker can get some compensation for a rise in prices, or can have the ability to meet an increase in the cost of living.</P>

If he does, he will get co-operation for any policy to force prices down and prevent further increases in prices.</P>
