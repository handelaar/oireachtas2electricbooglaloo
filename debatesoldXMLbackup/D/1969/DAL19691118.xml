    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether in the latter part of April or in May of this year he received from a reputable journalist employed by the news division of RTE a copy of a letter sent by that journalist to the Director-General of RTE regarding news coverage relating to the situation in Northern Ireland; and, if so, what action he took in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I received a copy of a letter, conforming to the description given by the Deputy, which I acknowledged.  Even if it had been possible to interpret the sender's covering letter to me as a request to take some specific action on the letter in question, I would not have regarded the matter as one justifying action by me in relation to the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not feel, in the light of the events since the end of April, that a very valuable warning was, in fact, contained in that letter and now, with the benefit of hindsight, does he not agree it would have been desirable then for him to act and would he consider acting now in the direction the letter urges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think it was necessary for me to act.  It was a matter for the news staff&mdash;editors and so forth&mdash;to decide the juxtaposition of news items.  On a previous occasion when a Minister sought to have the juxtaposition of news items altered objection was taken to that course.  Is the <Col N="1066" /> Deputy suggesting I should do now that which was complained about before?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>May we interpret that reply as an assurance that, in future, Ministers will not interfere with regard to news?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Ministers do not interfere. This suggestion was bandied about long before Deputy Dr. O'Brien came into this House.  It simply is not true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Timmins</b> asked the Taoiseach if he has received a memorandum from the Association of Irish Jurists regarding a resolution relevant to a state of emergency passed by Oireachtas Éireann in September, 1939; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has received or has had brought to his attention last week the memorandum from the Association of Irish Jurists concerning the continued operation of the State of Emergency in the Republic of Ireland; and the action he proposes to take in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>I received last week a copy of the memorandum dated 1st July, 1969, referred to in the questions.  The memorandum contains a request to the Houses of the Oireachtas to take certain action.</P>
      <P>This is a matter which, I consider, might appropriately be considered in relation to the question of amending the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach considered the resolution passed by the all-party committee on this matter and has he any observations to make or does he contemplate any action in respect of the resolution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The resolution was particularly adverted to in the light of <Col N="1067" /> the questions.  The resolution made certain recommendations which are, I think, worth considering but I think it would be better to consider them with other amendments of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the legislation passed in 1939 would he further expand on its relationship to the Constitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Constitution speaks for itself in Article 28 which refers to the Oireachtas being entitled to take certain action by way of emergency legislation in certain circumstances, such as in time of war or armed conflict.  This phrase is considered rather too narrow in present conditions.  It is a rather technical and legal matter and I think amendment would be required to ensure the Oireachtas would have reasonable flexibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say whether or not, in his opinion, an emergency exists and, if so, what is the emergency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting an emergency exists but if the resolution passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas in 1939 were now annulled it might not be possible to have another resolution passed within the confines of the Constitution as it now stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say if there are any powers still in operation on foot of that resolution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>None whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that at the end of the debate on Northern Ireland the Taoiseach gave it as his opinion that there was no special urgency in amending the Constitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The resolution has been in operation for the past 30 years and successive Governments did not see fit to bring in annulling resolutions and there would not, therefore, appear to be any urgency now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has said that this would need changing the Constitution and he sees no urgency to <Col N="1068" /> change the Constitution.  His reply to the Irish Jurists is, therefore, just to ignore them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach indicate whether we may expect some action before the end of the session in respect of constitutional reform bearing in mind the matters which have been raised here in recent months? Can he give some firm indication that action may be taken before the end of 1969?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy ask me to give an indication that something will take place before the end of 1969?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach set in train any course of action?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health what progress has been made towards establishing a service whereby drugs and medicines for all persons will be issued through retail pharmaceutical chemists; if he still estimates the date of commencement of the new service some time after the middle of 1970; and if it will commence before the end of that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreement has been reached with the drug manufacturers and wholesalers about the conditions on which they will participate in the new arrangements for the supply of drugs and medicines under the choice of doctor scheme. Discussions with the retail chemists have reached an advanced stage and I would hope that it would soon be possible to complete them.</P>
      <P>Because of the delay in the legislative programme due to the last general election it will not now be possible to introduce the scheme during the present year but planning is proceeding on the assumption that it will be possible to do so on 1st April, 1971.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any legal difficulty at the moment in the implementation of the scheme of distribution through the retail pharmacists?  My information is that there is no difficulty legally in doing this&mdash;that it can be done now if the Minister only has the will to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no legal difficulties.  It is simply a question of time.  It involves cost to the Exchequer. We have a very big programme to implement.  The choice of doctor administration has to be put into operation and completed before there is much point in making drugs available to retail chemists.  The two things go together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister admitted to me that they do not go together. The new Health Bill is not needed to do this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The average period for which eligible persons in County Kerry have to wait for dentures is about four months.  This is not regarded as excessive; in fact there are dentists who prefer to wait at least six months after extractions before fitting dentures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will arrange with the Kerry County Council for the erection of an old people's home in Cahirciveen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that Kerry County Council have been considering the possibility of assisting in the establishment in a number of the larger centres of population in the county of homes for the aged which might be administered by voluntary agencies.  I am informed that one such project is already in train and that the making of arrangements in relation to two other areas is under consideration.</P>
      <P>The county council will no doubt give consideration to other areas where there would be a good case for providing accommodation for aged persons who do not need hospital care but who at the same time cannot continue to live in the community even with the aid of supportive services.  It may be that in some centres it might be appropriate for the council to build accommodation of a residential type in association with an existing district hospital, rather than to establish independent homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is primarily a matter for the council to arrive at conclusions as to what provision should be made over the county as a whole but they will require to take into account the necessity for pressing on with the development of community care services as the most desirable form of development in relation to the aged who do not need institutional care for medical or social <Col N="1071" /> reasons.  Apart from this reservation I will be prepared to give sympathetic consideration to such proposals as the council may wish to put before me in relation to any particular area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health why his Department in approving of maintenance contribution arrangements for a home (details supplied) in County Westmeath limited the period for which a health authority may pay to six weeks; and what is the position of an elderly invalided person who was admitted to such home with the knowledge of a health authority, who has not sufficient means to pay for maintenance in the home on the expiration of six weeks and has not a home of his own to which to return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Contributions towards the cost of maintenance of geriatric patients in homes such as the Sacred Heart Home, Ballinderry, Mullingar, are restricted to six weeks as such patients enter these homes at their own choice and either are not eligible for or do not avail of the accommodation provided by the appropriate health authority.  The period of six weeks may be extended at the discretion of the health authority.</P>
      <P>In the case mentioned by the Deputy, the appropriate health authority would normally be responsible for the provision of accommodation although not necessarily in homes such as the Sacred Heart Home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that the Dublin Health Authority, in the case in question, has a discretion to extend the period?  If so, is there any limit to the period which the Dublin Health Authority may grant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not absolutely certain about the limit of the period but it can be extended from six weeks at the discretion of the health authority.  I think it lies within the discretion of the health authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the cases in question, one of the persons involved entered as <Col N="1072" /> a hospitalised patient and not as a geriatric patient.  In such cases, is it possible to have the stay extended indefinitely?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be for the health authority to say whether there might be alternative accommodation for such a patient.  The whole question is one where the costs are comparatively high.  It is within the discretion of the health authority to decide what is the financial position of patients and to what extent they ought to be asked to pay.  If they are unable to pay, there are generally alternative homes to which they can go.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the undertaking given in the Government's White Paper on the Health Services and their Further Development, the cost of the new services and extensions of existing services proposed in the Health Bill, 1969, will not be met in any proportion by the local rates.  Such additional demands on the local rates for the health services as may arise in the future will thus relate to increases in the costs of existing services which would arise irrespective of the Health Bill.</P>

      <P>In my reply to a question by Deputy Moore on the 30th October, I expressed the hope that my detailed statement would bring some reality into discussion of Dublin's traffic problem and would convince people that there is no ready or magic answer to traffic congestion in Dublin or in the cities of other countries with far greater resources than ours.  It is inevitable that in a subject like traffic different authorities will have an interest, but it is clear that already Dublin Corporation have the major interest, being the authority responsible for roads and planning and it is open to the corporation to secure such co-ordination of action as they consider desirable.  In my reply to Deputy Moore I mentioned that a committee of senior officials established by the corporation co-ordinates action in relation to traffic in the Dublin area and that the committee includes representatives of the Dublin local authorities, the Garda, CIE and my Department. Further steps on this general line may be considered taking account in particular <Col N="1079" /> of section 62 of the Road Traffic Act, 1968.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The person referred to in the question has not been refused an old age pension.  He was awarded a pension of 7/6d as from 18th March, 1965 when he reached 70 years of age. As a result of the general increases in pension since then the rate now payable to him is 35/- per week.  The rate of pension payable is that applicable to a person whose means exceed £130 15s per annum and do not exceed £143 15s.</P>
      <P>In February last the pensioner raised a question for an increase in pension on the grounds that he had transferred his holding and his means had consequently decreased.  It was found on investigation that although he signed a deed of transfer in respect of the holding in 1965 the deed had not been stamped or registered.  On the 13th August an appeals officer decided that there were no grounds for altering the rate of pension.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1087" /> The Deputy may, however, have in mind receipts from the letting of land for grazing on the eleven months system.  These lettings constitute easements and section 22 of the Finance Bill, 1969, provided, in explicit terms, for the charging of receipts from easements generally under Schedule D.  The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill and my speech on the Second Stage drew attention to this change.</P>
    <P>Prior to the Finance Act, 1969, a person who let land for conacre was liable to tax under Schedule D on the receipts whereas a person who let land for grazing on the eleven months system was liable to tax under Schedules A and B.  With the abolition of tax under Schedules A and B, the receipts from grazing lettings on the eleven months system were brought into line, for tax purposes, with those from conacre lettings.</P>

Therefore, is it not necessary, if they are to carry on with their livelihood under the new circumstances, that they should be provided with substantial re-equipment <Col N="1091" /> grants to enable them to build boats which will enable them to fish at a deeper level than they have been fishing to date?  Does he not also agree that it will take some time for the re-seeding to bring the mussel stock again to the present level and that during that time, approximately three to four years, the mussel fishermen will suffer a considerable loss in livelihood? Would he therefore not consider, first of all, providing a grant for re-equipment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Would the Minister be able to say whether or not the grant from the harbour commissioners has anything at all to do with the amount of compensation which may ultimately be paid to the mussel fishermen, or is it not a fact that this money must be supplied by the Fisheries Branch, irrespective of what grant is given for the carrying out of the work on the river?</P>

      <P>The main reason why voltage drops below normal is that consumers in an area continue to connect new appliances to the board's mains without notifying the board beforehand.

Would the Minister say why the Department of Finance, who do not appear to have any say in this at all, should have sent proposals for the approved scheme to Bord na Móna and not to the trade unions or the workers concerned, and while the original scheme was under discussion with Bord na Móna and the workers the Department of Finance seem to have published a proposal which we believe they had no right to make at all?

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that those pension schemes are supposed to have some relation to similar schemes for manual workers in the public service.  When the Minister for Finance became aware there was a desire for an improvement in the pension scheme he set out the main basis for it.  Then, of course, it comes before the trade unions in order to have some relevance in the pension scheme.  The Deputy should know that.</P>

As far as I know, the trade unions have not lost anything. The Minister for Finance insists that there be some relevance in pension schemes for manual workers as between one State body and the public service generally.  This has been tradition. I do not think that the trade unions will be disappointed if, in fact, it bears a relevance and is not grossly in excess, for example, of a pension scheme made available to some other public body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated previously, search and rescue arrangements and procedures are provided in accordance with the relevant standards of the International Civil Aviation Organisation.  The specific emergency procedures within this framework which apply in Ireland have been drawn up in consultation with the following parties, who would be directly concerned with their implementation.</P>
      <P>Irish Naval Service, Irish Air Corps, Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the British National Air Traffic Control Service, Royal Air Force Search and Rescue Co-ordination Centres at Petreavie and Plymouth, Eurocontrol Regional Service.</P>
      <P>The emergency procedures have been promulgated to these parties and to Irish Airlines and are available freely to all other parties who may be concerned.  I shall be happy to send the Deputies copies if they are interested. In addition, relevant parts of the procedures are included in the aeronautical publications of the Department which are issued to all airlines engaged in services to and from Ireland. These procedures apply to emergencies affecting aircraft within the Irish air traffic control area whether on land or sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated previously, appropriate exercises are carried out by <Col N="1099" /> individual agencies which may be involved in search and rescue operations. I am informed that combining exercises were carried out by the Air Corps and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution on five occasions in 1968.  Co-ordinated exercises involving simulated aircraft emergencies are not carried out and it is the considered view of my technical advisers that simulated exercises of this kind are neither necessary nor practicable.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will appreciate that aircraft emergencies involve not only the search and rescue agencies at home and abroad whom I have mentioned but all other parties who can assist, including the Garda Síochána, the Coast Life Saving Service and all shipping and aircraft, military and civil, which may be in the area.  Realistic simulated exercises would involve an unacceptable interference with normal air traffic and air traffic control procedures. In any event, there are a sufficient number of aircraft emergency alerts from time to time to provide experience for those concerned with the emergency procedures.</P>

      <P>I cannot see how the practice whereunder industrial policies are not lapsed until a premium is at least ten weeks in arrear involves <Col N="1102" /> any risks or disadvantages to the policy holder.  The practice is, in fact, imposed on insurance companies by law with the purpose of protecting the policy holder.

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Before progress was reported last week I had dealt at length with the problem of uneconomic holdings throughout the country and had spoken of the deliberate go-slow policy of the Department of Lands, of the Land Commission, in the acquisition and sub-division of land.  Before concluding I wish to re-emphasise some of the points I have already made and to make a few further ones.</P>
      <P>When he is replying, I should like the Minister to give to the House the reasons for delays in subdividing land. From the time a farm has been acquired, in some instances it takes up to four or five years before it is divided.  In the interim period, the land is let for grazing, in conacre, and this reduces its fertility and later it costs the farmers who get divisions of it a lot of money to bring it up to fertility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have given figures of the number of people who leave the land each year. They are continuing to leave it at an alarming rate at an annual round figure of 10,000.  Those who have left generally tend to be the most ambitious, people who will not accept a low standard of living.  There are many reasons for the manner in which rural Ireland is being denuded of its population.  I know that the Minister for Lands has very little control over this and has very few functions in it, but his colleagues <Col N="1114" /> in other Departments have control and have functions in so far as they can provide amenities in rural areas such as the quicker extension of rural electrification.  I know this is not relevant but I wish to make a few passing remarks on it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands has one function in all this: he has to assess the total number of uneconomic holdings in the country.  However, if we are to preserve and sustain a healthy rural community we must also have industrial development in rural areas.  This is of the utmost importance, and an opportunity to make extended comment on it will arise on another occasion.</P>
    <P>At this stage I should like to add my appeal to that of the Minister in relation to the problem of forest fires. There is no doubt that afforestation can be a great tourist attraction, but tourists bring with them the great hazard of forest fires which arise in many instances from carelessness by picnickers who set up camps at the edges of plantations.  In my area in the past few years approximately 300 acres of young trees were destroyed as a result of a picnic fire.  Therefore, on behalf of my party I add my voice to that of the Minister in appealing to people who come to this country or to people from cities and towns who come to the country to enjoy it at weekends always to be conscious of the danger to forests from picnic fires.  There is nothing more distressing or annoying&mdash;nearly invariably at great cost&mdash;than to see large tracts of forest burned and nothing but scarred countryside left.  It is something we must all be concerned about and I know everyone will join with the Minister in his appeal.</P>
    <P>I wish to bring again to the notice of the Minister that he and his Department have an important part to play, if we are to preserve a rural community, in the provision of a better standard of living for smaller farmers in congested areas where there is land which can be divided among small landowners.  I have already expressed dissatisfaction and disappointment at the rate of progress by the Department <Col N="1115" /> in this respect.  According to the Minister's figures, in 1964-65 the Department acquired a total of 43,431 acres but in 1968-69 the area acquired amounted to only 3,053 acres.  Therefore, instead of a marked increase in the area of land acquired there has been a marked decrease.  I know there are problems but I suggest to the Minister that in areas where there is congestion and where land is offered for sale, the Department should interest themselves far earlier than at present. Wherever possible, there should be voluntary acquisition.  I do not agree with compulsory acquisition of land but if we are to do anything significant in regard to this problem we must try to get as much land as possible for subdivision and for the improvement of smaller farms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ministry of Lands has moved back across the Shannon. For many years, almost since the State began, the Minister for Lands was taken from Connaught and for a short period, Deputy Faulkner, now Minister for Education, was in the hot seat.  The Government decided they would move the Ministry back across the Shannon and for a very good reason.  It is that when land division is being considered, west of Ireland people get primary consideration. I shall dwell on a very old theme as far as I am concerned.  I come from County Meath, which is a sizeable county.  Even though slices of it have been taken off politically and given to Monaghan and Cavan, it is still County Meath and for many years it has been the place where migrants are sent when they get farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I told the Minister's predecessors and I say to him now that we do not like migrants coming in but, when they come, it is not long until they become Meath men and women and they are always welcome.  No action has ever been taken against them in the county, but, rightly I think, we try to prevent people coming from outside the county and getting holdings of land that Meath people should themselves get.  I understand the Land Commission have a very difficult problem particularly when dealing with people living on uneconomic holdings, on bad land in the <Col N="1116" /> West of Ireland.  Since the law allows it, the temptation is there to move them into better land.  But it should be remembered by the authorities that a poor man in County Meath is just as poor as a poor man in Mayo or Donegal, Galway or Cork.  The idea that because somebody in the west is living on bad land and should therefore be helped by getting a farm should not be allowed to act against the people who have spent all their lives in agriculture. I refer particularly to farm labourers and small farmers in County Meath, some of whom have very poor holdings.  Farm labourers who are expert on the work of farms are passed over when the allocation of farms arises.</P>
    <P>The usual reason put forward is that they are landless men.  I know no other field where experts are passed over in favour of amateurs.  In industry it is usual to go to the ends of the earth to find somebody who can do the job properly and get the best man for the job, but in the case of farming the best man for the job is left behind and the person allocated the farm has little knowledge of farming.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to fishermen as amateurs, men who themselves told me that they never worked land in their lives, had a half acre in the West of Ireland and were given 40 acres in Meath and nothing with it.  One man told me that as a result, for the first time in his life, he and his family were hungry.  I think that answers the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the exception rather than the rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The exception proves the rule.  The Minister is new to the job and I wish him luck in his new post.  I hope when land division is being considered he will look into this question and not lightly pass over the claims of people who have been engaged in agriculture all their lives and who believe when a farm is being divided beside them that they should get portion of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister is <Col N="1117" /> aware that when the Land Commission acquire a farm they consider those working on the farm on the date of acquisition and give them some compensation or a portion of land.  To give somebody who has worked all his life on a farm, for 20 or 30 years, a lump sum of £300 or £400 is more of an insult than anything else because he is being taken out of the job he knows and is getting a sum of money which will not buy two acres of land and with that he is expected to live with his family in the future.  Worse off still are the men employed on farms until the Land Commission start negotiations for the acquisition.  The owner then naturally reduces the labour force and lets go seven out of ten, perhaps. The three retained will be considered for lump sums or portions of the farm but the other seven are not deemed to be employees because they were not employees on the date of acquisition. This is an injustice which should be remedied.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest curses of land division is the tendency of politicians to give the impression that they can influence somebody&mdash;either the Minister or his officials&mdash;so that they can get a portion of land for an individual. This is entirely wrong and should not be allowed.  When a farm is divided in an area and it turns out that six people locally get portions of land and those six, according to local views, are the least entitled to get land, it is very difficult for somebody to say: &ldquo;There is no political pull: no influence operated here and could not operate because the Land Commission are completely above politics&rdquo;.  I believe there should be no interference.  From time to time I have taken individuals to the Department, introduced them to officials and allowed them to make their own case and on that the matter would rest.  The practice should cease of going to people at local club or cumann meetings and trying to give them the impression that all they have to do is to appear to support a particular party and they will be sure to get a farm of land.</P>
    <P>Some aspects of land division should be considered and one is the reversal of the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party <Col N="1118" /> in regard to annuities.  One of the greatest boasts of the party for many years was that when they first came into office they halved the annuities. In the 1965 Land Act they changed that and as far as locals are concerned when they get a farm or portion of land they pay full annuities&mdash;the migrant still pays half the annuities.  The Minister and any of his party who stop to think must admit that this is a complete reversal of policy and, in my opinion, a betrayal of the aims of the then leader of Fianna Fáil who said he would halve annuities.  To halve annuities for one section and continue the full annuity for others is most unfair.</P>
    <P>Of course, this has an object.  I accused the then Minister for Lands when the 1965 Act was going through, of deliberately introducing this system so that the acquisition of land by local people in places like Meath and other midland counties would be made less advantageous to them.  If someone is getting a portion of land on which the annuity is as high as £17 or £18 per acre, before rates or any other outgoings arise, while his neighbour who comes from the West of Ireland has similar land for £9 per acre, this discourages local people from looking for portions of land, and I think this was included for that purpose.</P>
    <P>There are a number of farms in County Meath which have been in the possession of the Land Commission for quite some time.  I had a question down today but, unfortunately, supplementaries to other questions delayed the Ceann Comhairle and the House, with the result that my question did not come up for answer today.  I say unfortunately because the question referred to the number of farms which had been in the possession of the Land Commission in County Meath for two or more years and why that was so.  I think it was Deputy Creed who commented on the policy of the Land Commission of retaining land in their possession for an abnormally long time.  It will be generally admitted that, if someone is not working a farm properly and the Land Commission decide to acquire it for that reason and to divide it among people who are eligible for it, it is a bit thick to find <Col N="1119" /> the Land Commission keeping that farm for year after year and setting it.</P>
    <P>I was told by the Minister's predecessor some years ago that in fact the Land Commision were losing money on the farms which they held over a period and that rather than making money, as I suggested, by setting them on conacre or in grass&mdash;I noticed the Minister for Finance making a very fine point about the 11 months system as against conacre&mdash;they were losing money.  I cannot see where money can be lost on that.  I would ask the Minister to try to ensure that land acquired by the Land Commission is divided, no matter who gets it, within a reasonable period.</P>
    <P>Before I leave this particular aspect I should like to refer to something which has caused a lot of heart-burning to many others in the midland and eastern counties, that is, the fact that when a number of people are moved into an area, very often people with big young families, they are under the impression on coming to the east of Ireland that there are factories outside every door and that all they have to do is come there and all their children will find employment.  One can imagine the disappointment of those people when they find that the only jobs available are jobs held by local people and that the only hope they have of employment is to offer to work for less&mdash; if they are allowed to work for less&mdash; than the local people.  This can disrupt a whole area and it is not being given enough consideration by the Land Commission when they are allocating farms.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister, if he can, to give me an estimate of the cost of showing farms.  The Minister knows the system under which people are brought to look at farms.  There is nothing so galling to a local person who has been waiting for many years on his own smallholding, or working for a local farmer, and hoping against hope that he will get a small portion of land, as to find bus load after bus load of prospective tenants coming to look at a farm and rejecting perfectly good land in the hope of getting a better farm in the next area.  This must <Col N="1120" /> cost a considerable amount of money. I should like the Minister to give me an estimate of what is spent annually on it.  If people want land they should be in the same position as the local people who have to either take or leave what they are offered.</P>
    <P>Most of those who have come into County Meath have made a great effort to improve their holdings and to live there.  Some of them just have not been able to make it.  The proof of this is the houses which are closed up and the families gone to England.  This will happen no matter who gets farms.  It is too bad that these things should happen. Perhaps, better screening of the people who get land might solve the problem.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give me a definite yes or no in reply to my next point.  It appears that someone is trying to slip through a loophole which is alleged to be in the 1967 Land Act. Perhaps, it is in the 1965 Act&mdash;the years pass so quickly.  Originally land could be sold to a non-national under that Act, if my memory serves me correctly&mdash;and I sat here week after week after week for months when that Bill was going through; I thought I knew it backwards&mdash;if the non-national wanted to buy it for the purpose of starting an industry or wanted to buy a big house with five acres of park land.  Those two, subject to the sanction of the Commissioners, were the only non-nationals who could buy land.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Commissioners are interpreting &ldquo;subject to the sanction of the Commissioners&rdquo; on its own and feel they can allow a foreigner to buy any farm whether he is starting an industry or buying a big house with five acres.  I am sure this is happening and I can give the Minister instances of it if he wants them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently I made representations about a man who was attempting to buy a farm in County Kildare, a big farm and a house.  As a matter of fact, he was getting a bit nasty when the price which was originally agreed on was not being adhered to.  He was not starting an industry and <Col N="1121" /> there was more land than five acres. He wanted to buy that land.  I understand that the sale which he thought was being sanctioned has not yet been sanctioned.  I am told there are a number of such cases.</P>
      <P>I am raising this point specifically because of the burnings which took place in County Meath.  Farms were burned in County Meath, many of which belonged to non-nationals.  The argument being made by the people who were burning them was that the Land Commission were allowing all who wanted to buy farms, no matter where they came from, to do so.  I know that is not true.  I know that a farm which had been taken over by the Land Commission was burned also.  Some of those people were giving very good employment and had been here for many years.  If the reports which I am told are true are, in fact, true and, if the Land Commission are interpreting the Act to the effect that they have the right to allow non-nationals to buy large farms, there is an argument in favour of what these wild men are doing.  I do not agree with what they are doing but they can say: &ldquo;Somebody has to do something about it.  Dáil Éireann is doing nothing about it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I understood that we had closed all the loopholes but, apparently, this one is still there and I would be very anxious to have the Minister's comments on it when he is replying.  If it is there, the Minister should take the necessary steps to deal with it.  There is no reason good, bad or indifferent why justification should be given to people to destroy other people's property on the grounds that this House is not taking the necessary steps to prevent the land of Ireland going out of the hands of the people of Ireland. I am sure the Minister will agree with me on that.</P>

      <P>It was afterwards when the dots were put in different places it seemed to arise.  I am quite clear on that, although the Minister may not agree with me.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of loans to progressive farmers, when this was introduced I objected to it, and I still object to it.  If we are giving loans to progressive farmers to buy land, why not treat all citizens of the State equally?  Why not treat the small farmer in Meath who wants to buy a farm the same as a person who comes from Mayo?  If a farm of 25 or 30 acres is up for sale in an eastern county and a local man has either borrowed or saved the necessary money to buy it, why put him in the position that somebody from outside the area can borrow money from the Land Commission to outbid him for that farm?  That is wrong and should not be allowed.  If loans are to be given, they should be given to everyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago in my county the Land Commission went to a lot of trouble to try to supply what they called cowplots to local cottiers who had no land of their own.  Ten or 12 people were allowed to graze their cows on those cowplots on a communal basis.  An extraordinary thing about this was that land given in such circumstances was of extremely bad quality.  There may have been a reason <Col N="1123" /> for that.  I do not know.  Perhaps, it was cheaper to get the cowparks that way, but this is what did happen, and a lot of them did not operate.  The good ones did; I could mention a number that are still being carried on, and the circumstances in which they are being carried on are very good.  Local people who have no land of their own are allowed to graze cows on those farms.</P>
    <P>If the Land Commission have firmly set their faces against giving accommodation plots, as they are called, anything from two to five or six acres to a local cottier or landless man, they must reintroduce the system of cowplots. It is no answer to say that this man can buy a bottle of milk for nine-pence, when the lorry comes down from Dublin with it; there is a lot more to keeping a cow or two than having a bottle of milk when he needs it.  The Minister must seriously reconsider reintroducing this scheme whereby the local landless men or cottiers will get a holding, no matter how small it is, on which to keep a cow or two, or, alternatively, introduce the system whereby they will be provided with a cowplot.</P>
    <P>The employees of the Land Commission have been for a number of years scattered all over the place.  While their conditions have improved they are not anything like ideal.  However, I propose to deal with forestry employees at a later stage, and since the rates of pay and conditions are fairly comparable I shall take the two sets together.</P>
    <P>The question of payment for land is a matter which will have to be dealt with by the Land Commission in a different way.  For years the old system of land bonds had been in operation, and many people complained bitterly that no matter what they did they lost a great deal of money if they sold for land bonds.  The system whereby they can now sell for cash or, to reverse the position, the Land Commission can buy for cash, is a big improvement. However, the delay entailed in this sort of deal is far too great.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission must take steps to prevent people who already have more land than they know what to do with from acquiring further large <Col N="1124" /> tracts of land.  It will be found that if 100 acres of land come up for sale, a man with 300, 400 or 500 acres, will be the highest bidder for it and he will finish up with, as they say, half the side of the country.  Since on the original farm he usually did not employ more than one man and a dog, he normally puts the second bit in with the first and does not increase the number of people he employs.  This is something which should be considered very seriously without impinging too much on the rights of the individual.  Any man who has a sizeable farm of land has enough and should not be allowed to continue acquiring land until we have the position where the old ranch is back again in existence.  In the British time they started breaking up what was called ranch land.  Many of the areas which were divided years ago seem to have passed back into the hands of one individual.  This is wrong.  Too much land has a greater danger of being uneconomic than too little land, because one can remember the man with the very small acreage who has succeeded in making a living for himself and his family, while the man with too much land usually does not provide a living for anybody else but himself and his family.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Forestry Division, the acquisition of land is not going forward fast enough.  I do not know who is responsible for this, but I am quite sure the Forestry Division are very anxious to get hold of as much land as they can.  There are areas where land is bad and in such areas any kind of a middling good bit of land is considered valuable by the farmer; yet in areas where land is good there are quite sizeable portions which are not used.  Perhaps somebody is too lazy to drain it, but for some reason the land is let run into rushes or furze That land should be acquired by the Forestry Division.  The biggest snag about it is that, if this is not done and the area of land under the Forestry Division is allowed to drop, the employment position must depreciate.</P>
    <P>On the question of cutaway bogs, experiments have been carried out. Would the Minister tell us what is the <Col N="1125" /> present position about the use of cutaway bogs for planting?  When certain other crops can be grown on cutaway bogs I do not see why it should not be possible to grow trees.  In the area of north Meath there are a number of old bogs being planted, but beside them there are many acres, about 1,500 acres, of similar type bog which does not appear to have been taken over by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Employment with the Forestry Division has been fairly constant for ordinary employees for a number of years and similarly with the Land Commission, for certain types of employees, mainly supervisory grades.  The recent increase of 25/- from 1st June and £1 from 1st October has been useful in bringing up the wages of these people because until then the basic wage of these people&mdash;maybe we are all a little to blame for this&mdash;was the lowest in the State.  However, at the same time as they got this increase, a similar increase, which amounted to not less than 25/- and in some cases to £4 or £5 per week, has been passed on to other State employees.  This has put these lower paid workers in a relatively worse position than they were in before the 25/- was granted to them, and this is one of the things these people complain about bitterly.</P>
    <P>In regard to sick pay schemes for employees in the Forestry Division and the Department of Lands, a few years ago it was agreed to give the difference between social welfare benefit and wages for five weeks.  Generally the sick pay schemes in outside employment, including local authority employment, run to about 12 weeks.  It is about time the State came into line again.  If outside employment can give 12 weeks in any period of one year, there is no reason why the State should give only five weeks.  In most good employment a pension scheme exists.  All that has been allowed to State employees in those two categories is what is known as a treasury warrant; I think it is a week's pay for each year of service after seven years up to 14 years, and two weeks pay for any period after 14 years.  This is a very small sum for someone who has been all his life working for one particular employer, and the sooner the Minister <Col N="1126" /> decides that he himself must look into the question of introducing a proper pension scheme, the better it will be for all concerned.</P>
    <P>I was very interested to hear the Minister for Health, when he answered a question for the Minister for Transport and Power which I put down about Bord na Móna, slip out some information which I had already suspected: that the new pension scheme for Bord na Móna workers had to relate to the scheme for State employees. Possibly it was not intended that the Minister say that much but I must assume, as I suggested last week, that some type of scheme is being hatched up for the employees of the State.  All I would like to say is that, if there is a scheme, let the trade unions and the people concerned have a look at it and see if it is worth bothering about; do not hatch it for 12 months and then bring out an undersized chicken.  That is what usually happens.</P>
    <P>With regard to conditions of employment, I can understand that there are no paved paths in the forests; it is not possible to have conditions like that. However, I do not think the protective clothing being issued to the Forestry Division and Land Commission workers is sufficient.  An arrangement was made recently whereby the workers were allowed to bring their boots home for the first time.  Up till then they had to take off their boots each evening and wear their own shoes home lest they went out and sold them that night.  In the year 1969 this is too ridiculous for words.  We should also take into account that the rubber boots worn by one person should not be worn by another because of the danger of industrial diseases.  In most cases what happened to these boots, when the particular job for which they had been wearing them had finished, was that they were locked in a box and when they were taken out a year later they were rotten.  No blame was put on anybody; those were the regulations and they had to be carried out.  At least now they are able to wear them home; that is something.  It is all very well for us to blame the Minister and his officials for these regulations but somebody thought them up.  It was recently <Col N="1127" /> said to me that the most difficult thing in the world was to persuade any Department of State to change a regulation, no matter how stupid it was.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Forestry Division boots were made for lying in boxes to rot.  Other types of protective clothing are rather scarce.  The men are provided with knee pads when they are sawing; old gloves in certain conditions, and sometimes they are issued with coats.  In view of the small cost of buying these things wholesale, supplies could be more liberal.  There has always been a tendency to wait and see if anybody brings them home&mdash;as if a fellow would want to get a pair of rubber boots, a yellow coat and a pair of gloves from the Forestry Division to wear to Mass on Sundays.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of shelters, it has been pointed out that certain precautions have to be taken in forests. A shelter which could catch fire cannot be erected in any circumstances.  It has been said that the forestry workers were not supposed to be sitting inside a shelter; they were supposed to be working.  In bad days, as is the case for every other worker employed in the open, surely they are entitled to have some type of shelter?  I do not mean a shelter where the diesel cans, the tools and materials are packed, and whatever space is left the men can sit in.</P>
      <P>We have also reached a stage where some type of cooking facility, either Calor gas or Kosangas, should be provided. Cooking by gas has one fault in that it does not heat the hut, but I do not think it should be beyond the capabilities of the Forestry Division to ensure that some form of heating and cooking facility be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of travelling is a big problem, and I can see that State's trouble here.  The tendency in the past was to employ casual labour locally. If the people who had been employed for a number of years wanted to continue in that job they had to travel under their own steam.  I do not think it is really fair that a man should be asked to travel that journey in his own time without any payment for it.  I am <Col N="1128" /> one of those people who believe implicitly in the theory that, if a tradesman is given travelling time for travelling from one side of the city to another or from one job to another some miles away, a man working in a forest, who in his own way is a very skilled man, is entitled to some compensation for the distance he has travelled.</P>
    <P>It may appear from what I am saying that I am attacking the officials who are dealing with this problem, but nothing could be further from the truth.  While they have not the right to accede to requests made by us from time to time, they are always very helpful; they try to look into matters and they make representations sometimes with success.  As far as courtesy is concerned, we have no complaints about the way they deal with us and that is something which has become a rather rare thing when dealing with other State Departments.</P>
    <P>One group of people who have to travel and who are treated very badly are the Land Commission gangers.  At one time they were only employed if they agreed to live within, I think, five miles of the job.  This meant the job was either beside the ganger's home or else he had to take &ldquo;digs&rdquo;.  How they did it I do not know.  I think they should get a pension for that alone because the amount of money they got to keep their own home and to pay &ldquo;digs&rdquo; was so small that it must have been the worst job in the country. These men did carry on their work&mdash; but then came a revelation&mdash;there was an element included in their pay to cover their travelling.  Recently a very small allowance has been given.  These facts are only brought home when one finds a man travelling 40 miles to work and 40 miles back in a car, paying for petrol, making repayments on the car, paying tax and insurance on it.  If anyone does not believe this, again I can give instances.  No Minister or official would accept that for himself, and if he would not accept it for himself I do not think he should ask anybody in his employ to do so.  In 1969 there is no point in telling me that the alternative is to employ a local man as a ganger, and leave him at home.  We have heard that so often that we are getting a bit sick of it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1129" /> We can now take these matters to the Labour Court.  Possibly I should not be wearying the Minister with a recital of them here but I am deliberately doing this because I believe the Labour Court has a good job to do.  They are doing it fairly well, but the more work piled on them the less well they will be able to do it.  I should much prefer to sit across a table with officials trying to hammer out these matters, rather than take them to the Labour Court.  If I am successful, well and good; but if I am not successful, then we will have to go back again to the old system and have it discussed at the Labour Court. There are many other aspects of this matter which should be dealt with but I do not wish to delay the House or the Minister.</P>
    <P>As far as we in these benches are concerned we are all in favour of the purchase and allocation of land, despite what some of us seem to say from time to time.  We are also all in favour of the acquisition of land for afforestation.  If it does happen that a bit of good land is acquired, I do not think the Forestry Division should be blamed.  On one or two occasions I have made representations in regard to land which was considered good land and which was in the middle of a farm which had been acquired for afforestation because it was scrub land. I have attempted to get that good bit of land returned or sold to somebody who had a small farm in the locality. In such cases, the Forestry Division usually stuck their heels in the ground and stated that what they had they would hold.  Although at the time I may have said the decision was harsh I now believe that it was a wise decision.  Investment in forestry is bound to pay dividends.</P>
    <P>I was in Finland some years ago&mdash; granted, there is a great difference between Finland and Ireland&mdash;but I was amazed to discover that 97 per cent of the exports from Finland were timber and that a great deal of it was exported to Ireland.  Some years ago we used to be talking here about the possibility of using native timber for building, furniture-making and so on. Great progress has been made in remedying the trouble experienced then <Col N="1130" /> in using native timber.  Money spent on experiments in the use of native timber would be money very well spent because many forests are reaching the stage where they should begin to pay dividends.  The Christmas tree trade was almost the only profitable feature of our forests a few years ago but that is no longer the case.</P>
    <P>One aspect of afforestation which has been rather neglected recently is private planting.  I recounted in this House a few years ago how, in Austria, on the birth of a daughter, the farmer plants an acre of timber which would represent a fine dowry for the daughter when she had reached the age of 21 years.  Dowries are not so important or so popular in this country at the present time but some farmers would be well advised to plant even a little timber even without having a daughter's dowry as the <i>raison d'être.</i> There is a great deal of bad land on which shelter belts could be planted.  Even for ordinary drainage it would pay farmers to plant trees.  While there was a big drive in connection with private planting a few years ago it now seems to have eased off.  An effort should be made to encourage farmers to plant timber on their own land rather than to depend on the State to plant.</P>
    <P>All of us deplore the occurrence of forest fires.  Personally, I do not think the fires are caused by vandals, as has been suggested, or even by trippers who forget to quench fires.  On bogland, it is not uncommon for fires to be lighted for the purpose of making tea.  Somebody tramples out the fire and subsequently the fire burns underground and appears 100 yards away, and does a great deal of damage. Normally where a fire is lighted on hard ground, it is extinguished.  It does not seem to be appreciated that many forest fires are caused accidentally. One cause of fires is glass.  During a hot summer, such as we had last year and this year, the action of the sun on a piece of a glass bottle may cause grass to ignite.  Many fires are caused accidentally in that way. If a fire is caused by a person deliberately burning scrub, in defiance of the law, no penalty is sufficiently harsh in his case.  Apart from the loss of timber and the loss of revenue involved, <Col N="1131" /> a forest fire destroys a thing of beauty which has been produced at the cost of a great deal of labour, money and time.  No punishment is sufficiently severe in the case of a person who deliberately or through carelessness causes the destruction of a forest by fire.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the Minister in this Department.  I hope, and I am sure, he will be prepared to listen to the very many pleas made to him.  I can assure him as a Deputy and as a trade union official dealing with very many of his employees that as long as he is fair and can see the two sides of the story&mdash; and there were predecessors of his who could not&mdash;he and his officials will receive full co-operation from the people that I represent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment as Minister for Lands.  I wish him well in this position and look forward to many improvements being brought about in the working of the Land Commission under his authority. It is not that I want to be too critical of the operations of the Land Commission at the present time but I do believe that there are many changes which could be made to good effect.</P>
      <P>A great deal of good work has been done by the Land Commission over a long period but time has wrought changes and the Land Commission have not changed sufficiently to meet the changing circumstances.  In particular, I refer to the high price that land is fetching in the open market at the present time.  Land has become too expensive for the Land Commission to continue to operate as they have been operating in the past.  Also, it would seem that the public are reluctant to deal with the Land Commission, first of all, because of the many delays involved from the time they start to acquire a holding, whether compulsorily or by voluntary purchase.  The time lag is altogether too great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the factor that the public are reluctant to accept land bonds in payment for land.  There has been an improvement in land acquisition because the Land Commission are <Col N="1132" /> purchasing a greater amount of land for cash.  Nevertheless, there is this great fear on the part of the public in regard to land bonds.  Sometimes this is due to lack of knowledge on the part of the public as to the actual or potential value of land bonds and it is also because of fluctuations in price. Therefore, there is need for a change.</P>
    <P>We all looked forward to the 1965 Land Act to bring about improvements within the Land Commission, especially with regard to the acquisition of larger estates for division among uneconomic holders and for migration and division of migrants' holdings among local uneconomic holders.  Of course, I am very much in favour of accommodating the people living within the county in which an estate has been acquired.  They should get first priority.  If there are not sufficient uneconomic holders within a mile or so of an estate that is acquired, people from some other area within the county should be given a holding on the estate.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties is that the sale of an estate takes place before the fact that the land is for sale is brought to the notice of the Land Commission. Where elderly people are not farming land properly neighbours are reluctant to ask to have that land acquired by the Land Commission.  Equally, the elderly people do not want the Land Commission to know that they intend to dispose of their holding and so they do not advertise locally their intention to sell the land.  They quickly and quietly make a sale, perhaps to someone in the locality or perhaps to someone in another part of the country, someone who may already be a very large landholder. As Deputy Tully has said, we have too much of this thing of people with 300, 400 or 500 acres of land going out and buying additional land.  When the deposit has been paid on such land it is then the local people begin to agitate for the acquisition of the land by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>If the Land Commission decide to acquire they must, first of all, serve notice of their intention to acquire. Until they do so they have no right to enter on the land to carry out an <Col N="1133" /> inspection.  This kind of operation leads to a boosting of the price.  I have a suspicion that the price is often boosted deliberately in order to keep the Land Commission from acquiring the holding.  Naturally, when the Land Commission seek to acquire, the price is something they must take into consideration. The price may be uneconomic and, if they succeed in acquiring the land, the task of paying for it will fall on those who get the land and the question they have to ask themselves is: is the price economic where these people are concerned?</P>
    <P>I believe the price has been boosted on occasion with this purpose in mind. Indeed, it is very difficult for the Land Commission to ascertain what the price paid for the land was.  These people have to pay additional duty if they say the price was higher than it actually was, but they are prepared to do this in order to get hold of the land.  Even if notice of intention to acquire has been served before the sale takes place the land can still be sold to some other interested party, subject to the consent of the Land Commission.  Again, the price the Land Commission will have to pay, if they decide to acquire, is the market value of the holding.  In my opinion this is a very big loophole in the Act and something will have to be done about it because there is exploitation.</P>
    <P>Grave hardship is caused because of delay when the Land Commission goes after a holding.  I believe this delay deters people from offering their holdings to the Land Commission. From the time the Land Commission serves notice of intention to acquire they have three months in which to make up their minds as to whether they will go ahead with negotiations or withdraw.  If they have not concluded their findings in the three months they can have another three months and, that three months having expired, they can have a further three months.  This is a great hardship on those selling and on those who may have paid a deposit on the land.</P>
    <P>It may be said that one cannot have very much sympathy with a person who pays a deposit and moves in on land knowing the risk he is taking and knowing that the Land Commission <Col N="1134" /> may decide to acquire the land, but I know personally of one particular case where three medium sized farmers bought a holding of 45 acres.  Subdivision was involved and so the sale came to the notice of the Land Commission. The Land Commission did not agree to the sale of the land.  That was in 1966.  The case was listed for hearing and the Land Commission were successful in their objection.  The three farmers who had purchased the land, manured it and harvested crops off it, may have been aware of the risks they were taking, but they nevertheless suffered a certain hardship.  The owner who sold the land would have got his money from the three farmers without any difficulty.  Because the Land Commission stepped in he naturally could not get this money and he had to wait a considerable time to get his money from the Land Commission; in fact, he had to go into the county home in Dungarvan and spend a considerable time there.  Now, that farm has not, as yet, been allocated to the uneconomic holders in the area.  In the past 12 months, it has been let.  The land there has become run-down due to the type of animal grazing it while it was let under the 11 months' system. It will not be of any economic value to the holder in the area when it comes to be divided.  Perhaps, one of the three people who originally purchased it may get an allocation&mdash;I believe he would be entitled to it.  This type of operation does not do the Land Commission any good in the public eye.  If at all possible, an improvement should be effected.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned, however, with larger estates.  The Land Commission are not getting their teeth into that problem.  The owner of the larger holding or estate is much more likely to get away with a private sale. I can illustrate this by what happened in County Waterford at that time.  In the very same area, there was a 215 acre estate which was sold to an individual who already had approximately 1,400 acres.  The hearing took place about the same time as that for the small estate but the sale was allowed to that private individual.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall move on from that with the remark that the large man seems better able to make his case as well as being able to avail of the best legal advice.  Such a landowner, when he moves into a holding, is in a position to plough, till and manure the land as well as to start a dairy there; finance is no problem to him.  At a hearing, an important factor is how the land is being used.  That a holding was derelict and was not being operated under the previous owner and, under the new owner, is being put into good shape and, furthermore, is giving employment, has a big bearing on the findings of the court of legal inquiry.  I would ask the Land Commission to pay particular attention to this aspect of land purchases.</P>
      <P>I mentioned the high price of land and the boosting of the price that takes place with the result that the rent is far too high when the acquired land comes to be allocated.  Because of the high rent, the people who get the land are unable to operate it successfully; they are unable to get into the farming practices they would like to engage in&mdash;the stocking of the holding, the manuring of it, and so on.  The married person with a young family who is living on an economic holding will get priority.  He is not too well off as it is the time in his life when his financial commitments are greatest.  Money is not too freely available.  The high rent is a great millstone around the neck of such a family.  I know of many very good farmers in their own right who are unable to work the land for those reasons. I know it is against Land Commission regulations but sometimes these people are forced to let the land.  It often happens that the cattle or the sheep are taken in at a cost per head but, nevertheless, this situation is forced on those people because of the high rent they must pay.  This is something which must be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of many cases where people had the land from the Land Commission, in the period between <Col N="1136" /> its acquisition and allocation, for one-third of the price they had to pay for it when it was eventually allocated to them.  I know this to be so in my own area.  There is the argument that, when they have the land, there is no risk that somebody else will take it from them on an annual letting and that this is a tremendous advantage.  Nevertheless, I would ask the Minister to do something about the very high rent they must pay year in, year out.  If those people got even three or four years to enable them to get off the ground with regard to the financing of their farming operations before this heavy rent falls to be paid, it would be a tremendous help to them.</P>
    <P>I came up against another problem with regard to the Land Commission bidding for land at public auctions, which can cause annoyance and hardship. In some cases a farmer with a grown family, living on an economic holding, whose sons have come to the stage where they would be able to help him on the land and where he would be able to farm additional land successfully, might have saved sufficient money to buy a holding adjacent to his own holding.  Such a man would be looking forward to a derelict property coming on the public market because he would be in a position to purchase it.  Imagine his annoyance when that day arrives and he finds a Land Commission inspector bidding against him.  We must all share the blame for situations like this.  I myself have brought to the notice of the Land Commission a farm which is coming up for public auction.  I have in mind a rather small farm which is somewhat different from a large estate.  I have been responsible for bringing Land Commission inspectors to the sale to bid for the land at the public auction.  Sometimes they have been bidding against people who were worthy of getting the land, who were economic holders and outstanding farmers in their own right.  I regretted having done this, which should have been avoided at all cost.  If the Land Commission are successful in purchasing such land it could happen, that the people who eventually got the land would not be able to farm it successfully. <Col N="1137" /> The annoyance of the farmers who were unsuccessful in bidding at the public auction is understandable.  I would ask that this aspect of the matter should be looked at carefully and the position remedied if at all possible.</P>
    <P>I advocate that the Land Commission should go after the bigger farms and estates.  I mentioned my regret when the Land Commission inspector bids for a farm which is suitable for some small local farmer.  I want to emphasise the fact that the farm I had in mind, when notifying the Land Commission, would be a medium or small farm.  The man I was speaking of and on whom the hardship and annoyance would fall would not be able to go after the bigger tracts of land.  The Land Commission are allowing the estates to escape their net.  Quite recently I made representations to the Land Commission in regard to a farm and estate in order that they might acquire it.  They were reluctant to do so because it was not a place suitable for migrants owing to the difficulty of building houses on it.  The layout was not suitable for building and there were no uneconomic holdings within a mile of it.  This estate is quite near a mountainous area.  There is great production of sheep in such an area and these estates should be acquired so that the sheep farmers could be allocated some land.  The Land Commission should acquire land with this purpose in mind. They would not be going into competition with uneconomic holdings or with migrants' holdings because the estates I have in mind would be unsuitable for such holdings.  The numbers of sheep have increased in recent years on these mountainous holdings.  The farmers have tremendous difficulty in feeding their sheep during the winter months, particularly at the time of a heavy snowfall or heavy frost.  Pastoral land to which they could move their sheep for grazing purposes would be of tremendous value to them.  I would ask to have this point considered.</P>
    <P>I have been criticising to some extent the operation of the Land Commission. The time for change has arrived.  I would like to see the Land Commission helping farmers to purchase land themselves.  A short while <Col N="1138" /> ago a farm of 200 acres came up for sale in my constituency.  Many people asked me to get in touch with the Land Commission and have it taken over and divided.  I studied the type of people making this request and I felt that quite a number of them would be in a position to purchase land for themselves if they got a little help from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I said to them that if they could manage to buy the estate between them and divide it up it would be much cheaper land for them and each one would be assured of getting some land.  I pointed out to them that if the Land Commission acquired the holding for distribution they could not be quite so sure of getting land.  We had a few meetings to discuss this proposition and eventually, with the help of the agricultural inspector, we arranged that the people concerned would buy the estate.  We arranged how much land each would get.  We approached the owner of the estate who was quite willing to sell to the local people.  The owner expressed his fear of getting involved with the Land Commission but he was quite willing to do business with local people.  They made the necessary arrangements with him very quickly.</P>
    <P>I then approached the Land Commission with a view to getting their consent to the subdivision of this holding. I am glad to say we had no difficulty whatever.  I should like to see this type of operation taking place.  The Land Commission could play a big part in such operations.  The capable farmers of a district would be very interested and they would have the ability to deal properly with any land they might get.  Such people should be helped.  Much speedier results would follow such arrangements.  This system would operate even more easily with regard to the purchasing of smaller holdings.  The Land Commission would have the problem of deciding in what way they should help these people.  I would suggest the Land Commission should help them financially, as well as by working out the arrangements for them.  The Land Commission would have to select the type of person to whom they would be prepared to give financial help.  This should not present any great problem.  At present the <Col N="1139" /> Commission have to decide to whom they are going to give land.  It would be a simpler matter to decide whom they thought was most deserving of financial help to purchase land in any area.</P>
    <P>I would ask them to be very slow to allow any of the bigger landowners to purchase additional land, to become bigger farmers, because we want to keep as many people as we possibly can on the land.  If they come off the land we must find employment for them; otherwise they must emigrate and this is something we do not want to happen.  It might be a different story if there was a shortage of workers in industry but this is not so.  The type of people who come off the land are not equipped for industrial employment so we should do everything possible to try to keep them on the land. I am not satisfied that the Land Commission are doing enough in this direction.</P>
    <P>With regard to forestry, I welcome the employment that the Forestry Division are giving in rural Ireland.  It is very good employment at present. The conditions of employment and the wages have improved considerably. This is something we are all very pleased about because forestry work is of great importance to the people of rural Ireland.  We would like to see the Forestry Division purchase as much land as possible for planting.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred to the damage caused to plantations each year by fire. Like Deputy Tully I do not believe that this is caused by vandalism; I believe it is caused by carelessness.  I do not believe that anybody would intentionally burn down a plantation. During the dry season it is very easy to start a fire and once it has started it is very difficult to bring it under control.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to ensure that each forest is properly guarded and watched during the summer months for outbreaks of fire.  A fire in its first moments can be very easily dealt with but within a very short time it can get out of control and cause thousands of pounds worth of damage.  I would suggest that where possible capable caretakers <Col N="1140" /> should be appointed.  Where a suitable person lives near a forest he should be appointed and the amount of money paid to him would be money well spent.  Where it is not possible to find such a person I suggest that the woods should be patrolled by employees of the Forestry Division on Saturdays and Sundays and in the evenings when they are not at work.  This is work for which they should be well paid be cause by being present and alert to the dangers of fire they could save the country considerable sums of money each year.  This is something that has been neglected.  Fires cannot be avoided but the important thing is to ensure that there is somebody on the spot to deal with fire as soon as possible after it starts.</P>
    <P>There is quite a lot of mountain and forest area in my constituency and sheep farmers have suffered considerably from damage to sheep by foxes.  This damage has become very severe in recent years.  We would like to see more co-operation from the Forestry Division in regards to the elimination of foxes in the forests.  We know that they permit people to go into the forests in pursuit of foxes but this can be a difficult operation and I believe these people owe it to the sheep farmers to co-operate with them.  This would be an added incentive to people living in those areas to sell land which they are not using to the Forestry Division.  At present we hear people saying that they would not sell such land because if they did their sheep would be damaged by foxes from the forests.  For that reason they are reluctant to sell land.  This is regrettable because it need not be so.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that this problem is dealt with.  Again I wish the Minister every success.</P>

      <P>I do not think a man with 1,400 acres of land should be allowed to purchase a farm of this size.  It is something like non-nationals coming in here to buy land.  During the election campaign one party had a slogan which I thought was very good: &ldquo;The Land of Ireland for the People of Ireland&rdquo;.  That should be the rule and we should stick to it rigidly. During my time in the House I am sure I have put down more questions to the Minister for Lands about the acquisition and division of small holdings of land in my area than any other Deputy.  When Deputy O'Donovan was speaking on this subject he mentioned 23 and 25 acres.  He then went on to refer to various Ministers for Lands we have had, dwelling on the Mayomen and he then referred to the late Deputy Seán Moylan as the best Minister for Lands this country has had.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only fault I find with the Land Commission is that they are too slow in the acquisition of many of those holdings.  When a holding comes up for sale they do not know whether they want to buy it or not.  In many cases they apply section 40 to it, whereby the sale cannot go through without their sanction.  Eventually the matter is dealt with by the court and in all probability the individual who bought the land in the first place is left with it.  I have seen various cases of this.  Let us assume that a person buys a holding and the Land Commission feel they cannot reach the price he paid for it.  When the court, which decides whether the purchaser should be left the land or not, sits the people who originally asked the Land Commission to acquire the holding should be informed and should be asked to give evidence substantiating their claim with regard to the Land Commission's acquisition of the land.  There are a few of those cases coming up in my area in the near future.  I should like notification and I could then notify the people who came to me seeking the assistance of the Land Commission for the acquisition of those holding originally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to lands acquired by the Land Commission regardless of size&mdash;ten acres, 20 acres, 30 acres or, perhaps, a couple of hundred acres.  On most of those holdings which the Land Commission acquired there was a house which sometimes was in good repair and sometimes was not.  Some of those houses were in exceptionally <Col N="1143" /> good repair.  It takes the Land Commission a minimum of two years and sometimes up to ten years to divide a holding.  In some cases I believe it has taken even more than ten years, although it usually runs to five years. The land will not go bad.  I presume it will be there at the end of that time. The house in question, assuming it was in reasonable repair when the Land Commission took over the holding, should not be left empty for years when we have a great shortage of houses in this country at the moment. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle may say that this does not come within the scope of this debate.  When acquiring lands on which there are houses, the Land Commission should examine the idea of giving those houses to many of the worthy applicants in need of them.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary, who is sitting in the Minister's place, what he considers to be an economic holding.  Some time ago it was supposed to be the equivalent of 45 acres of good land.  In the West of Ireland, and particularly in the constituency I represent, the majority of farmers have a lot less than 45 acres.  Now that the Minister is here, perhaps, he can tell me what the Land Commission consider to be an economic holding?  When can the Minister foresee the majority of the landholders in the West of Ireland being economic holders?  Does he honestly think the Land Commission are taking the necessary steps to ensure that the land they have acquired in the West of Ireland is being divided as quickly as possible in an attempt to give these individuals, who will not stay on the land unless it is divided, a chance to earn a better living?</P>
    <P>Recently I put down a Parliamentary Question regarding the Love estate at Ahascragh, Ballinasloe, which comprises approximately 200 acres.  I asked the Minister to acquire that estate with a view to dividing it among the people of the locality.  He indicated that the local individual who acquired that land had paid well for it.  However, there are many local farmers in that district who have fewer than 30 acres of land. This was an estate of 200 acres and I <Col N="1144" /> am quite sure, if the Land Commission acquired it, it would give all those people an economic holding.  I should like the Minister to reconsider the decision of the Land Commission and reopen the case of the Love estate, Ahascragh, with a view to acquiring it and having it divided among the needy tenants in the area.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the question of rates on land.  It has now reached the stage when many people, due to the fact that a lot of small farmers are drawing unemployment assistance or farmers' dole, as it is popularly known, are reluctant to accept land.  I know of a few cases where this happened because it would put them in a category whereby they would not any longer be entitled to this little benefit which is paid out weekly.  When the Land Commission come across a case such as this they should compulsorily acquire the land which that person has and divide it among the people who are prepared to accept land.  I do not think this country or any country can afford to pay any section of the community subsistence allowances to keep them in any place.  I believe we all owe a hard day's work or a hard year's work to this country and nobody should be given a couple of pounds to keep him in any industry.  The Minister should look into this matter.</P>
    <P>I have spoken on previous occasions about land sold to non-nationals.  I do not think any land in Ireland should be sold to them.  You have only to go to the midlands or County Meath and you can see the number of farms in those areas owned by non-nationals. There are people here in Dublin who consider that a farm of land similar to the Phoenix Park is a good farm of land.  It is, and it is a big one, but there are tracts of land similar to it in County Meath that are owned by Germans and other non-nationals.  This is something that should not be allowed happen.  To quote our election slogan &mdash;&ldquo;The land of Ireland for the people of Ireland&rdquo;.  It is a good slogan and it is one that the Land Commission and the Department of Lands would do well to take note of.  The area of land that has been taken over by non-nationals in the past few years must <Col N="1145" /> amount to hundreds, or, maybe, thousands of acres.</P>
    <P>When the Land Commission take land along the western seaboard they should let the land to individuals who are prepared to take it and work it. I know that the Land Commission must cover their costs but the present charge of £10 an acre is too much and they should only charge £1 an acre even on a trial basis.  This would not cost any more than the amount of money that was lost on one or two industries in this country.</P>
    <P>While Deputy Tully was speaking, he referred to migrants from the west as &ldquo;amateurs&rdquo;.  Many people from my constituency have gone to farms in County Meath but they are not amateurs at the game of farming.  It is accepted by the Land Commission as well as by the neighbours of these people that they worked very hard and made a success of their land.</P>

      <P>I should hate anybody to pass a remark like that about those people.  When they came from the west they had to work on a different type of land from that to which they were accustomed.  With regard to afforestation, there is not enough land being planted and the grant of £20 an acre that is being offered is insufficient. A greater incentive should be offered to farmers to encourage them to plant part of their holdings.  The Forestry Division are very slow-moving.  I know of one individual who had six acres of rather wet land which he offered to the Forestry Division on condition that they would put a fence around it but the Division refused to take it from him.  It would not have cost very much to put a fence around six acres. I shall send a note to the Minister with details of this particular case in the hope that the decision already taken will be reversed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to mention also the case of an individual whose land was taken from him compulsorily some time ago&mdash;during the 1940's or early 1950's &mdash;because he also had a business.  This man was paid with 3½ per cent land <Col N="1146" /> bonds which today are worth £56 per £100 land bond.  I am not very well aware of the facts because I was very young at the time.  I should like the Minister to let me know if there is any draw for these 3½ per cent land bonds and I should also like to know when they are redeemable and at what price. I am speaking on behalf of an individual whose land was taken approximately 20 years ago.  It was grossly unfair to have taken this man's land because he held a little business.  I also know of another farm of land that was taken in the same way in the Tuam area and which was given to what is known as a &ldquo;Taca man&rdquo; and he, in turn, was allowed to sell it and he bought a farm of land afterwards in the midlands.  The Deputies on the other side may laugh but this is a fact.</P>

      <P>I did not say that the Minister knew the facts but it is possible that he knows the individual, but then he knows a lot of people.  With regard to turbary rights, the Land Commission have bogs in certain areas and be the bog big or small, they divide it and make a road through it. All the banks are vested in the tenants and the Land Commission do not consider that they have any obligation to go back at any future time to repair the roads they originally made.  The Board of Works looked after those roads in the past but they no longer do so.  The onus is now on the Land Commission to keep these roads in repair.  When I tried to bring some of these problems to the notice of the Land Commission I was told that the cost involved would be too great to warrant their repairing the roads.  These roads are badly in need of repair and I hope the Minister will look into the matter because to have them repaired would be of great help to many people.</P>

They grazed their cows on it but now they are seeking to have it divided among them.  I hope that when the case eventually comes to the Land Commission they will deal with it quickly and not allow it to hang on for years.  It is necessary also that any land in the vicinity of groups of cottages should be divided into two-acre or three-acre lots and given to cottiers when they apply for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister on his appointment to this Department and I wish him success in it.  Many people say that the Minister's job is an uphill fight all the time in this Department.  It is a great challenge and I hope the Minister will make a success of it so that when this Estimate comes before the House next year, or even in the following year, I shall not have to speak on it because all the points I raised this year will have been <Col N="1148" /> dealt with to my satisfaction.  If I am still in my health in those days, I hope all I shall have to do is to thank the Minister for having dealt with all the problems I spoke of today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with the administrative setting of the Department of Lands.  My personal regard for the Minister and for the Department's secretariat does not in any way inhibit me from advocating very strongly that he should be declared redundant and that his Department should be abolished.  I propose to elaborate briefly on this.  I feel strongly that the Government should urgently reconsider the role of this Department within the Cabinet and within the operations of this House.  This Department should be abolished as at present constituted because there has been no convincing reason in recent decades to make in any way unacceptable to the House a proposal to integrate this Department including the Forestry Division, into a revitalised Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
      <P>The reasons for the amalgamation&mdash; I do not think this is out of order in this setting&mdash;are quite obvious and self-evident and I think they have been fully endorsed by the recent Devlin Report.  If these Departments were combined we would not in this House have to continue, by way of piecemeal debate, to insist on securing closer and more effective co-ordination and planning of the agricultural functions of the Government.  This is a fundamental reason for advocating the integration of the two Departments&mdash;the possibility of operating the various agricultural services in the country more effectively and of ensuring more effective management of these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This would be enhanced immeasurably if we went back to the 1924 situation of direct integration of these two separate Departments of State.  Co-ordination in this way is a rational proposition which I strongly urge the Minister to consider.  I am disappointed that a small European nation like ours should have appointed a commission to investigate the State services and yet not take one iota of action on a major reform such as the Devlin Report advocated. <Col N="1149" /> I understand there may be a Cabinet division on this, but the point should have been stated for the benefit of the House.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that if there was integration of the Departments of Lands and Agriculture and Fisheries&mdash; and I would hope, in addition, to have arterial drainage and possibly the functions of the Board of Works affected&mdash; we need not in any way fear, as some public servants might fear, as indeed I should imagine particularly the public servants in the Forestry Division might fear, that there might emerge a monolithic, bureaucratic new structure. Although inevitably there would be more responsibility on the one Minister, there would be half a dozen assistant secretaries under the secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>This would ensure a much better intermeshing of the Departments, particularly in the formulation and execution of Government policy.  These things are self-evident and do not require any great elaboration.  Such a situation would give a shot in the arm to our agricultural policy which in my estimation&mdash;I do not claim any great experience of dealing with that Department apart from particular industries&mdash; is badly needed because the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries at the moment have not given any display of a sense of dynamism or innovation.</P>
    <P>I shall pass to another aspect of the Minister's contribution.  It deals with the life annuity scheme.  I strongly suggest that there should be a complete re-examination by the Minister and the Department of this scheme.  The Minister describes it as having had a moderate success.  I am afraid his choice of adjective was rather curious because this scheme has been a failure.  Let us be frank and admit that it has not had even a mild success.  Since its inception we have had a sparse 22 life annuities set up and although I appreciate the difficulty of purchasing land from elderly farmers, from incapacitated farmers, from blind farmers, in return for life annuities, and although I appreciate the intractability of this problem, the record of 22 life annuities since the <Col N="1150" /> inception of the scheme is a cause for serious concern.</P>
    <P>While the scheme is entirely voluntary, and while it would tax the imagination of the House to make it more effective on its present basis, it requires considerable examination.  I think the Minister should, therefore, set in train a complete reappraisal of the effectiveness of the scheme.  The very high hopes inspired by his predecessor two or three years ago have not materialised and, as I think the Minister implied in his opening speech, this scheme merits reconsideration.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects of the sale of agricultural land to non-nationals with which I wish to deal.  In dealing with a subject of an emotional character like this, we must put our cards on the table and ensure that the subject does not fall out of perspective.  Rapacity in terms of possession of land is not necessarily a characteristic of non-nationals; it is as rampant in Ireland as in Germany or any other European State.  I become slightly cynical about the show of self-righteousness which tends to develop on this topic.  Rapacity is not perhaps our original sin in Ireland but there is cause for concern in the fact, as mentioned in the Minister's speech, that in the past two years alone some 9,300 acres have been vested in non-nationals with the sanction of the Land Commission.  We are entitled to more information and explantation as to how this came about. The explanations given to the House for these sanctions are not adequate. The Minister stated that the types of property for which sanction was given could in most instances hold no attraction for the ordinary Irish purchaser. This, it was alleged, was the basic reason for sanctioning the sale of the bulk of that land.  But I suggest the Minister should be challenged to elaborate on what precisely he meant by that statement, in other words, that out of some 9,300 acres some 5,000 held no attraction for Irish purchasers and therefore sanction was given by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Without being evocative or trying to corner the Minister on an emotional topic I think he should inform the House on a general basis as to the <Col N="1151" /> location of these 9,300 acres sold in the past two years.  He might give us some details, county by county, or give us specimen properties, which were sanctioned for sale to non-nationals, to convince us of the validity of his assertion.  I think the amount of the sales and the proportions and implications are quite large.  I am not raising the question in any jingoistic, non-nonnational sense but to dispose of, I hope, or at least erase, the disquiet which many people have about the allegations made from time to time, that some Members of the House may have more than just a parliamentary interest in the sale of land to non-nationals. I shall leave that without elaboration, but I think it is worthy of comment.</P>
    <P>In our strictures in relation to non-nationals we should not ignore the abuse of our agricultural land resources by many Irish nationals.  We should not ignore the speculation by means of auctioneering which goes on in respect of Irish land and resources by native speculators.  We cannot segregate ourselves that happily.  We should not ignore the evidence&mdash;admittedly not great but still there&mdash;of tax evasion on farm losses by the manipulation and abuse of land and property by Irish nationals, and well-heeled ones, well known to the Cabinet.  These aspects of the matter should not remain unstated in the House because it is important that we should get the use and abuse of land into proper perspective.</P>
    <P>I share with the Minister his very considerable concern for the difficulties facing the Land Commission.  At times I felt the Minister was adopting, almost understandably, an attitude of half-despair that our land structure and infra-structural problems of Irish land will ever be resolved or even mitigated within our lifetime.  The evidence presented by him and by Deputy L'Estrange is a matter for serious concern.  There are some 350,000 farms in Ireland out of which 137,000 are farms of between five and 30 acres in size.  Four out of every ten farms in the country may be classified as uneconomic holdings.  The magnitude of that problem and the cold, <Col N="1152" /> harsh, agricultural realities behind the statistics should give us cause for serious concern.</P>
    <P>While a minority of farmers on, say, 30-acre holdings could, as I have seen done in Munster, by exceptional industry based on intensive dairying combined with fully efficient pig or poultry production, get a living&mdash;perhaps some could get a very good living &mdash;we must face, in the reality of Irish life, that the vast majority of 30-acre farmers cannot in the foreseeable future of Irish marketing trends and prices get the kind of livelihood that would stop them from wanting to leave the land.  It is not so much a question of a decent livelihood: it is not what they get from the land but the attractions to them off the land, in the relevant sense.</P>
    <P>We therefore have a massive structural problem of Irish agriculture on our hands.  The future of many farmers, whether we like it or not, seems rather black.  I do not know whether those in this House have the political honesty to face up to the implications of that statement, but it is time we stopped putting our heads in the sand and hoping that miracles would prevent the decline which has been and is there and which, in the context of present Government policies, seems likely to continue in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Another obligation devolves on members of the House, an obligation to act in a positive manner in relation to land.  Everybody in the House today spoke about the need to give people more land but nobody asked the question: for what purpose?  for what use?  for what concept?  for what idea?  In almost every speech we had this obsessive aspect of people wanting land and nobody indicating for what purpose or use.  This is an extremely difficult concept to get across because you get what may be called, and I excuse the Minister from it, the hack cry from some of the backbenchers of his Party who will say: &ldquo;There go the Labour Party again, taking the land from the people and devaluing the sacred heritage of the Irish people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We in this House have got to convince <Col N="1153" /> our people in many parts of rural Ireland that there should not necessarily be a perpetual national elevation&mdash;as it has now almost become in terms of the social attitudes of our people&mdash;of land, as such, which has, in many areas, destroyed family life in rural Ireland, which has, in many areas, crucified internal relations in townlands and which has, in many areas, almost completely perverted and distorted community relations all because, when an estate was divided, someone got five acres more than someone else.</P>
    <P>In some respects this has been fostered by the politicians down through the years.  So much so is this inbred into the historic and very necessary traditions of our people in respect of land and the possession of land, that today, in 1969-70, it has been elevated to a sacredness of concept which quite frankly at times I find nauseating and, in many respects, quite hypocritical. We have an obligation to say to many people in rural Ireland that a man with personal skill, with personal training, may be in a far better position living on one acre, or having no land at all, provided he has secure and well-paid industrial employment.  This is a type of concept which quite often we tend to ignore in our discussions with the people.  Rather do we tend to hope that someone will be on a 25 acre farm, secure in his rights of possession but locked for ever more in an uneconomic holding from which he will eventually emerge without a reasonable standard of life.</P>
    <P>There has been a total absence of any effort to convince our people that land is not held as a total and absolute and irrevocable right as such.  Some of our Church leaders might consider that concept and try to advise people accordingly.  I think land is held as a community trust.  Successive Irish Governments have failed quite miserably to convince our people that it is, in fact, an elementary concept of the ownership and possession of land, that it is held not as an irrevocable, personal, intrinsic right but in the form of a community trust and that, therefore, land acquisition for, say, the Forestry Division is perfectly justifiable in any <Col N="1154" /> social sense, that land acquisition for more equitable distribution is perfectly justifiable as well and, indeed, in many respects, very necessary.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would hope, if I may dispose of that point, that the current pathological obsession, if I may say so, of some of our politicians in regard to the possession of land will be reduced within the lifetime of this Dáil.  I would hope that we would impress on our people also that having one acre of land, having on it an industrial plant based, for example, on agriculture, giving full employment to workers on a regular production basis, is, in many respects, a more viable proposition and more conducive to economic development, than 100 acres producing, say&mdash; this may be controversial&mdash;milk, which in the context of current prices and in the context of current massive European surpluses, may be poured down the drain in ten years time.  Of course, one would be crucified in Irish politics for making these comments but I think they must be made if we are to revitalise Irish rural society.  These are aspects which are worthy of consideration. I would hope, also, that there would be an equal sense of realism with regard to other aspects.</P>
    <P>I want to pass on to what I would call the reality of the impending transfer of the Department of Lands to Castlebar.  I would not like to see the Minister becoming redundant in the Cabinet sense.  I think he could be far more usefully employed within the Government, if I do not sound too patronising.  There is a considerable need for the Government to re-examine the nonsense talked about the transfer of the Department of Castlebar.  I submit that there is need, as is evidenced in this House tonight, for constant communication between the Minister and his secretary, and the chief officers of his Department, which continually requires their presence in his office.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the spurious transfer of 700, 800 or 900 civil servants to Castlebar will necessarily resolve the problem of decentralisation. A decent decision by the Government to have an industrial growth centre in the West of Ireland rather than a bureaucratic growth centre in a certain <Col N="1155" /> area of the public service in Castlebar, would be much more conducive to sane economic development in that area. This is not just to say that the Labour Party deplore a transfer to anywhere, or that we are opposed to decentralisation as such.  This just is not a serious proposition.  I know it was fostered by the Minister's predecessor with certain locations and certain desirable attributes in the political sense in mind, but I do not think it is worthy of general support.</P>
    <P>Decentralisation in the regional development of the Forestry Division and the regionalisation and general dispersal on a provincial basis of the Forestry Division to where they are required throughout the country are much more desirable and logical propositions than having, God forbid, 850&mdash;I presume the Minister will keep about 150 of the executive staff in Dublin&mdash;of the Forestry Division staff allegedly based in Castlebar and 500 or 600 members of the Department of Lands also down there.  This approach should be examined and re-examined by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the work of the Forestry Division.  By and large, I am not too familiar with the work of the Land Commission.  In the past three or four decades we have built up a very considerable and major store of expertise in the field of forestry plantation and in the field of forestry management.  The expertise that is available is underestimated by the Irish people, unappreciated by us and, in some respects, unknown to many people.  This brings us to a central point in terms of State policy, namely, that it gives the lie to the concept that State enterprise is, of itself, inefficient, that State enterprise is, of itself, extremely bureaucratic and that State enterprise is not, of itself, in the long term interests of the Irish people.  The Forestry Division of the Department of Lands have given the lie to that proposition and given considerable hope for the future in terms of industrial development.</P>
    <P>Industrial relations in that sector of the Department are extremely good, by and large.  From my contact with <Col N="1156" /> union officers representing the 3,600 men employed in the Forestry Division, I think they can verify that comment. The work study innovations, many of which were of a pioneering nature, were land-marks in terms of effective management.  Therefore, we should not be unduly sparing in our praise for that Division of the Department.</P>
    <P>We might advance further on a number of fronts.  I would urge the need for an acceleration of the programme of acquisition for plantation, and so on.  This is giving cause for concern in the Forestry Division.  In 1961-62 we acquired 32,000 acres; in 1963-64 we acquired 29,000 acres; in 1968-69 we acquired about half of that only, about 14,000 acres, some 17,000 fewer than were acquired seven years previously.  The slowing up of acquisition gives cause for concern.  Admittedly, there is a decline, naturally, in the stock available and the potential development.  There is bound to be a syphoning-off and a slowing down, but I submit that there should be a sharp examination within the Forestry Division and under the Minister's auspices to find out how best this programme of acquisition for plantation could be developed.</P>
    <P>Another proposition I would put before the Minister is in connection with the thorny problem of State sponsored industries based on our forest resources.  In the formation of policy in this regard the Cabinet has shown little imagination.  The time is now ripe for a feasibility study by the Government, indeed, by the Division itself, admittedly on a long-term basis, perhaps, 1975 or 1980, of the introduction of a State-sponsored enterprise based on our expanding production of wood pulp.  I appreciate that at the moment piecemeal industrial projects based on our growing pulp and timber resources must be encouraged.  However, I find it contradictory that the resources of the State, the expertise of the public service, financed by the taxpayers should be for the sole benefit of private enterprise companies, either foreign or native, producing chipboard, newsprint, hardboard and so on.  I know it may not be pleasant for these commercial enterprises to <Col N="1157" /> learn of the impending State interest in this field, but it is logical that as our resources expand in the decades ahead, we should not confine ourselves to private enterprise.  We should, in accordance with the wishes of many Irish people, set about establishing a State-sponsored enterprise based on forestry resources.  As I say, this is planning many years ahead, but this should give cause for an even greater sense of innovation in the Forestry Division.</P>
    <P>Regarding the forests themselves I would suggest to the Minister that he should open up more effectively the resources of the State forests to the children and the youth of our nation. Coming from a typical concrete, suburban area of Dublin, I am very conscious of this.  There are now 500,000 acres of forest in the country, and 25 per cent of that is certainly mature enough and close enough to the major urban areas to provide a golden opportunity for the further education of people of all ages and for the development of recreational facilities on a controlled basis.  It is only right that people reared in suburban or municipal environment should be able to acquire an appreciation of the wild life in our forest.  I would strongly commend to the Minister that in association with teachers and parents he would enable thousands of children and adolescents who languish in our cities in the early spring and in the summer months, to enjoy our national heritage and discover what is really Ireland.  I would also hope that school transport facilities, which lie unused in the summer months, would be made available for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a special plea to the Minister, as Deputy Tully did, to improve the conditions of employment of forestry workers.  Very often they work in exposed and wet conditions.  I often feel that if the Members of this House spent a couple of months in the winter digging a few trenches on the side of a hill they would become less obstreperous&mdash;I am thinking particularly of Deputy Lenehan who is not in the House at present&mdash;and would be more appreciative of the work done by these forestry employees on our forest estates; and that the Minister and <Col N="1158" /> other Members would readily concede the rightful demands of these workers for adequate shelter and adequate cooking and heating facilities.</P>
    <P>On arterial drainage schemes there are a large number of workers who have a major degree of skill, for example, workers familiar with difficult excavation work, with the maintenance of heavy mechanical equipment, with heavy dumper work and so on.  Some of these workers complained that when they were asked to transfer from the Moy to the Boyne there were not available to them adequate transport and resettlement allowances.  Such workers who make a very considerable contribution to the development of our lands should be treated much more generously on transfer within the arterial drainage scheme.</P>
    <P>With regard to the pension schemes of workers in these services, I am extremely critical of the cynical attitude, one might even say the attitude of complete indifference on the part of successive Governments towards the pension entitlement and death benefit entitlement of workers employed by the Board of Works and other bodies within the State.  It is a serious reflection on our so-called Christian concepts of social equality that such workers, after a lifetime of service to the State get a mere pittance of a Queen's gratuity, to use the old term.  After seven years and up to fourteen years service, they get a gratuity of one weeks pay for each year of service; after fourteen years service and upwards they get two weeks pay for each year of service.  Is it any wonder that there should be such cynicism, apathy and frustration among these workers when they witness the golden handshakes of the power politicians, when they witness the special care and consideration given to those who serve their party well, when they witness the generous pension and mortality schemes for bank management personnel, for industrial workers and others in outside employment?</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would urge the Minister to ensure that the various Government Departments, in consultation inevitably with the Minister for Finance, at least give generous terms on a par with what other industrial <Col N="1159" /> workers get when they meet the unions. I think there is a meeting pending on this matter.  I hope this large body of workers, who have given tremendous service to the State, will be given their basic pension, superannuation and mortality entitlement.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his contribution.  I was immensely impressed by the concern he has shown for conservation generally. While I must advocate the rationalisation of his Department I have no doubt that the considerable understanding which the Minister has acquired from his own constituency of the problems facing the people in the West of Ireland and throughout the country could be made to bear even more fruit if the Departments were amalgamated and if he were given even greater responsibility within the Cabinet itself.  With these reservations I welcome this Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few brief observations on this Estimate. I cannot agree with the point made by the previous speaker about the abolition of the Department of Lands. Very few people in rural Ireland would be inclined to agree with it either.</P>
      <P>There are certain aspects of this Department which the Minister could look into because there is room for improvement.  In particular, I should like to refer to the working of the Land Commission and how it has functioned. I come from a constituency where we have a lot to do with the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much criticism of the Land Commission, principally because of the grave delays in the working of it.  It is very frustrating to have long delays in the acquiring of land, whether compulsorily or voluntarily, and the reallotting of that land.  Sometimes the whole operation may take four or five years, as it is doing in my own constituency. There appears to me no necessity for this delay in either the compulsory or the voluntary acquisition. Once the Land Commission get interested in a place an inspector goes out, inspects it and makes his report. In some cases it takes several months before a decision is made.  The <Col N="1160" /> decision-making with regard to the acquisition of land should be done within four weeks and instead of letting these places over a period of years&mdash;at a loss, I would say, in most cases&mdash;they should proceed with all haste to have them re-allotted.</P>
    <P>I know one of the reasons for these delays is the lack of personnel to carry out these duties.  The Minister should take a very serious look at this to see whether he should employ more officers.  These officers are mainly agricultural graduates and if the rates of pay were as good as the local agricultural committee's rates there is no reason why the Minister should not be able to get plenty of these officers.  In my own county up to last year there were two officers and now there are five. A reasonable increase in the activity of the officers has taken place.  A number of acres has been re-allotted, although last year it did not seem as if there was any likelihood of this taking place.</P>
    <P>We appreciate that the purpose of the Land Commission is to acquire land and to re-allot it, thereby relieving congestion.  This is its main function, as far as I am concerned.  In order to do this the Land Commission have to get land either in the county where the congestion exists or outside that county.  In many cases they acquire big holdings outside the counties of the West of Ireland and they take small-holders out of congested areas into places like County Meath under a scheme called the migrants scheme. Deputy Tully referred to some of these migrants as amateurs.  I fail to see how any of these men could be described as amateurs.  From my own experience the Land Commission screen all applicants very carefully, and to qualify in the first instance the person concerned must already be a farmer.  How a person who is already farming can be described as an amateur when he goes to County Meath is beyond me.  The Land Commission not only establish the fact that he is a farmer but they also take a look at how well he has been farming to see whether or not it is worthwhile giving him an improved holding.  In most cases the choices they make are excellent ones.  The people <Col N="1161" /> they choose are a loss to their own local community more than anything else.  Of course, Deputy Tully is quite entitled to make his case for getting more land for his own constituents but the Land Commission have in the past, I understand, found it was not a good practice to give land to landless people.  This happened in my own county and it finished up later in the hands of one person and the whole purpose of giving a living to many people rather than to a few was defeated.</P>
    <P>With regard to the acquisition of land, the most desirable method is the voluntary method, the method of buying on the open market.  There are cases where the Land Commission have to move in and acquire land on a compulsory basis.  The system of acquiring land on the open market is open to some criticism at the moment. I have in mind two particular cases of land offered for sale by public auction. They were advertised for at least four weeks in the local press.  There was ample time for the people in the area concerned to make representations themselves, or through their local representatives, to have these lands acquired.  The local inspectors must surely have seen them advertised.  The auctions took place, the deposits were paid and the contracts were signed.  A week or two after the auctions the Land Commission became interested and after several weeks they decided to proceed to acquire these holdings.  I know there must be congestion in the area and the point I am making is that this congestion should have been known to the Land Commission before the day of the public auction.  In one case they started to acquire the land last May and the sale has not yet been completed.  The vendor in this case is very seriously handicapped, as in all such cases, because the person concerned has decided to go into another line of activity altogether.  They were planning on doing so during the summer. They assumed that the sale would be closed within a few months&mdash;a period by which many sales are closed. There is still no sign of this sale being closed.  The sum involved is £8,000. There has been no firm decision as to <Col N="1162" /> whether the person will be paid in cash or land bonds.  As far as I am aware, the delay is due to the fact that the solicitor for the original purchaser applied for expenses.  This should not be a valid reason for not closing the sale.  The Land Commission could have dealt with that point afterwards and could have closed the sale so that the person would be in receipt of cash, I hope, and would be proceeding with the line of activity he had in mind.  Of course, the purchaser also suffers hardship when such delay takes place.</P>
    <P>Another point to bring out is that if the vendor lodges an objection and the objection goes as far as the land court, it means that the auctioneer&mdash;many people do not seem to have great sympathy for the auctioneering profession but I happen to be an auctioneer&mdash;is deprived of his fees.  That is an injustice. I know of cases where it has happened in the county&mdash;not to myself but to another member of the profession.</P>
    <P>If the Land Commission by land which is put up for public auction, but not within one month of the auction, the auctioneer is not entitled to his full fees as he would be if the land were sold by public auction.  These are a few points that should be rectified.  I do not see why anyone should be victimised because of the slow manner in which a Government Department proceeds.</P>
    <P>The Minister should reassess the whole position with regard to the acquisition of small holdings.  I am speaking now in relation to congested areas and small holdings of perhaps 30 or 40 acres or even less which come on the market and which the Land Commission acquire for allocation to smallholders in the area.  It would avoid delay and trouble not only to those looking for the land but to those offering the land for sale and to the Land Commission if the Minister adopted some scheme whereby loans would be made available to one or two handpicked persons in the area.  I have in mind cash loans.  I realise that the amount of cash available to the Land Commission is very restricted.  I do not envisage very large amounts of money. The holdings in question would be small holdings.  If such loans were made available to help people to purchase <Col N="1163" /> this land it would expedite the operation and it would mean that people who were entitled to have land would have it more speedily and could get on with their farming.  The Minister should consider making some form of advances available to these people to help them purchase holdings that come on the market.</P>
    <P>The trouble I find about the migrant scheme is that the Land Commission continue to accept applications.  They are certainly not getting sufficient land to accommodate all the applicants.  In Clare, last year, there were 74 migrant holdings allotted to the county.  One of these was so bad that it was turned down by everyone to whom it was offered.  It was even turned down by people from other counties.  There are hundreds of applicants to be considered. It is ridiculous to have these people chasing after every public representative asking him to get their applications dealt with.  The list should be closed, at least temporarily, until some impression is made on the applications already received.  This would avoid a great deal of trouble for everyone concerned.  Applicants who are living in hope of one day getting a better farm in an area where there is better land available for migrants let their houses get into disrepair and very often do not put into the land what they would put into it if they expected to spend the rest of their lives there.</P>
    <P>The other migrant scheme, the voluntary migrant scheme, I gather, is not working very well.  It has not meant a great deal.  It is ridiculous that there should be a ceiling of £10,000 in respect of this scheme, especially having regard to the current market value of land.  I have not had the opportunity of selling land in Meath, Kildare, or places where the good land is, but I do not think that £10,000 would buy very much land or any reasonable size of holding there.  The ceiling should be raised to at least £20,000 if the scheme is to be made workable.</P>
    <P>I do not mean that a man who has a holding worth £3,000 to give to the Land Commission should get £17,000. He should not, because he could not hope to pay it back and he would <Col N="1164" /> only get into trouble but, definitely, where holdings are being offered to the Land Commission the ceiling should be raised.  The sum of £10,000 is of no value in the purchase of a farm at current market prices.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which applies to Clare in particular rather than to any other county in the west of Ireland. It concerns the definitions of congested areas and non-congested areas.  All the areas in the west of Ireland, including Kerry, are deemed to be congested areas.  In Clare there are three areas deemed to be non-congested&mdash; Limerick rural, Ennis rural and Corofin rural.  This is a most unsatisfactory position.  The area of Ennis rural takes in land which is described as snipeland and at the other extreme there are fattening lands with very high valuations. The people in the bad lands within that &ldquo;non-congested area&rdquo;, the Ennis rural, are severely handicapped in the matter of land division or in regard to the migrant scheme.  I understand that if they are migrated they will not qualify for reduction in rent.  Outside these &ldquo;non-congested areas&rdquo;, in the &ldquo;congested areas&rdquo; in the county there are good lands with very high valuations. This is an anomaly which should not be allowed to continue.  I see no reason why Clare should be treated differently from Galway, Kerry or any other county.  The same facilities should be available in Clare as are available in any of the western counties.  The Minister should look into this with a view to making the necessary changes.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the work of the Department of Lands to which I should like to refer.  It has to do with game re-stocking, gun clubs, and so forth.  The easiest way to illustrate the point is to give an example.  This year a gun club in North Clare has taken over an area of 640 square miles, which is a great deal of the county.  They have got a grant from the Department of Lands in conjunction with Bord Fáilte, which is in the region of £1,800, for the re-stocking of this area.  They have erected insignificant notices all over the area to the effect that the lands are preserved.  I appreciate that lands have to be preserved if we are to build up our game resources and that this has <Col N="1165" /> some tourist value.  It is debatable how much.  As far as I know, the people in the hotel in Ennis who pioneered this scheme for the last ten years have now come to the conclusion that it is not of any value to them.  However, the hotel is not my concern.  This vast area is very good for shooting.</P>
    <P>The people of a place like the town of Ennis, with approximately 10,000 population, who like to exercise with their guns over the weekends, are now deprived of the right to shoot over this area.  I have made many inquiries and find that any member of the gun club which got the grant and which preserved the area is entitled to shoot over it.  The obvious answer, then, was that the people of Ennis should all join the gun club.  I think the name of the club is the Tubber Gun Club.  Some of them have already tried to join and have failed to secure membership.  The Minister must agree that this is a grave injustice.  All this area is now denied to the people of Ennis or, indeed, to the people of any other town in Clare.  I should like to know if the grants are used strictly for the purchase of game and restocking.  Is there any stipulation that portion of the money must be used for pest control?  If there is not, then there should be because pests such as grey crows, magpies and foxes cause more havoc than all the guns in the county.  The Minister should ensure that portion of the grant at least is spent on pest control.</P>
    <P>The people in the area are very perturbed by a rumour that a syndicate has been formed by outsiders who are charging so much for shooting rights over these preserves.  I do not know if the rumour is true, but it is certainly circulating.  If it is true, then that is another injustice.  Any club which gets a State grant should be compelled to have membership open to any Irish man or woman who wants to join.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister once again to take a hard look at the working of the Department, to speed up the working of the Land Commission and so obviate the frustration suffered by the people concerned and the Deputies who make representations on their behalf.</P>
    <Col N="1166" />
    <Speaker pid="GodfreyTimmins" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister's statement covers practically every aspect of the activities of his Department we should, I think, have set out in greater detail the amount of land held in each county by the Land Commission, the length of time the land has been in the possession of the Land Commission, the amount of land divided in each county over the previous 12 months and the total area of land held at the time the Estimate is presented to the House.  Deputies should have that information to enable them to see at a glance the up-to-date position in their own constituencies.</P>
      <P>Land Commission officials are very courteous to Deputies seeking information but a great deal of the work of the Land Commission goes on without Deputies knowing anything about it and without their knowing the manner in which land is divided and allocated.  I do not say this by way of criticism because I believe the Commissioners work conscientiously and diligently within the guidelines laid down by the various Acts, but, at the same time, the situation should not exist in which one hears, as a matter of local gossip, what decisions have been reached in the allocation of different farms throughout the country. There should be greater liaison between the Minister and officials of the Land Commission and members of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one looks at the priorities governing the allocation of land one sees that farmers' sons and landless men are very far down on the list and they do not qualify at all in almost 100 per cent of cases.  The time has come when the Land Commission should ask if this is a desirable position, a position in which we should persist.  It is appreciated that there are close on 140,000 farmers with under 30 acres of land and that there is not sufficient land to bring everybody up to what is regarded as an economic unit, but I think the energies of the Land Commission should be directed towards providing land for young, enthusiastic people who have more than proved their worth on their fathers' farms.  Because of the efforts of various Departments and rural organisations over the last number of years the <Col N="1167" /> young people today have more scientific and technical knowledge of farming than their fathers ever had, plus all the enthusiasm of the young.  The only thing they have not got is the land upon which to demonstrate in a practical way the knowledge they have acquired.  If we are to build the type of society we would all like to see and increase the economic prosperity of the country we must ensure that all the land, all the capital and all the labour of the country are properly employed.</P>
    <P>How can we bring about that position when the guidelines laid down for the allocation of land bar the very people who have the requisite ability from securing the essential raw material?  Every year the highest hopes are expressed here about the provision of land for those in this particular category.  But hopes are not enough. The time has come when something positive must be done.  It should not be impossible for the Minister and his colleagues in the Government to introduce some scheme, even a scheme based on loans at a reasonable interest rate. If the Government can provide loans for those who surrender their land to enable them to buy bigger farms in other areas surely a scheme like that could be extended to include those who are looking not for help but for an opportunity to improve their own position and the economy of the country as well.  Local organisations have done more to educate young farmers than 50 years of departmental effort.  What is required now is an outlet for that education.  In many areas you have the people with the ability and the enthusiasm but they cannot bid for land on the open market.  I trust the Minister will look at this aspect of the workings of his Department to see what can be done to provide these young people with an opportunity here at home.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of gratuities to ex-employees.  The Minister said that the average figure paid over the past year was something in the region of £240 per head.  Surely that is a very small sum by way of compensation to those whose source of income has been taken from them.  The Minister must surely be aware that in many parts of <Col N="1168" /> rural Ireland employment is very limited.  When a person who may be well past middle age loses his source of income the Minister should use his good offices to ensure that such a person is paid a reasonable gratuity in view of the hardship caused to him in many cases.</P>
    <P>Another hardy annual is the question of access roads built by the Land Commission to estates that have been divided.  I am sure members of local authorities, in particular, realise the position that exists here.  Local authorities maintain it is not their responsibility to put these roads into proper repair.  The Land Commission should have left them in a better condition when they handed over the estates.  I would ask the Minister to get the Land Commission to black-top these roads.  If he does so, I am sure local authorities will be prepared to take them over and maintain them, but only if the Land Commission play their part in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The one-mile limit was mentioned by many speakers in connection with the allocation of land.  We have heard how very genuine applicants who live just outside the limit might not qualify whereas people within the limit, not nearly as deserving from a personal and from a national point of view, would qualify.  In view of modern transport and machinery, the Minister would be well advised to remove that limit and thus ensure that the land is given to deserving people who will make the best use of it.</P>
    <P>Co-operation is the keyword in many fields of activity.  It is well that the Land Commission and the Minister are examining how to strengthen the economy of the small farmer by encouraging more co-operation.  As in everything else there will be problems in this field, but a tremendous amount of good can be accomplished.  I exhort the Minister to press ahead in this field of endeavour, irrespective of the problems he may meet with and have to solve.  Another matter I wish to mention is far removed from what the Land Commission was originally set up for but it is worthy of mention here.  I refer to the provision of land for the building of houses by local authorities wherever it is feasible for <Col N="1169" /> the Department of Lands to provide it.  I know it is not the function of the Department to provide local authorities with land for building but the Land Commission can come to the rescue of local authorities in many rural areas.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to encourage co-operation in this respect.  The Department may be in a position to give local authorities land adjacent to towns which is suitable for development without in any way interfering with the provision of economic divisions for people to whom it is intended to allocate land.  There should be more co-operation in this matter between the Department and the local authority. When the Department consider they have this particular type of land available, they should notify the local authority concerned of the fact and of the amount they would be prepared to give.</P>
    <P>The Minister feels the amount of land being acquired for forestry is sufficient to reach the planting target of 25,000 acres within the next few years.  It is hardly necessary for anybody to emphasise the benefits of afforestation.  If a proportion of the money which the Government have spent over the years on misguided ventures had been used instead for forestry purposes we would today be reaping a very rich harvest.  Ireland is one of the poorest-wooded countries in Europe although its climate is most suitable for forestry.  Many types of timber mature here in fewer years than they take to mature in other parts of Europe.  We have large areas going waste which are suited only for afforestation.  Forestry gives employment in the planting stages and that employment carries through into aftercare, as well.  It is one method of providing fairly regular and consistent employment in many places.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Department on the establishment of the new forestry school extension at Avondale.  It is a very important addition to the forestry service staff training system.  As in other spheres, refresher and specialist courses are necessary in the Forestry Branch. This building will play a very real part in keeping all the staff up-to-date with fresh knowledge and techniques. <Col N="1170" /> Credit is certainly due to everyone concerned with the provision of this facility.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the increased use of State forests as tourist attractions.  I do not think Ireland has any county with as many forest areas of outstanding beauty as County Wicklow.  There is much room in this connection for co-operation between the Department and the various bodies fostering the tourist industry in the provision of roads, parking bays, and facilities for picnics which would add enormously to the attractions of the area.  I must criticise the Department over the years because although there has been so much afforestation in Wicklow no industrial development in the timber processing field has taken place within the county.  Let us hope that in any future programme very favourable and careful consideration will be given to Wicklow in this connection having regard to the advantages of having industries sited adjacent to the necessary raw materials.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter to which I should like to refer.  During the year a deputation from the Wicklow Sheepowners' Association met the Minister and officials of his Department in connection with the fencing around State forests in County Wicklow. They pointed out the problem which had arisen where fences had been allowed to deteriorate and finally break down.  People with hill-grazing rights, on going to collect their sheep for dipping, were unable in many cases to collect them because many of the sheep were lost in the State forests.  Perhaps the Minister, in conjunction with the Sheepowners' Association, would try to avoid a recurrence of this trouble. Regular and periodic inspection of the fences should be carried out.  It would be a simple matter to repair existing fences if the deterioration was noticed at an early date.  Possibly it would not be prudent to ask who was responsible for the deterioation of the fences in the first instance.  I hope the Minister and the officials of the Department will continue consultations with the sheep-owners until this problem is finally resolved. The problem which has arisen in County Wicklow over the last few years could arise in other counties <Col N="1171" /> within the next few years as the forests grow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put on record my best wishes to the new Minister for Lands.  Irrespective of what some speakers may say about getting another Minister from the west I, who am from the east, am quite certain that the new Minister will bring about desirable changes in the Department of Lands.</P>
      <P>First of all, I wish to refer to the annuities charged to allottees by the Land Commission.  At the moment people in the congested areas, such as displaced employees or migrants, get their land at half the annuity, whereas people who get an addition to their holdings in areas not defined as congested areas have to pay the full annuity.  This may have been all right some years ago when land was cheap. Today, those of us who are associated with the people who have got land from the Land Commission know that they are being asked to pay anything from £8 to £12 per acre for their land annually.  Take, for example, a man with 25 acres who gets from the Land Commission a further 20 acres to make up what is, in the eyes of the Land Commission, a viable holding&mdash;something I did not agree with.  Such a man has to pay approximately £300 per annum by way of annuity.  We heard from the farming community some years ago about the problem of rates. They were strongly organised, got together and voiced their opinions through the press, radio, television and every other means.  The small farmer has not got this means of making his problem public.  It is a bigger hardship on a small farmer of 40 to 50 acres to pay £300 or more by way of annuity than it is for larger farmers to pay this amount in rates.  I will continue to press that something should be done about halving the annuity in order to alleviate the hardships created all over the country.  I am satisfied that people in my area who have got portions of land from the Land Commission will be unable to pay the annuity. There is no need to go further into this question.  The facts are quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1172" /> I referred to the fact that I do not consider an area of 45 acres in the part of the country I come from to be a viable holding.  I come from an area where mixed farming is carried on. Such an acreage may be sufficient in areas where milk is produced and where farmers rear cows and can have 35 cows on 50 acres of good land.  Let us look at a farm of 45 acres in the midlands where a farmer would grow wheat and beet and rear dry cattle.  He might have some cows for creamery milk.  He must have crop rotation.  The paying of an annuity will be a big problem on such a farm of 45 acres. So far as I am aware the Irish Sugar Company will not allow one to grow beet in a period of five years from the previous sowing of beet.  If one grows beet this year he would not be allowed to grow it again for five years.  It would not be possible on a 45 acre farm to have proper rotation of crops.</P>
    <P>Many of the experts today speaking on farming maintain that 45 acres of land is not a viable holding.  Officials of the Land Commission whether inspectors or those who allocate the land take a liberal view of this.  A holding of 45 acres of good land is mentioned in the Act, with a somewhat larger acreage if the land is of varied quality.  This &ldquo;land of varied quality&rdquo; is an open sort of phrase.  In the allocation of land as we go along I hope that the Land Commission will take an even more open view of what is an economic holding.</P>
    <P>The life annuity scheme introduced in 1967 was availed of by about 22 farmers.  I know this from the Minister's statement.  We all welcomed this scheme and we were hoping that old people living on many of the derelict farms would avail of the scheme.  I know that negotiations are going on in many areas.  The Minister is probably well aware of the thinking behind these negotiations.  In many cases relatives were living elsewhere and waiting for the death of an uncle or aunt on the derelict farm.  Such relatives would then come to the funeral grieving but knowing they would naturally by heredity take over the farm and work on it. Since this scheme was introduced in 1967 many of those old people have nephews, nieces or friends caring for <Col N="1173" /> them and also caring for the farms. This is an aspect of this life annuity scheme that has probably slowed down the handing over by older people of land to the Land Commission for a pension and the use of the house for their lifetime.  If it did that alone it is certainly good for the economy and good for the old people themselves.</P>
    <P>Under section 5 of the Land Act the Land Commission can tell a person in a congested area to look round for a farm and that they will look at his farm and if it is suitable for division they will give him a loan to buy the other farm.  This is a desirable thing and I am sorry to read in the Minister's statement that so far it has not been very successful.  There are many things involved in this.  A man may not find the right type of farm or his own land may not be suitable to the Land Commission for the purposes of the resettlement programme.  However, I am satisfied that if this scheme were extended to the whole country there is no doubt that much good work could be done.  Take the case of a man with 15 or 20 acres living in a congested area in Laois, Carlow or Kilkenny, the Land Commission could tell him to pick out a nice 50 or 60 acre farm and buy it and his 15 or 20 acres would be there for the Land Commission for resettlement.  I could never understand why this scheme was not extended to the whole country.</P>
    <P>Many small farmers have approached me&mdash;I am sure they have approached every Deputy&mdash;having seen farms for sale and asked if there was any way in which they could get loans from the Land Commission and the answer is simply that there is not. Such men can go to the bank or to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and look for loans but, generally speaking, the men with 15 or 20 acres are not creditworthy and will not get enough money from the bank or the ACC to purchase 50 or 60 acres.</P>
    <P>While on this subject, the ACC have a scheme whereby a small farmer can get a loan of up to £2,000 to purchase a piece of land beside him.  I could never understand why this scheme or a similar scheme could not be operated <Col N="1174" /> by the Land Commission on a nationwide basis so that if 20 acres came up beside a small farmer with 30 or 35 acres he could go to the Land Commission and get a loan of £4,000. There could, of course, be four or five people near this piece of land with uneconomic holdings and which does the Land Commission select?  Selection could be made with the very same machinery that the Land Commission uses at present.  An inspector goes out and decides that Mr. X is the proper man to fix up.  If the Land Commission have a small piece of land at the moment they do not divide it up into pieces of two or three acres.  They pick out, perhaps, two people and divide it between them and hope that more land will come up for the others. Many Deputies know the trouble they have got into over things like this.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the Land Commission for the wonderful improvements they are making in the houses they are building, the tarmacadam roadways and the lean-to haysheds they are providing.  If one looks at the original houses built by the Land Commission and compares them with the houses they are building now and the way their farmyards are laid out and haysheds and lean-tos provided one can see the improvements that have been made.</P>
    <P>We always heard the complaint that the Land Commission kept the land a long time and that it was run out before people got it.  That was a very sound complaint because this did happen through no fault of the Land Commission but through the fault of the people who took it in conacre, knew it would not be theirs and decided to get the best they could from it and good luck to whoever got it next.  The new policy of the Land Commission of liming and fertilising the land, doing a certain amount of reclamation by removing scrub <i>et cetera,</i> will be of great benefit to the people who get the land.  We must face the fact that a person who gets land from the Land Commission is not a person with much capital because if he was uneconomic he could not have much capital and if he is a migrant he migrated because he was in a congested <Col N="1175" /> area and was not making a very good living.</P>
    <P>In the field of loans for housing at the moment the Land Commission will give a farmer a loan of £500 towards the building of a new house or £500 to supplement grants from the Department of Local Government or his county council.  There is no doubt that the Land Commission should move into the field of providing housing for farmers.  We know that in latter years in keeping with the traditional small farm policy of the Fianna Fáil Government they have given an increased rate of grant to small farmers.  Today he can get, with his local government grant and the Department of Local Government grant, £900, this on a graded system up to £60 valuation. However, if a farmer of 30 acres wants to build a new house, qualifies for the £900 by way of grants and gets a loan of £500 from the Land Commission this amounts to £1,400.  This will not go far towards the provision of a new house.  We know that many small farmers can get local carpenters and masons and that they put in a lot of work themselves but, even allowing for that, I know a man who did this and his house cost him £2,200.  I would strongly urge the Minister to increase this loan to something in the region of £1,500.  Many of us would like to see it go higher but it would be desirable to get it up to that anyway.  If a small farmer gets an SDA loan from the county council his repayments will be about £4 a week on £2,000 and this might be a burden he could not bear.</P>
    <P>In the debate on last year's Estimate there was criticism by Deputies of the links between local authorities and the Land Commission so far as land for housing was concerned.  When we in Carlow approached the Land Commission for land for the purpose of house building in villages or near towns we were always facilitated.  I do not know where it happened that the Land Commission did not facilitate local authorities but in Carlow they have gone out of their way to do so.  We know this creates a problem for the Land Commission because they get very little land and when a county council is looking for land for houses <Col N="1176" /> it often happens that they want the best of land.  As far as Carlow County Council are concerned I want to thank the Land Commission for their co-operation in this field.  Every Deputy knows that when one looks for land for housing today one pays and pays dearly for it.  Usually you have to have a CPO to get it.  I will conclude by again wishing the Minister every success in his new Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking on this Vote for the Department of Lands I welcome the net increase this year of £305,000 allocated to the Minister for Lands.  That is necessary because to my mind what has impeded the development of the Department of Lands and the Forestry Division over the years is an inadequate injection of funds to provide adequate staff and an adequate pool of land on which those men would be employed.  Therefore, I welcome that necessary provision.</P>
      <P>Many suggestions have been made regarding the best method of improving the activities of the Land Commission and the Department of Lands. It has been suggested, in fact, that one of the best alternatives is to scrap the Department entirely but I cannot advocate that policy.  In fact, my views are in direct conflict with any scheme which would either abandon the present Land Commission, as we know it, or which would join it up with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  I believe the importance of the Department of Lands cannot be over-stressed and to those people who reside remote from this city and from the built-up areas all over the country the work and the activities of this Department are really very important. They rely in the future on the policy and the scope of that Department to be extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the best methods of extending the scope of the Department which I would recommend to the House is the setting up of pilot areas all over the country and the promotion of a proper understanding between the officials of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Department of Lands and the Forestry Division and the officers of committees of agriculture. <Col N="1177" /> I would recommend the pooling of all those resources and afterwards the dissemination of that knowledge to the country by the Department of Lands.  I have seen the results of the pilot areas.  I have seen the concentration of activities by all the officers I have mentioned into one area and proper consultation with the farmers concerned who had land to offer.  This was all done in a voluntary way. Acquisition was not compulsory.</P>
    <P>The advantages of this are very obvious.  We had many farmers offering holdings which were not adjacent to their own.  We have seen a big pool of land being acquired.  I would compliment all those concerned and all those who did such great work to see that this scheme was brought to a successful conclusion.  An extension of this method is the best thing the Land Commission could do in order to increase the pool of land available.</P>
    <P>In the West of Ireland we can never hope in many areas to have economic holdings but we can undoubtedly, when we have a pool of land available, add to the acreage of a holding.  I would advocate to those people who wish to live in the traditional holding to hold on to their holdings and I would suggest to the Minister for Lands if he can acquire further capital that it be administered through his Department in setting up in congested areas small industries where holdings will never reach the proper size to be economic. He should approach the Minister for Finance in a realistic fashion regarding this matter and he should treat it as urgent.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that this little scheme could be administered through the Land Commission.  From what I have known of the gentlemen in that Department they have a proper understanding of rural life and of the people who intend to live on the land.  I would advocate that we should continue to buy land in the open market and compete.  Certainly, if we are ever to strengthen the small holdings of the uneconomic holders we have to compete and pay the market value but we should also keep in mind that it is necessary not to outbid the small farmer who wishes to acquire for his <Col N="1178" /> son a holding on which to live.  If we want to increase our agricultural production we must rely on those young men who intend to give their lives to hard work on the land and there should be no obstacle placed in their way.  Every encouragement should be given by every Department to place funds at the disposal of those young men.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that it is very necessary that housing loans should be provided for those people in rural areas who intend to improve their premises. I feel rather disappointed that we have no increase in this regard this year. It still stands at £75,000, which is the same as last year.  Even at this stage some adjustment could be made on that figure.  I have no doubt that the greatest impediment we have at the moment towards the voluntary acquisition of land is the payment in land bonds.  I always refer to the acquisition of land in a voluntary way because we should avoid compulsory methods as far as possible.  The Minister has heard enough of the bad effects the payment in land bonds has.  We have the situation in which one Minister is compelled to pay a portion of the purchase price on land in land bonds and the Minister for Finance will not accept the land bonds in payment of death duties.  We should give some thought to that and we should adjust that method.</P>
    <P>I had great faith in the scheme introduced under section 6 of the Land Act, 1965, which provided for a life annuity for elderly and incapacitated people.  However, it is disappointing that the scheme is not working as effectively as we would wish it to work. However, its introduction has made it possible for those who wish to do so to hand over their holdings.  In a congested area there will never be an offer of big acreage and I would therefore ask the Minister to advise inspectors in the different counties to accept any smallholdings offered, if they can do so within the Act.</P>
    <P>Very often when land is acquired by the Land Commission there is a considerable delay before it is subdivided. It is my opinion that these delays are caused because there is not adequate staff in each county to deal with these <Col N="1179" /> matters.  The tendency is to blame the Land Commission inspector, but the real reason is the general inadequacy of staff.  In cases where land is not divided immediately, I ask the Minister to consider arranging for the holding to be fertilised and limed so that the land, when it is eventually divided, will be productive.</P>
    <P>The process in regard to the scheme for migrants is a slow one.  The choice of farm is often very limited.  However, if we continue as we are doing, we will give greater encouragement to people to avail of this scheme.  Many people whom I know of in the pilot area I have mentioned have reacted promptly to those inspectors who visited them.</P>
    <P>I note that approximately £228,000 was provided for the acquisition and resale of land in 1968-69, but this year it is approximately £333,000.  I thought that provision could and should have been made for a greater increase because it is on this that the whole scheme of division is built up&mdash;the acquisition of a proper pool of land.</P>
    <P>There is an indication of some improvement within the Forestry Division; there appears to be an air of greater activity and a greater awareness of the necessity to move faster with regard to re-afforestation.  It is necessary that we should invest more money for the provision of State nurseries.  I see no change here in the grant for afforestation purposes and I should like to know why this is so.  It was obvious that a serious step was being taken with regard to plantations for which there is an increase of approximately £160,000.</P>
    <P>Getting back to the division of land, I should like the Minister to remove the impediment which prevents Land Commission inspectors from giving land to cottiers who, because they are without receivable order, are not eligible for a division of land.  In no case should these people be prevented from getting land when it is being divided around them because it may be their last opportunity of acquiring a few acres on which to graze a cow or two. The Minister should consider this because the tendency in rural areas is to depopulate and discourage rather than to encourage people to stay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1180" /> Those cottiers are the people who have provided the material for our Army during the years and also, of course, for our labour pool.  We depend on them for the future.</P>
    <P>If the Minister would ask his inspectors to make an investigation of turbary areas and to build up in so far as is possible a pool of turbary plots, these could be re-allocated to deserving cases.  Many people are no longer using their turf banks because of the different methods of cooking and heating.  If an investigation were made it would reveal that in some areas there are 50 or 60 applicants for one plot making it practically impossible for a Land Commission inspector to do anything but stick a pin in the list and give the plot to some person who had applied.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the former schemes of road making and drainage in boggy areas being reintroduced. These would provide local employment as well as creating proper roads on which the heavy transport of today, tractors and so on, could move without difficulty.  There are some areas where there is still adequate scope for that service.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see a man from the West in charge of this Department.  I assure him and his officials&mdash;during the years I have had experience of the patience and understanding of the officials&mdash;of my personal co-operation towards an objective approach to improving and consolidating the Irish Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of necessity, I shall be very brief.  I have just a few cribs and suggestions.  Deputies in the Labour Party, including Deputy O'Donovan, suggested that the Land Commission be abolished.  The Land Commission were set up in 1881 and I do not know what kind of a Deputy would suggest that, when an institution of that sort have progressed and improved during the years, that institution should be abolished.  The Land Commission have been a regulatory body and in 1923 we were enabled by a stroke of the pen to alter the position so that tenants of landlords were made tenants of the Irish State.  To abolish <Col N="1181" /> the Irish Land Commission as a regulatory body would create a situation in which there would be need for the Whiteboys and the others. Apart from being a regulatory body, the Irish Land Commission are almost a police force and because of the acquisitive nature of our people in regard to land I do not know what kind of an Irish landscape would result from their abolition.</P>
      <P>There are a few points I should like to put to the Minister.  I ask him to have another look at section 7 of the Land Act&mdash;the section that halved the annuities.  One Fine Gael Deputy spoke of it.  I come from a migrant county, from Clare, but I live in Westmeath and I find that when migrants come there they find themselves side by side with people who pay twice the annuities.  I think that is wrong.  It is difficult to know what it would cost to eliminate this anomaly, but it would not cost more than £75,000 a year.  I therefore ask the Minister to have another look at section 7 of the Land Act which is producing second-class citizens.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot of talk about land bonds.  There is an inflationary situation at the moment, but the 4½ per cent land bonds of 1923 held their own for many a year.  I do not know when the next issue will be or what the rate will be, but I think it will be around nine per cent.</P>
      <P>I suggest that voluntary migration from congested areas should be extended throughout the country.  In North Longford and in Westmeath there are congested areas.  Farmers who give up their land in congested areas, shop around for a suitable place and get loans from the Land Commission. If that were spread throughout the whole of Ireland there would be a nice cross-pollination of farmers from North Longford and elsewhere settling in County Meath.  I suggest the scheme should be extended to the whole of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The panel of auctioneers should be scrapped.  It is like a sacred cow, of which we have a few in Ireland.  It has been there since the days of John Brown.  John Brown's body is mouldering in the grave and so should the panel of auctioneers.  I know an <Col N="1182" /> auctioneer in Westmeath who sold three farms of 350 acres but he could not have the letting of that land after the first year.  The letting goes to somebody else, to someone who is on the list.  For God's sake get rid of that panel of auctioneers.  They may all have been Fianna Fáil originally but they are not now.</P>

      <P>The Deputy and I came out of the same stable.  If an auctioneer sells land to the Land Commission, let him have the letting of it until it is divided.  Reference was made to the role of the Land Commission when we become members of the EEC.  There would still be need for a regulatory body.  There is one case I should like to bring to the Minister's attention.  The Land Commission gave 100 acres of land, and built a nice house on it a few years ago, to a migrant.  I have here an advertisement from the <i>Westmeath Examiner:</i></P>
      <P>Modern bungalow on 56 acres of land overlooking Lough Owel for sale by public auction.</P>
      <P>The migrant is keeping 50 acres and selling the bungalow and the rest of the land.</P>

      <P>Of course, you cannot very well attach conditions to a person who comes from a resettlement area and who has given up his original farm for resettlement, but this highlights the kind of thing that can happen.  I will pass on the details to the Minister.  The two points which I wish to put to the Minister again are the extension of section 7, opening migration to the whole country, and the abolition of the auctioneers' panel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Deputies have congratulated the Minister on his appointment and I wish to join with them.  The Minister represents the constituency which I come from and <Col N="1183" /> I can freely say he will be enthusiastic and sincere in his efforts to solve the problem with which he and I are so familiar.  In speaking on this Estimate I find certain difficulty due to the fact that the Minister is as familiar with the problems as I am.  Perhaps it is true that, because of his training as a solicitor and his experience as a solicitor in Mayo and outside it, he would have one angle on things and that perhaps I would have another. Because he engaged in business with many of the people there he gained much knowledge and experience of their problems, particularly the problems of the smallholder.</P>
      <P>I live in a village made up of small-holders, roughly four miles from the town of Foxford.  In that area, thanks to the efforts of the Sisters of Charity in providing and maintaining Providence Woollen Mills, congestion was relieved by the provision of work for approximately 200 in that factory. Smallholders in the area who have one or two members of the family in the mill or the county council or the Forestry Division have no serious problems. The people who have real problems are those without cash incomes, small land-owners.  Their plight formerely, as the Minister knows, was that down through the years they had to go to England for seasonal employment to supplement the meagre incomes from their holdings with money earned in the hay fields or potato fields of England.  That way of life was accepted by former generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the problems under which these people laboured and in many cases the Land Commission have helped by rearranging holdings and giving additions to holdings, even in Mayo.  Many others were migrated to Meath and Westmeath and other places and began a new life there and they have done very well.  They are now bringing up families or have reared families.  I met some members of these families who are now in big business in the city, company directors, members of the professions and so on. It is not true that the Land Commission have been an absolute failure. I do not agree that the Commission <Col N="1184" /> should be abolished.  I think it is necessary to retain them and make use of their excellent staff many of whom I know to be people of integrity, anxious to help as far as possible.  They are very approachable.  Their upbringing and background was ideally suited to equip and train them for the work they are now doing.</P>
    <P>Because I was reared where congestion exists I am familiar with the difficulties Land Commission officials meet in their work.  Deputies and elected representatives who are in close touch with the public hear outcries from time to time about shortcuts that could be taken.  Why, it is asked, do the Land Commission not acquire and divide this land or migrate people?  One would imagine there was a press button system which would make everything work out right. Things are not as easy as that.  It is amazing how fond a man of 65 or 70 becomes of the rural holding where perhaps he had many days of hardship and difficulty when it is suggested to him by his son or daughter that if it was good enough for him it is not good enough for Paddy or Jack who feels he should go to England or some faraway place and start anew.</P>
    <P>Many people who had applied for an exchange of holdings when it came to the time to transfer, even though the Land Commission had done their best to help these people to solve their problems with the aid of the considerable sums of money involved in the process, refused to move.  Others yielded to the pressure and took flight. Anybody without experience and understanding of the mentality of these people cannot appreciate the difficulties the Land Commission have.  The work is much more difficult than many people appreciate.  If we have not got the results we should like to see, that is one of the reasons.  There are many others.</P>
    <P>You cannot divide land unless you have a pool of land available.  The price of cattle and sheep and other farm produce has a big bearing on Land Commission activity.  In slump periods people sometimes, when they find themselves with a loss instead of a profit at the end of the year, become <Col N="1185" /> frustrated and fed up and in a moment of despair offer their holding to the Land Commission.  A short time later, because of an improvement in the price of cattle and sheep the position changes and some who offered their holdings will withdraw.  Time and efforts of field and office staffs are taken up by people who, understandably, cannot always make up their minds about what they should do.  It is a big decision, particularly for a farmer in Mayo, to give up a holding of 20 rocky, mountainous acres and go to Meath, Westmeath or another county and start farming 50 or 60 acres without the necessary capital or stock.  If his family are weak he faces a very serious problem.  Many who migrated in the past really got going as a result of their families being forced once again to leave their holdings in Meath and Westmeath and go where their fathers and grandfathers went, to England to go into employment with McAlpine or some other contracting firm for the purpose of earning money to come home here and try to get the farm working.  I met those people.  Many of them told me how they solved the problem.  Many of them have made a very good &ldquo;go&rdquo; of things and are now doing very well.</P>
    <P>I have more than 20 years experience of dealing with this type of problem. At one time, as the Minister knows, I was closely associated with the former Minister, Mr. Blowick, who was anxious to help the people of his own county and, for that matter, people all over the country, as is the present Minister.  At that time I would have up to three dozen or, perhaps, 40 or 50 people calling on me in one week, thinking that I could press some sort of magic button to contact the Minister for Lands, and that they would be sent to another part of the country. No doubt to a lesser extent the Minister has the same experience today.  I have it very seldom now.  There are people who are anxious to get additions to their holdings, but the number of people who call on me now and make representations for the purpose of getting an enlargement of their holdings or exchanging holdings and going up to the midlands, is down to a trickle in comparison with what it <Col N="1186" /> used to be many years ago.  There are a number of reasons for that.</P>
    <P>We know that the small farmer in the West of Ireland with a valuation of £7, £8 or £10 is eligible for free hospital treatment and a number of other free benefits.  He is eligible for the dole.  If he works over a period he can draw stamp money.  The Land Commission inspectors have called on some of these people and have actually offered them holdings of land in order to try to solve the problem of congestion locally.  In other words, they would get a holding of land in Meath or Westmeath or Kildare or somewhere else valued at £7,000, £8,000 or £10,000 despite the fact that their own holding at home was valued at, perhaps, £2,000.  They refused to leave. Some of them living within half a mile of me spent about £2,000 to build their own homes on those uneconomic holdings rather than take the plunge and leave.  I admit that they would not be a very adventurous or progressive type of people.  People are reluctant today to take large areas of land, particularly if it involves the employment of labour because then they are going into another category altogether and are not eligible for free hospital treatment and other social welfare benefits such as the dole.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, there is a tendency today to look for a job with a five-day week, a 40 or 44-hour week, plus overtime.  The people I referred to at the outset who are employed in the Providence Woollen Mills &mdash;and the Minister can make inquiries into this; he is probably as conversant with it or nearly as conversant with it as I am&mdash;and the people who are employed by county councils and on drainage schemes are quite happy as they are because they have, if you like, the best of both worlds.  They can stop work on Friday night and be free on Saturday and Sunday to have a little enjoyment, while the man with the big farm&mdash;the man with 100 or 200 acres; and there are a few of them in Mayo&mdash; is tied to his work Saturday and Sunday and finds great difficulty in getting workmen to work for him.  Naturally, he wants his workmen to work on Saturdays and Sundays but that day, if it is not gone, is going very quickly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1187" /> I have stated what I know to be true. There is not the same interest in rural Ireland today in getting additions to holdings of land and in getting increased acreages, as there was in times gone by.  I am already on record in this House as advocating the policy of the enlargement of holdings in Mayo, more migration to the east, and getting more small farmers out so that we would have a greater pool of land locally.  Now I have been won around to the idea&mdash;and I see it from practical experience&mdash;that you can go too far with that policy.  It is a very costly one today.  We know that the price of land in Kildare or Meath or any of those counties is in the region of £100 or £200 an acre.  To migrate one family today when you consider that it costs, perhaps, £10,000&mdash;I am not quite sure of the figure; I speak subject to correction; I know that the Minister and his staff will have some averages&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be £12,000 to £14,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a shocking figure.  With your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I will now refer to an area with which the Minister is very familiar, namely, Midfield, which is a very congested area.  The people in that area continue to go across to England.  In the old days they worked in the coalmines.  They sent the money home and their wives managed on the three, four, five acres.  Somebody with ten acres would be regarded as in the rancher class in that region.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission, thanks to the efforts of a good official who came from Deputy Taylor's county, County Clare, went in there, got down to it and sorted it out.  He must be a wonderful man.  He did not get his head chopped off because, while they do not value land too much in that region, they like to have the little bit they have.  I think he met with a good measure of success.  A number of people were migrated from that area but, while it solved one problem, another was created.  It is well known in the town of Swinford that the best customers that ever came into that town were the people from Midfield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1188" /> While on the one hand it solved one problem and provided those people who were migrated with a good holding&mdash;and many of those people were well &ldquo;hipped&rdquo; in the pocket with money&mdash;it created another problem at local level for the merchants and others in that town and in Charlestown as well.  There was not much migration from the Charlestown region but we know that as a result of the migration of certain families, and as a result of other people having packed up and gone across to England, problems were created in those towns.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have another look at the whole position.  I once advocated a policy of migration and I still say the holdings should be enlarged at home as much as possible, but it should always be borne in mind that when you migrate people you are breaking up local community life.  The school suffers and the town suffers.  It can be noticed in the churches and in the markets and fairs and marts that the people are gone and that those who can stay are those with the small holdings and the cash incomes.</P>
    <P>This Minister is wasted in the Department he is in now unless, as Deputy Desmond suggested, he is given additional work to do.  The Office of Public Works and the Department of Fisheries, which are tied up with his work as Minister for Lands, should be under his control.  He is a man of energy.  He was an athlete and he is youthful.  He has the ability and should be given greater responsibility.</P>
    <P>Many people in the West of Ireland, particularly in the coastal areas, depend to a lesser or greater extent on fishing to supplement their incomes, but I am not at liberty to discuss that at length on this vote.  Arterial and local drainage is also of the greatest importance to the people on uneconomic holdings.  It would be good business to carry out drainage schemes, whether under the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries land project or through arterial drainage, in order to keep these people on the small holdings.  Side by side with that, if they are to survive at all, it is essential that they should be provided with an adequate cash income.  If they have to <Col N="1189" /> be on the dole&mdash;I hate that word &ldquo;dole&rdquo; but for the time being we must live with it&mdash;I would appeal to the Minister to increase these allowances. If we are to keep our people on the land it will be necessary to subsidise them, and this policy has the support not alone of our Government but of the bishops, certainly the bishops in the western counties.</P>
    <P>Colossal sums of money have been spent by the Department of Lands in providing houses and giving assistance for building to people in the western regions.  If the Minister cares to come to my native village I can show him half a dozen bungalows which were constructed on this basis.  In recent times a large sum of money was spent in renovating one of these bungalows which was vacated only a couple of years ago.  It would be a tragedy if these bungalows were allowed to go. There are several others, for instance, in the villages of Culduff and Midfield for which generous grants were given by the Department some years ago.</P>
    <P>Some of these houses have been vacated on a long-term basis and others short-term.  These houses with small farm buildings could be renovated and would provide living accommodation for many families who are in bad housing and are anxious to be re-housed.  Are we going to allow the taxpayers' money to go down the drain?  The owners of these houses, perhaps, pay rates and rent to a local solicitor; I would not be in a favour of any compulsory measures and I know that that would not be the Minister's idea either, but they should be asked if they would sell to the Land Commission.  Perhaps we could get them for £1,000 or £1,200, and they would be well worth buying because you could not erect them today for less than £3,000 or £4,000.  I shall co-operate with the Minister along these lines.  This is the first time for some time past when there has been an Estimate on which I could even speak briefly on this subject.</P>
    <P>It would be well worth the Minister's while to make a study of the position around Foxford, my home town.  About a mile outside the town going towards Ballina there is a village <Col N="1190" /> where every bungalow has a worker. Its valuation is £5 to £7.  There are a motor car or two and a television mast to be seen outside every house; they have transistor radios, washing machines and everything else.  You will find there are no debts in the shopkeepers' books in the town where these people are employed, because these people have the best of both worlds.  Let the Minister also go down by the post office, along by the woollen mills and he will find there is traffic congestion.  I do not know if any of them have a Mercedes like the Minister but there is no sign of poverty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that I know the Minister is in touch with his constituents.  We are neighbours at home, and we will pass from the political scene and a new set will come along.  He and I and the other Deputies for the county would be anxious to do everything we can to solve the problems as economically as possible. The present generation take a different view of things from that of the previous generation.  There is a new outlook, five-day week and so on.  At the same time, we should do our utmost to keep them out in the country instead of having them coming into town where there is already a housing problem which Mayo County Council, for instance, were trying to solve up to 11 o'clock last night and with which they did not get very far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1191" /> I hope I am not misunderstood in any of the things I have said.  It is very easy to misrepresent a person.  Time was when it would not be safe to say some of the things I said here this evening.  However, I have said them; I believe they were constructive, and I hope it will give courage to the Minister to embark on a holder policy of trying to solve the problem within the area rather than looking for holdings in Meath, Westmeath or some other place for these people.</P>
    <P>Somebody referred to the remark made by Deputy Tully that some of these people were not very experienced. I know very well what he was referring to.  It is true that a small number of people many years ago, who lived in the fishing villages of Connemara, were not accustomed to agricultural land.  They were given holdings mainly because their homes were not so good.  I can well imagine the standard of farming they operated along the western coastline in Connemara and I know it would have been a shock to them when they saw the rich lands of Meath.  In the early years they would have been faced with many problems but they have solved them. I would resent any remark made by any Member of this House which reflects on the misfortunes of these people.  If they had not been given these holdings they would have had to go to Pearse Station and take the train and boat to England in order to keep their families in Ireland.  They made good homes out of these holdings and in their present surroundings they are a credit to the country.  They have preserved their language, they have preserved their faith and we should not grudge them anything they have got.</P>
    <P>With regard to afforestation, some people seem to think you can start planting trees here, there and everywhere on a Monday morning.  The acquisition section of the Department of Lands has played a great part down through the years in helping the overall effort to have forests established. Taking it by and large, they have met with great success, but we do have an acquisition problem.  When an inspector calls to inspect a holding he <Col N="1192" /> may find that the occupier's brother, who is co-holder, is in Australia, America, or England.  It is unlikely that the brother will ever come back. I know an Act was passed which made provision for doubtful titles but I do not think much land ever came in because of it.</P>
    <P>The first problem that arises when dealing with these people is that the land is not suitable for afforestation by reason of its exposure to the sea breezes or because it is too near the sea.  I am not competent to comment on whether or not those are valid reasons; I have to rely on what the experts say.  Some people say that, if you start planting at the sea, after you have gone inland a few hundred yards everything will be all right.</P>
    <P>A considerable acreage of land has been acquired in Mayo down through the years and a lot of forests have been planted which are now at varying degrees of maturity.  They are a great asset to the community.  A lot of useful money has been expended in wages, in payment for land and in the construction of roads and all these have helped to bring employment to the people of Mayo.</P>
    <P>It would be a good thing if more land suitable for afforestation could be acquired within the county but I realise that the position has been aggravated somewhat by reason of the fact that sheep and cattle prices have increased in the last couple of years and as a consequence people who would have been very anxious a few years ago to dispose of such land are now reluctant to do so.</P>
    <P>Some offers have been made by the Forestry Division for land in Mayo and I would ask the Minister&mdash;he is all powerful in this matter, unlike the case of the Land Commission, and when he makes a deal in forestry it is binding, subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance&mdash;to be more generous about the price paid.  In the year 1969 there is no use coming along and offering £1, £2 or £3 an acre for land because nobody is going to take that sort of money.  It should be appreciated that the value of money has depreciated and if the Forestry Division <Col N="1193" /> want to acquire land they will not do so by making a mean offer to a countryman.  Unlike businessmen, these people do not have deals every day in the week; they weigh up all the pros and cons and consider what their families abroad would want them to do.  The acquisition section would be enabled to buy more land in Mayo, and thereby provide more employment, if they were more generous in the matter of price.</P>
    <P>We are lucky enough in Mayo to have the most beautiful scenery in Ireland. The forests that have been planted have contributed their share to improving the overall position.  The suggestion put forward by Deputy Desmond this afternoon that children should be brought on tours of these forests and shown some of the wonders of nature there is a wonderful idea, and I endorse his point of view.  As the Deputy said, the buses will be idle for a couple of months in the summer and it would not cost very much to take these children on a tour on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon.  That would provide a very happy outing, particularly for children in the towns, who might not have an opportunity, by reason of the fact that their parents or relatives do not have a car, of going there.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to assure the Minister of my help and co-operation. I repeat that I feel he is capable of greater things than being Minister for Lands in control of the Department as presently constituted.  I feel he should be given more control and more work to do.  He should be given full control of the Office of Public Works, full control of the Department of Fisheries.  If he can use his influence within the Government to have these responsibilities made part and parcel of his work, I shall be glad to see him with that power and authority.</P>

      <P>First of all, I wish to welcome the Minister to his new Department and to wish him good luck in it.  I sincerely hope he will be successful in the Department even though it is one of which I personally have never been particularly enamoured.  The Land Commission is usually the object of abuse.  Ministers in my time have <Col N="1194" /> come and gone and the policy of the Land Commission, as far as I can see, has never changed or has changed very little.  I often wonder is it that the policy never changes or is it that the Land Commission have no policy to change.  When the Land Commission was originally established it was envisaged that it would operate for a period of about 30 years, that matters would be settled up and there would be no necessity for the Land Commission. That has not happened.  The Land Commission are one of the finest examples of Parkinson's Law that I can imagine.  The less land there is to divide the greater the number of Land Commission officials.  The more experts they bring in and the more nonsense they preach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not been as lucky as the last speaker.  Nevertheless, I should like to take this opportunity of extending very sincere good wishes to the Minister for Lands on his appointment.  Bearing the name he does, I am sure he cannot fail in all his efforts.</P>
      <P>The debate on the Estimate for Lands usually takes the same line year after year.  A comparison of introductory statements by various Ministers for Lands and of speeches by Deputies as reported in the Official Report over the past 25 years reveals that they are practically identical.  There is little variation in the expressions of opinion and views put forward by those interested in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1195" /> I have a few observations to make which I should like to go on the record. Appeals for increased production and encouragement of farmers, by a good agricultural policy, to make use of the facilities that are provided for them to increase production on the land, are of no avail unless the producers have sufficient land.  That brings me to the point that the Land Commission as at present constituted has performed all its functions.  Even though the last speaker may have been out of order in speaking for a second time on the Estimate, he was not altogether incorrect in what he said.  The Land Commission was set up as a temporary institution. It was never intended to be a permanent institution.</P>
    <P>What is the life-span of the Land Commission?  Is it now proposed that the Land Commission should be a permanent institution?  Or, have the Government any plans to incorporate the work of the Land Commission in other schemes to help small farmers both from the point of view of increasing production and relieving congestion? These problems have been tackled by the Land Commission but they do not seem to have achieved their objectives.</P>
    <P>The flight from the land, emigration, and the fact that a large number of small farmers are leaving the land are indications of what can be described as a collapse in rural Ireland.  How can that be remedied?  That can be remedied by relieving congestion.  That is one of the responsibilities of the Land Commission.  Let us ask ourselves, can the Land Commission do any more than they are doing?  The Land Commission is a big body that moves very slowly and that is bound up in miles of civil service red tape which prevents the Land Commission from exercising, speedily and efficiently, its functions in regard to the problem of congestion.</P>
    <P>There is a very low marriage rate in rural Ireland, probably one of the lowest in Europe.  There is the problem of congestion.  That low marriage rate, that problem of congestion, and the poor standard of living available to very many smallholders are matters which should engage the attention of <Col N="1196" /> the Minister for Lands and the Government. Therefore, I advocate the establishment by the Department of Lands of a rural development authority in which would be incorporated the work of the Land Commission and which would enlist the support of all voluntary organisations in rural Ireland.  The relief of congestion and the enlargement of existing holdings cannot be achieved in our lifetime by the Land Commission as at present constituted.  If the Minister for Lands wishes to make a significant contribution to the solution of these problems, he must tackle them earnestly and seriously.  The suggestion has been put forward that a rural development authority be established.  The Land Commission needs to be reorganised in that context.</P>
    <P>I would be critical of the manner in which the annual report of the Land Commission is produced and presented. Apart from a rearrangement of figures, the reports for the past ten to 15 years are identical.  Provision should be made for the incorporation in the annual report of a table, county by county, of statistics clearly showing the areas where congestion exists; what steps have been taken within the past 12 months to relieve congestion, and the acreage of land allocated for the relief of congestion.</P>
    <P>There is no practical liaison between county committees of agriculture and the Land Commission.  County committees of agriculture, through their advisory services in particular, are in a position to give very valuable information to the Land Commission to assist that body in solving the problem of congestion on a county basis.  We are told in the annual report that £X have been spent on the relief of congestion and the acreage of land allocated for the relief of congestion is given, but there is no indication as to where that land has been allocated.  That is why I say there is an absence of information about the activities of the Land Commission. I would ask the Minister to depart from the present method and to give more details and statistics, county by county, so that we may have a picture before us and be in a position <Col N="1197" /> to compare, year by year, the progress of the Land Commission in their efforts to solve the problem of congestion.</P>
    <P>There are still many holdings which cannot provide a good family living. There are many large tracts of land which could be, should be and must be divided if the smallholder is to remain as part of our agricultural economy. The State has a duty to keep people on the land if people want to remain on the land.  Many smallholders are put to the pin of their collar to eke out a miserable existence.  Many take conacre at £25, £26 or £27 an acre and, at the end of the 11 months, they have to surrender the land.  Having spent money on fertilisers and so on they find the land is someone else's the following year.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission will have to tackle the problem of congestion in a more serious fashion.  Everyone knows the problem is being tackled in accordance with laws passed by this House. We all know we cannot advocate legislation on an Estimate and we cannot expect the Land Commission to do what the laws of this House do not permit it to do.  It is for that reason I urge that whatever steps are necessary will be taken within the next 12 months so that the problem of congestion may be tackled in a more practical way.</P>
    <P>We all know that there are more applicants for land than there is land to allocate.  First, let us create a pool of land to allocate in areas where there is congestion.  Let us decide what is an economic unit.  Opinions on this very because the quality of the land varies.  I believe an economic unit is between 50 acres and 60 acres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>An economic unit should provide ample tillage, grazing and meadowing.  One of the main reasons given for any inability to solve the problem of congestion is that there is a shortage of money to purchase land to relieve congestion. That is a ridiculous assertion.  If the Government are serious in their efforts to provide land and if they are serious in tackling the problem of congestion funds must be placed by this House <Col N="1198" /> at the disposal of the Land Commission. It is high time that we scrapped this idea of paying for land with land bonds.  People shy off offering land to the Land Commission because they do not want land bonds.  They want to put their land on the open market&mdash; they are entitled to do so&mdash;because on that market they will be paid in cash. Experience has shown that landowners have suffered serious financial loss through dealing with the Land Commission on the basis of land bonds.  The system is unsatisfactory. The Government should examine this and the Land Commission should enter the public market in competition with other buyers of land and they should pay cash for any land they buy.  If they do that they will have little difficulty in getting a substantial pool of land.  They will not get it as long as they persist in paying for land with land bonds.</P>
      <P>It may be argued that a very substantial sum of money will be required to purchase land for the relief of congestion. What is wrong with that? Why should the present generation pay the full cost?  The same bizarre system exists in regard to the purchase of a house; the man buying a house is expected to pay for the house in his own lifetime, even though he is providing a stake in the country for his family and those who will come after him.  I agree with Deputy Nolan that a contribution of £500 to a smallholder for the erection of a house is of very little assistance, though it is appreciated in present circumstances.  If we intend to provide small farmers with houses then we must be prepared to provide sufficient money for that purpose.  I agree with Deputy Nolan that the smallest sum should be £1,500, repayable not in one lifetime but in the lifetime of those who will go on living in the house after the owner is dead and gone.  The State is sound. The lifetime of a house is 100 to 125 years.  The lifetime of a tenant will be possibly 40 to 60 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State should seriously consider an investment of this nature on a long-term basis.  We are too much concerned with what is described as &ldquo;good, sound book-keeping&rdquo;.  The man who has no house or only a very small holding is <Col N="1199" /> little concerned with book-keeping.  He is concerned with having a house in which to rear his family and with having a holding of a size sufficient to enable him and his family to obtain a decent standard of living from the land.  The Land Commission should deal with this matter with more courage and determination than they have displayed in the past.</P>
    <P>I often wonder if, on the shelves of the Land Commission, in addition to the other recommendations to which I have referred, are to be found Mr. Whitaker's economic development plan.  They may be hidden away somewhere and covered with cobwebs and dust.  One of Mr. Whitaker's recommendations was some form of State-aided development whereby an aspiring farmer would be enabled to rent land until he could afford to buy it. The third report of the capital advisory committee contains the recommendation that land held by the State should be rented on short-term leases to promising young men.  As the Land Commission is at present constituted, that cannot be done.  I do not believe Mr. Whitaker made his recommendations for fun.  This is a sound, commonsense recommendation: likewise, the third report of the capital advisory committee.  Some steps should be taken to deal with a problem of this kind by putting lands into the hands of people who are anxious to work them.  Many farmers' sons are well prepared and equipped to work land but, unfortunately, are not in a position to purchase land on the market.  Such people should be assisted to rent or lease land with the option of purchasing it from the State.  The effectiveness and functioning of the Land Commission should completely be reviewed.  I hope that, in the coming 12 months, steps will be taken to carry out such a review.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have referred to the Land Commission annuity.  For migrants, the annuity is half what it is for people outside the congested area. If a smallholder outside a congested area gets an addition, he must pay the full economic rent.  Are we serious about solving the problem of congestion when we offer land to a person <Col N="1200" /> knowing that he must refuse it owing to the excessive rent demanded for it? Many smallholders in the midlands have been offered land by the Land Commission but, unfortunately, a number of them had to withdraw their applications owing to the excessive rent which would have to be paid for it.  That matter should be rectified.</P>
    <P>I come now to other recommendations which, like Mr. Whitaker's report and others to which I have referred, have seemingly not been acted upon. I refer to the recommendations of Macra na Feirme and the National Farmers' Association, otherwise the NFA, which were unanimously agreed to at meetings of the national councils of Macra na Feirme and the NFA as far back as October, 1963.  The first recommendation made to the Government was the immediate enactment of legislation to preserve the land of Ireland for the people of Ireland.  What has been done about that?  I asked the Minister a Parliamentary question about the purchase of land by non-nationals. I am 100 per cent opposed to any non-national getting agricultural land in this country where there are local congests anxious to receive additions to their holdings in order to eke out an existence in their own country.</P>
    <P>If land is required by an alien for industrial purposes, no one has any objection.  We have a bounden duty to provide agricultural land for our own people.  I congratulate those responsible for the setting-up in recent months in this country of what is known as The Land League, a law-abiding organisation which brings smallholders and small farmers together with the object of ensuring, within the law, that the land of Ireland will be for the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Is it not extraordinary in this day and age, when we can send rockets and men to the moon, that, here in Ireland, an Irish landowner may not take a fish out of a river that is flowing through his holding?  Is it not extraordinary that both fishing and shooting rights are denied to Land Commission tenants?  Some positive action should be taken by the Land <Col N="1201" /> Commission to see that such rights are the property of the tenants.  Some steps should be taken to prevent land falling into the hands of aliens.</P>
    <P>We were given to understand, when the last Land Act was going through the House, that foreigners would not be allowed to purchase land.  The 25 per cent stamp duty is only a small amount of money to those people who come here to purchase land.  Even if the duty were 50 per cent the land would still be very cheap compared with the price they would have to pay for land in the countries of their origins.  The Minister for Lands told us on the 22nd October, 1969, that there is a table giving particulars of the relevant transactions.  There is a record kept by the Land Commission in accordance with the provisions of the Finance Act, 1961.  There are records in the Land Commission of payments of stamp duty.  There are no records of aliens kept there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is such a record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to get that information from the Minister.  I had an interesting letter from the Land Commission informing me that such records were not available.  I will return the letter to the Minister shortly and hope that the information I sought will be forthcoming.  I was told that no records were kept of the nationality of aliens owning land in this country. There was no record of the acreage of the land held or of the location of the land.  If the Land Commission are serious about preserving the land for Irish people they could address a communication to every garda station or to every county committee of agriculture&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The gardaí are far too busy already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the gardaí are overworked because duties have been assigned to them which make it impossible for them to discharge their duties efficiently.  Every agricultural instructor knows his area, the occupiers of it and how the land is worked.  If a query were addressed to <Col N="1202" /> each such officer by the Land Commission in less than three months we could have a proper estimate of the amount of land held by non-nationals.</P>
      <P>There have been 462 transactions involving 7,999 acres where the 25 per cent stamp duty was exempted.  This was for industrial property.  Nobody objects to such transactions which may be a means of providing employment for our people.  It is better that foreigners should start industries employing our people at home rather than that our own people should emigrate to work for such foreigners abroad.  I object to the 399 transactions in which 36,500 acres were transferred to non-nationals since the last Land Act was passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were 191 transactions exempted from the 25 per cent stamp duty on the recommendations of two lay commissioners of the Land Commission. If any two lay commissioners decide that a particular alien is entitled to come in and buy land he may be exempted from the payment of the duty.  Two lay commissioners permitted 191 aliens to get away with the 25 per cent duty.  A total area of 9,336 acres was involved.  I object to foreigners taking over the land.  It is wrong and neither the Minister nor the Land Commission are effectively doing their duty if they allow the land to fall into the hands of foreigners.  It is bad enough to say that a man is not able to take a fish out of a river flowing through his own land or take a shot at a bird flying over it during the shooting season, but it is an extraordinary state of affairs to see thousands of acres of land being given to non-nationals while we have smallholders deprived of a reasonable standard of living.  Foreigners can come here and use our lands as a pastime. There is an estate on the Tipperary border in my constituency owned by an alien lady who frequently visits here for the purpose of walking around her estate.  In the same area applications have been made for land by local smallholders and cottage tenants.  Many of these people are grazing cows on the road because they are not in a position to pay for grazing while this alien lady can enjoy the fruits of ownership as a pastime.  I am referring <Col N="1203" /> to an estate near Cloughjordan.  I have asked the Minister to investigate this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>What about our native land speculators?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them are not too good.  I am more concerned about the alien speculators.  If we dealt with them now we would be able to deal with native speculators later.  Aliens are not coming in for the love of Ireland or to spend money but because they can get cheap land here which is a good investment for their money.  They should not be allowed to come in and buy up land while there is a problem of congestion.  A former German ambassador appealed twice in a public-spirited manner to his own people asking them not to purchase agricultural land in this country because of the history of land here.  There has been a land history in Ireland since the Norman invasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot blame the Germans for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not blame the Germans for the Norman invasion. The land, the faith and the language are very near and dear to the hearts of Irish people.  Many of the aliens who come here to purchase land do not know our land history, do not know of the Land Wars, of Parnell, Davitt and Dillon, of the congestion problem which exists to this very day.  These people come here not knowing how sacred the land is to the people of Ireland and how treasured it is.  That is why I would ask the Minister for Lands to consult with the Minister for External Affairs and with all embassies in this city and ask them to appeal to their countrymen, as was done by the former German Ambassador, to leave agricultural land for the relief of congestion and tell them that the purchase of such land by aliens is strongly resented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We may be inclined to paint a different picture; but if one goes down the country and talks to people one will see that such land purchases are resented very much.  It is only right that, before another non-national puts <Col N="1204" /> his head into the noose by the purchase of a large tract of agricultural land, he should know in advance that whatever agricultural land is on the market should be used for the relief of congestion.  We are told that many of the purchases of land by non-nationals is of land of too poor a quality for any Irish smallholder to take over.  I would much prefer to see that land given away for nothing to our own people, and let them make the best of it, rather than to see people coming from the four corners of the earth to make money out of it while our own people &mdash;farmers' sons, many of them the sons of old IRA men who fought to set up this State and this Parliament&mdash;must emigrate.  The least they are entitled to is a decent standard of living on the land of Ireland in preference to some alien who comes here because he looks upon Ireland as a happy hunting ground where he has shooting, fishing, hospitality and where he can purchase what can be described as dirt-cheap land in comparison with land prices on the continent and in other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>The responsibility of the Irish Land Commission should be to implement in so far as it is possible the recommendation that was made as far back as 1963 by both Macra na Feirme and the NFA &ldquo;That legislation be enacted immediately to preserve the land of Ireland for the people of Ireland.&rdquo;  The NFA and Macra na Feirme were right in their demands.  That demand is still in the hearts of all of our people in rural Ireland.  Many of them cannot express that opinion for reasons best known to themselves, but those of us who are free to speak can say that it is only right and proper that the land of this country should belong to the people of this country.  For the information of the Minister&mdash;he may have read it but it is no harm to quote it again&mdash;I will read the second recommendation of the recommendations of Macra na Feirme and the NFA at that time.  I quote:</P>
    <P>That all purchases of land, whether freehold or leasehold, be controlled and that the following set of priorities in order of presentation be adhered to:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1205" /> (i)  To make the existing uneconomic holdings of Irish farmers into viable units.</P>
    <P>(ii)  To provide viable holdings for Irish farmers willing to give up their existing holdings in congested areas.</P>
    <P>(iii)  To provide viable holdings for suitably qualified Irishmen who are at present landless.</P>
    <P>These recommendations were submitted to the Land Commission and to the Minister for Lands, and I submit that they have not to date been implemented. I strongly recommend them. It should be no crime for any Irish Parliament or any Irish Government to take practical steps to ensure that the lands of this country are held for the people of this country so long as the people of this country want them.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal further with the activities of the Land Commission but I would recommend to the Minister that he read a small booklet which is available in the Land Commission. It is called &ldquo;Rural Problems and Possibilities&rdquo;.  This booklet was written by the present Bishop of Down and Connor, Dr. Philbin, when he was Bishop of Clonfert.  It is a most enlightening document, sound and very practical.  It might not be any harm if a half dozen copies were circulated to the land commissioners and special copies with red markings thereon supplied to the two lay commissioners who recommended that aliens should purchase land here exempted from the 25 per cent duty.  I am sure the Minister will be in a position to obtain these booklets.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the courtesy of the officers of the Land Commission. In my constituency I have considerable dealings with them and I have always found the greatest possible courtesy.  I have also found that, where their attention was directed to any matter, they acted with whatever speed and efficiency the law allowed them to.  We have an excellent Civil Service.  I have said that on many occasions.  They may be slow.  We may consider that they are unreasonable, but they are acting within the laws passed by this House. For a comparatively new State we have as good a Civil Service as any country <Col N="1206" /> in the world.  I certainly have always received the greatest possible courtesy from the officers of the Land Commission. Under the present unsatisfactory land laws we have a very substantial pool of land in the constituency of Laois/Offaly.  That is due to the hard work of the Land Commission staff. I join with other Deputies in appealing to the Minister to take steps to increase the Land Commission stocks by the purchase and acquisition of land. This is most desirable.  I would also ask the Minister to take steps to prevent long-term conacre lettings by the Land Commission.  This is wrong and undesirable.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the forestry side of the Minister's Estimate.  Very considerable work has been done but a tremendous amount of work remains to be done.  We can with a progressive and ambitious forestry programme employ at least twice the number on forestry than is employed at the moment.  We have in this country some of the most beautiful forests not alone in County Wicklow and in County Kerry but in the midlands.  All our forests are a credit to the Forestry Division.  I should like to know what happened in regard to the talks between the Forestry Division and Bord na Móna in connection with the planting of cutaway bog.  I often wonder why it is not possible to have a dove-tailing between Bord na Móna and the Forestry Division.  There are times when Bord na Móna let off a substantial number of their workers.  I feel that as soon as they are let off they should be immediately recruited for suitable forestry work.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna are a most successful organisation for rural Ireland but if there was greater co-operation between the Forestry Division and Bord na Móna much greater work would be done.  When Bord na Móna are finished with cutaway bogs the Forestry Division should immediately move in and prepare those places for planting.  This would provide very substantial and much needed employment in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Last year I spoke at length on this matter but I do not intend to do so tonight.  I made comparisons in regard <Col N="1207" /> to the help which private planters can obtain in many other countries and I suggested there should be an all-out drive for afforestation in this country. I am not satisfied that the Forestry Division cannot get land for planting. They could get an abundance of land if they were prepared to pay for it. I have known of many instances where land was offered for planting but for some reason or other it was not taken. I can never understand why there has not been substantial forestry development in the Gaeltacht areas.  We have been told that because of the Atlantic breezes and the climate it would not be suitable to have substantial forestry development in the west of Ireland, yet we find that in Finance forestry is even carried out on the shores of the Bay of Biscay which is exposed to very severe storms.  If forests thrive these there is nothing to stop forestry thriving in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I should be glad if the Minister for Lands would take a look at a report on Irish forests.  I have read it many times particularly when I was depressed and it entertained me.  It is an excellent report produced by a committee which was set up by the Government of the day in 1907.  I should like to quote from that report:</P>
    <P>All the men of experience and expert knowledge are agreed that in soil and climate Ireland for forestry purposes is particularly well favoured. On the question of her capacity to grow timber as well as any other country in Northern Europe there can be no doubt whatsoever.</P>
    <P>That is an extract from the Report of the committee on Irish forestry appointed by the British Government in 1907 and which beyond all doubt gives the all-clear that in so far as any European country can produce timber we have the capacity, in regard to both climate and soil, to do so.  More than any Fianna Fáil Minister who has taken charge of the Department of Lands I would like to see the present Minister, because of his name, make a good job of this work.  I would like to see him tackle this problem of afforestation with a determination and vigour that no <Col N="1208" /> other Minister for Lands has shown up to now.  He can make a name for himself because he has the scope, he can get the land and he can employ men who badly need employment in rural Ireland.  While afforestation will not pay off immediately it is a sound, long-term investment.</P>
    <P>It has been very encouraging in recent years to hear the tributes paid by the master builders and others to Irish timber for construction and building work.  This timber would not be available today for the building trade if it had not been for the initiative and foresight of the Cosgrave Government, the first Government of this State which took the first necessary steps in afforestation.  It was the small plants in the first term of afforestation which produced the timber described by master builders of this country as excellent for building and construction work.  It may be 30 years before afforestation pays a good dividend but in the meantime you are helping to improve the climate.  Planted land can be used as a sponge to soak up waterlogged land.  We can provide more employment, we can beautify the country and we can add to our national wealth by producing timber for the home market and probably for export.</P>
    <P>I would respectfully suggest that the Minister should tackle forestry on a county by county basis.  You cannot get an accurate picture viewing the country as a unit but if it is taken county by county it will give you the full picture, because every county has its wasteland.  I should love to see every acre of land put into production. We have too many ditches, too many hedges and too much wasteland.  It is a pleasure to visit some of the countries of Europe where the ditches have disappeared and where the land is producing food for man and beast.  Much of the land in Ireland is taken up by hedges, ditches and drains.  The ditches and hedges should be removed, the drains cleaned and the lands developed for forestry.  We should not expect our people to do it because they have not got the financial resources.  It is the duty of the State to do this and I feel that the State will not mind paying for development of that kind.  It is <Col N="1209" /> necessary to get the maximum produce from the land.  The Department of Finance should provide money to undertake this work.  We should have a national forestry board similar to Bord na Móna and the Shannon Development Company which have produced results.  Forestry is very important for this country.  It provides employment in the country and shares national wealth for the generations to come.</P>

      <P>No one but the present Minister can do that.  I invite him to do so.  Had there been a change of Government as a result of the last election and had I been entrusted by the Leader of my Party with the Department of Lands, I would have tackled that job that must be tackled by Fianna Fáil today.  Had I been responsible for Lands, I would have utilised every acre of waste land by planting it and I would be asking this House for the money to continue the work.  If this were done a great deal of employment would be provided for rural Ireland where there is a great need for it.</P>
      <P>However, the present Minister for Lands now has the power to do all this.  He has been given the power to do so by the Taoiseach.  He has the ability and the qualities to do the work and, in my opinion, he has the ability to tackle the special problem of the Shannon valley.  Why is every Department of State running away from the Shannon valley?  I recommend to the Minister that he read the history of the plantation of the Tennessee Valley and that he read also the various reports compiled before that valley was planted which suggested that it could not be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Shannon valley is crying out for afforestation.  A special section of the Forestry Division should be charged with carrying out an immediate survey with a view to the planting and forestry development of the Shannon valley in Counties Tipperary (North), Offaly, Galway, Roscommon, Westmeath and that portion of the Shannon that comes through part of Longford from the <Col N="1210" /> Cuilcagh Mountains in Cavan.  There is ample scope for an immense separate scheme of afforestation in the Shannon valley.</P>
    <P>There is not a word about the thousands of people who are emigrating. These people would not emigrate if there was work for them at home. Afforestation would provide work for farmers and farmers' sons.  Such people could supplement their incomes by working in the forests.  The Minister is aware that in Sweden and elsewhere many landowners as soon as they have cultivated their own land immediately find employment with the national forestry commission so that they continue to work and enjoy a good standard of living.  The same thing happens in the Province of Ontario in Canada.</P>
    <P>Why can we not have the same thing here?  Why can we not have some arrangement with Bord na Móna whereby the batches of men who are let off are taken on in a forestry area? These are problems which the Minister can solve.  The relief of congestion, an end to the buying of Irish land by foreigners, the establishment of proper forestry and the proceeding with exclusive additional schemes for the planting of cut-away bogs are still matters that can be undertaken by the Minister and his Department.  Let the Minister not be prevented from doing so by the Minister for Finance with the excuse that funds cannot be made available.  We must provide money for the development of our own country, for employment and for investment in timber which the country is capable of producing.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Forestry Division on the addition to the annual report to which the Minister has referred.  I trust that this is only the first instalment of reports of this kind.  I wish the Minister every success in the task he has before him, which is a difficult task especially with a body like the Land Commission who are so slow-moving, and also with the Forestry Division, which has ample scope for activity but which seems to be hampered by lack of money.  Has the Minister ever called for public investment in Irish forestry?  There are public-spirited moneyed people who <Col N="1211" /> would be prepared to invest money in forestry development: they may be few but at least there should be a start so that the generations who will come after us will enjoy the fruits and successes of a well-planned and progressive forestry policy.</P>

      <P>Anyone who has had much to do with the Irish Land Commission will realise that he is dealing with a sea of frustration. That does not apply only to Deputies and Senators but to the officials concerned. I have always been puzzled when dealing with the Land Commission as to who exactly takes decisions.  From time to time I have written letters to the commissioners and have been informed by them in writing that they had placed my recommendations before the Land Commission. I have written to successive Ministers from time to time and I have received the same reply from them&mdash; that they had placed my recommendations before the Land Commission. This poses the question as to who is the Land Commission exactly.  That is something that I have been trying to find out for almost 20 years.</P>
      <P>There is a lot to be said for the arguments of Deputy Dr. O'Donovan and other speakers who suggested the total abolition of the Land Commission. I would not like to go as far as that but the time has been reached when it must be realised that a lot of the land that has already been divided in this country was possibly not divided in the best interests of the people as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible, in my opinion, to divorce entirely agriculture and land. The two are more or less complementary to each other.  It is quite obvious that to produce a good agricultural policy it is necessary to further the interests of it by producing a good land settlement policy.  Therefore, an amalgamation of the two Departments is immediately and highly desirable. I am sure my experiences in the Land Commission are not any different from those of other Deputies in that I have never been able to get any definite information; I have never been able to <Col N="1212" /> find out who takes the decision.  The Land Commissioners direct me to the Land Commission and the Minister advises me to get in touch with the Land Commission and I wind up in a sea of frustration.</P>
    <P>So, without advocating legislation, which I am not allowed to do on an Estimate, I suggest that the Minister should take another look at the Land Commission in an endeavour to produce some stable process whereby land can be acquired and divided more quickly so that the best interests of the country may be served.  One of the main things I query here is the length of time between acquisition and division of land.  It seems to be the policy of the Land Commission always to spend sixpence, if necessary, to save a penny, and that naturally leads to over-administration.  I fail to see why if an estate is taken over it is necessary for the Land Commission to let it for up to five years.  That is possibly the exception rather than the rule but, on the other hand, I have seen land held for seven or eight years in County Wexford.  Of course, everything is thoroughly examined and goes through the hands of innumerable officials before finally going to the commissioners.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister for Lands is not a farmer, he must realise that if land is held for too long by people who have no final claim or any guarantee to a final claim to the land, they will take all the good out of it while they have it.  The Land Commission acquire land from people who have been working it badly.  They acquire it seven or eight years before they finally give it to somebody who will work it better than those previously in possession of it.  But the Land Commission proceed to do exactly what the people were doing before.  They let it for four or five years after acquisition. The acquisition of the land takes a year in legal matters, and again lawyers are not always as quick to act as they should be.  Then it is let again and, perhaps, a final query comes in about it from somebody in the Department who probably has not been near the land and may never have left the <Col N="1213" /> Land Commission offices in Merrion Street.  He sends out a query and the whole thing starts all over again.  The poor official who had been out on the land and who had decided on its distribution plan finds the whole thing shelved.  It is an instance of spending sixpence to save a penny.</P>
    <P>Very often land is divided and distributed in the spring.  Anybody who knows anything about farming will agree that ploughing must be done early to get good results.  I have known land to be divided after St. Patrick's Day.  That means that the person who gets it has got to plough it straight away and sow it straight away and he finds that it is run out to nothing.  The Land Commission should divide all estates in the autumn.  In that way they would give the recipients a few months during which to plan for the future before the spring sowing.  This does not need any legislation, and if the Minister has any authority in the Land Commission&mdash;I suspect he has not a lot under the present set-up&mdash;I suggest that he tells the officials to make a point of distributing land in the autumn.  I wonder if anything will come of that simple request made, if you like, by a simple fellow to the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the high price of land.  Some years ago, with a great blast of trumpets, we had new legislation, a land Bill.  We were all hopeful that the sea of frustration would be abated somewhat by that legislation.  We had a western Minister for Lands at the time.  We generally have them; perhaps, some day we will have an eastern one.  However, all that legislation boiled down to was that land was made cheaper for those in the so-called congested areas&mdash;Kerry and west Cork and right up through the western coast.  Where were the people to get the money from?  I have been told by a reliable official of the Land Commission, whose opinion I value highly, that a very small subsidy would have met that problem.  Instead the money was got through a levy on non-congested areas.  This has made land so dear that it has made it impossible for recipients to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I do not know who the Land <Col N="1214" /> Commission are: they are some secret body working somewhere in Merrion Street.  They say that a small farmer with 25 acres will get an allotment of 40 acres.  He is given an allotment of totally run-down land.  The 40 acres are handed to him in the last stage of poor fertility.  He has to pay £10 an acre&mdash;that is approximately what he is asked to pay in rent and rates.  Now, anybody with 25 acres of land, struggling to exist without capital, without reserves, who is offered 40 acres jumps at it because it raises him from 25 acres to 65 acres, to an economic holding.  I shall deal with economic holdings later.  He is asked to pay £400.  This puts a millstone round his neck and he is rendered bankrupt.  Unadulterated nonsense is what I call it.</P>
    <P>I am not sure the Minister wants to assist small farmers, but that is what is happening.  In my constituency people had the foresight to say they could not possibly face that situation and they refused the land.  If you ask a Parliamentary question you are told that the percentage of refusal is small.  Of course, it is small, but the percentage of bankrupcy is very high.  Why ask anybody in those circumstances to pay £400 a year for 40 acres of land? Why does the Minister for Lands not go to the Minister for Finance and ask for a subsidy?  The amount would not exceed £350,000 a year and it would enable the division of land to go on without hardship.</P>
    <P>The question comes up of what is an economic holding.  The Department of Lands have changed their minds on that subject at least 20 times.  Originally the economic holding was supposed to be 22 acres.  I heard Dr. O'Donovan refer to it the other evening again as 22 acres, and it was this which created congested districts in Ireland and made a mess of land settlement as a whole in this country.  Eventually, we built up to 40 acres as an economic holding but 40 acres do not make an economic holding.  Sixty acres is barely economic. Anyone who farms knows that even with 60 or 70 acres he is always in the position of having to buy fodder to feed his livestock.  It is time that the people in the Department of Lands or <Col N="1215" /> the Land Commission, whoever they are&mdash;I do not know exactly who they are&mdash;got this into their heads.  An economic holding for ordinary mixed farming here must be at least 60 acres.</P>
    <P>I do not advocate the confiscation of land which is the European policy of land settlement.  The policy of the European Economic Community is the abolition of small holdings or the compounding of fragmented holdings to create larger and more viable holdings. Circumstances here are totally different. We have not the large fragmentation of land that they have in Europe. To my mind, an economic holding is at least 60 acres.</P>
    <P>According to the present Land Acts, land is available to anybody who wants it.  That is a misconception because nobody has ever been given land who has not land already.  The Land Commission says there is not enough land to go around.  That brings me to the British system which is a very good one.  They have no Department of Lands.  It is done through Agriculture, a by-product of Agriculture, by a board consisting very largely of parliamentary representatives as against civil servants, on the basis that parliamentary representatives know what is good for the people and are the contacts with them.  The board's chairman must be a member of the Opposition; he may not be a member of the Government.  Their scheme, which is worked in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, makes land available.  They have not any great quantity of land to spare. They interview applicants.  It is not a matter of a smallholder of 20 acres being given another 20.  A large number of those interviewed are sons of farmers.  Usually, land is not given unless the applicant is married and they also interview the wives to be satisfied that the woman is as interested in living on the land as the man is.  As a result, their land settlement system is a good one.  I do not admire everything British but it would be a good thing for the new Minister here to study that system and to see if it is possible to accommodate some of the farmers' sons&mdash;and there are many of them who are taking large acreages on conacre and making a good living out of it <Col N="1216" /> although they have no land themselves. They are worthy of land and should be considered for it.  In fact, they can be considered without any new legislation. It is open to the Minister to do so and it is only a matter of his taking a decision, if he has the authority to take a decision&mdash;I do not know.  I hope he has.  I am not suggesting that he should chuck his weight about in the Land Commission and achieve miracles almost overnight.</P>
    <P>There is a great injustice at present taking place in connection with the issue of land bonds.  I do not fully understand the finances of the Land Commission but it seems that if they buy land the only way they can do it is by the issue of land bonds.  A case was brought to my notice the other day of a man who wished to sell his own holding and buy another holding. He contracted with the Land Commission to buy the holding for £7,000. The holding he wished to buy cost exactly the same figure.  In other words, he was going to improve himself by moving to the other holding.  He bought it and waited a long time for his land bonds.  Anybody who sells land to the Land Commission is not paid for some unknown reason for possibly 12 months or more.  The ordinary commercial practice does not seem to apply.  If I bought a house and waited 12 months before I paid for it some of the solicitors would have a writ on my doorstep and I would be evicted.  The Land Commission, apparently, can buy land and need not pay for it for about 12 months afterwards.</P>
    <P>This man, however, got £7,000 for his farm and ultimately the value that would have accrued to him at the time of the sale was about £6,800: the Land Commission always retain a small sum, perhaps for costs or in case they overpay and cannot get it back&mdash;I do not know.  This man expected to get £6,800 but the land bonds fell in value by the time he got them and by the time he came to sell them he got only something over £5,000.  The result is that he now faces a demand from his bank, credit being somewhat difficult due to financial stress through which the country is going, to pay off his overdraft.  There is no need to dwell <Col N="1217" /> on the financial stress because Fianna Fáil know more about it than I do. Anyway, he could not get a halfpenny from the bank and he was asked to pay off his £1,400 overdraft straight away and he faces a serious situation. That is a perfectly true story.  I think I have already made representations to the Minister about the case, but if I have not I shall do so.</P>
    <P>If the Minister, or the Land Commissioners whoever they are, are not prepared to guarantee the value of the bonds so that they will not fall in value, they will find it very difficult to deal with anybody in the future and also they are committing a serious injustice to the farming community or those they may deal with.  It is a matter that the Minister should seriously consider straight away and he should try to rectify the situation for I am sure my case is not the only one and that there are numerous other similar cases throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Since the inception of the State we have made a considerable capital investment in forestry of which I have always been an advocate.  Our raw materials are limited and afforestation ensures that we shall have something to fall back on.  I do not know how many millions we have spent on afforestation to date or whether it is money well spent.  I should like the Minister when replying to give some indication as to when the money, possibly hundreds of millions, that has been spent will give a return.  It is a business that takes time to build up, but surely after 50 years of afforestation there should be a pretty good return, particularly as recently, more up-to-date methods are being used and there is far less employment in forestry than there was a few years ago. Perhaps the Minister would tell us when it is hoped afforestation will be able to pay for itself so that no Minister afterwards will have to come to the House for money but will just produce his Estimate and a statement of what he is doing in his Department and so on.  I hope it will then be a question of a surplus which can be used for further development in other spheres.</P>
    <P>With regard to afforestation itself, <Col N="1218" /> the actual sowing of trees, in my travels in Europe I have found that they rely very largely on natural regeneration. I also found in Europe, particularly in France where they are pretty well up-to-date with afforestation, that they rely a good deal on hard wood. Natural regeneration is, perhaps, more inclined to take place in relation to hard wood than the conifer breed. Somehow, we do not seem to rely on natural regeneration here.</P>
    <P>The policy of those directing afforestation here is to sweep everything aside, cut everything down wholesale, and re-plant.  We are expending a good deal of money on expensive nurseries which may not be necessary. I have travelled a good deal in the Vosges&mdash;as the Minister did himself&mdash; and also in the Black Forest.  It is the exception in this huge tract of afforestation rather than the rule to find a nursery, whereas in any afforestation centre here in Ireland we have these nurseries, quite big nurseries.  There is one near me&mdash;the estate originally belonged to my family&mdash;with an enormous nursery.  I do not see any sign of natural regeneration there.  Perhaps the Minister, when he is replying, would care to give us some indication as to whether that is to be developed here or whether it is something to be watched from afar in other countries.</P>
    <P>I was told something the other day which caused me a certain amount of apprehension.  I was told that there is a change in the forestry policy on fencing.  This is the type of thing which could only come out of a State Department. Most of our forests here are surrounded by arable land.  I am told &mdash;I do not know whether it is true&mdash; that recently there has been a change of policy.  When these lands were bought originally the fences were the responsibility of the Forestry Division. I am told that they will no longer re-fence them.  A lot of these lands were bought about 20 years ago.  As the Minister knows, there are farms with stock around them and the fences need continual attention.  Most of them are falling down.  The timber has rotted away.</P>
    <P>This is a question of whether the Forestry Division will re-fence them, <Col N="1219" /> or whether they are liable to re-fence them.  If they are not liable, who is liable?  I am told that there was a case recently in County Cork, I think it was &mdash;or somewhere in the south of Ireland &mdash;where several beasts broke into a forestry estate because the fencing was indifferent, although it was supposed to be the responsibility of the Forestry Division, and a couple of bullocks fell into a drain and broke their necks.  An action was brought against the Forestry Division.</P>
    <P>Of course, all State Departments if an action is brought against them, instead of settling the case as an ordinary private individual would, with all the resources of the State behind them fight it to the last ditch.  It matters nothing to them if they lose it because the State pays for it.  In this case I understand they won the case, although what the actual facts were I do not know.  It highlights the fact that, apparently, it is the position that the Forestry Division are now maintaining that they are not liable for fencing. If that is the case it is a very serious matter, because some landowners will find themselves having to fence almost miles of land.  It does not make sense to me.  Of course I am not a lawyer so I could not determine the legal position, but it seems to me that in ordinary common honesty&mdash;whether common honesty applies to the law I am not in a position to say&mdash;the Forestry Division are liable for the fencing and should fence.  The Minister should clarify that point.</P>
    <P>The final point I want to deal with is the delays that occur between the Forestry Division and the Land Commission. They are both under the one Minister.  If the Forestry Division buy a tract of land which includes arable land&mdash;I am glad to say they are mending their ways and do not plant arable land as they used to: at one time it looked as though they were going to plant Phoenix Park because they were becoming so keen on arable land&mdash;and that arable land is offered by the Forestry Division to the Land Commission, why should it take the best part of two or three months, and sometimes a year, before the Land <Col N="1220" /> Commission decide whether they want the land?  They are both under the same roof.  They are both under the same Minister.  I suggest to the Minister that when cases like that are brought to his notice he should act at once.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree largely with what Deputy Esmonde said.  We all come up against this sea of frustration in the Land Commission.  We get these anonymous letters&mdash;that is the only way I can describe them&mdash;saying: &ldquo;We are bringing the representations of the Deputy before the proper authorities and when the land is divided your representations will be borne in mind&rdquo;, or words to that effect.  Of course, we all know very well that this is pure waffle and that it has absolutely no effect.</P>
      <P>The whole reason for this is that we, as public representatives, are not able to pin down who is responsible for what in the Department of Lands.  It is time we started to settle this question in the Department of Lands.  It is the most frustrating of all the Departments to deal with.  We have an obligation to the people we represent to ensure that not only do they get fair play but that they get quick fair play, and that we do not have instances, as cited by Deputy Esmonde, of a man being paid in land bonds and, because of a drop in the value of land bonds, he is up to his neck in debt in the bank and has a very awkward and, indeed, serious situation to deal with.</P>
      <P>I had an instance last week or the week before, of which the Minister is aware, of a man who bought 80 acres of land and, because of a certain amount of agitation locally&mdash;he paid, I think, £18,000 for it&mdash;the Land Commission stepped in and are now, so far as I am aware, about to purchase that land from him.  If he is to be paid £18,000 in land bonds he will be in a more serious situation than Deputy Esmonde's friend.  Quite honestly, I do not think we can tolerate this situation. We will have to take some strong action.  We will have to decide what an economic unit is and how serious we are about enforcing the economic unit limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My personal opinion is that it is <Col N="1221" /> very hard to define what an economic unit is.  In some areas it could be 80 or 90 acres and in other areas it could be much more, or maybe a little less. I am convinced that, if we are serious about the whole question of land, we must develop in the villages and towns industries allied to those smallholdings. I think a smallholding can be classified as anything from 60 acres downwards. Unless we make a very conscious effort to industrialise west Cork and the western parts of the country, we will have a very serious social problem on our hands.  I do not think it is possible for any man to meet his <Col N="1222" /> repayment commitments to the Land Commission on 40, 50 or 60 acres, make a living, provide for the future, and have the investment of capital in equipment, machinery and stock which is so necessary for modern-day farming. A whole new look must be taken at this Department.  I know the Minister is very well aware of the shortcomings of the Department.</P>
