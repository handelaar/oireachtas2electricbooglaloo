    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether there is any new initiative in the Government policy towards entry to the EEC which would align this country more closely with other European neutrals who have expressed an interest in some form of association with the EEC countries; and whether discussions with such interested counttries are contemplated in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position still is that our application for membership, along with those of the other applicants, remains on the <Col N="155" /> agenda of the Council of the European Economic Community, but agreement has, so far, not been reached by the member countries on the opening of negotiations.</P>
    <P>It is yet too soon to say what effect the advent of the new administration in France is likely to have on that country's attitude to enlargement of the Communities.  Another factor with a possible bearing on the situation is that a general election is due to be held in Germany later this year.</P>
    <P>As regards Question No. 4, I must reiterate that our objective is full membership of the European Communities, not merely some form of association.</P>
    <P>Our missions in the Community and in the applicant countries will continue to maintain the closest contact with developments.  The Minister for External Affairs proposes to visit the commission in Brussels and some of the European Governments at the earliest opportunity.  This will be followed by further ministerial visits to Europe later in the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the current thinking which is that Britain will be accepted prior to the entry of other countries associated with Britain?  In view of the repercussions of the acceptance of Britain as a member prior to membership of other countries, including ourselves, would it not be in our best interests to consult with other countries with whom we have a great deal in common particularly in view of our policy on neutrality?  Does he not think it would be wise on our part to consult with other countries in a similar situation before the inevitable takes place and Britain, according to current thinking, is accepted as a member on her own?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach what assurances, if any, he has sought and secured from the member countries of the EEC that Britain will not, in fact, be admitted to membership prior to Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accepting at all the suggestion that Britain may <Col N="156" /> be accepted prior to the other applicant countries is a likely eventuality. As far as the suggestion goes that we should seek some kind of arrangement with so-called neutral countries, I do not think that is necessary because a form of association, as has been suggested in the past, did not in any way obviate the political obligations of membership of the Community.  Association is seen only as a temporary device to overcome temporary economic difficulties of applicant countries.  In reply to Deputy FitzGerald's question, we have not sought any assurances as such, but we have taken positive steps to ensure that our negotiations are contemporaneous with those of Britain and that our ultimate acceptance as a member will be a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say whether there have been any recent discussions with the British Government to discover whether they want to go it alone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There have not been discussions as such, but we have made it clear to the British Government that we regard our accession contemporaneously with that of Britain as being necessary in their interests as well as in our own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any indication from the commission as to whether or not the commission propose to consider applications separately or together?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach telling the House that he discounts the possibility of Britain's entry into the Community alone and outside the entry of this country?  Is the Taoiseach telling us authoritatively that he discounts this possibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that we have the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement which has an effect on trade between this country and Great <Col N="157" /> Britain, does the Taoiseach not think that he should take immediate steps now to discover what is in the mind of the British Government with regard to entry to the EEC?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach used the word &ldquo;so-called&rdquo; neutrals. Does this imply that in his view neutrality is no longer a relevant concept for a country like ours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I used the term &ldquo;so-called&rdquo; in its literal sense.  There are countries that call themselves neutral but our neutrality is not of the same nature as theirs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will tabulate the current retail prices of beer, spirits, tobacco and petrol in the Dublin area; and the estimated excise duty content as a percentage of price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The information on retail prices available in the Central Statistics Office is that collected at quarterly inquiries made in connection with the calculation of the Consumer Price Index numbers.  The latest inquiry related to Tuesday, 13th May, 1969.</P>
      <P>Top quality petrol cost 6s 5½d in the Dublin and Dún Laoghaire area on 13th May and the excise duty payable amounted to 64 per cent of this price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the other items specified in the question it is estimated that on 13th May, 1969, the excise duty content expressed as a percentage of the price was about 46 per cent for a pint of draught stout and 50 per cent for a glass of whiskey, while the customs duty content expressed as a percentage of the price was 76 per cent <Col N="158" /> for 20 plain cigarettes and 70 per cent for one oz. of plug tobacco.  For these items meaningful average prices are not available since the commodity priced is not identical in quality for each reporter, the main object being to measure price changes between two periods rather than absolute prices.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The net registered tonnage of ships which arrived at Irish ports in 1968 (including net tonnage of ships in the coasting trade) was 14.78 million.  Of this total 1.70 million related to Irish registered ships. The corresponding figures for 1967 are 13.81 million and 1.56 million respectively.</P>
      <P>In compiling the figure a vessel calling at one or more ports is recorded as an arrival at each of these ports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>At 31st March, 1968, there were 896 mentally handicapped children (under 16 years of age) on health authorities' waiting lists for care in the special residential centres.  These waiting lists include children who are mildly, moderately or severely handicapped but full assessment of the extent of their disability had not been carried out in all cases.  It is estimated that of the above numbers over one quarter are mildly handicapped.  Returns for the year ended 31st March, 1969, are being compiled.</P>
      <P>Additional residential accommodation for some 900 places is under construction or in planning for both mentally handicapped children and adults.  The provision of accommodation for adults will result in freeing places intended for children which are at present occupied by adults.  Some of this accommodation will be available at an early date and the remainder should be completed within a couple of years.</P>
      <P>Details of a further programme for 600 places for mentally handicapped adults are being worked out in consultation with the various voluntary organisations engaged in the services for the mentally handicapped.</P>

      <P>As recently as last May the sanction of my predecessor in office was conveyed to the implementation of an arbitrator's award involving increased remuneration, effective as from 1st June, 1968, for nurses in the service of local health authorities.  The award was applied, also, to nurses serving in voluntary hospitals.</P>
      <P>As to conditions of service, the working hours of hospital nurses were reduced from a 96 to a 90-hour fortnight in 1962, and were further reduced to an 85-hour fortnight in 1966.

I am informed that to guard against this the Chief Medical Officer of the Dublin <Col N="162" /> Health Authority arranges for fortnightly checks during the swimming season on sea water at bathing places around Dublin.  Tests carried out this year have indicated that the incidence of pollution has increased but, while this at times can result in unpleasant conditions for swimmers, I am advised that there is, as yet, no cause for alarm so far as health hazard is concerned.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>When there are so many doubts expressed in an effort to confuse the issue it is very difficult for me and my Department to make clear what the intention is.  There has been a good deal of confusion generated around the south of Ireland as to what would result from rushing willy-nilly into rationalisation.  Figures of 6d and 1s per gallon have been held out to people provided they jump head first into rationalisation.  I have been at pains to make it clear that this sort of jumping in head first is not the proper approach.  All aspects must be considered before we make a change. Without proper consideration any change might be for the worse and not for the better.  It is in that context I made the most recent statement in the Deputy's constituency and it was made in order to try to clarify the situation and get away from this madcap idea that there was all this big money to be gained from rationalisation, rationalisation merely as an exercise.  That big money just is not there.  There is a great deal to be done.  I should like a balanced view rather than this wild <Col N="164" /> idea of rationalisation adding 6d or 1s a gallon to the price of milk for the benefit of the producer in any part of the country.  That is just not so and it was to try to get away from that and have the situation looked at clearly by the producers, in particular, that I made the statement on the occasion to which the Deputy referred; I made it to counteract the wild talk going on at that particular time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is prepared to introduce amending legislation to ensure free access for all citizens to the beaches and foreshores of the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that amending legislation to deal with this matter is necessary.  Planning authorities have very wide powers under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, to preserve or provide rights of access to beaches, foreshores, mountains, lakeshores, riverbanks or other places of natural beauty or recreational utility.  Many of the authorities have included objectives in their development plans for the preservation of such rights of access. Where established public rights of access do not exist, planning authorities have power to create public rights of way, either by agreement or compulsorily. Where such rights of way are created or where a provision for the preservation of a public right-of-way is included in a development plan, the way must be maintained by the planning authority and penalties are provided on conviction for any obstruction or interference with the right-of-way. Development in coastal areas is, of course, subject to planning control in the normal way.  An additional safeguard as regards preservation of established rights of access has been provided <Col N="166" /> in the revised Exempted Development Regulations, 1967.  These contained a provision removing from the scope of the exemptions from planning control any development which would consist of the fencing or enclosure of any land habitually open to or used by the public during the preceding ten years for recreational purposes or as means of access to any seashore or other place of natural beauty or recreational utility.  This restriction means that such fencing or enclosure cannot legally be undertaken without planning permission.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the relevant provisions of the 1963 Act are adequate to enable planning authorities to safeguard public rights of access.  I consider, however, that it is of vital importance that planning authorities for coastal areas should exercise the utmost vigilance and should fully utilise their statutory powers to preserve rights of access to beaches and seashore and some time ago my Department issued a circular letter to the authorities about the nature and extent of the powers and responsibilities which they should exercise in this regard.</P>

        <i>(Cavan)</i> asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that certain tenants of local authority cottages who did not make application to have their cottages vested before the 30th June, 1968 and who wish to do so appear to be precluded from having their cottages vested now; and if he will take steps <Col N="170" /> to amend the law in order to permit these tenants to vest their cottages under the Labourers Act, 1936.</P>

      <P>I am so aware.  The relevant provisions of the Labourers Act, 1963, were replaced without objection from the House by the Housing Act, 1966, under which a local authority may sell cottages to the tenant for the market or replacement value less discounts of up to 30 per cent for cottages in built-up areas and 45 per cent for cottages in other areas. In these circumstances, I do not propose to introduce legislation on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Is the Minister aware that through ignorance or through other causes quite a number of tenants failed to apply to have their cottages vested within this specified time and as a result they are now precluded by law from vesting their cottages?  In view of the fact that their failure to apply in time was in most cases due to ignorance, or in some cases because they were absent from their cottages, would the Minister consider granting a short extension of, say, six months to give those who wish to vest their cottages an opportunity of doing so?  It would not be unreasonable.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he proposes to introduce amending legislation to ensure that housing and land developers complete estates in accordance with the planning conditions stipulated by the planning authorities; and, if so, when.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, <Col N="173" /> 1963, gave planning authorities new and strong powers to enable them to ensure that housing estates and other forms of development are completed in conformity with the relevant planning permission and that any condition attached to a planning permission is complied with.  Effective use of the enforcement powers conferred on planning authorities by the Act will go a long way towards eliminating the problem of unfinished estates which has caused considerable trouble in the past in a number of areas, and particularly in the Dublin area.  In addition to their enforcement powers, planning authorities are specifically empowered under the 1963 Act to attach a condition on the grant of a planning permission requiring the developer to lodge security for the satisfactory completion of the proposed development. Insistence on the giving of such security in appropriate cases provides a valuable lever to enable planning authorities to bring pressure to bear on defaulting developers.</P>
      <P>I am, of course, aware that difficulties still exist in relation to some housing estates developed on the basis of permissions granted before the 1963 Act came into operation and I have been pressing the local authorities concerned to take whatever action is open to them to clear up the residue of these older cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that there should be no difficulty in relation to any scheme for which permission was given subsequent to the Planning Act 1963.  In regard to earlier cases which have not been satisfactorily completed the planning authority, as I say, should be able to get them all satisfactorily completed and I have been pressing them to do so.  I am keeping the matter under review and if it appears necessary to take further steps I will do so.</P>

      <P>There is no question of baiting arising in any of these sports to which the Deputy refers, so far as I am aware.  Bear-baiting was done away with many centuries ago.  What the Deputy is asking us to do is to abolish sports that are available in every country in the whole of Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the countries to which the Deputy has referred have taken any such steps.  I have quite recently shot in Germany. They have special laws to enable the people to preserve certain areas so as to get an income from the hunting that goes on in that country, both wild bear and deer, and so on.  The same goes for the other countries to which the Deputy refers.  I know there is a very small minority view against all forms of beast sports but I think they would have to convert more people to their point of view before I should promulgate legislation in this House.</P>

    <P>The discharge of oil into the sea is governed by the International Convention for the Prevention of the Pollution of the Sea by Oil which was implemented by the Oil Pollution of the Sea Acts, 1956 and 1965.

In recent years a number of successful prosecutions have been taken in respect of oil pollution offences.  My predecessor set up a working group to advise on what measures should be taken to deal with serious oil pollution affecting Irish territorial and adjoining seas and beaches.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The company operating at Tynagh is a private concern, and I am precluded from giving information of this kind except to the extent to which it is published by the company itself.</P>
      <P>In its annual reports, the company has indicated that the tonnage of ore treated in the year ended 31st December, 1967, was 703,511 tons, from which was recovered a total of 190,985 tons of metal concentrates; and that the tonnage of ore treated in the year ended 31st December, 1968 was 709,913 tons, which yielded a total of 181,950 tons of metal concentrates.</P>
      <P>As regards royalties I cannot, for the reason stated, give information about the Tynagh company in particular.  All I can say is that total receipts from all sources, including royalties, under the Minerals Development Acts for the year ended 31st December, 1967, amounted to £163,191, and that receipts for the year ended 31st December, 1968 amounted to £200,867.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider it in the public interest that the royalties paid by companies to the State should, in fact, be the property, if necessary, of this House?  I <Col N="190" /> am referring to the aggregate of £163,000 in total royalties from all companies.  I am also conscious that the company I referred to succeeded in the past three years in having an aggregate repayment of their total cost of something in the region of 14 million Canadian dollars and so on.  Does the Minister not agree that £163,000 from all companies is indeed a rather sparse return royaltywise for the concessions given by the State to such companies?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Labour Court decided on Friday last to meet the parties to the dispute tomorrow.  The officers of my Department have been in touch with the affected hospitals with a view to securing that the services will be available to patients needing them in emergencies.  Further discussions with other hospitals are being held as appropriate in changing circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy would not expect me, at this stage, to be more precise, except to say that for night accident services it has been arranged that for tonight, tomorrow night and the night after the hospitals providing this service will be Jervis Street on the north side and Steevens and St. Vincent's hospitals on the south side. <Col N="191" /> These hospitals will be available for accident services on an emergency basis for three nights after which we hope the Labour Court will have succeeded in improving the situation.</P>
    <P>I want to be very careful not to say anything which would make a settlement of the dispute more difficult.  I am sure that I am expressing the unanimous wish of the House when I say that I hope a solution, through the good offices of the Labour Court, will be found tomorrow, or if that is not possible immediately, that the technicians who are on strike will resume duty while negotiations are proceeding so as to obviate the possibility, however remote, that an avoidable tragedy should occur.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister assure us that the non-availability of two hospitals as announced today for accidents will not cause any serious risk to people who may be injured in accidents?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the peculiar humanitarian problems involved in this case, would the Minister consider intervening himself to expedite a settlement giving fair remuneration to laboratory technicians commensurate with the importance of their duties and the care and skill involved because these appear to be the problems which have not been recognised and have given cause for the dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I prefer not to give a history of the revision of salary scales and other improvements that have taken place in the laboratory technicians' pay and conditions.  I am not the employer in this case and I do not think it would be right for me to intervene, certainly at the present time.  The negotiations have been continuing and I do hope that the Labour Court will be able to find a solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime I should add that the laboratory technicians, if they receive <Col N="192" /> evidence from the consultant in charge, are prepared to give service in very grave cases requiring emergency and quick examination and also that the pathologists are assisting when so required.</P>

      <P>I was about to explain it.  I did not mean any disrespect to the House.  I intended to explain it when we came to the Bill proper.  This is a Financial Resolution prior to the Bill.  The purpose of the Financial Resolution and the Bill is to confirm all the various taxes we have been collecting since the Dáil dissolved.  With the dissolution of the Dáil the Financial Resolutions which were carried on the authority to collect all the tax increases went by the board.  We must bring in this piece of legislation in order to confirm them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy asking about discussion on the resolutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 13 Financial Resolutions.  As I understand the position, this measure is purely for the purpose of regularising the position between the date of the dissolution and today.  The general Budget discussion and the Financial Resolutions will come up for discussion under the ordinary Financial Resolution No. 13.  We accept that there must be some orderliness in the public finance and that this resolution, on which the Bill will be founded, is necessary.  Frankly, it appears to me now, as it appeared to me 15 years ago, that there is a serious difficulty here.  Since the dissolution of the Dáil the Minister for Finance has been collecting taxes for which he had <Col N="197" /> no statutory authority at all.  When I was faced with that position I was not the Minister for Finance who had been doing it.  I came in and took over from another Minister who had been collecting taxes without statutory authority.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey, who was Minister for Finance at the dissolution of the Dáil, and who is Minister for Finance today, is in the position of having collected taxes under the Financial Resolutions at the increased rates which were imposed by the Budget, without statutory authority to do so.  The fact that that is so is proved by the necessity to come to this House with the financial resolution in the form of Resolution No. 12 and with the Bill that is set out at No. 6 on the Order Paper.  To put it mildly, that seems to be a most unsatisfactory state of affairs.  The Minister for Finance should have foreseen this possibility before the dissolution of the House and have taken regard of it.  He could have put it to the House then.  He failed to reply to the Budget debate.  The Taoiseach dissolved the Dáil that night without taking proper cognisance of the lacuna that was there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with Deputy Sweetman on this.  I believe legislation should be introduced prior to the dissolution of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not have been necessary had the Dáil not been dissolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have such a measure introduced often.  It is not often that the debate on the Financial Resolutions is interrupted by a general election.  We have no objection to this motion.  We supported all tax resolutions. I do not remember what the attitude of the House in general was but the Labour Party supported the tax resolutions to provide for the benefits contained in the Budget.  Consequently we have no objection to this.  It was a device practised by Deputy Sweetman 15 years ago but in view of what Deputy Sweetman has said, perhaps, we should have made provision for these matters before there was a dissolution of the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are numerous <Col N="198" /> precedents for this procedure.  Be that as it may, this is the first time I have come up against this situation.  When we come to the Finance Bill I propose to make provision in it so that this sort of situation will not arise again.  In the future we will make better provision for this eventuality.</P>

      <P>(1)  That, subject to paragraphs (2) and (3) of this Resolution, the duty of customs on tobacco imposed by section 20 of the Finance Act, 1932 (No. 20 of 1932), shall, as on and from the 8th day of May, 1969, be charged, levied and paid at the several rates specified in Part I of the Schedule to this Resolution in lieu of the several rates specified in Parts I and II of the Second Schedule to the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1968 (No. 37 of 1968).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="206" /> (2)  That the provisions of section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall apply to the duty mentioned in paragraph (1) of this Resolution&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  with the substitution of &ldquo;the area of application of the Acts of the Oireachtas&rdquo; for &ldquo;Great Britain and Ireland&rdquo;, and</P>
    <P>(b)  as though the descriptions of manufactured tobacco mentioned in Part I of the Schedule to this Resolution were included in the first column of the Second Schedule to that Act after the expression &ldquo;manufactured tobacco&rdquo; and the appropriate preferential rates mentioned in that Part were mentioned in the second column of the said Second Schedule opposite the mention of those goods in the first column thereof in lieu of the rate mentioned in the said second column opposite the mention of manufactured tobacco in the said first column.</P>
    <P>(3)  That&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  this paragraph applies to manufactured tobacco which was manufactured in, and consigned from, the United Kingdom and was manufactured therein from materials other than materials falling within Tariff Heading number 24.02 in the Schedule to the Imposition of Duties (No. 159) (Customs Duties and Form of Customs Tariff) Order, 1966 (S.I.

    <P>
      <Col N="207" /> (c)  the provisions of section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall apply to the duties imposed by this paragraph&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  with the substitution of &ldquo;the area of application of the Acts of the Oireachtas&rdquo; for &ldquo;Great Britain and Ireland&rdquo; and as though the expression &ldquo;manufactured tobacco&rdquo; in the first column of the Second Schedule to that Act did not include manufactured tobacco to to which this paragraph applies.</P>
    <P>(ii)  as though manufactured tobacco to which this paragraph applies, together with the descriptions of such manufactured tobacco in Part II or III (as may be appropriate) of the Schedule to this Resolution, were mentioned separately in the said first column and the appropriate preferential rates specified in that part were mentioned in the second column of the said Second Schedule opposite the mention of those goods in the first column thereof, and</P>

    <P>(f)  the expression &ldquo;other pipe tobacco&rdquo; mentioned in Parts II and III of the Schedule to this Resolution means manufactured tobacco of kinds normally intended to be used in pipes, not being hard pressed tobacco.</P>
    <P>(4)  That the duty of excise on tobacco imposed by section 19 of the Finance Act, 1934 (No. 31 of 1934), <Col N="208" /> shall, as on and from the 8th day of May, 1969, be charged, levied and paid at the several rates specified in Part IV of the Schedule to this Resolution in lieu of the several rates specified in Part III of the Second Schedule to the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1968.</P>
    <P>(5)  That, subject to the provisions of paragraph (6) of this Resolution, there shall be charged, levied and paid on all stocks of tobacco of every description which at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 7th day of May, 1969, are in the ownership or possession of a licensed manufacturer of tobacco and in any place in the State other than a bonded warehouse, a duty of excise, payable by the manufacturer, at the following rate, that is to say:</P>
    <P>(a)  so far as the stocks consist of unmanufactured tobacco, three shillings and seven pence for every pound weight of the stocks, and</P>
    <P>(b)  so far as the stocks consist of tobacco (including snuff) other than unmanufactured tobacco, three shillings and seven pence for every pound weight of unmanufactured tobacco from which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, the stocks were derived.</P>
    <P>(6)  That the duty provided for by paragraph (5) of this Resolution shall not be chargeable on any manufactured tobacco (including cigarettes, cigars and snuff other than offal snuff) as to which it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that it was at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 7th day of May, 1969, fully prepared for sale by retail and that either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  it was not the product of any operation carried out by any manufacturer in whose ownership or possession it was at that time; or</P>
    <P>(ii)  it was at that time held as retail stock in premises used for selling tobacco by retail; or</P>
    <P>(iii)  it was at that time in transit from seller to buyer under a contract of sale:</P>
    <P>Provided that no tobacco shall be deemed for the purposes of this <Col N="209" /> paragraph to have been fully prepared for sale by retail if, according to the ordinary course of business of the person in whose ownership or possession it was or to whom it was in transit, it had still to be subjected to some further process (other than packing) before being sold by him.</P>
    <P>(7)  That every licensed manufacturer of tobacco shall not later than the 14th day of May, 1969, make a return to the Revenue Commissioners in a form approved by them giving such information as they may thereby require and, in particular, showing the quantities by weight of tobacco of every description in his ownership or possession at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 7th day of May, 1969, in any place in the State other than a bonded warehouse.</P>
    <P>(8)  That every licensed manufacturer of tobacco shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  produce, if so required, to any officer of Customs and Excise the trade books and all accounts and documents belonging to or in the possession of such manufacturer which are necessary for verifying the return made in pursuance of paragraph (7) of this Resolution, and</P>
    <P>(b) render all reasonable assistance to such officer in the taking of an account of the tobacco which was in the ownership or possession of such manufacturer at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 7th day of May, 1969.</P>
    <P>(9)  That every licensed manufacturer of tobacco shall, immediately upon making the return required by paragraph (7) of this Resolution or on the 14th of May, 1969, whichever is the earlier, pay to the Revenue Commissioners the full amount of the duty mentioned in paragraph (5) of this Resolution on any tobacco which was in his ownership or possession at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 7th day of May, 1969, and was chargeable with the said duty, and the Revenue Commissioners may, if they think fit, defer the payment of the duty to a date not later than the 1st of November, 1969, upon the manufacturer giving <Col N="210" /> security by bond or otherwise to their satisfaction that such duty will be paid.</P>
    <P>(10)  That every manufacturer required by paragraph (7) of this Resolution to make such return as is mentioned in that paragraph who either fails to make such return or makes a return which is incomplete, false or misleading in any material respect or fails or refuses to do anything which he is required by paragraph (8) of this Resolution to do shall be guilty of an offence under the statutes relating to duties of excise and shall for every such offence incur an excise penalty of fifty pounds, and all tobacco in relation to which such offence was committed shall be forfeited.</P>
    <P>(11)  That where drawback is payable in respect of tobacco on which the excise duty provided for by paragraph (5) of this Resolution has been paid, such drawback shall, to the extent of the duty paid in pursuance of the said paragraph (5) as determined by the Revenue Commissioners, be a drawback of excise.</P>

As the Deputy may know, we are having increasing difficulty here in getting skilled reporting staff and investigations have been undertaken to seek to mechanise the reporting of the Dáil. It was decided, wisely I think, that this should first be investigated in the Seanad on a tentative or pilot basis. That has been going on, as most Deputies <Col N="230" /> know, for some time.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because most political Parties nowadays supply scripts from their public relations officers, the old tradition of reporters going out and reporting political meetings, verbatim, has died and therefore the type of reporter who can do shorthand of the necessary speed has become very rare indeed.

      <P>I do not understand why Vote No. 4 comes in at this stage. The Central Statistics Office was always under the direction of the Taoiseach. As far as I know, it still is.  I realise that the Secretary of the Department of Finance is the accounting officer but I think the Taoiseach has always accounted for it in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of this figure is a non-recurring item of £35,000 towards outlay on new accommodation. Part of the increase also has been in respect of extra staff.  I should not like to be doctrinaire as to whether more staff will be required in this institute in the future.  This body can perform a very useful function.  We might avail of their services in the future on the side of social research as well as economic research.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It refers to expenses incurred by county development teams. There are 13 such teams in the west and there is a development officer now in west Wicklow.  By and large, the expenses and the costs of the team secretaries are paid for by the Department by way of salaries because they are established civil servants, but there are three temporary appointments.</P>

      <P>There are county development teams in each of the western <Col N="233" /> counties composed of the chairman of the county council, the county manager and the county engineer.  Each team has a secretary who is responsible for the general economic development of the area &mdash; tourism, industry, any possibility of development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>They have been very successful.  They are backed up by the special regional development fund.  To date, out of that fund we have either paid out or have accumulated liability to pay out grants of more than £400,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The situation up to now was anomalous.  It was carried under the vote for the Department of External Affairs and I did not have control of it because it was availed of by all Ministers.  The main factor was whether Department of Finance sanction was given to any item in respect of entertainment.  It was deemed to be partly under the Finance votes.  This change has been brought about because of a general endeavour to achieve savings.  Generally speaking, we have laid down the principle that for this year there will not be any official entertainment unless there is an existing commitment to an international organisation or some other inescapable commitment.</P>

      <P>In respect of the National Savings Committee, there has been an increase.  One of the duties of this committee is to organise group savings.  Will the Minister say whether in the past year any group savings have <Col N="234" /> been effected by the staff allocated to the National Savings Committee, part of whose work is the general promotion of savings in the community?  As far as I can see, the concrete work they are involved in is the organising of group savings schemes.  Have they organised any such schemes?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies know, we have established a new body to advise and assist in general science policy &mdash; the National Science Council. The administration costs of that new council will be borne under other subheads of the vote for my Department and this amount of £50,000 is to cover the cost of a scheme of research grants which this council have instituted. This £50,000 will probably not be sufficient. We expect ultimately to spend £100,000 in a full year on these grants. The subhead, therefore, deals with a new scheme of science research grants administered by this council.</P>

      <P>Any agreement of this nature must have regard to the special circumstances arising in the case of either of the contracting parties. We all know the British have had enormous balance of payments difficulties.  They have gone to great lengths to put their balance of payments situation right and to protect sterling.  We have a vital interest in this matter too.  When they take some action of this sort, we have to look on what they are doing with sympathy, which we did in this case.  We brought in this particular scheme with a view to alleviating the effects of the special import deposit scheme on our exports, very successfully, indeed, as it happened, and the outcome of the whole affair from our point of view was not unsatisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

If it precluded them from taking this action, then they are acting illegally and we are paying £2 million for their breach of the agreement.  If it entitled them to take this action, the agreement was seriously defective as, judging from the tone of the debate at the time, the Government felt that no such action could be taken.  So, we should like to know whether it is the Minister's view that this is or is not a breach of the agreement.</P>

The Minister says the British may be technically in breach of the free trade agreement.  For the benefit of new Deputies in the House, it is worth recalling that in the British Parliament the question of the breach by the British Government of the free trade agreement was raised. It is a long time since we had the experience of seeing the Tory Opposition proceeding to accuse the British Labour Government of having broken their agreement with this country while at the same time the Conservative Government of Ireland were saying: &ldquo;Oh, there is no breach of the agreement.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a breach of the agreement, and the Minister knows there was.  The regrettable fact is that we had not a Government strong enough in their own views to stand up to the British.  We raised this matter in this House before.  The plain fact is that the result is now known.  The taxpayer <Col N="245" /> will be asked to pay for this breach.

To what extent do we continue to tolerate a breach of an agreement in respect of which many people have doubts?  This was one agreement about which there was supposed to be no doubt that the British were not entitled because of balance of payments difficulties or anything else to do precisely what they did.  The Minister says it has worked out all right.  I do not know whether it has. Certainly it will cost the taxpayer this sum of money.  If, in six months time, the British Government decide to do <Col N="246" /> something else, merely because they conceive it to be in the interests of sterling, are we to tolerate that?  There must be an end.  The agreement has got to be observed, and the Government have been unduly weak in this regard.</P>

The recent discussions we have had with the British Government on various aspects of the free trade agreement have worked out very satisfactorily from our point of view. This item should not be looked at alone.  It must be looked at in the context of the whole result of the agreement and of the discussions which we have had with the British Government on this and other matters. I want the House to advert closely to what I am saying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Various other matters. If the Deputy will cast his mind back to the earlier part of this year, we had far-reaching discussions with the British Government on a number of aspects of the relations between the two countries which have worked out quite satisfactorily from our point of view.  I must say we have been met with great understanding by British Ministers when we have discussed these matters with them.  We have to be realistic about this.  The British Government have enormous difficulties to contend with and they are taking, to my mind, very courageous action to try to protect their balance of payments situation and restore the strength of sterling.  We must have regard to all this and look at the agreement and the workings of the agreement in the light of all these circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that if we were to get into serious difficulties this year or next year we would meet with full understanding and co-operation from the British Government with regard to the agreement.  This is my belief and, in fact, when Irish industries have got into difficulties the reaction of the <Col N="247" /> British Government demonstrated that they are prepared to look at the agreement in the round.  I think both sides to this agreement want it to work to their mutual benefit and if it does not do so, then neither party will be satisfied. As far as this matter or any other matter is concerned I think we can be satisfied that the agreement is working overall to our advantage, and the outcome of this particular matter was very much to our advantage.</P>

      <P>The Minister says he appreciates the difficulties of the British Government in their balance of payments problem and more or less suggests that they had to introduce the import deposit scheme which is costing us £2 million a year.  Might I remind the Minister that on the 18th March last he grimly forecast a big deficit in our balance of payments?  At that time he did not say, for example, we should postpone the reduction of our tariffs on 1st July.  His only suggestion was that wage and salary earners should look for a little less.</P>

      <P>The Minister's defence of Britain was very moving.  It is a pity the British Ambassador has left and did not hear him.  It is not the Minister's job to defend the actions of the British Government.  It is his job to defend the actions of the Irish Government to the Irish people.  The words &ldquo;realism&rdquo; and &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; kept recurring in his remarks.  The only interpretation one can put on the word &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; is that when we sign an agreement with Britain, because they are bigger than we are, they can break it and we must be realistic in accepting that, but we are not in a position to do likewise.  The Minister spoke of the benefits we have been getting.  What benefits have been got outside the terms of the agreement from which Britain agreed to depart for our benefit?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of cheese and butter the position is entirely different.  The British breached the agreement on cheese.  We were given free access for various commodities, for instance, potatoes and <Col N="248" /> sugar.  This list included cheese. Although there was a guarantee in regard to cheese as soon as the British made a fuss we had to give ground. The only case mentioned where there has been any concession is in the case of tyres, but that concession was not outside the terms of the agreement but within it.</P>
      <P>The agreement made provision for cases where an Irish industry got into difficulties and where protection could be reimposed for a period in relation to the industry.  That is the action we took.  However, I do not think the Minister can reasonably equate that concession within the agreement with the British decision in respect of the clause to protect their balance of payments, the clause that was written in to enable them to take certain action to protect their balance of payments. The British decision to depart from that breached the agreement and we had to pay the cost.  We are not the richer of the two parties but by far the poorer.  There is no case whatsoever for this procedure, and the Minister is merely drawing a red herring across the trail in order to distract attention from it.  The case of the tyres, which is within the agreement, is not an adequate justification for the fact that Britain has breached the agreement on three occasions and there has been no compensation of any kind.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that through the quick action of the Government in asking for this concession this country was saved from considerable disruption of exports?  If the British economy collapsed this country would be far worse off; in fact, I think we got the best deal of any country. We were the first country to think of this idea of paying the interest on the deposits necessary to enable our goods to go into the British market.  This was the only country the British allowed to operate this system; other countries applied for it and were refused.</P>

      <P>That is another red herring.  If the Minister wants to go back in time let me remind him that we in this Party had a certain viewpoint on the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and expressed that viewpoint here in 1966.  The defence of the agreement so far is that the balance of trade has been in our favour and will be in our favour up to 1970, but that after that period the advantage will apparently go to Britain in their exports to this country.  In fact, what has been happening in the period in which we should supposedly benefit most from the operation of the agreement is that the British themselves have unilaterally breached the agreement on several occasions and I should like to ask the Minister whether, in fact, in any of the discussions held with the British over the past year the possibility of our being compensated for their breaches of the agreement, breaches for which we have had to pay, was raised or whether the money paid to us earlier this year, amidst a great fanfare of trumpets, was in lieu of any settlement of the moneys we would look for because of their breaches of the agreement.  If the Minister thinks £2 million a small sum, how explain the fanfare that accompanied the payment back to us of a quarter of a million?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>What the British did on this occasion applied to practically every country in the world and cut across numerous agreements which they had with other countries.  Indeed, I do not know if this action of their did not cut across GATT.  It may have. They had no alternative and their trading partners understood that and accepted the situation.  In order to avert a serious economic collapse the British had to take this action and, from our point of view, it was the least injurious action they could take.  As Deputy Briscoe pointed out, we moved very vigorously immediately to introduce this particular scheme in order to counteract the worst effects of the special import deposit scheme on our exports.  That scheme worked very satisfactorily.  Remembering what other countries have had to put up with in the British market, the outcome from our point of view was not unsatisfactory.</P>

Had there not been a Labour Government in Britain it is perfectly obvious this problem would never have arisen at all and we would not be here this evening debating this matter.

Of course, had that happened, there would be no subscriptions and they would not have been able to fight the election.  It is a public disgrace that these people should come in here and start blackguarding the Minister when the truth is that it is the Labour Government's policy in Britain which has been responsible for our having to take the action we did and we could expect nothing better from that crew over there if they got in here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise one point.  There are problems at times about publications which go out of print.  I know it is difficult for the Stationery Office to judge the demand exactly.  Indeed, a couple of years ago there was a big demand for a Seanad debate and, no sooner was the debate printed and available, than the demand dried up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. nFitzGerald Dr. nFitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. nFitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Amongst others. That created the demand.  What caused the drying up of the demand I cannot say.  There are cases in which publications are likely to remain in continuing demand and it is rather startling to find such publications out of print.  A case in point is that of election results.  General election results are printed but, when I inquired lately for a copy of the 1948 general election results, I was told they were out of print.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The results of the previous general elections were also out of print.  I suggested that these election results were of enduring interest in a country as politically minded as this and it is important that they should remain in <Col N="254" /> print.  If they were in print there would be a continuing although, perhaps, sporadic demand for them, perhaps, for years or decades to come, but I did not elicit any competent response. Could the Minister look into this particular question and also into the general question of re-printing publications? Although I cannot put my finger on other publications in regard to which this problem has arisen I have found on other occasions that the same problem exists.  I am quite sure that my judgment of a continuing demand might not always be correct but it is important that what should or should not be kept in print should receive further attention.</P>
    <P>This procedure in regard to Dáil general election and by-election results should be extended.  It is a matter of some concern that it is not possible to get results of either local elections or Seanad elections in similar form. The Seanad election results are available in manuscript form in the Library of this House but the are quite difficult to read because of the binding. They are not otherwise available to anybody and they are of some current topical interest to some hundreds of people in the country.  It seems to me that for the permanent record they should be available in print.  The same is true of local election results in respect of which it is almost impossible to get details of all the counts without a search.  They should be available to us.  The whole question of reprinting publications should be considered further and some procedure should be introduced to ensure that publications which are out of date should be kept under review and a reasonably generous policy should be pursued in relation to publications which could be of continuing public interest.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a simple matter about which I do not know whether the Minister can do anything.  The Ordnance Survey Maps are completely out of date as they were produced some 140 years ago.  Today, especially with the Planning Act in operation, these sheets are absolutely useless in most cases.  I would like the Minister to say when it is likely that new Ordnance Survey sheets will be available.  I know that everything possible is being done but in the west where most of these surveys have already been carried out I hope that they will not be left without these new sheets until the whole country has been done.  I would ask the Minister to try <Col N="256" /> to have new survey sheets available to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would support what Deputy Lenehan said.  We must be in an almost unique position in regard to the out-of-date character of our maps.  The city of Dublin has not been mapped in any detail for over 30 years.  A two-inch scale map has recently been produced and is totally inadequate as there is no room for entering in the names of the streets except in some cases by number and if you are looking at the map and looking for a street name you have to look up the entire index to find it. Dublin is comparatively well mapped being only out of date for 30 years although when I was looking at the map for the Dublin South East constituency I found whole areas which involve tens of thousands of people shown as open fields.  Many parts of the country are 70 years out of date on the half-inch scale and over 100 years in respect of larger scales.  I know that the mapping process is an expensive business and organised as it is at present it does not pay.  I do not think the Ordnance Survey is being run with sufficient commercial acumen.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister is giving it a freer hand to make it a greater financial success.  I am informed that in Denmark, where the tourist industry is on a much smaller scale than here the sale of maps is three times greater than in this country. The reason is that they produce up-to-date attractive maps for sale on a profitable basis and as a result their sales of maps per tourist are something like nine times what they are here. A disparity of that magnitude is something that merits looking into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our Ordnance Survey are limited in that they have not been producing up-to-date maps which are in a particularly attractive format, up to recently and in addition under the present system the copyright is given free of charge to commercial map makers after 30 years and this is why out-of-date maps are still in active use.  The copyright should remain the property of the Survey and not be given away free of charge.  The whole approach is uncommercial <Col N="257" /> and unsatisfactory.  I recall that during the war there was a survey of roads and I myself have in my possession a map which I obtained as a member of the FCA and some years ago when I inquired about a copy of this map from Government Publications I was told that it never existed and that no such survey was ever carried out.  Although we had an up-to-date survey of the roads carried out, and which I have at home, it was not available to the public.</P>
    <P>There is no blame attaching to the expert staff of the Ordnance Survey over all this, it is due to the way in which it is run, under the fairly tight control of the Civil Service and because it is not run as a commercial proposition and not given a free hand to develop commercially.  It would be to the advantage of the tourist industry and also to our revenue which could be greatly enhanced, if the Survey were given a freer hand.  I suggest that the Minister should look into this matter and, perhaps, organise some review of the position, perhaps, take advice from somebody with experience in the matter in other countries and see if it would not be possible to have up-to-date maps produced by a more remunerative Ordnance Survey which would cost the country less.</P>

      <P>I must certainly look into the matter of the secret military map which Deputy FitzGerald has and I may be able to expend some of the Secret Service Vote acquiring it in the interests of national security.  On the broader issue of these maps, work has been going on.  The operation is a very expensive one.  Whether we can improve matters within the limit of our resources is something I shall go into. But, I would like to tell the House that there was a committee on mapping requirements set up by the Director of the Ordnance Survey in 1964 and that advisory committee made various recommendations and I, as Minister for Finance, accepted all those recommendations and have undertaken in <Col N="258" /> principle to make the necessary finances available to implement them.  So that I would hope that the situation will be considerably improved as we proceed.  It may not be able to be improved dramatically in the short term but improved I hope it will be.  I will also certainly inquire into the suggestion that maps are not available when they are required.</P>
      <P>A considerable amount of progress has been made in revising the largescale maps.  I am told that revisions of Dublin city and county were undertaken and started in 1966.  Dublin county will be finished this year and, of course, Dublin city, being a much more complicated business, will take something like three to four years to complete but activity is going on and I will see what can be done to expedite improvements in the situation.</P>

      <P>First of all, can I ask the Minister whether it would be possible to have a copy of this advisory report?  I think it would be useful to have this and to have an opportunity of studying it.  Could I ask him whether it is, in fact, a technical report only on mapping requirements or whether it covers the commercial aspects to which I have referred? Could I ask him whether his reference to the provision of finance &ldquo;in principle&rdquo; means what I think it means, which is, that there is no commitment of any kind to provide it in any particular year and, if so, would he consider providing finance, not in principle, but in practice, to ensure this work is done and the recommendations are carried out?  Could I ask him, when he says &ldquo;in three or four years time&rdquo; in respect of the maps of Dublin city, does he mean three or fours years from now or from the time the exercise started?</P>

      <P>From now.  Could I ask him whether he is aware that something like £30,000 worth of free maps are supplied to Government Departments which are not included, I think, in the figures in the estimate for appropriations-in-aid and, therefore, the figures as given are not correct or adequate and could I ask him finally whether he is aware that having gone to considerable expense to train staff in the Ordnance Survey they are then paid as Army privates and corporals and, therefore, do not stay and whether the cost to the community of this training, the value of which is lost, could not be recovered if, in fact, they were adequately paid and would remain in the job?</P>
