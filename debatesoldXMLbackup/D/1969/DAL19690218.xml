      <P>As the answer is very long <Col N="1032" /> and comprised of factual details and statistics I propose with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate it with the official reports.</P>
      <P>(a)  Under the terms of the Scholarship Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Act, 1957, An Bord Scoláireachtaí Cómalairte consists of seven members of whom four are Irish citizens appointed by the Minister for External Affairs and three are citizens of the United States of America appointed by the head of the Diplomatic Mission of the United States to Ireland.</P>
      <P>The present members of An Bord are:</P>
      <P Just="Center">
        <i>Appointed by the Minister for External Affairs</i>
      </P>
      <P>An Dr. Mairtín Ó Tnúthail, Chairman of An Bord, President of University College, Galway;</P>
      <P>Dr. Tadhg Twomey, Director of Department of Research and Development, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teo.;</P>
      <P>Professor E.T.S. Walton, F.T.C.D., Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy, Trinity College, Dublin;</P>
      <P>Mrs. Patrick Drury Byrne, Company Director.</P>
      <P Just="Center">
        <i>Appointed by the Head of the United States Mission</i>
      </P>
      <P>Mr. James E. Hoofnagle, Counsellor, U.S. Embassy;</P>
      <P>Mrs. Luan P. Cuffe, Writer;</P>
      <P>Mr. Virgil P. Randolph III, Second Secretary, U.S. Embassy.</P>
      <P>(b)  An Bord invites applications for grants by means of advertisements in the daily newspapers, and circulars addressed to the universities and other interested bodies, which specify the academic or other qualifications required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All applications which fulfil the requirements specified in An Bord's advertisements are considered.  The limited number of grants available is awarded on a strictly competitive basis. The advertisements lay down that An Bord reserves to itself the exclusive right to evaluate the merits of each <Col N="1033" /> applicant, that the selection of An Bord is final and that An Bord does not give reasons for its decisions.  In selecting grantees An Bord takes into consideration the qualifications of applicants, their future plans as stated to An Bord, and the importance to the Irish economy of their proposed fields of study.</P>
    <P>(c)  The Scholarship Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Act, 1957, gave effect to an agreement between the two governments for the establishment of a scholarship exchange scheme and the utilisation for that purpose of the American Grant Counterpart Special Account.  The Act specified that the functions of the Board shall be the financing of studies, research, instruction, teaching, lecturing and other educational activities&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  of Irish citizens in schools, <Col N="1034" /> universities, institutions of higher learning and other suitable institutions located in the United States of America, and American schools and suitable American institutions located elsewhere.</P>
    <P>(b)  of citizens of the United States of America in schools, universities, institutions of higher learning and other suitable institutions located in the State.</P>
    <P>and, in co-operation with the United States Board of Foreign Scholarships, the selecting of students, professors, teachers, research scholars and other suitable persons for that purpose. Since the exchange scheme operates under the terms of an agreement between the Government and the Government of the United States of America the Minister is not in a position to extend its operations beyond the limits specified in the agreement.</P>

    <P>The figures given are for the academic year (1 July&mdash;30 June) in each case.</P>
    <P>(e)  The operation of An Bord and the execution of its programme are financed from the yield on the investment of the funds provided from the American Grant Counterpart Special Account.  The total sum available to An Bord in the current financial year is approximately £30,600.  It is not possible at this date to state an exact figure, since further income, amounting at the most to a few hundred pounds, may accrue to An Bord before the end of the current financial year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state with reference to the recent statement by the Minister for Education regarding a new Government scheme to assist Irish exiles in Great Britain whether any part of this scheme will be administered by his Department; and, if so, if he will give details.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Advice and assistance to Irish citizens living abroad is administered by the Department of External Affairs and, as I indicated in my reply to the Deputy on the 12th instant in the case of Great Britain, improved arrangements have been made in recent years to help our citizens there, particularly those who are in need of special protection.</P>
      <P>The education and technical training of citizens to enable them to improve their earning capacity whether they stay at home or go abroad is within the purview of the Departments of Labour and Education.  The matter is constantly under review and being improved by the Government and the Departments concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the help referred to includes assistance in the case of women whose husbands have deserted them and in which an effort is <Col N="1035" /> being made to locate them.  Does that come within the Minister's province or is it more appropriate to the Department of Justice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is Social Welfare but if an Irish citizen was in need of protection for any reason that protection would be given.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. L'Estrange</b> asked the Minister for Transport and Power if his attention has been drawn to a report concerning an incident at Dublin Airport on Saturday, 8th February involving newspaper photographers and airport security officers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>For reasons of safety and security at the airport, access to the apron area is allowed only with permission and under supervision.  In this case the newspaper photographers were found on the apron area without permission and were required to leave.</P>
      <P>Normal facilities for pressmen are available at the Press Office at the Airport. Where special facilities, such as access to apron, are required and the airport press officer is not available, the procedure is to apply to the security officer in charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that on this occasion the press officer was not there and the photographers <Col N="1036" /> tried to find if they could get permission from someone else to get out on to the apron?  They got permission from the Customs men.  The Customs men were the only people they could see from whom to obtain permission. They got permission and, when they went out on the apron, the security man came along and asked them to leave.  They explained that they had gone to the Customs people who were the only people they could ask at the time and they were told that, if they did not leave, they would be forcibly removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to be very strict about security arrangements.  We have to take every precaution.  I understand that the Customs officer, in fact, told the pressman who asked him only that he could move into the Customs area.  This is the first complaint, I think, I have ever had since 1959.  The arrangements generally are understood but, in this instance, an unfortunate misunderstanding arose. It is usual to have people who come to meet aeroplanes under proper supervision naturally because meeting planes makes for more publicity for the airport, for Aer Lingus and for tourism.  We have, however, to keep the movement of pressmen maintained in an organised way.  We have nothing against them at all.  It was purely a misunderstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think that, having regard to the fact that these men had regularly attended there before and were quite well known to the security officers, the action of the security officers in telling them to leave or they would be forcibly removed was a bit highhanded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The security officers have to take the maximum precautions. The Deputy is making a mountain out of a molehill because this procedure operates so successfully.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the policy of the B &amp; I Company, in common with other semi-State bodies, to buy Irish to the greatest practicable extent.  I understand from the company that in conformity with this policy almost their entire requirements of publicity material are obtained in this country.  The case mentioned by the Deputy was exceptional in that it required a special printing process which so far as the company could ascertain was not available here.  I should add that the value of the order represented an insignificant portion of the company's total expenditure on publicity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Pursuant to the provisions of section 465 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, I have had a preliminary inquiry carried out by a marine surveyor of my Department into the loss of the <i>Sea Flower</i>.  The statutory purpose of such an inquiry is to enable me to determine whether a formal investigation under section 466 of the Act is warranted.</P>
      <P>The inspector who carried out the preliminary inquiry had available to him the sworn evidence given at the inquest into the loss of life.  He interviewed and took statements from members of the Garda and local persons who were able to supplement evidence given at the inquest.  He also obtained reports from the Marine Rescue Coordination Centre and the Meteorological Office and inspected the scene of the casualty.  He had himself carried out a survey of the vessel shortly before the casualty and had found it fully seaworthy.</P>
      <P>The vessel had put to sea despite gale warnings and local advice.  There is no evidence to suggest that the vessel was not seaworthy in all respects or that there was any other cause of the casualty than very bad weather.  I am satisfied, therefore, that a formal investigation is not necessary.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the adequacy and efficiency of the sea rescue services are kept under constant review.  I have arranged for very early discussions between the various agencies concerned to consider whether any improvements are called for in the light of this tragedy.</P>

      <P>The increasing levy receipts will be applied by the Board mainly towards meeting one-third of its export losses and subsidies.  The remaining twothirds of these losses and subsidies will, of course, be met by the Exchequer. Total Exchequer expenditure on milk in 1969/70 at present levels of support could be in the region of £29 million as compared with £19.3 million in 1967/68 and an estimated £25.6 million in 1968/69.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order referred to has been in force since the 1st February, 1969.  There can, therefore, be no question at this stage of postponement.</P>
      <P>I might point out to the Deputy that three years prior notice through the press and other publicity media was given of the proposed introduction of the ban on the sale or export of horned cattle with effect from 1st February, 1969.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with the Minister that the time is opportune but it is small recompense to the man hard hit at the moment because he has one or two cattle to sell and he cannot dispose of them in a public place.  Therefore he has to sell them in the stall or not at all; and because he will not know the value of them so well he is victimised.  I would appeal to the Minister to postpone this to the 1st April and he would not do any harm to anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties, as the Deputy is already aware and as the House is aware, is that the Order has been in operation since the 1st of this month.  In addition, there can be no doubt but that every effort was made to let it be known that this ban was being put into operation.  Ample notice was given and also a lot of publicity was given to this matter. There is again another feature in that, in doing this job and applying this ban and getting this thing in movement, we have a reciprocal agreement with the Six Counties who have made such a regulation simultaneously <Col N="1046" /> and this also comes into operation.  That is a further difficulty. If there are those who have horned cattle at the moment I do not think they suffer all that much from this regulation in not knowing the value of cattle those days.  Generally speaking, they are well able to ask more than the value of them.  Whether they hold out and get the value of their cattle is another matter.  There is another feature.  We hope it is not too far from the time of the year when it will be possible to de-horn those cattle which would bring them within the regulation that has been made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that nobody would attempt to de-horn cattle which would run for beef.  It is the small man who suffers. It is the man with one or two cattle who wants to sell them who suffers. He cannot sell them and he has to take them home.  If the Minister would not enforce the Order until 1st of April he would be doing a service to the small man.</P>

    <P>Under the Mountain Lamb Subsidy Scheme the rate of subsidy was increased last year from 10/- to £1 per head, with payments to farmers amounting to over £365,000.  With effect from 25th November, 1968, there were substantial increases in the <Col N="1047" /> maximum rates of grant under the Mountain Fencing and Mountain Grazings Schemes.  I will shortly be bringing into operation improved marketing arrangements for wool. Exports of carcase mutton and lamb to Britain are supported under the Export Guarantee Scheme, payments being specially weighted to encourage increased marketings of lamb in the early months of the year when prices are at their highest level.  All these measures are designed to encourages sheep production and I am examining the position to see what further steps it may be possible to take to increase production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is primarily a matter for Limerick Corporation, as planning authority for the area, and I have no direct functions in relation to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 planning authorities have power to include in their development plans objectives for the preservation of buildings of artistic, architectural or historical interest.  Limerick Corporation's statutory development plan contains an objective for the preservation of a <Col N="1049" /> number of such buildings including the Georgian buildings in The Crescent and Perry Square and the Corporation have committed themselves not to permit any alteration or reconstruction of these buildings which would materially conflict with the architectural character of the areas.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that the Minister himself made a regulation under the Planning Act authorising any landlord to pull down any building by removing demolition by his order from the scope of the Planning Act and the jurisdiction of the local planning authorities and that he is only now bringing in a Bill to undo by legislation what he himself did by order?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true.  This is a conflict of fact.  Is there not a statutory order made by the Minister for Local Government under the Planning Acts whereby certain matters are exempted from the authority of the local planning authority and amongst these matters is the matter of demolition?  Is it not a fact that the Minister himself made a regulation under the Planning Acts authorising any vandal to pull down any building by removing &ldquo;demolition ......&rdquo; from the scope of the Planning Acts and the jurisdiction of the local planning authority and that he is, only now, bringing in a Bill to undo by legislation what he himself did by order?</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <P>Could the Minister say why a State Department cannot buy all their petrol from three or four companies rather than from one company? I do not understand that.  Private business people have a sort of solo agreement.  Why cannot a State Department, which buys a tremendous amount of oil, buy from three companies rather than from one, giving that particular company a monopoly?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry; the Minister misunderstood me.  If a State Department buys from one company, which signed a contract to supply oil at 2d a gallon less or something like that, why not buy from three companies? Why not get three of them to supply and then a strike would never affect you?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy understands.  The Office of Public Works goes out from time to time and invites tenders for the supply of petrol and oil.  At present a particular company, which won the tender on the basis of competitive offer, have the contract.  There is no guarantee they will get it next time.</P>

      <P>A site for a new school at Bloomhill was obtained in 1965. Difficulties arose in regard to getting title to this site.  In order, however, to permit of arrangements being made by the Commissioners for the erection of the school a grant was sanctioned in February, 1968, pending the question of title being resolved.  Title to the site was not established until October, 1968, and tenders were subsequently invited.

We have reached the position during the past 12 months where the university institutions in this country recognise the qualifications achieved in engineering and in architecture by the College of Technology to the extent that the students concerned, although they have not got degrees, can pursue a mastership at the university on the basis of the qualification achieved at the Colleges of Technology.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned last Thursday I had said most of what I intended to say on the Criminal Justice Bill.  However, there is one matter&mdash;I do not know whether or not we are allowed to discuss it&mdash;which I should like the Minister to bear in mind and that is uniformity of fines or sentences.  Offences which would seem to the layman to be of a similar nature very often carry different fines or sentences.  An instance of where this uniformity is lacking is in cases where a person up for the second or third time on a charge of housebreaking gets a suspended sentence which will not be enforced provided he is of good behaviour for 12 months.  He is only asked to do what every honest, law-abiding citizen is supposed to do at all times, and if this condition is carried out then there is no other penalty.  At the same time, we see cases where somebody caught in a public house ten minutes after the official closing time is fined £2.  Surely a man who happens to be a few minutes late finishing his drink cannot be regarded in the same category at all as a housebreaker who has been convicted for the second or third time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are heartened by the thought that the Minister has agreed to amend sections 30 and 31, because originally the Minister told us when this Bill was first being criticised that the criticism was ill-informed and misguided.  However, he now realises himself that it was not all that misinformed or misguided. Not alone had we his word, but the <Col N="1077" /> Minister for Local Government came in and speaking at a dinner in honour of the Minister for Justice assured us that there was nothing in the present Bill of which Fianna Fáil could be ashamed.  May I say that the Minister for Local Government was as near the truth in that instance as he was when he tried to force the referendum?  If Fine Gael feel that the Minister goes far enough in amending sections 30 and 31 then they will be satisfied with him, but if they do not feel that they will continue to press for further amendments. The Succession Bill, when it was finally passed, bore little resemblance to what was originally introduced. Who knows but this Bill, when it is finally passed through this House, may turn out to be a lot better than it was when it was originally introduced by the Minister?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few observations on this Bill.  From listening to people outside speaking on this Bill one would imagine we were a lot of dictators here and that we wanted to injure everybody.  In introducing this Bill, the Minister did so for the benefit of all the people and not for a section of the people.  In my time in this House I never saw a Bill introduced here but there was some objection to portions of it.  On this occasion we have some very good sections in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted to see the section which deals with flick knives and ordinary knives.  I feel it is the most criminal thing possible for a man or a boy to produce a knife.  I would prefer to meet a man with a gun than someone with a knife who might possibly stab one in the front or back, the heart or chest.  This has been going on too long.  There are cases pending at the moment and I do not want to make a statement, but I would suggest to the Minister that it is time the Minister for Justice or the Department of Justice put a stop to the use of knives by anyone on his fellow man or woman.  An example should be made of such a person.  I know an unfortunate boy living near me in Santry who had a very good career in front of him.  He was beaten up by a number of thugs while leaving a dancehall.  One of them <Col N="1078" /> knifed him.  That is three years ago now and that young man is a wreck today.  In dealing with these thugs who are going around beating up people who disagree with them it might be a good idea to put men into plain clothes in order to catch them.  I believe the Garda are doing a good job in the city, but I want to feel that anybody can walk freely in this city without being molested.  We are too chickenhearted in dealing with these people.</P>
    <P>We have another position in which everybody wants to be a law unto himself, so far as I can see.  Public men are fair game for abuse at all times and in public life you must expect that. We now find the position that a few people can hold up the whole traffic of Dublin.  Is that freedom of democracy, when people cannot get to or from their business or move around on their business?  We are talking about freedom of speech and other freedoms. Is it freedom when a number of people can sit down on the streets of Dublin and hold up the whole city?  Are we going to tolerate that type of situation? I should like to see another Hyde Park in Dublin where people could come along and preach anything they liked, but to go out and hold up the thoroughfare in the city of Dublin is another day's work.  In the city, no matter what one's calling is in life, everyone is going to, or from, or about his business. Is this idea of the people taking the law into their own hands and saying they are going to object to such and such and so-and-so and sit down on O'Connell Bridge &mdash; is that democracy? We must do something to stop this type of blackguardism.  If it were decided to go any place in the city, and even if the Corporation and the Government would set up a special park with special stands where people could preach, or roar, or shout that would be democracy, but it is not democracy to interfere with the citizens who walk or drive through the city. For that reason I feel very strongly about the Puritans who have been criticising us.  It is one thing to have a peaceful march in the city in a democratic way.  That is no harm if it does not interfere with traffic.  I should not like to see decent people marching like that being interfered with.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1079" /> We have too many housebreaking charges and I would like to see if the Department of Justice could trace the receivers.  I should like to see them severely dealt with because they are encouraging crime and encouraging people who are engaged in stealing and housebreaking.  I feel we should do whatever we have to do to try to deter these people more and more.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to say very much more on the Bill.  So far as I can see, with the exception of a few amendments that the Minister himself has promised to insert at Committee Stage, it is a good Bill and in my estimation the Bill is long overdue.</P>

      <P>It was very nice of Deputy Reynolds to ask for the count.  He wanted me to have an audience.  I was getting on reasonably well.  I was dealing with house breakers and others of that type.  There is another type who should be treated more strictly.  It is the motor car thief. Terrible inconvenience is caused by people who steal cars.  A businessman may pull up his car at some space where he will not be penalised for parking. He goes in to do his business and comes out to find that his car had been stolen.  I know that the courts should be given every possible freedom and I know that judges and district justices give proper decisions in all cases, but I think stricter action should be taken against car thieves.  Such people always have excuses &mdash; they say they did not know what they were doing and that they come from decent families.  Indeed, I have often been approached in cases of this kind to intercede for these people.</P>
      <P>However, the inconvenience they cause is incalculable.  Hundreds of cars are stolen each year and though the guards find many of the culprits it is difficult to undo the inconvenience caused to decent people going about their business in the normal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister for Justice has adopted the human approach in this Bill.  He has decided to deal leniently with first offenders <Col N="1080" /> and, in certain cases, with second offenders.  I have spoken about the people with knives, with those who sit down on the streets and stop traffic. This, according to them, is supposed to be democracy in action.  Another favourite pastime is abuse of the Garda.  They are our police force, there to enforce law and order.  Sometimes they have to protect even public men against people who would try even to take over this place or other places. The Garda have been doing a good job to keep law and order.  I should like to see extra gardaí on duty outside dancehalls in this city, particularly when dances are over because there are always thugs at some of them ready to beat people up.  Taking everything into consideration, the Minister has done a good job in this Bill and I wish him luck with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most evil Bills which Oireachtas Éireann has ever been called on to consider, because this is a Bill which asks the people's representatives to give power to the police force to ban public meetings. There is no qualification in this evil measure as to the type of meeting which may be prohibited.  There is no guidance given to the police force to indicate the type of public gathering which is to be regarded as contrary to the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers given are unlimited, unqualified and unprecedented and are not in any way justified by the circumstances of our time, nor could they be justified in any foreseeable circumstances. What is upsetting is that any Government should ask from Oireachtas Éireann such unlimited powers to do such evil things, and it is no consolation to us to learn after months of acrimonious debate and after the Government have been politically embarrassed, that for the time being they are having second thoughts about this wholly unwarranted measure.  If the Government are having second thoughts it is only because of the embarrassment which they suffered in last autumn's referendum and because of the fact that, unavoidably, they will have to face the electorate this year.  Were it not for these two important facts the Government would not in any way be qualifying <Col N="1081" /> the powers they are seeking here to restrict and to prohibit public meetings.</P>
    <P>Section 30 purported to make it obligatory according to the law of this land for any person organising or holding any public meeting to give notice to a superintendent of the Garda Síochána. I know of no other country in the democratic world in which it is obligatory on citizens to give notice to the police force of an intention to hold a public meeting.  To suggest that it were necessary to do this in order to prevent traffic obstruction is to advance an excuse for a wholly unjustifiable action.  There are those who have, quite wrongly, suggested that this Bill is the product of bureaucrats, of ruthless, faceless men in the corridors of power who are not members of the Government. It is unfair to say that because the responsibility for any Bill lies with the Government. A Bill of this kind if drafted at all in the bureaucratic corridors has to be submitted to the Government and that requires the circulation of copies of the Bill to every member of the Government many days. if not in some cases many weeks, in advance of the consideration of the Bill by the Government. Any Bill such as this Bill has then to be solemnly and formally considered at a Government meeting of which due notice must be given to all members of the Cabinet. That is a necessary and unavoidable procedure. This Bill was so considered. This Bill was so circulated.  This Bill was, therefore, examined or ought to have been examined by each and every member of the Government before the Government gave their <i>nihil obstat</i>, its <i>imprimatur</i> to the measure.  Therefore, the responsibility for the outrageous proposals in this Bill lies fairly and sequarely on the Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, and the men selected by him to be members of the Government.</P>
    <P>They and they alone are responsible for seeking powers here which no dictator in recent times has ever sought by edict or otherwise to take unto himself. Therefore, we must condemn the Government and nobody else for this measure.  We must fear the Government and nobody else.  We must protest against the Government and against nobody else and we must justifiably seek our revenge against the Government <Col N="1082" /> and nobody else.  If there be any advisers to the Government who wrongly advise the Government it is for the Government to reject the advice; it is for the Government to consider and balance any advice given to them; it is for the Government to consider and weigh and amend if necessary any legislation drafted for them.  Therefore, if the Bill was drafted for them in this form it was for the Government to reject the draft which was put before them.  The Government did not reject it.  The Government did not amend it as far as we know and if they did they certainly are responsible for the text as put before Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Every iota in this Bill is the responsibility of the Government, the Taoiseach and all his Ministers.  The Minister for Justice may have some measure of Departmental responsibility but that is as far as it goes.  If any Minister proposes a Bill to any Government it is for the Government to accept the responsibility and then the Government can amend any draft submitted by any Minister.  It would be wrong, therefore, even though it might be tempting for us to do so, to put blame personally on the Minister for Justice; the blame must lie entirely on each and every member of the Government. Therefore, when the Taoiseach appears in public with a woebegone look on his face of &ldquo;it is all rather beyond me and I am not really responsible&rdquo; it just will not do.  He is responsible as Head of the Government for all the odious proposals contained in this evil Bill.  On that account the Government together must be condemned.</P>
    <P>We cannot be in any way comforted by a partial withdrawal by the Minister, on behalf of the Government, of some of these proposals, a withdrawal which, of course, has not yet been made but which is promised.  We cannot be comforted because we know it is done unwillingly, reluctantly, because time and time again in the course of public debate after Fine Gael tabled their amending proposal, the Minister has come forward and has endeavoured to justify every section of the Bill.  If the Minister now makes any amendments it is because he is forced to do so out of the only thing that the Government <Col N="1083" /> take into consideration and that is because of political embarrassment and for no other reason.</P>
    <P>If by some strange miracle of fate the Government were to be re-elected at any time in the future it is certain, as certain as I am standing here now, they would bring in a Bill as evil and as odious as the one before us.  If they should again get their hands on government, after the next general election they would bring in proposals just as outlandish and just as unwarranted and just as undemocratic as the Bill we are asked to consider at present.  The right of peaceful and orderly assembly is an essential part of the democratic way of life.  There is no other way in which people can freely express themselves or more effectively express themselves than by way of public meeting.  A public meeting can be organised in a way which no amount of letter-writing or no amount of usage of other media can equal and, therefore, to restrict this essential liberty is to put a very severe embargo on the right of freedom of expression.  There is certainly every reason to restrict violent assemblies, disorderly assemblies, groups of people who are bent upon an evil purpose, or any public meetings which cause much greater disruption and inconvenience or restrictions on other people than are warranted in regard to the purpose for which the meetings are called.</P>
    <P>These are matters which can be dealt with by simply drafting legislation if there is any need to draft it but I think that the ordinary decencies which are observed by the people of Ireland are sufficient to enable us to continue in future as we have in the past.  We have public gatherings without having to have an umbrella of restrictive and intimidating legislation.  I know that many people in public life, including myself, who had occasion to call public meetings in the past have made a practice of notifying the Garda Síochána where such meetings were proposed to be held in public places, not because there was any legal obligation imposed on us to do so, not because there was any legal sanction if we did not do it but because it appeared to be the reasonable thing to do.  But if the Bill, as it is proposed in Second Stage and as <Col N="1084" /> it is now debated, were to become the law of the land, I, for one, would refuse to give notice to the police force of my intention to hold a public meeting. Even if I were to be visited with imprisonment for failing do it, I would refuse to give notice to the Garda Síochána of intention to hold a public meeting under section 30 of this Bill as drafted no matter what penalties were imposed on me for failing to do so.</P>
    <P>I say that at the moment I give notice whenever it is proposed to hold a meeting in a public place because there is no sanction to be imposed upon me if I fail to do it, because it appears to be the reasonable thing to do, but the day on which this House of the Oireachtas and the other House would pass an unreasonable measure I would say that reasonable men would be wrong to obey such an unreasonable sanction and that the proper thing to do would be to show one's contempt for such an outrangeous law by refusing to obey it.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister in his anxiety to hit about him in all directions will probably declare this as an appetite for anarchy on the part of the Fine Gael Party.  We are indifferent as to anything the Minister may say because the public are unlikely to accept anything which he may now say, having regard to the fact that for so long he refused to make any amendment, and then made an amendment, and having regard to the fact that he is publicly shown to be in the wrong and publicly shown to be abusing the privileges of this House and attacking an innocent citizen.  He refuses to make what ought to be a proper apology for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;particularly having observed the fact that the Minister made a note when I was speaking.  It is also not unreasonable that I should base my anticipation on the Minister's past conduct or upon what public opinion may now be of the Minister. The section to which I have referred is, therefore, one which should never have been put into a Bill which was submitted to the Oireachtas and the Minister stands, with his colleagues in the Government from the Taoiseach down, as unqualifiedly condemned for all time as unfit to hold the reins of office and, indeed, unfit to be members of a democratic Parliament for ever having conceived and given birth to such outrageous proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 31 is equally offensive.  That is the section which gives power to impose conditions in regard to, or to prohibit meetings and processions.  In the past I have condemned efforts on the part of the present Government, and the Minister in particular, to misuse the Garda Síochána.  The Garda are as fine a body of men as any country could have as a police force. They have given unselfish and impartial service to all sections of the Irish people irrespective of politics, religion or social background.  But in recent times there have been very obvious indications that the Government were bent upon trying to use the Garda Síochána for political purposes. We have seen on many occasions, where industrial and other disputes arose, that the Garda were obliged, on Ministerial direction, to impose or threaten the full majesty of the law and to bring before the courts and to hold before the odium of public condemnation citizens who were never wrong before.  We have seen that as soon as the political purposes of the Government had been served by such a process the Government could just as quickly direct the Garda to stop such actions and just as quickly could release from jail the people whom we were asked, days beforehand, to consider as enemies of public peace and public order and the welfare of the State.  This is an improper use of the law officers of the State.  It is an abuse of the police force.  It is grossly unfair to members of the Garda Síochána <Col N="1086" /> who should be the friends of everybody and not made the tools of the Government because they fear demotion or unpopular transfers or some other penalty which a ruthless or reckless Government would not hesitate to use.</P>
    <P>In an atmosphere in which we are aware of the Government's behaviour in that regard we must, therefore, be doubly anxious about their proposals in section 31 which would give a right to a police force directed by them to impose conditions in relation to public meetings both as to time and place. Such restrictions and conditions are not necessary in statutory form.  So far as our people are concerned, as I have said before, the overwhelming majority give notice to the Garda and are only too glad to comply with suggestions which they may make regarding the time and place of public meetings.  It is only proper that people should give such reasonable notice and that people should have such reasonable discussions with the Garda but if we cannot achieve a consensus of wisdom by such processes we shall never do it by making it statutorily necessary to have such consultations.</P>
    <P>Therefore, apart from the fact that sections 30 and 31 are evil in themselves we should not have them on the Statute Book and they should not be proposed for it because as they are evil they are also unworkable and would lead to greater chaos and disorder and more anarchy than anything we may already have.  Some years ago, for instance, the present Government for the first time made it a law to obtain Garda permits for certain collections. Since then there have been several cases of serious disorder and near riot because certain people, for their own strange reasons, decided that they should not seek such permits. Such legislation has not prevented any undesirable collections taking place, using the word &ldquo;undesirable&rdquo; in inverted commas.  I am using it in that way because certain people might regard them as undesirable; others might regard them as highly desirable. Such legislation has not prevented the type of collections taking place which it was sought to prevent at the time the legislation was going through this House and the Seanad.  In the same <Col N="1087" /> way, even if sections 30 and 31 of this Bill were to be passed into law, they would not prevent public meetings and public demonstrations of the kind which the Minister and the Government say they are seeking to prevent; they would go ahead.  People who will not at the moment perform the reasonable action of consultation with the Garda are not going to observe the law which seeks to impose this on them as a statutory duty and which seeks to impose penalties on them for failing to discharge that statutory duty.</P>
    <P>So that, here we have a purposeless Bill, an evil Bill and a provocative Bill which will create more trouble than could be avoided.  It is a Bill which would only bring the law into contempt; it is a Bill which would only bring the Garda into contempt; it is a Bill which serves no useful purpose but which, unfortunately, serves very many evil and undesirable purposes and therefore those who conceived it, that is to say, the members of the Government, must certainly be very, very strongly condemned, indeed.</P>
    <P>Some sections of the Bill do not merit the same condemnation.  In fact, some of them are highly desirable.  The section which seeks to impose very severe penalties for carrying offensive weapons is most desirable.  Our only regret is that it was delayed for so long. Section 22 is one which we in the Fine Gael Party welcome without any hesitation, but we are tempted to remark that it is unfortunate that it took the Minister so long to bring in section 22 as a proposal to this House.  For too long we were told that it was impossible to legislate against flick-knives, to legislate against dangerous weapons of that kind, because of the difficulty in distinguishing between a pocketknife and a domestic knife on the one hand and a dangerous weapon on the other.  It reminds me of the difficulty which we were told the draftsmen had for many, many years in trying to define &ldquo;nursing home&rdquo; and because they could not define &ldquo;nursing home&rdquo; we went for many decades without the legislation necessary to supervise nursing homes.  Similarly, we have had, unfortunately, all too many cases of serious injury being inflicted and serious <Col N="1088" /> crime committed because of the Government's tardiness in providing a section such as we have in section 22 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I just wonder whether it goes quite far enough.  Some instruments can be used which can inflict serious damage which one might not call knives.  I know that one such weapon is a steel comb with a long steel handle on it which with any amount of even unqualified skill can easily be converted into a dangerous stiletto and I would hope that any steps which can be taken to restrict any weapon of that kind would be taken.  I do appreciate, of course, that the section which refers to &ldquo;any other article whatsover made or adapted for use for causing injury to the person&rdquo; would probably cover something of that kind, but if there is any danger of anybody escaping the wrath of the law by saying that an article was more a comb than it was a knife, I hope the Minister will suitably amend the section.</P>
    <P>To our mind, the ordinary laws which apply to the carriage of firearms should also apply to knives and any penalties which at present attach to the unlawful carriage of firearms should apply also to the carriage of knives. We are aware of two recent cases of tragic deaths in Dublin which are <i>sub judice</i> and therefore we do not want to go into great detail in relation to them but it does appear that they were related to the carriage of knives.  These and other cases must cause us very deep concern and anything which can be done to hasten legislation to prevent the carriage of knives like that ought to be taken.</P>
    <P>It is our regret that this very essential and urgently needed reform of the law should be put into a Bill which necessarily will take a considerable amount of time going through the House.  As far as we are concerned, we have a solemn obligation to hold up any sections of this Bill which would seek to restrict the proper liberties and rights of our people and I would join with my Fine Gael colleagues in appealing to the Minister to withdraw this Bill and immediately to re-introduce a Bill which would contain the several sections of this Bill which are urgently required.  Such a Bill could be given <Col N="1089" /> very expeditious passage through the House and we could at greater length, perhaps, then discuss the objectionable sections.  I think that is the proper thing to do and if the Minister reflects carefully he ought to see the wisdom of that proposition.  There is a real possibility that, if the Minister does not do that, this Dáil will be dissolved before the Bill becomes law and it will lie with another Government to introduce the measure necessary to deal with the agreed sections of this Bill.  I think the Minister has done some good and he ought to get the credit for it. If he wants to get the credit for it, the simple thing to do now is to withdraw this Bill and to bring in an unobjectionable one dealing with the matters which require urgent attention and in relation to which everybody is agreed.</P>
    <P>There are people more qualified than I to discuss in detail other sections of this Bill.  Indeed, they have already done so.  I suppose it is more a Committee Bill.  Once one has asserted certain points of principle it becomes after that a Committee Bill and we can deal with it more properly at that level.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by saying that any law which attempts to restrict the liberties of people, of even the most disreputable member of the community, is a law which attacks everybody. Any legislation which purports to control the actions of sections of the community who are regarded as unacceptable is legislation which curtails the freedom of everybody in that community. Therefore, we must resist attacks upon even the most disreputable members of our community when the cost of such attacks is that the liberty of everybody is interfered with.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, justification for imposing penalties on wrongdoers.  This justification springs from the necessity to protect other members of the community, but a Bill such as this, which seeks in many sections not to impose penalties for offences but rather to curtail indiscriminately the liberties of people, is a Bill which goes to the very foundation of our democratic way of life and one which is, therefore, totally unacceptable.  It seeks to restrict our <Col N="1090" /> civil liberties.  It seeks to restrict our civil rights.  It does this without conferring any benefit on anybody, except whatever passing benefit the Government of the day might think would accrue to it by restricting the liberties and rights of certain people to assemble freely and express themselves freely and lawfully.  Because of that we, in Fine Gael, oppose this measure on this Second Stage.  We regard it as a measure which interferes with the essential rights and liberties of the people.  We would ask the Minister, therefore, not to conclude this Second Stage without giving an assurance that he will withdraw entirely the sections to which objection has been taken so that on Committee Stage and Report Stage a quick passage can be given to those sections which are acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel in duty bound to speak on this measure.  As a public representative I have an obligation to voice my alaram at some of the provisions in this Bill.  There are desirable provisions in it.  The provision making attempted suicide no longer a crime is most desirable.  It is one with which most people will agree.  Again, the abolition of the archaic distinction between felony and misdemeanour is very welcome.  Those sections the Minister has stated he will amend on Committee Stage are, however, most undesirable. Had there been public apathy in regard to this measure it is more than likely that these sections would have been bulldozed through by the Minister and his Party and, had that happened, we should have had most undesirable legislation on the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>Sections 30 and 31 have created widespread national alarm.  As public representatives, we have been inundated with protests from public bodies, trade unions, tenant associations, farmer organisations, soroptimist clubs, and so on, and we have a public duty in this House to force the Minister to make the proper amendments or to delete the undesirable sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These sections are unconstitutional. In conscience I must oppose any sections in any legislation designed to whittle away the rights of the people. Our democratic rights and our freedom <Col N="1091" /> are precious things.  We have little enough of them, God knows.  It is obvious that this unamended section 30 is an attempt by Fianna Fáil to assume dictatorial powers, powers which would make life impossible for our people.  That attempt has been made on a few occasions in the past. It was made recently in the referendum.</P>
    <P>These sections should never have been introduced.  Indeed, the Minister should have deleted them even before this Second Stage.  They are undesirable, undemocratic and unconstitutional. It is just not good enough for the Minister to say he will introduce amendments on the Committee Stage because these amendments have been forced on him by the pressure of public opinion.  I wonder what the next measure may be when the Government are defeated on this.  The Government will stand seriously indicted if these undesirable sections are not completely transformed.</P>
    <P>Section 31, which gives powers to the Garda completely extraneous to their normal functions and duties, would result in the Garda interfering in all public assemblies, meetings, discussions and so on.  That would, in turn, give the Government more control.  These sections violate all our democratic rights; if not amended, they will result in our being deprived of the right to free discussion, debate, or meeting on any topics whatsoever.  Imagine factory employees deciding to discuss some problem in a factory being told they are committing an offence.  How often do discussions arise spontaneously on many matters affecting workers?  These could be declared illegal.</P>
    <P>The public generally have done a wonderful job in expressing their concern over these sections.  We re-echo their concern and it is our duty now to ensure that these undemocratic sections are deleted from this measure.  As I say, there are desirable provisions in the Bill, but I am utterly opposed to the fingerprinting of suspects who have not been charged.  The Minister must amend this provision, too.  There are undesirable provisions in sections 20 and 21.  I agree there are sections designed to protect the public but the <Col N="1092" /> sections which aim at whittling away our freedom and democratic rights more than justify a complete revision of the Bill and its presentation to the Dáil in proper form.  We have seen what has been happening in Northern Ireland.  In the past we have condemned the fact that people are deprived of their democratic rights up there.  Some of our Ministers have been hypocritical enough to attack the system up there knowing, in their hearts and souls, that some sections in this Bill went even further than the powers given to the police in the Act in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is a Draconian Bill.  Unless it is properly amended I feel sure it will lead to extremists taking advantage of it to create anarchy.  It will not serve any purpose except to involve the police in matters in which they would much prefer not to be concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support speakers who have called for the withdrawal of this Bill.  Some of those who have spoken in favour of it maintained, funnily enough, that the Bill we are discussing is no longer in existence.  I wonder if we are now on the Second Stage of a Bill which really is not in existence.  I suppose that is partially true because the Minister said he will be amending certain sections of it.  In his opening speech he gave some indication of his line of thinking on these amendments.  So, we are to be deprived of a Second Stage debate on the actual Bill itself as it will be amended.  This is a bad system by which to introduce important legislation such as this.  Even though we will have an opportunity to debate it on Committee Stage, we will not have the wide-ranging discussion we would have on the Second Stage of the Bill as the Minister now feels he would like to introduce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity that this Bill was not withdrawn and separate Bills brought in to cover the various matters contained in this Criminal Justice Bill.  I do not think that a Bill of this kind, which tries to deal with people who wield murderous weapons, such as knives and other weapons which can be wielded with fatal results, should also cover the conscientious citizen <Col N="1093" /> who wishes to protest against some injustice he sees in society. This Bill brings those two extremes together more or less.  We are now debating a measure which proposes to deal with those two types of people who are, as you will agree, Sir, as different as chalk and cheese.</P>
    <P>Parts of the Bill are good, and it is a pity that the parts covering dangerous weapons were not introduced months ago.  During the past three, four or five years, various local authorities, county councils and private clubs and societies, have passed resolutions calling on the Government to introduce legislation to curtail the use of offensive weapons.  During those years I have listened at Question Time to various excuses being put forward by successive Ministers for Justice as to why that kind of legislation could not be introduced, and as to why it could not be worked by the Garda and others who have to enforce the law.  Even though it is late I welcome these provisions. I still wonder why they could not have been introduced many years ago when the demand and the necessity were there.  We know that, if they had been in force, quite a number of people who suffered injuries, some of them fatal, from these weapons could have been saved that suffering.</P>
    <P>The opposition to this Bill right from the start has been very vocal and demonstrative.  No matter what the Minister may say the criticism has been constructive, and it has proved right.  I said there was public demand for the sections of the Bill dealing with offensive weapons.  I should say, also, that there was no demand for the sections dealing with curtailment of the right of individuals to come together to protest, and their right to have meetings. There was absolutely no such demand by an elected representative, by any clubs or associations or by any individuals. Last, but by no means least, I suppose, there was certainly no demand, as we have seen recently, from the grass-roots of the Fianna Fáil organisation for this type of restrictive legislation.  So, I wonder what motivated it and who inspired it.</P>
    <P>One organisation, the National Association of Tenants, has been <Col N="1094" /> singled out particularly in this legislation. The name has not been mentioned but one has only to read between the lines to find that section 53 is specifically aimed at that organisation.  In existing legislation there is adequate provision for dealing with people who default in paying rents, or rates, or anything like that.  The Minister and the Government want to go a good deal further and catch the leaders of this organisation or, indeed, of any other organisation, who would try to organise tenants and get them to fight in support of their rights.</P>
    <P>There are not many ways in which local authority tenants can show their disapproval of certain measures taken against them by the central Government or local government. One of the most peaceful ways in which they can show their disapproval is by withholding rents.  It now appears that, if this section goes through, not only will individuals who withhold rents be subject to prosecution, as was always the case, but people who organise or condone or encourage them in this type of practice will be prosecuted and will be open to the full penalties the law lays down. I know it is open to the Minister, under existing legislation, to declare an organisation which carries on activities like this illegal, but this is a far worse provision.  It is not enough just to say it is as bad a provision as that; it is an even worse one.  It is aimed at this national organisation, which is presently looking after the interests of the local authority tenants of this country.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that the inspiration for this section came from the Minister for Local Government.  I will not be surprised to hear that that is so. While we have problems and difficulties in our society, while people will always require some way of expressing disapproval of the Government, of local authorities or of anybody else responsible for creating those problems or allowing them to continue, we must remember it is only justifiable causes which get public support.  One might imagine that all causes, whether they are justifiable or not, would get the support of the public, but this is not so.</P>
    <P>Some individual or some organisation <Col N="1095" /> wants to protest about something and the general public feel they are not justified in doing it.  That individual or organisation may protest and hold a meeting but they will not have support for long.  If they cause inconvenience to anybody their supporters will be relatively few.  I do not see any problem in regard to that type of protest and march which does not spring from good and valid reasons.  It is the protest meetings and marches which spring from good and valid reasons, when some obvious injustice is being done, which gets the support of our people. The best way to solve that type of problem and march is not by legislation of this kind; it is by eliminating the causes which give rise to that type of demonstration because the causes must obviously be clear to everyone.</P>
    <P>We had, going back a number of years, the marches and sit-downs of the farming community of this country. What caused those marches, protests and withholding of rates?  One little incident caused the whole lot. That was the refusal of the Minister for Agriculture to meet farmers' representatives on the day they marched to Dublin. Just one little incident could have saved the country, the farming community and the Government all the trouble which ensued.  If more care were taken by Government Ministers and the people in authority, that type of protest could be avoided altogether. Our whole aim here in the Parliament of this country should be to eliminate the causes which give rise to those big protests, those big marches, those big meetings, which do at times cause inconvenience to other users of the highway and can at time be exploited by a small minority of irresponsible people for their own reasons.  As I say, it is only the very good and justifiable causes which will get public support and the big crowd.  Those which are not justifiable, those which are for illegal purposes, will not have the support of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>We should have confidence in our people to judge themselves what is a good cause and what is not.  We should devote our time to eliminating the <Col N="1096" /> many glaring examples of injustice, lack of services and inadequate services, in respect of which people could protest and could march on this House every day of the week rather than trying to legislate to protect ourselves from our own deficiencies.  We should try to settle the ills of the society in which we live.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Bill there is some good and a little bit of bad.  Very often in a Bill like this we are inclined to read about the good and to forget about the bad.  That could very easily happen in this Bill too, even though the Minister in his opening speech stated he is prepared to withdraw some of the sections, those sections which have been severely criticised from this side of the House.</P>
      <P>There is certainly good in section 22, the section which deals with offensive weapons.  We all know for a long time past that something had to be done about the use of flick knives.  As mentioned by Deputy Ryan earlier, there are other types of weapons as well as flick knives. Quite recently I heard of a man who carried a bicycle chain. He put out his hand to stop a car to get a lift somewhere near Mullingar.  He had the bicycle chain in his hand.  The car did not stop.  He threw the bicycle chain and it hit the window of the car. The car continued to move on with the result that he lost one of his fingers. None of us would have much sympathy for him.  We would all feel it was good enough for him.  A bicycle chain seems to be carried by a person who intends to take another person's life. Any people who carry weapons such as those should be severely dealt with. If the Minister thinks at any time that he should amend this section to cover this type of offensive weapon he certainly will have the support of this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the sections which we all fear, that is sections 30 and 31, it has been the usual procedure in this country for many years for any group having a public meeting to notify, without compulsion, the gardaí.  That courtesy has always been extended to the gardaí by such people.  Whenever a public meeting was held the co-operation <Col N="1097" /> of the Garda ensured that everything went smoothly.  The Minister is anxious to compel people holding a meeting to get permission from the local superintendent of the Garda.  I cannot see the need for this.  Is there some group of people in this country, whom the Minister is afraid of, and whom the rest of us do not know about, who will be holding a public meeting?</P>
    <P>I think, if that is the situation, the Minister should say this and let us know what groups he has in mind.  I am sure the greatest offenders of all about holding meetings are the political Parties that make up this House but I am sure the Minister has not these Parties in mind.  It will be found from any side of the House that the Garda give full co-operation and, in return, the political Parties give the same amount of co-operation to the Garda. If the Minister decided to continue on that line, he would leave the Garda position utterly impossible.  Somebody made reference to the recent disturbances in Northern Ireland.  We can all remember one day when the Garda were blamed for moving in: the next day they were blamed for not moving in.  Whether they move in or do not move in, they will be blamed.  They are a section of the community who often have to carry blame&mdash;and it is not fair. If the Minister continues with these two sections then that is the situation that will be created: he will leave the position of the Garda utterly impossible.</P>
    <P>In section 53, the Minister indends to charge the promoters of organisations who encourage the withholding of rates or rents or any such thing.  To me, that section is pointed directly towards the National Farmers' Association.  It is completely uncalled for and will not serve any purpose.  Even if it were not directed towards that particular organisation, very often we find people protesting about something and, as the protest goes on and on, the leaders very often lose control of it.  A limited number of people, in the name of a particular organisation, may decide to withhold their rates or their rents against the better judgement of their leaders.  Under this section, the Minister <Col N="1098" /> is giving power to his Department to charge these people and they will pay the full penalty.  I do not think that that would be fair.  The Minister should have another look at the section.</P>
    <P>I admit that we have a number of people who are protesting by way of marches and that we have a big number of these protests here in Dublin city.  I do not think it ever got out of hand in recent years with the exception of the one occasion when the members decided to sit on O'Connell Bridge.  Speaking from this side of the House, I certainly did not agree with that.  However, people with a genuine grievance are entitled to carry out a reasonable demonstration such as marching through Dublin city or any other town in the country or anything that is within reason and that is done in a mannerly fashion, within the law.</P>
    <P>I agree with those Deputies who say that the Government should try to cure the cause of these demonstrations.  They should examine why people are protesting and parading and try to solve their problems rather than introduce a Bill such as this which seeks to prevent them from making these protests.</P>

      <P>This Bill has some good points as well as some very bad points.  The good points could have been introduced many years ago. There have been repeated requests for action in relation to flick knives and other such weapons or potential weapons.  However, to flavour this Bill, the Minister introduced these matters now in the hope that they will help its passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>This is a panic measure to deal with the situation which this Government themselves have created.  We have protests and we have unsettled conditions brought about by a Government not fit to govern.  All they can do is to stop the people from protesting.  We know what happened in the past when the Government tried to muzzle the people. We went out and we got free speech, in spite of the Government.  Even though we had to put shirts of a certain colour on us, we did it.</P>

      <P>I am showing where the Government have failed in the past, in respect of measures such as this, to try to curb the rights of the people. They will only bring about a worse situation than was originally the position. We have seen certain elements riding on the backs of good causes. These elements could be dealt with quietly, before they start firing the bricks from the back of the crowd of those with a just cause.  A lot of incidents would never have seen the light of day if this matter had been handled properly.  Possibly, what we require in this city, which has the greatest number of protests, is something on the style of Hyde Park Corner on a Sunday morning where people meet and let off steam on various topics.  There are some head cases to be heard at Hyde Park Corner, London, on a Sunday morning such as some of the head cases we have parading in this city.</P>
      <P>It is suggested that certain elements from certain institutions which we need not mention are responsible for the trouble.  I should like to know if some of these gentlemen are Irish nationals and how they got in here.  Does it require a Bill such as this, as well as the time of this Parliament, to deal with such gentlemen?  This measure is a steamroller to crack a nut.  There is no need for a lot of it.  It will only create more trouble.  Consider students who should have been out of college many years ago.  Are we to subsidise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This could be eliminated without bringing in this nutcracker of a Bill.  Maybe, if there was less public money wasted on this type of thing, we might have less trouble.</P>
      <P>I thoroughly agree with the section dealing with flick knives, but it is rather confusing because if you measure a flick knife by the length of the blade what have you?  There are young women today who are carrying knives in their pockets for protection.  One cannot blame them with the elements that are abroad.  Are we going to punish these women who are prepared to defend themselves?  I never read of a case of a young woman stabbing anybody. Certainly, it is not something one hears of every day.  I feel it is very hard to impose this on them.</P>
      <P>With regard to meetings, processions and demonstrations, I said that if we had a Hyde Park of our own established here it might ease the situation. I foresee that if the Minister is going to try to put this Bill through he will have to start another force of gardaí like the one that was known as the Broy Harriers, because there are many young, decent gardaí and superintendents who do not want to be put in the position of deciding to whom they will refuse and to whom they will grant a licence to hold a meeting.  It is trying to push over on the gardaí what is the Minister's own mind and the Minister, like a lot of the members of the Front Bench, is a bit upset these times.</P>
      <P>The threat to introduce military custody is going to create unrest in respect of something that has never existed.</P>
      <P>I would go a bit along the road in regard to the withdrawal of grants if I thought it would affect certain people who are wasting their time instead of studying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need in this Bill to eliminate a lot of the little points that are no way helpful and the Taoiseach should tell the Minister that if he is thinking of bulldozing such a Bill as this through the House it is not wanted by any section of the community.  Even his own Ard-Fheis, no matter how they tried to talk people down and turned <Col N="1101" /> up the loudspeakers to talk people down, went away with a different outlook from what the Minister thinks.  I warn the Minister that the day he tries to enforce this measure he will cause trouble and he will have to employ a force of Broy Harriers to enforce it.  I would appeal to the Minister to have a bit of commonsense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is published by the Minister for Justice and presumably in its original publication form, in accordance with normal practice, had the approval of the Government.  It is another example of the slipshod manner in which the members of the Government deal with their ordinary day to day duties.  The Minister for Justice has been pretty vitriolic in his condemnation of the people who raised objections to certain provisions of this Bill. Indeed, his speech on Second Reading has shown that he was pushed by those condemnations and correctly pushed to abandon some of the unsatisfactory features.  If there has been a great deal of criticism of the Bill, of the Minister and of the Government, they have nobody but themselves to blame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, of course, in the Bill some excellent provisions in relation to the consolidation of the law.  One has only to look at the Schedule to the Bill to see the number of repeals going back to pre-Union statutes and statutes that were also brought into force here by virtue of Poynings Act.  Incidentally, I am never quite clear why nobody ever talks of Poynings Act.  The Minister will remember from his student days that it was always referred to as Poynings Law and never as Poynings Act but I see it has been given its more correct title.  I suppose, in the Schedule to the Bill.  It is, of course, highly desirable that the criminal law should be brought up to date by the repeal of all these old statutes that really have no relevance at all or should have no relevance at all in modern times.  I feel that the work that went into that is work that should be praised just as I feel that the work that went into other aspects of the Bill to which I shall refer in a moment and to which others have referred is something that should be most critically condemned.  We see a <Col N="1102" /> pattern emanating from the Department of Justice.  One can only believe that it is a Fianna Fáil pattern because it was first indicated when Deputy Haughey was Minister for Justice and now it is coming out in this Bill under the present Minister for Justice.  It is that these Ministers believe that nothing that we have here at all at present is worthy of preservation.</P>
    <P>The Succession Bill, introduced by the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Haughey, was a Bill for which there was no public demand whatsoever. There was no need for that measure. It was an unwarranted measure and in its original form was something that shocked the conscience of the community as a whole.  As a result of the pressure put on the Minister for Justice that Bill had to be radically altered and it was radically altered.  It was, of course, in its radical form merely a photostat of enactments in other countries&mdash;enactments which may very well have been of great value to those countries but had nothing whatever in common with the Irish scene.  So, too, this Bill is cast in the same mould in respect of its unreasonable and unrealistic provisions.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister has, in his Second Reading speech, given an indication of the changes that he proposes. It is a good thing that he has been forced to make those changes but, as I said at the beginning, we must remember that the Bill saw the light of day for two reasons and for two reasons only (1)  that the Minister for Justice approved all the provisions that were in the Bill and (2)  that the Fianna Fáil Government accepted that the Minister for Justice was right in publicising those provisions, in asking Oireachtas Éireann to enact those provisions.</P>
    <P>If, therefore, the Minister feels that there has been criticism, unfair criticism even, of any of the provisions of the Bill, he has only himself to blame for introducing a Bill that contained so many unreasonable provisions that even on Second Reading, before he heard any discussion, he was forced to mend his hand.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan a few moments ago referred to a provision in the Bill about the use of knives.  I take leave to differ <Col N="1103" /> from my colleague in that respect.  It is desirable that proper control should be exercised over the modern weapon of violence&mdash;the flick-knife&mdash;which is largely the equivalent of the unlicensed gun in America in respect of which there is such very strong feeling against any licensing at all.  I shocked many people while I was in America last summer by saying that I could not understand any reason for their opposition to licensing.  However, this is a matter about which individuals can differ.  Deputy Coogan and I are perfectly at liberty to differ in relation to knives just as we might possibly differ in relation to the regulations that he is advocating for the cinema in Galway of which I read in this morning's paper. Whatever about legislation being necessary in regard to knives.  I do not think it would be necessary in that case.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling abroad at present &mdash;it is as well that it should be recognised&mdash;that it is a manly thing to kick against authority.  Perhaps there has always been that feeling in youth but it has, I fear, throughout the whole world gone out of bounds now.  I wish to say quite calmly and collectively that I am quite satisfied that the Garda, as a whole, administer justice in our country in a manner that is impartial and evenhanded and that they do not use any more force than they have to.</P>
    <P>Occasionally, of course, one gets the odd garda who loses his temper&mdash;they are only human like anybody else&mdash; but it is only occasional and there must not be a general condemnation of the Force on that account.  The gardaí have frequently acted with very great patience and restraint in relation to some of the demonstrations. We should not be progressive towards a society in which people who are educated expect greater tolerance from the officer enforcing the law than they themselves expect those officers to give to, say, itinerants.  The approach in this Bill, as prepared by the Minister, is like taking a sledgehammer to crack a hazel nut.  We will not get any respect for that sort of approach and we will not get any respect for trying to tamp down by the sledge hammer <Col N="1104" /> approach the sort of agitation which is now going on all over the world. We should give it the opportunity to blow itself off in a peaceful and democratic way.</P>
    <P>The type of peaceful ordered protest march which this Bill first tried to prevent is something that is symbolic of our time and to prevent it being held in a peaceful and orderly fashion will only mean that it will be the authorities who will create the trouble rather than the people against whom such enforcement proceedings were aimed.  I do not believe that the Garda Síochána considered the provisions introduced in the Bill originally by the Minister were in any way necessary for the purpose of enforcing law and order and ensuring that ordinary people could peacefully go about their avocations.</P>
    <P>I do not believe they were necessary and the Minister has been wise in agreeing to delete these provisions from the Bill.  The suggestion that every type of meeting had to be notified and that a person who was going to a meeting would, in fact, be guilty of an offence, as the notification would imply, was something that none of us would tolerate and it is a good thing that it is dropped but the attitude of mind is still there.</P>
    <P>I think that it is the attitude of mind not of the masses of the forces responsible for law and order but the attitude of mind of one or two people who are anxious to avoid in so far as they can, any trouble for themselves and who believe that this method is one that would mean less trouble for them in the handling of difficulties as they arose.</P>
    <P>We have seen the effect in the north of stupidity in handling emergent demonstrations.  I sincerely hope that because of lack of understanding, lack of appreciation and lack of a sense of humour, those who are responsible for law and order down here will not allow matters to take that course which might have been the great danger if the Bill had not been amended in the manner in which we have been told it is about to be amended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  The House and the Minister, of course, are aware that our procedure in relation to companies is now governed by the Companies Act, 1963.  Prior to the amalgamation of people into a company for the purpose of fostering trade and commerce there was something that had been running for about one hundred years or so.  I think, speaking subject to correction, that the first Companies (Consolidation) Bill was in 1862 or thereabouts, but as a result of the legislation then and as a result of the 1908 Act, <i>entrepreneurs,</i> people in all walks of life, came together for the purpose of welding themselves into a legalistic person called a company for the purpose of ensuring activity in various parts of national life.  They did so, first of all, in one way, and then, as the years went on, it became clear that there must be very exact regulations or the powers of limited liability that were given would be abused.</P>
      <P>In consequence of that there was in the 1908 Act and again adopted in our Act of 1963; which was a consolidation measure primarily and an improvement measure, in addition, provisions that everybody who was concerned with any company would have an opportunity of knowing the type of company that was involved, in relation to its capital, its creditworthiness and the personnel who were engaged in controlling it and in running it.  Accordingly, it was provided that there would be a regulation that the names of the directors, up to 1963, and after 1963, the names of the directors and secretary, of every single company would have to be registered in the Company's Office in the Castle; and in addition to that, under sections 195 and 196 of the Companies Act, 1963, that on every letter that went out, unless exemption was given, the names of the directors of the company would have to be published so that it would be clear and easily available to everybody who was concerned with any individual company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As time went on, and only in quite recent years, because of the greater facilities of travel, people became directors of companies even though they might not be very near the actual source of operations of the company&mdash; indeed, the company itself might have <Col N="1107" /> several places of business&mdash;and when these directors were unable to attend a particular directors' meeting it became appropriate to appoint an alternate or substitute director, as they are usually known, to attend that meeting. This became the practice for occasional meetings and a good thing it was because it enabled companies to keep the balance of interested voting at meetings of the directors.</P>
    <P>In the last two or three years an entirely different practice has sprung up of using the provisions of the Companies Act for the purpose of ensuring secrecy, not so much to prevent compliance with the law, as to prevent compliance with one of the things that the Companies Act should ensure, that is, open-handed dealing on all sides. In the last few years the practice has grown up by which nominal directors are appointed to companies, they are not the real directors at all, but are merely nominated and immediately after they have been nominated an alternate director is appointed by each of them.  It is those alternate directors who really run the company.  They are paid as such by the company, extract the profits of the company and direct its policy.  The hidden hand is being used in this way, in a manner in which it was never visualised that the Companies Act should operate and in a manner which is universally condemned by people in commercial life.</P>
    <P>This Bill is introduced for one reason and one reason alone, to ensure that where a person is acting as an alternate director he will have fixed on him the exact same light of day as the regular director has, no more, no less. I fail completely to see what reason there can be in the mind of the Government for objecting to such a procedure.  If a person is going to act as an alternate director of a company he should be prepared to register his name in exactly the same way as a director has to register his name.  He should be prepared to have his association with that company publicised in the same way as a director must have it publicised.</P>
    <P>The only reason there can be opposition to this Bill is because some people are acting as alternate directors who have no right in the public mind <Col N="1108" /> to act as such directors and who are determined, therefore, to bring pressure on the Government to make certain that their activities will not see the light of day.  There is not any other reason for opposition to this Bill.  I am amazed that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is a person who holds himself out to be a defender of propriety in public life and who, I am sure, would not be himself personally party to the type of abuse that is going on, nevertheless allows himself to be sent in here by his Government to oppose it.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the Minister make some inquiries.  It is being talked of publicly all around the town.  There is not any reason whatever why an alternate director should be ashamed of having his name registered in public.  This Bill will provide it and that is the purpose of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sweetman having dealt with the legal aspects, there remains the purpose of the Bill. I want to make clear what the effect of the Bill will be in the proper legal manner through the operation of the Companies Act, 1963, as amended.  If this Bill went through one would find a situation whereby every Minister of State forever after in this country until a further amendment would have occured would have to declare his interest in any company in which he had any interest.  That is a principle that should have always held.  It is a principle that is held in every democracy.  There have been cases in other states where persons who did not declare their interests in certain industrial <Col N="1109" /> enterprises and were Ministers of State were asked to resign or resigned when that interest which they did not declare was found to exist.  I hold, therefore, that this amendment will forever, until amended again, create the situation whereby Ministers of State shall have to declare their interest. What has been said by Deputy Sweetman in relation to the rumours around this town is true.  There is no point in bringing dirty linen in here to be washed.  It is right and proper the country should know there is this situation and that Ministers of State should be made to declare their interest. The amendment so well put together by Deputy Sweetman has much support.  This declaration of interest provision should be tightened up so that it must apply in the case of every Minister.</P>

      <P>If the legal position were as described by Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Donegan, I would be the first to agree with the passage of this Bill as quickly as possible, because the principle which they have enunciated of full disclosure as to who are directors or alternate directors is one with which no reasonable man could quarrel.  I would not quarrel with it. On the contrary, I would strongly support it but I must oppose it for the reasons I am about to give and I have my suspicions that the Bill was not brought in for <i>bona fide</i> reasons.  I thought when this Bill was put down that it was a genuine attempt to try to improve Company Law in this country.  In the light of the case put forward it now appears it was merely a tactic to further the smear campaign <Col N="1110" /> in which Fine Gael have been indulging rather than a serious attempt to improve Company Law.  If it had been the latter I suspect the Deputies would have done their homework.  Having done it they would have discovered what they are now suggesting is, in fact already in the 1963 Act.  This is the only reason I oppose the Bill.  It is not going to advance by one iota the cause which they have espoused, and to which I just as strongly subscribe. Section 2 (1) of the Companies Act, 1963, which, as Deputy Sweetman says governs our Company Law, provides that the word &ldquo;director&rdquo; includes any person occupying the position of director by whatever name called, and for the purposes of sections 195 and 196, which it is specifically proposed to amend in this Bill provides that a director includes a person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of a company are accustomed to act.  There is no definition in the Act of alternate or substitute directors, although there is an indication in Table A of certain circumstances and conditions which would normally apply to the appointment of such directors. It seems clear, and I am so advised, on the basis of section 2 (1) and section 195 and section 196 that an alternate or substitute director of a company, who is for instance entitled to attend and vote at board meetings, is a director for hte purposes of the Companies Act.  His name should be included in the register of directors provided for under section 195 and the required particulars should be drawn on the company's notepaper under section 196.</P>

      <Col N="1112" /> What is wrong here, and the Deputy knows it as well as I do, is the difficulty of enforcement.  The Law is there but the difficulty of enforcement is such that it may not be observed in many cases.  The Bill that is proposed here does not improve on that.  It has no provision for enforcement.  It merely provides what the law already provides, and what advantage is that?  If Fine Gael have some constructive suggestions as to enforcement, I shall be very glad to hear them.  I agree with the principle enshrined in this Bill but it is already in the law.  As I said earlier, and as I repeat, the difficulty is one of enforcement.  I have given some thought to the question of better enforcement but I have not come up with any worthwhile solution yet.  If Fine Gael have some constructive suggestion I should be glad to hear it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the present health services do not meet the needs of the people, and that the method of financing them is unfair in the unjust burden which it imposes on ratepayers without regard to their ability to pay, and that as a matter of urgency existing services should be replaced by a comprehensive health service based upon insurance principles and which will provide without charge, and as of right, for all people within the scheme, full medical services with choice of doctor and free hospital, specialist and diagnostic services.</P>
      <P>It is the second time in about seven years that we in the Fine Gael benches have proposed such a motion.  Over the past ten years we have been pressing for the adoption of such a policy, such a health service.  It has been an uphill fight with the roller of the Fianna Fáil Party trying to roll back the progressive Fine Gael health policy.  It is very little comfort to the people who have been suffering in the meantime to receive from time to time an odd glimmer of an indication from the Government that at long last they are prepared to admit that there might be something to be said for the Fine Gael Party stand on the basic principle that a health service is best financed in the main by insurance contributions. The present health service, the present system, has come to us from the poor law guardians.  It is a service that is wrongly based upon high-cost institutions which give medical attention in the last resort instead of being correctly based on low-cost home care of the first requirement.</P>
      <P>If we had here what every European country with the exception of Finland, has, a medical service and a health scheme which would allow people to call a doctor of their own choice and get drugs and medicines at nil cost or substantially reduced cost we would require the system which operates in those other European countries with the exceptions of Finland and Ireland. Until we have, we shall have a continuation of a system which ensures that an essential human need like medical service finds itself perpetually in competition with every other service provided by the State, with every other service from the revival of Irish to the maintenance of an army, from farming subsidies to the maintenance or creation of prestige.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" /> This is basically wrong.  Even this week the Minister for Health found himself obliged, having received estimates from health authorities of their necessary costs in the next year, to reply to them saying that the financial situation is such that he feared we would not be able to provide the financial support necessary to maintain the services which they had put before him and asking them, therefore, to endeavour to prune the services and cut back on or avoid expenditure. Here we have the Minister whose prime care&mdash;and I know his natural disposition&mdash;is to provide a good health service and all the medical attention people need, saying to health authorities: &ldquo;You are trying to do too much.  It is in competition with other services that the Government have been asked to pay for.  It will not do.&rdquo; The people who need doctors, in order words, must go without them and the institutions which are considered necessary to provide medical services will not be built this year because other things are competing with them. As long as we continue a system which means that health costs have to compete with everything else provided by the State or local authorities we shall have a mean, insufficient and inadequate health service.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael are satisfied that it is within the capacity of any modern progressive State to apply certain techniques to ensure that health services are not in competition with other national and local services.  We are also satisfied that the present system does not meet the needs of the people. It provides care out of institutions and hospitals for an average of 30 per cent of the population; the other 70 per cent must provide everything for themselves.  In an urban area like Dublin only 16 per cent of the population get any medical attention or care or subsidised drugs outside hospitals and institutions.  The remaining 84 per cent must care for themselves.  We are satisfied that this causes serious hardship in many cases, that it means that many heads of families postpone getting necessary medical attention in the hope that what they regard as a minor illness may not turn out to be serious one.  In many cases having got medical <Col N="1118" /> advice and having obtained prescriptions from doctors, many people do not get these prescriptions filled when they find the cost is beyond what they consider the family can bear.</P>
    <P>On that account we have a situation in which 70 per cent of the people, without any help or assistance towards medical costs outside hospitals or institutions, neglect to get the necessary medical care for themselves until a stage is reached where the doctor must be consulted because of the gravity of the illness.  The doctor then, in many cases, must consign the patient to an institution or hospital, that being the only place then capable of looking after him.  This is basically wrong.  That is why we in Fine Gael regard the present service as so inadequate in answering the needs of the people.</P>
    <P>Today we should be debating the Government's much-promised but still undisclosed Health Bill to improve&mdash; to use their own words&mdash;our existing services.  We were informed prior to the 50th Anniversary Meeting of Dáil Éireann that the Government proposed to introduce at that meeting the longpromised Health Bill.  It was first promised in the autumn of 1965.  We were promised on three separate occasions in the spring of 1966 that it would be before the Dáil and Seanad in the autumn of 1966 and would be law and in operation before the autumn of 1967.</P>
    <P>These promises were broken like every other promise made in relation to the same Health Bill.  On the great day of the Golden Jubilee of this democratic Assembly such a Bill was introduced.  We of the Fine Gael Party informed the Taoiseach prior to that meeting, when we were informed of the intention to introduce the Bill, that we could not support a Health Bill which was based upon the Government's present White Paper because we regarded it as unacceptable because of the proposal to retain the poor law system as the basis of any future development and because of the Government's unjustified assumption that medical care outside of institutions did not cause hardship to most people.</P>
    <P>We regarded the 50th Anniversary of Dáil Éireann as a singularly unsuitable <Col N="1119" /> occasion to introduce a Bill which sought to enact once again as the basis of health services a system which has come down to us from the days of the poor law guardians, singularly unsuitable I say because the first democratic programme of the First Dáil said that the poor law system was an iniquitous system and that the first task of any Irish nation having achieved its independence would be to abolish the iniquitous poor law guardian system.</P>
    <P>In the event, the Government indicated that they had not made up their minds exactly what the basis should be for the financing of the future health services.  Therefore, in the hope that even at the 11th hour and the 59th minute the Government might do the right thing, we did not divide on that great occasion of the golden jubilee of this House, but if when the Bill is circulated we find that it is proposed to retain the objectionable features of the present poor law system with its means tests and its class distinctions, its exactions from people when they are sick and in need, its limiting of health services to one-third of the population and making ratepayers of small means pay for services which are denied to them, we in Fine Gael will oppose the Bill ruthlessly because we regard any future development of our health services so conceived as basically wrong, inhuman and stupid from the economic point of view.</P>
    <P>The present health service is geared so that only three out of every ten people get any help from it unless persons are so seriously ill that they are in hospital.  Only five per cent of the total national bill for health services goes on providing medical attention outside of hospital; 95 per cent of our public health bill is payment for the maintenance and care of people in institutions and hospitals and only five per cent of the total health bill goes in paying for services outside of hospitals for 30 per cent of the population. This ought to make it clear that a mere ten per cent increase in the public health bill would provide for 90 per cent of our citizens full medical care outside of hospitals and we in Fine Gael are satisfied that if 90 per cent of the people were fully cared for outside <Col N="1120" /> of hospitals and institutions huge savings would result in hospital costs which would, if not more than compensate, certainly substantially compensate for the increased cost which a full medical service would impose.</P>
    <P>These are simple sums in arithmetic. The tragedy is that the answers have not yet been worked out or have not been accepted yet by successive Ministers for Health and for Finance in the Fianna Fáil Government.  As the Minister knows full well, the cost of maintaining people in hospital these days will vary from £20 to £30 per head per week and the tragedy is that in many cases if £3 per head per week were spent on those people in good time in their own homes they would never have ended up in hospital at all. It is only by a proper development of our home care of people and only by adequate subsidy of the high cost of modern drugs and medicines outside of the hospitals that we will get the kind of medical service which is so urgently required.</P>
    <P>One of the great and inevitable tragedies of our present health services is that overworked doctors, particularly dispensary doctors, are obliged by the nature of the system to shove people into institutions and hospitals because their own case-load, the number of patients they are expected to look after, is so great that they could not possibly give people outside of hospital the kind of care and attention and frequent calls which their illnesses would require.</P>
    <P>At present, in urban areas where there is no need to maintain separate State-appointed dispensary doctors because there are sufficient doctors available, there are many dispensary doctors with as many as 8,000 patients apiece.  The figure is 8,000 when you associate with the number of medical card-holders the number of dependent children in their families.  The result is that in many growing suburbs where there is a large population of children the dispensary doctors are required by law to give medical attention for 1½ hours per day in the dispensary to anything from 100 to 140 persons.  It cannot be done.  It is a physical impossibility. It is no exaggeration then to <Col N="1121" /> say that our medical services at the moment do not answer the needs of the people.</P>
    <P>In relation to so vital and personal a matter as health, people ought to have a choice of doctor.  That is a right which is available to any person of means who can afford to pay for the services of a doctor.  It is entirely wrong to withhold that right from people who have not got the means to pay for a doctor and it is wrong to say to them that if they avail of the health service provided by the State and the health authority they must go to a particular doctor and no other.  It took many years of fighting from the Fine Gael benches to get a reluctant Fianna Fáil Government to accept the principle of choice of doctor but it was accepted four years ago in the Government's White Paper and since then they have done nothing to implement what they then accepted as necessary, vital and the right thing to do.  We consider that their delay is unforgiveable.</P>
    <P>As we speak of the need to abolish the dispensary system in areas of high density of population, so we reiterate our conviction that the dispensary service or some system of that kind must continue to operate in areas of low density of population because we do not want a situation to arise in relation to the medical services of this country such as has arisen in relation to dental profession in particular and some other professions where professional men are not available in the more remote areas of the country because there is not an adequate living in such areas for them.  Of course, the State must continue to pay the salaries and allowances and maintain premises for the medical profession in areas of low density of population.  But there is no justification for trying to adopt a uniform system or trying to evolve a service suitable for a remote area and making it the only service available in an area of high density of population and high density of doctors as well.</P>
    <P>We do not think the present health service answers the needs of the people because the needs of the people are to obtain medical attention when necessary, without losing self-respect in the process.  A system which debases the <Col N="1122" /> dignity of doctors and patients to a degree which requires people to prove, as a matter of law, that they are unable out of their own incomes, or other lawful means, to pay for the necessities of life&mdash;food, clothing and shelter&mdash;is a system which does not answer the needs of the people.  It is a system which is harmful to the health of the people because people are naturally reluctant to use such a system.</P>
    <P>Our nation is at the moment painfully conscious of the inconvenience and loss to national wealth caused by the current industrial disputes and the abstentions from work which those disputes entail.  Year in and year out we lose in Ireland 14,000,000 working days through abstentions from work caused by illness.  That is a rate five times greater than the average number of days lost through strikes.  We are not assuming for one moment that we can ever reduce abstentions caused by illness to nil&mdash;that is not the fate of mortals in this world&mdash;but we ought to consider these figures and, considering them, we ought to accept the justification for a totally different approach to health services.</P>
    <P>We, in Fine Gael, have found ourselves in violent disagreement with Fianna Fáil for very many years on issues of national priority and governmental responsibility.  Fianna Fáil, in their First and Second Programmes, spoke of the priority which economic development had to get over what they regarded as subsidiary, or secondary, or less important, social development. We consider this to be wrong. We do not think you can have economic development to the exclusion of social development and <i>vice versa</i>.  One goes hand in glove with the other.  If we were to do something worth while about our health services and provide for all our people free medical care and substantially reduced drugs and medicines outside of hospitals, I believe we would cut significantly into that 14,000,000 working days which are lost annually. If the Minister is unable to prevail upon the conscience of his colleagues and, in particular, upon the conscience of the Minister for Finance, to do something radical in relation to the <Col N="1123" /> financing of our health services, might I plead with him to use the economic argument that the expenditure of another £5 million would be well justified if, in the result, we cut down on the number of working days lost annually through illness.  If we could do it even by 2½ million working days per annum we would recover all the time that is lost, the production that is lost and the wealth that is lost through industrial disputes.  That is not to say that we should not do something also about reducing, if we can, the number of industrial disputes, but it is certainly worthwhile trying to do something about what we are losing unnecessarily at the moment through absenteeism because of ill health.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael motion refers to the unjust burden which the present system of financing the services imposes on ratepayers without regard to their ability to pay.  This causes me to return to the objection in principle which I voiced earlier, the principle of the poor law system which assumes that any property owner is a person of wealth and, on that account, must contribute to the support of paupers in the district in which the property is situated.  The assumption that a ratepayer was a person of means might have been justified in the days when only people of means owned property.  That day has, thank God, long since gone.  There are many smallholders and many small owners of house property obliged to pay for health services from which they themselves are excluded because of their ownership of property.  That is totally and unforgiveably wrong.  We ask for the adoption of a comprehensive health service based upon insurance principles.  We do this because such a system would remove health services out of competition with all the other services provided by the State.</P>
    <P>We believe our people would respect an insurance fund, which could not be raided for any other purpose except the provision of health services.  People would understand the costs involved if they had created for them a health fund which would pay for the services. So long as the cost of running the health services is confused with the cost <Col N="1124" /> of every other service and amenity provided by the State, so long will you get people complaining about taxation and so long will you find people trying to fleece the health authorities for every last penny they can get because they honestly believe they are paying too much for an inefficient service.  I think they are justified in that belief.  An insurance system assumes that you will receive from those who can afford to pay a small contribution at regular intervals, probably weekly.  Then, when the rainy day comes, society and their neighbours will be able to come to the assistance of those who are ill through the medium of the fund created by their contributions.  That is the doctrine of good neighbourliness.  That is the doctrine of mutual help.  That is the doctrine which sees society working as a family and the nation working as a brotherhood.  It is a doctrine which is most respectable and it is a doctrine which would be acceptable to all sections of our people.</P>
    <P>Where we in Fine Gael differ from the two other political Parties is on the issue of the mode of financing our health services.  We appreciate, and we have so argued, that you cannot suddenly switch&mdash;nor would it be desirable suddenly to switch&mdash;all the cost of the existing health services from general taxation or from the ratepayers to an insurance fund.  We do not propose that.  What we do propose is that in relation to all further improvements in the health services, and particularly in relation to the domiciliary service which we have advocated, the contributions and the money paid, would come from people under an insurance system.</P>
    <P>The Government apparently accept that the health services should be paid to the rate of about 45 or 48 per cent by the ratepayers, and to the tune of 52 or 55 per cent, or thereabouts, from general taxation.  If I correctly interpret the most recent statement on the health services from the Labour Party, their view is that the cost should be transferred entirely to the national Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the understanding which reasonable people, including myself, took out of that statement. Fianna Fáil and Labour both err in principle.  They both put essential medical personal services, the preservation of life, in competition with every other service provided out of general taxes and rates.  We think that principle is wrong.  Until we get away from it, we will continue to suffer the strange reputation of being the only country in Europe, except Finland, not to have progressive, modern and adequate health services.</P>
      <P>As to the mode of financing the services, or paying for them, I know there has been a great deal of discussion. Some years ago I went on record as expressing the view, which I repeat now, that you will not have a proper health service unless the doctors are paid according to the services they give rather than on a capitation basis. Again, this returns to my earlier remarks about not continuing a service which leads to people being put in costly institutions.  If we try to operate here, without any qualification, a purely capitation rate then, human nature being what it is, doctors who work under such a system will tend to remove their responsibilities to institutions and hospitals.  In such cases with a capitation rate their income will not diminish.  It will remain the same, but the duties they will be asked to perform will be significantly less.  If we have a fee per service system, then doctors will be encouraged to provide the best services.  I believe that what is in operation in all countries with the exception of Britain and Holland can operate here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Sweden, Denmark and Britain free medical services are available to 100 per cent of the population.  In Germany, France and Austria, 90 per cent of the people enjoy a full medical <Col N="1126" /> service.  In the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland and Spain, which is not noted for its progressive social policies, 80 per cent of the people enjoy health services without charge.  In Belgium the figure is 75 per cent.  What reason is there to suggest that in Ireland alone only 30 per cent of the people should enjoy this service?</P>

      <P>This part of Ireland. What justification is there for continuing a situation in which only 30 per cent of the people enjoy services which on average in Europe are available to 90 per cent of the population?  We in Fine Gael are unable to find any such justification.  We believe that medical attention, drugs and medicines, are so vitally necessary that they should be available without charge when required.</P>
      <P>Any doctor, any nurse, any rational person, will tell you that recovery is frequently postponed, frequently delayed, because of worry and anxiety about the cost of medical attention. Any doctor, any nurse, will tell you that people will frequently postpone medical care, or purchasing drugs and medicine, because of the cost.  For that reason we consider that we must get away from a system which requires payment at the time of necessity, and get to the much more sensible system of paying at a time when the income is there, when the wealth is there, and the need is not immediately apparent. By having such a system we can have for all our people who require it, a full medical service with a choice of doctor, and free hospital, specialist and diagnostic services.  That is what we in Fine Gael are pledged to achieve.  That is what we in Fine Gael will give to the people when we return to power later this year.</P>

      <P>In seconding the motion which has been proposed by Deputy Ryan, I should like to add a few remarks to the case which he has made very ably to the House.  In my experience in this House, we have had many discussions, many debates, and many motions relating to the health services.  The manner in which any <Col N="1127" /> community regards how the exigencies of ill-health should be dealt with, is surely a hallmark of the sense of social justice which that community believes in.  The Party of which I have the honour to be a member, the Fine Gael Party, have held a consistent view in relation to the manner in which our health services should be organised and directed.  I do not want to go back over the many years of debate here, but I think it well to remind the House that, since 1957, when the present Fianna Fáil Government came into office, the Fine Gael Party have disclosed and advocated a consistent and clear policy.  No other Party has had any real view on this matter of the health services.</P>

      <P>I was Minister for Health in the inter-Party Government that went out of office in 1957. I noted with sadness and regret today the passing of Jim Larkin who was a Deputy in this House at that time.  I remember within six weeks of becoming Minister for Health having to introduce legislation to enable me to postpone the operation of the Health Act, 1953, because of the chaotic conditions which confronted me at that time as Minister.  Having been asked by the late Jim Larkin to give a certain undertaking, I repeated it in this House and I stated it would be a matter of public honour with me before I left office, while I did not in any way subscribe to the policy behind the Health Act, 1953, and while I regarded it as a wrong approach to health policy in this country, I made a public commitment that I would endeavour to make that work and that, in so far as I could assure it before I left office, that Act would be fully in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to say that that commitment was fully honoured.  I am glad to say that the chaos that attended my initiation into the Ministry for Health in this country had disappeared by 1957 and the Health Act was in operation and people were able to assess fully, without bias, without anger or hate, whether it was a correct solution for their problems.  Very shortly after the Health Act policy went into operation <Col N="1128" /> people began to realise that this was an inefficient and ineffective solution for what our people urgently required.</P>
    <P>The Health Act is a bad mixture.  It is a bad mixture of the poor law system of medicine, to which Deputy Richie Ryan has referred, and a State system of medicine that had been canvassed so generally in the decade before its introduction.  Its real defect is that it continues the poor law system of medicine that was first introduced as a famine relief measure in this country in the middle of the last century.  It continues that in general.  If one looks at the Poor Law Relief Act, 1847, and around that period one will find that the pauper test is repeated in the Health Act, 1953, and one is not entitled to the health services provided by this community, by this State, unless one can prove that one is entirely incapable by one's own industry or other lawful means of providing for oneself.</P>
    <P>That is the poor law approach.  It is very understandable, perhaps, in the purse-proud society of the early imperial days of the British Parliament in the last century, but is certainly not in keeping with the requirements of a modern, progressive and Christian society.  The Health Act requires, as the basis for medical services for one-third of the people of this country, proof that they are incapable by their own ends or other lawful means of providing for themselves. &ldquo;If you do that we will give you,&rdquo; the State says in effect, &ldquo;the minimum requirements to deal with your health problems but of course you will not be entitled to a choice of doctor.  You will have to take the services of the State doctor we will provide.  It does not matter that you have no confidence in him, it does not matter whether you were found trespassing on his land or had some particular enmity with him, he is the doctor you will go to and if you do not go to him you will get no other doctor&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is what this community provides as the medical services for the poor, under-privileged of this country. Merely to state it must bring a blush of shame to any Deputy concerned <Col N="1129" /> with the conditions of our society and concerned with social reform.  I am certain it brings a blush of shame to the Minister.  I am certain the Minister, whose instincts I know to be in the right direction, feels that this is an appalling burden to carry.  No one could have served as Minister for Health who could not but feel otherwise.</P>
    <P>Why has this system endured straight from the last century, incorporated by a Fianna Fáil Government into the Health Act, 1953, remained unchanged now 15 years later although time and time again we in the Fine Gael Party have pointed to the need for reform, have urged that it should be introduced, have demonstrated that, while our national policy here is concerned with the reunion of Ireland, we are asking poor people in the North to accept a farthing in place of the one shilling they have in so far as the value of health services is concerned?  Why has it never been changed?  I regret to have to say this &mdash;in my Party I am no longer the spokesman for health as it is an abler and certainly a more dedicated person who now speaks on these matters for us&mdash;but I feel bound to say it, that the reason this reform has not been introduced is because of the political prejudice and the political bias of those in charge of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Deputy is not here. I never like to criticise a man in his absence but I do so only because I feel it necessary in relation to what I have to say.  I would say that Deputy Seán MacEntee, as my successor and as the predecessor of the present Minister for Health, is the person responsible because he would not have it to say that the only solution was&mdash; and it is the only solution to our health problems in this country&mdash;the solution of health insurance.  But because we had proposed it, Fianna Fáil would not adopt it.  Under Deputy MacEntee as Minister for Health&mdash;I am sorry: he is not the Minister's immediate predecessor&mdash;the same absurd policy was continued, the mixing of oil and water, of chalk and cheese and the poor law system with modern <Col N="1130" /> social thinking.  That continued through the years.</P>
    <P>In 1961 the Fine Gael Party tabled a motion in this House urging that the Government of the day should embark on a policy of providing a comprehensive health service based on social insurance.  The then Government introduced an amendment to that motion suggesting the establishment of a Select Committee on Health Services.  I served on that Committee.  I did not do it willingly.  In fact, if anyone wants to know, I was a minority in my Party. I felt that to serve on that committee was to encourage the desire by the then Fianna Fáil Government to commit into the limbo of forgotten things what I regarded as the urgent problem of health reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is essentially a Committee Stage Bill.  I might start off by saying that, on the Committee Stage, I shall be glad to see every section of the Bill being closely examined.  I shall be glad to see every line of the Bill being closely examined, as has been suggested by some Deputies.  As I said in my opening statement, it is a Bill that needs careful consideration.  It is a far-reaching Bill which repeals a number of Statutes going back to the 13th century.  While some of the proposals are re-statements and re-enactments of the law as we know it, still, there are others that need close examination.  Some of these <Col N="1131" /> sections may turn out, with that close examination which is a feature of the Committee Stage of a Bill, to need some amendment.</P>
      <P>Taking everything into account, I cannot complain about the way the Bill has been received in this House. Opposition Deputies are entitled to make the most of the fact that they had not before them any specific draft of what is proposed by way of amendments to sections 30 and 31.  There was a genuine difficulty there but, on my side, there was a procedural difficulty. I felt that, if I were to circulate a specific draft, objection would be taken because this is not the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>In answer to Deputy M.J. O'Higgins I should say that, while I have spoken of amendments to these sections, this was only because I wanted to explain the nature of the changes.  When it comes to putting down the formal amendments, I intend to propose two new sections and to omit the existing ones.  I have spelled out, as well as I could, in my opening statement, the lines of what I proposed to substitute for sections 30 and 31.</P>
      <P>Deputies in both the Opposition Parties have said they intend to vote against the Bill partly because of what sections 30 and 31 contain although I do not propose to retain those sections as they appear at present.  Some Deputies have said they find some other sections of the Bill objectionable.  It would seem, however, that there is disagreement among Deputies in the Opposition Parties on some of the proposals in the Bill.  Some Opposition Deputies suggest one thing while other Opposition Deputies&mdash;possibly, I think, through misunderstanding some of the sections&mdash;have taken a different line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the sections providing for re-trials.  These have been criticised as involving new principles, double jeopardy, and so on and we are told that once a man is acquitted that should be the end of the matter.  I can only assume that the Deputies who made those remarks have not had an opportunity of assimilating what I pointed out in my opening speech, namely, that there is nothing new in the principle of what is proposed. <Col N="1132" /> A principle that, once a person is acquitted, that is the end of the matter is not by any means accepted in present law.  On the contrary, when it is an acquittal on a point of law, the right of appeal, with the possibility of a re-trial, is the normal rule and has been so all along.  These amendments apply, statistically, to fewer than one per cent of the cases.  Essentially, they apply to this one per cent the rule that is already applicable in 99 per cent of the cases.</P>
    <P>I pointed out in my opening statement on this particular matter that there is an appeal, by way of case stated on a point of law, in the district court: that has been the law for many years.  This covers 99 per cent of these cases which are dealt with in the criminal courts.  Indeed, this principle goes beyond the criminal law.  For instance, in the Land Code there is an appeal from the Lay Commissioners to the High Court&mdash;again on a point of law.  This applies irrespective of what happened in the courts below.  This principle has been there for a very long time.  All that is proposed is to apply the same principle to the one per cent of cases that are not already covered.</P>
    <P>If Deputies have made up their minds to vote against the Second Reading&mdash;notwithstanding the apparently uniform support for the great bulk of this Bill, because that has been the tone of this debate&mdash;nothing I can say is likely to change it.  But I can see no reason whatsoever why the Second Reading should not be allowed to pass without a division.  There are 62 sections in this Bill.  The criticisms that have been offered relate to just a few of them&mdash;indeed, in the main, to the two of them which in fact will not be moved.  However, this is a matter for the Deputies themselves.  I cannot help emphasising that most of the Deputies who have spoken on this measure have heartily welcomed many of the proposals in it.  The vast majority of the criticisms of this Bill were confined to two sections that will now be omitted from it.</P>
    <P>As I keep emphasising, this is essentially a Committee Stage Bill.  As far as the close examination that will take place on the Committee Stage or on <Col N="1133" /> any amendments that may be moved is concerned, I shall certainly welcome a very full debate on it and on every one of them and will give specific explanations, where this is necessary, to get the Deputies to appreciate fully the reasons for these sections.</P>
    <P>Even apart from what was said by Opposition Deputies about sections 30 and 31, the comments related to particular sections and, therefore, were comments that could more usefully be made on the Committee Stage.  This was unavoidable as there is a variety of matters, not very closely connected, in this Bill but it would be much easier to deal with these specific matters on the next Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins made a point on section 7 about the case where an employer is defrauded of money and wants to get back his money but does not want to have to report the matter to the Garda.  Deputy O'Higgins himself noticed that the Explanatory Memorandum drew special attention to this type of case because it mentions that to accept restitution is legally regarded as accepting reward for silence or, in legal parlance &ldquo;compounding a felony&rdquo;.  The Deputy can take it therefore, that I, too, recognise that there is an argument for some modification of the existing law if it can be kept within the bounds of reason.  And for that reason I am glad to see that he has commented on it.  I shall give this particular matter some further thought between this and the Committee Stage.  I, too, in my time have experienced some of the difficulties that, obviously, Deputy O'Higgins has come up against in practising his profession.</P>
    <P>On section 6, however, I think he went wrong.  He said it places on the accused person the onus of proving himself innocent, and that this is a tendency to be found in much recent legislation.  He admitted, however, that there are cases where this must be done because the particular sections would not be effective otherwise.  I think he is wrong, however, about this section&mdash;it is, to be specific, section 6 (2).  There is no question, there, of making the accused person prove his innocence.  The essence of the offence is that the accused knowingly helped another to escape.  The prosecution will <Col N="1134" /> have to prove that, but the section provides an exemption; even where the prosecution proves that he knowingly did this thing, it will be open to him to prove that he had a reasonable excuse.  It is a well-established principle of law that a person who claims the benefit of an exception or an exemption has to prove that he is the exception he claims to be, and so there is no departure from principle.  On the practical level, there is no conceivable alternative because the &ldquo;reasonable excuse&rdquo; the person might have would almost certainly be the kind of one that only he would know about.</P>
    <P>Some references were made during the debate to the provisions about the collection of rates and taxes.  I am glad to see that everybody admits that rates and taxes must be collected and that campaigns to withhold them cannot be allowed to succeed.  This, indeed, goes without saying.  Nevertheless, there has been criticism of these provisions on two grounds.  The first is that they are unnecessary.  It is alleged that the existing law is adequate.  The second criticism is that, if there is a campaign of this kind, it betokens a failure at Government level.</P>
    <P>In one sense existing law may be adequate.  I said so in my introductory speech.  An organisation that advocates or encourages the withholding of rates and so on is, by that very fact, an unlawful organisation, and the consequences of that, for the organisation, are very serious.  The difficulty is that the consequences are so serious that one has to try to look the other way for as long as possible in the earnest hope that those responsible will see the light very quickly.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is what Deputies mean when they speak of the existing law.  They are not thinking of the Offences Against the State Act.  They mean, I think, the legal process of enforcing the collection of rates by seizure.  This, of course, is adequate for individual defaulters or even for defaulting groups if they are just a few local people with a purely local grievance. However, for many reasons, it is both inadequate and inappropriate where there is a widespread conspiracy to withhold rates.  By any reasonable test, it is the people who incite others to withhold their rates and taxes who <Col N="1135" /> should be made amenable.  Seizures are, of their nature, directed at individual defaulters, as such.  They are cumbersome and expensive.  In practice they require the diversion of large numbers of gardaí for protective duties. Where there is an organised campaign, seizures inevitably give rise to charges of discrimination, victimisation and questions as to why some individual should be first on the list.  Yet we all know that somebody must be first on the list.</P>
    <P>Before leaving that I should say that it has been the practice of some people who have participated in a widespread organised conspiracy of this kind to do the preaching, to take a leading part in the campaign not to pay the rates and so on, while they themselves, the inciters, took very good care to slip quietly in and pay their own rates. They got numbers of unfortunate people who were not aware of what was happening behind the scenes, into trouble with the law.  We had that situation not so very long ago and I think that such people should certainly be made responsible for their actions in inciting others, who may be in an emotional state, to take part in these unlawful activities.  They make sure that they themselves go scot free and that no sheriff can descend on them, to take their stock or chattels to be realised for rates due.</P>
    <P>The other criticism that was made on this section is that when this sort of situation arises it means that the Government have failed in their duty. We have had this kind of comment also about demonstrations near Leinster House, statements that people would not be engaging in this type of protest unless they had a grievance and that, if they have a grievance, it must be the Government's fault.  If this is just a matter of Deputies wanting to try to have a crack at the Government, I am not concerned; but if it is meant to be put forward as a serious argument against a change in the law, I feel bound to point out that it is a very dangerous fallacy.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that any Government&mdash;of no matter what Party&mdash; would like to give huge increases in agricultural subsidies, huge increases in social welfare benefits, huge increases <Col N="1136" /> in educational grants, in fact huge increases in everything if they had the wherewithal; but the purse of course is not a bottomless one, as we all know. Organised sectional groups&mdash;and I do not mean to use this term in any offensive way&mdash;tend to press their demands to the limit.  Some people say that this group or that group would not be adopting these tactics unless they had a serious grievance.  This of course is nonsense.  Of course they would, if they could get away with it or succeed with it, and I for one have no intention of criticising them for that.  In so far as different groups think that, by this form of action, irrespective of the demands of others or irrespective of the position of the national purse, they are going to get some special treatment, some of them will undoubtedly try it.</P>
    <P>We should introduce a little realism into this.  Different groups fight for the interests of their members and that is only to be expected.  But in any civilised society one either fights within the rules or one gets penalised for going outside the rules.  One of the rules is, and must be, that rates and taxes must be paid.  Precisely because they are vital, there will always be a temptation to some groups to think of withholding them.  The most effective way of ensuring that the temptation is resisted is to have it recognised, beyond dispute, that such a campaign is directed at the very foundations of our society and that it cannot be allowed to succeed.  This is neither arrogance nor intolerance nor intransigence.  It is, in sober truth, no more than saying that our institutions could not survive if we were to allow such challenges to succeed.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have referred to the criticisms of the Bill that have been made by various bodies such as county councils, trade unions and so on.  In fact, I referred specifically to those criticisms in my opening speech.  However, this picture which some Deputies attempted to draw of a universal condemnation of this Bill is a caricature. Most of the criticisms were concerned with just a few sections and it is only now, I think, that many people are getting to know that there are sections in this Bill apart from sections 30 and 31.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary suggested that I had <Col N="1137" /> tried to imply that the Bill's critics were just a group of subversives.  He could not have been referring to anything I said in my opening speech.  He was obviously referring to something I said in a speech in Cork some time back and, since he has referred to it, let me set the record straight.  What I said was, and I quote:</P>
    <P>On 26th July last, a letter was issued from the Sinn Féin Headquarters at 30 Gardiner Place, Dublin, instructing all members of that organisation to write to their TDs about the Bill.  But not only that: they were also instructed to organise the writing of similar letters by any other organisation of which the Sinn Féin member happened to be a member.  So, if you have a Sinn Féin Member of a County Council or a Trade Union, or a Residents' Association, he is instructed to get that organisation to lend its weight to the campaign.  And, of course, these organisations are just told that the Bill contains such and such a provision&mdash;which it does not &mdash;and they, in all innocence, lend their names to this kind of campaign.</P>
    <P>If anybody wants to read that as meaning that I denied there was criticism from these various bodies, when in fact what I said was the very opposite, he is welcome.  If he wants to suggest that I said or implied that these groups were subversives when my whole point was that they were innocent victims of a planned campaign, again he is welcome. I am content to let the record speak for itself.</P>
    <P>There is no point in any of the Deputies concerned trying to evade this issue.  I accept, as I have repeatedly said, that there were people who had genuine objections to sections 30 and 31 and perhaps to a few other sections out of 62 sections in the Bill, but the resolutions and protests were not confined to these sections.  They referred also to sections that are simply statements of the existing law and on which trade unions and others were grossly misled.  Some of the protests were about sections like the provisions re-enacting something from the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act of 1875&mdash; that have been the law of this land <Col N="1138" /> all down the years.</P>
    <P>While I am on the matter of my speech in Cork and what I said on television, which was referred to by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, I should like to answer the allegation that on both of these occasions I adopted a &ldquo;notan-inch&rdquo; policy and that if I had then adopted the line I have taken in my Second Reading speech, there would have been far less controversy.</P>
    <P>I was on television for just a few minutes.  My comments were taped beforehand and were limited to answering specific criticisms put to me.  I knew nothing of the contents of the introductory statement given on the programme before my taped interview was shown.</P>
    <P>As far as my Cork speech is concerned, I stated in the most explicit terms that it was made only for the purpose of answering some of the wilder criticisms of this Bill.  I stated, again in explict terms, and I even said a few times during the course of my speech, that I was not to be taken as saying that the Bill needed no changes. I said I was expecting to make changes. On section 30, I quite specifically stated that I was defending only the principle on which it was based, and that it was in the interest of the public-at-large that the police should receive some advance notice; and almost the very last words of that particular speech were these, and I quote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I repeat that I have, from the outset, expected that some amendments will be necessary and I have at all times made it clear that I am willing and anxious to listen to reasoned criticism and indeed to do anything I can to remove any grounds for genuine misgiving even where I myself might be completely satisfied that there was no reason for such misgivings.  All I ask is that the criticisms that are offered should relate to the Bill as it exists in fact and not the Bill as it exists in the imagination of those who have criticised it on the evidence of some casual paragraph in a newspaper report.</P>
    <P>Even as late as today, some Deputies have been repeating that it was only just before I came into the House for the Second Reading that I indicated <Col N="1139" /> that I was prepared to make any change.  Again, for the record, if I do not get tired hearing myself repeating this proposition, let me say that, from the very first time I spoke in public on this Bill, I indicated, just as I have quoted, that I was prepared to consider reasoned amendments and to listen to reasoned arguments in connection with the different sections of the Bill.  That was my original attitude; that was my attitude all along; that is my attitude on this Stage of the Bill; and that will be my attitude on the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael O'Higgins, in his comment on the Bill, spoke of the duty of the State to preserve law and order.  He said there were different ways of carrying out that duty and he thought the best way was to have a situation where the law is respected and not merely tolerated and where the organs of the State are admired and not feared and where the whole administration of justice is welcomed by the people.</P>
    <P>I certainly support that proposition and I expect that every Deputy in this House would do likewise.  But how far does one take it?  I am sure that Deputy O'Higgins and most other Deputies are quite familiar with the fact that we have all kinds of people and groups standing up on public platforms and openly admitting that they are not really concerned with remedying this grievance or that grievance but with, as they put it, &ldquo;destroying the system&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Many of them will say that they have not the faintest notion of what new system they wish to put in its place.  They even say it is somebody else's job to find an alternative.  Some others, of course, are quite clear as to what they want in its place and what they want is something which few, if any, of the Deputies here would welcome.  However, these people claim that to destroy the system they are entitled to resort to public disorder. There is not much use in talking to people like that about respect for the law.  They say they have not any and I put it to Deputy O'Higgins that, on that issue, at all events, he can <Col N="1140" /> safely take their word.  I also put it to the Deputy and to the House that we must take account of life as it is and not as we might wish it to be.</P>
    <P>In much the same way, I must take issue with Deputy Dunne who seems to me to allow his humanitarian ideas to get the better of his good sense.  He opposes all retrials, even those the law already provides for.  However, I will say that he has been much more logical and consistent than some of the experts outside this House.  He was quite right in putting his finger on the fact that what is at issue is the ordeal of the trial and not the purely formal and legalistic point that in one case there has been an acquittal and in the other case there has not.</P>
    <P>The formal acquittal on a point of law carries no weight at all because we are talking of cases in which the acquittal is due to a legal mistake and was not given on merits.  In such a case, the accused has had much less of an ordeal than where a jury disagrees, because he has not gone through the ordeal of waiting for a jury verdict. The logic of the situation is, therefore, that we should either have no retrials at all, as Deputy Dunne advocates, or have what the Bill provides.  I am afraid that it is quite unthinkable that retrials should be completely abolished. It would inevitably result in some people who were clearly and provably guilty of crime evading trial.  This, I imagine, would be quite unthinkable to most Deputies.  I wish to say very seriously that, in certain circumstances not at all far-fetched, it could lead to crimes of private vengeance by injured parties or their relatives convinced that the law did not allow justice to be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne also took up my reference to special courts and proceeded to launch an attack on them. I do not accept what he said but, if he takes the trouble to re-read what I said, he will find that the very point I was making was that nobody likes special courts and that we should, if we can, create a situation in which special courts will not ever again be necessary.</P>
    <P>He spoke of making it easier for the State to secure convictions.  This phraseology does not fit the facts as they now are or the situation that we are trying <Col N="1141" /> to establish.  It is phraseology which gives the impression that the prosecutor goes out to &ldquo;get his man&rdquo; irrespective of whether he is guilty or innocent. This is not so.  What the prosecutor does is to place all the facts before the court and then let the court decide, and the court decides subject to that over-riding provision about the onus of proof.  All this Bill seeks to achieve is that we should do away with some quite artificial and illogical obstacles which prevent the jury from giving a true verdict based on the available evidence.</P>
    <P>Deputy T.F. O'Higgins launched a severe attack on the Bill and he picked on section 24 as a particularly bad example of the kind of provision which he accused my Department of thinking up without having any regard to individual rights.  Again, if he will refer to my opening speech, he will find that this section which he thinks so dreadful is taken&mdash;as I acknowledged&mdash;word for word from English legislation and was recommended by a distinguished English committee of legal experts.  The Deputy may disagree with the section, but I think that if he had known of the weight of expert and learned opinion that supports it he would not have been so quick to dismiss it as a product of bureaucratic minds insensitive to the interests of ignorant or unrepresented defendants.  And if he reads the report of that English committee, which I have placed in the Library of the House, he will see that that section is very carefully thought out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton said that this was a Bill which is mainly the concern of the lawyers of this House.  However, by far the most constructive criticism came from Deputies who were not lawyers at all.  I notice that neither of two eminent lawyers in the House, Deputy Lindsay and Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, thought it necessary to read my opening statement on the Bill or the Explanatory Memorandum.  I feel justified in claiming that, if they had done so, they would not have made the contributions they made in the House on this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, Deputy Dunne and other Deputies referred to the repeal of <i>Magna Carta.</i> This repeal is, in fact, a formality and is simply part of the <Col N="1142" /> continuing process of clearing away deadwood from the Statute Book.  As I mentioned in my opening speech, the Bill proposes to repeal in full over 120 old and obsolete statutes.  Very many of the chapters of <i>Magna Carta</i> have already been formally repealed from time to time.  What is left, apart from Chapter 16, is superseded either by the Constitution or by later specific enactments. <i>Habeas corpus,</i> which has been referred to in the debate, is not dependent on <i>Magna Carta:</i> it is specifically provided for in our Constitution. It is well known that the original <i>Magna Carta</i> was a charter to which the good King John was forced to affix his seal at Runnymede in surrender to the barons; our charter of liberty is the Irish Constitution.</P>
    <P>Chapter 16 of <i>Magna Carta</i> is not being repealed.  This is concerned with the obstruction of rivers and is a provision of civil law, not criminal law. Whether it is still a live part of our law I could not say without very long and detailed research.  This was not gone into when the repeals were being prepared, because this Bill deals with the criminal law.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also suggested that we should have a Consolidation Bill dealing with some of these repeals.  I am afraid it would not work out, and I say this specifically on the point he particularly mentioned, that is, powers of arrest.  Most of the powers of arrest are Common Law powers, and are not always clearly defined.  We could not have a consolidating Bill on them.  His proposal is the exact opposite to what is normally accepted in England as well as in this country as the proper and most effective procedure for consolidation, that is, that one first passes a Bill to make any necessary changes and to clear away anomalies preparatory to consolidation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon mentioned that this Bill was left suspended for two years from the date of its publication.  In fact, it was not published until May last.  I agree, and I am fully conscious of the fact, that if we had the Second Reading a lot sooner, much of the misapprehension and misunderstanding that have arisen in the minds of some of the public would have been eliminated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1143" /> Some Deputies, including Deputy Dillon, were concerned about majority verdicts.  Deputy Dillon thought it was quite wrong for me to emphasise the position in civil cases.  If the Deputy looks at the record, I think he will agree that I did not emphasise it or make much point of it.  I made what was just a passing reference to the fact that majority verdicts by juries in civil cases have been accepted here since the foundation of the State or as long as I remember the legal business anyhow. Of course, in places like Scotland, in both civil and legal cases that has long been the position, as I pointed out in my opening statement.</P>
    <P>I think some Deputies missed an important point.  If you have one recalcitrant man on a jury in a criminal case, he can hold up the whole proceedings. If there are eleven jurymen for acquittal and one for conviction, then there must be a retrial.  Deputies are inclined to think this is always going one way, but, of course, this is not so.  There have been cases, such as I have mentioned, where one or two have held out for a conviction against nine or ten who wanted to give a verdict of acquittal.  This is an aspect of the changing of the jury system that does not, as I say, occur to Deputies or people generally considering this problem.</P>
    <P>The other matter&mdash;and I shall go into this in greater detail on the Committee Stage&mdash;is that in this country we have the problem over a number of years of quasi-political crime, if I could describe it as such.  I made it quite clear that the reasons for this proposed change have nothing to do with the reasons for the change in the law in England, which, we know quite well, was due to juries being got at by highly organised gangs of criminals, but we have here, from time to time, cases, some quite recently, where certain political elements have been involved in crime and where juries, or some of them, have been got at or an attempt made to get at them.  As I pointed out in my opening statement, if the majority verdict operated here that type of campaign would be far less likely to succeed.  It is true that if the situation warranted it, if it got <Col N="1144" /> really serious, we could be driven back to our special courts, but, as I say, I do not like that; I do not want that. On the Committee Stage of this Bill I shall go into this matter further with Deputies in the House, but I believe this is a correct way of tackling the difficulty which is peculiar to our country.  Deputies on reconsideration will probably come round to my view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy says so I will accept it.  What I am saying here is this may occur on a fairly small scale&mdash;I am thinking with particular reference to the south in recent times where it has been on a small scale&mdash;and the situation would not warrant the setting up of special criminal courts.  Yet, it is and can be serious enough and, if we had something like this, there would be far less chance of these gentlemen being able to terrorise juries.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lindsay said that the Bill, as introduced, provided for the banning of all protests, all marches and all meetings, at the behest of the Minister instructing an officer of the Garda Síochána.  I have no intention now of going into any detail on these sections but I must repeat again three simple facts.  Firstly, section 31, as it stands, provides for the banning of meetings on two, and only two, grounds.  Secondly, there is a nondiscrimination clause written into the section.  Thirdly, there is a right of summary appeal to the High Court. From this it follows that Deputy Lindsay's statement is sheer and utter nonsense.  Nobody knows that better than Deputy Lindsay himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also complained that we were slavishly following English law in some of these reform sections.  As I told the House, we took some sections from the report of the English committee which is now the law in England.  It occurs to me, though, that when we were dealing with the Succession Bill in this House Deputy Lindsay's big complaint was that we did not keep to the English law.  He is being rather <Col N="1145" /> inconsistent now in complaining about following the English law.  This is a reform measure.  These sections are sections to expedite the legal process here.  As I pointed out in my opening statement, the sections are as much for the benefit of the defendant or accused person as they are of the prosecution. If distinguished legal practitioners in England have come up with this type of solution there is no reason why we should not adopt it.  If I thought it workable and the suggestion came from any other country in a measure of this kind I would gladly sponsor it and I think we would be foolish not to adopt it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay has kept a good deal of his wrath and indignation for section 27 of the Bill, which deals with the admissibility of evidence of previous crime of misconduct.  He said that this particular section appalled him as a legal practitioner and that it would appal people who practise on the other side of the court, by which, I think, he meant those practitioners who act for the State in criminal proceedings.  The Deputy gave us to understand that the section represented a monstrous change in the law which would be detrimental and unjust to an accused person.  The Deputy said at column 929&mdash;top of the page&mdash;that there was only one type of case that he knows of where this is now permissible.  The Deputy saw the section as representing the thinking of the theorist as against the practitioner, and he argued that the practitioner was closer to reality.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that, as I understood it, section 27 was designed merely to give effect to our existing law as laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of <i>The People v. Kirwan,</i> cited in paragraph 106 of the explanatory memorandum.  The Deputy was taken aback and quickly switched his attentions to another provision of the Bill. When, during the adjournment of the debate, he got a chance of having a look at the explanatory memorandum to which I have referred, he came back to the attack and proceeded to tell the House that the explanatory memorandum did not correctly interpret the judgment of the late Mr. Justice O'Byrne as laid down in the Kirwan case.  The Deputy asked that on Committee <Col N="1146" /> Stage I would bring into the House the full reports mentioned in the memorandum.  The clear and obvious implication of this suggestion was that I had quoted the judgement insufficiently or out of context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it a murder case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  I did not quote this out of context at all.  He is on the record as saying the evidence of previous misconduct is admissible in one type of case.  He is clearly and seriously wrong in that.  He is equally wrong in saying that the explanatory memorandum misinterprets the Australian case.  The explanatory memorandum makes no attempt to interpret the Australian case.  The extract it gives was chosen not by me but by Mr. Justice O'Byrne in his judgment in the Supreme Court.  If the Deputy wishes to argue that the Supreme Court went off the rails on that occasion, he is entitled to do so; but he cannot blame me as I have only referred here to the construction placed on the matter by the Supreme Court.  In so far as I and my advisers can understand the existing law on this subject, this section writes into statutory form the accepted principles of case law, not an inch beyond and not an inch less than that. I have no objection at all when we come to the Committee Stage, on this section about which Deputy Lindsay is so frightened, to bringing into the House the full judgments.  It will be clear that I did not take anything out of context.  If anybody took anything out of context, it can only have been the late Mr. Justice O'Byrne.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is what we call case law which is scattered over a number of decisions.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It has always been the position in legislation of this kind. <Col N="1147" /> It is good and proper practice and practitioners, instead of having to spend hours searching or writing to counsel about the admissibility of this, that or the other, or find out what particular number of cases must be referred to, will find it of immense benefit if such information is in a concise and clear form.  That would be of immense benefit to everybody. That is indeed the vital purpose of consolidating provisions&mdash;to make the law as clear and accessible as we can, to show what the law is as at this point of time in an up-to-date manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister does not mind my interrupting him at this stage.  The whole problem is that this is not a consolidating Bill.  We have not got in it, as we would have in a consolidating Bill, a certificate from the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I dealt with the Deputy's criticism in that connection before he entered the House.</P>
      <P>Section 36 deals with the right of appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of a lower court in discharging a person who might have been convicted of an offence.  Deputy Lindsay alleged that the section was a direct and deliberate attack on the principle that a man cannot be put in peril twice.  Even if the Deputy did not know it before, he would have realised if he had taken the trouble to read my opening speech that what he says in this respect is incorrect and that the principle to which he refers is not, in fact, a principle that is accepted in the present law.  As I pointed out, what has been overlooked in the criticisms that have been made by Deputy Lindsay and others concerning Part VII of the Bill is that, under existing law, if a district justice makes a mistake in law dismissing the prosecution, his decision can be challenged on appeal to the High Court by way of case stated and, if the appeal is upheld, the district justice is obliged to hear the case again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know why Deputy Lindsay and others run away from this situation, which has been the law of the land since the foundation of the State. District court prosecutions account for <Col N="1148" /> more than 99 per cent of all criminal prosecutions that come before the courts.  He suggests that there is a dangerous departure here.  While this appeal exists from the decision of the district court, that suggestion of his is beyond me.  It has always been the practice here that, where a point of law is concerned in a court of summary jurisdiction, there is an appeal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay carefully avoided mentioning that, even when an appeal is upheld by the Supreme Court, a retrial will not follow as a matter of course.  It will only follow when the Supreme Court directs that it should take place in the interests of justice. I do not know whether it is Deputy Lindsay's view&mdash;whether he is prepared to get up here and say it&mdash; that the Supreme Court cannot be trusted to give a proper decision in a situation of that kind.  It is spelled out here clearly in the Bill.  There is discretion. The Supreme Court need not order a retrial.  It is within the court's discretion&mdash;and I think that is fair enough&mdash;in the interests of justice.  I think it will be acceptable to most reasonably-minded Deputies.</P>
    <P>Another point made by Deputy Lindsay to which I wish to refer arose in respect of section 44, which proposes to empower the court to allow the prosecution to remedy an omission in the proofs after the case has closed.  Some Deputies criticised this section as in some way altering the onus of proof in a criminal prosecution, which rests on the State. The State must prove the case against the accused person.  Deputy Lindsay suggested over and over again that this was shifting the onus of proof, but I do not know how he managed to place this extraordinary interpretation on section 44, because it should be obvious to any unbiassed person, and certainly to any legal practitioner, that the section has nothing whatever to do with the onus of proof.</P>
    <P>Moreover, if the Deputy would read the section he would see that the court may exercise its discretion only if it considers that, in the interests of justice and having regard to all the circumstances of the case, it is reasonable to do so.  Therefore, the picture drawn by the Deputy of a never-ending game <Col N="1149" /> in which the prosecution would keep popping up with new evidence is, as he no doubt knows, an absurdity.  Such a thing could conceivably happen if judges were fools, but, of course, they are not.  All the section proposes to do is to provide for cases where, as Deputy Lindsay and other Deputies, including Deputy O'Higgins, said, if the prosecution fails to put in some form of proof, perhaps by a slip &mdash;everybody is human and that can happen&mdash;the accused could walk out. This section gives power to a judge if, in all the circumstances, and where it appears that the proof is available, to hear the prosecution, to recall the witnesses or to put some document in evidence.</P>
    <P>There have been&mdash;I will go into it in more detail on Committee Stage&mdash; some bad cases, due to omissions, of criminals escaping justice.  Most sensible Deputies will agree that should not be so.  On some occasions allegations have been made that it was a real scandal such things were allowed to occur.  Let me emphasise that the trial judge has this discretion and indeed, as practitioners know, a late statement of evidence may not be put in if the judge does not think it right or if he thinks the defence have not got sufficient prior notice.  Judges have refused to allow adjournments and they have discretion to deal with the omission of formal proof.</P>
    <P>However, this has nothing to do with the onus of proof which never shifts in a criminal case except on special occasions such as the illicit distillation of liquor whereby, if poteen is found on a man's land, the onus shifts and he has to go into the witness box and prove that he did not know or that he had no reasonable grounds to suspect&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And in all customs cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, certain customs cases, anyway.  But, broadly speaking, as far as the criminal law is concerned, the onus is always on the State to prove its case.  Indeed, it is very regular and, if I may say so, a hackneyed warning by the defence to juries at all times that there is no duty on the defendant to go into the witness box and answer cases <Col N="1150" /> which they say have not been made. That is the law and this section has nothing to do with the onus of proof, notwithstanding what Deputy Lindsay has alleged.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies spoke about other sections of the Bill, welcoming many of them.  Deputy O'Connell, however, spoke about dictatorial powers and alleged that a lot of these provisions were unconstitutional.  It is not necessary for me to point out to Deputy O'Connell that here he has no problem: if they are unconstitutional, they are not the law and that is the end of it. Somebody will simply have to point that out to the court at some particular stage.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the provisions about fingerprinting to which some Deputies have taken exception are a severe imposition on the ordinary people of this or any other country. It is only in specific circumstances set out in the Bill that the fingerprints can be taken.  Indeed, in this day and age when crime is highly organised and where, for instance, the Garda may have caught somebody breaking a window, where they have some fingerprints and have suspects, a senior member, under a judicial order, can get authority to take suspects' fingerprints. I cannot see what is wrong with that.  If we are thinking in terms of trying to protect our people and our property, and if we are to combat what is now a highly organised business, these powers are essential. They are being used and used extensively in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware, and, indeed, it goes without saying, as set out in the Bill, that, where a man is acquitted, his fingerprints are destroyed.  However, we should build up here, and I hope we will build up in time, a record of fingerprints of persons proved guilty, as they have in other countries.  It is rather significant that in a recent rather notorious case where an American woman was found, alleged to have been murdered on the beaches of Clare, it was only through the fingerprints in the United States that the Garda were able to identify her or find out anything about her.  Deputies will be aware that in the case of some very bad sexual crimes in England, where <Col N="1151" /> frequently it is notoriously difficult to bring the culprits to justice, the police had to ask the people over a wide area voluntarily to submit to fingerprinting. Certainly in the interests of the community I see nothing wrong in the limited way here in which we are dealing with this problem.  When we come to Committee Stage I think Deputies will really take a sensible look at this matter, noting the built-in protection for the individual which is in these sections and they will, I believe, accept the proposition as it is or certainly one very like it.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not see the difference between being asked in such cases as he mentioned, in some revolting sexual case, by the police &ldquo;Will you help us to eliminate you from this case?  It would help us if you gave us your fingerprints&rdquo; and the police authorities going to court and asking for an order to enable them to take Michael Moran's fingerprints in a revolting sexual case?  In the one case Mr. Michael Moran can say to the guards &ldquo;Go to hell.  What do you think I am doing with a case like this?&rdquo; but on the other hand they can say &ldquo;We are going to court, Mr. Moran, and we want your fingerprints in the case of the lady who was raped on Dollymount Strand&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is trying to twist it around.  I gave the instance that people in other countries do not see anything extraordinary about coming forward and giving their fingerprints. Some Deputies have been making the argument that there is something abhorrent about giving fingerprints for any purpose at any time and that there would be a bar sinister on the family escutcheon for all time if one gave one's fingerprints for any purpose at any time.  I am merely stating they do this voluntarily&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In dealing with the section regarding offensive weapons some Deputies asked a question about bicycle chains. It is, of course, correct to say that they will be covered.

      <P>In regard to section 53 I made it clear that I appreciate the point made&mdash;and I anticipated that it would be&mdash;by some Deputies that some small man, or two or three men, might want to go slow on the payment of rates to draw attention to a bog road or some matter which they regarded as a genuine grievance.  It is to meet that situation that I said that I would propose an amendment to provide that a prosecution would not be brought except at the instance of the Attorney General, so that it would be only in the circumstances of a conspiracy of some significance, such as I described in my opening statement, that that particular law would be applied.</P>
      <P>Deputy Pattison made the point that the House on the Second Stage debate was deprived of discussing the proposed new sections, instead of sections 30 and 31.  That, of course, is true. I appreciate that, notwithstanding how I spelled out the purport of the proposed changes, it was difficult for Deputies fully to study them without having the actual draft sections in front of them.  I hope to have these amendments out as soon as possible, giving effect to what I think I covered fairly fully in my opening speech in regard to the changes in sections 30 and 31.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan made a very extreme and hysterical speech and of course he was talking about matters that are not in this Bill.  His own colleague, Deputy Barrett, is on record as having said that some of the criticisms of sections 30 and 31 were exaggerated.  I do not know what he would think of Deputy Ryan's speech if he had heard it, but I can guess.  I do not feel it is necessary to add to what Deputy Barrett has said and so I pass from what Deputy Ryan had to say on these two sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Belton, Deputy Burke and others are concerned about the lack of uniformity in fines and sentences and this, I suppose, is a fact of life not alone here but in other countries.  They have a system in Britain, I think, whereby the magistrates get together <Col N="1154" /> from time to time and one of the ideas behind a section of one of our recent Acts in this country in appointing a President of the District Court was to achieve a similar result here.  The idea was that from time to time he might get his colleagues together and discuss the matter of uniformity of punishment. It is notorious that different district justices, and judges for that matter, take different views of what is the correct punishment to fit the crime. I know there are many people who take a very serious view of the mild manner in which some offenders have been treated by some justices or judges.  It is a matter that is difficult to determine. But I believe that what has been said by different Deputies on this issue may have a healthy effect.  I have no doubt that the President of the District Court will convey those views to his colleagues and that the Press will also make them known.</P>
    <P>It is very desirable, so far as it is practicable, to have uniformity but I should like Deputies also to appreciate that it is very dangerous to go on what one reads in a newspaper as to what happened in a court.  It may be, quite unavoidably, a skimpy report and the reader may not get the vital piece of evidence that may have swayed the court one way or another.  That vital evidence may not be reported at all. The justice or judge is there and is in a position to assess the value of the evidence given before him, whereas one may see, perhaps in the same day or within a week, the rather extreme example, perhaps, of one man getting off under the Probation Act while another man gets a very severe penalty for the same kind of offence or crime. People are inclined to fly off at half cock and say that there is something radically wrong here.  While there may be genuine concern, it is very dangerous to rely in these matters on newspaper reports.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the main points and criticisms that have been made on this Stage.  Let me emphasise that, listening to the debate, practically the whole of the Bill with the exception of two sections seems to be largely acceptable to Deputies.  There may be some sections that need close examination.  I have emphasised that this is essentially <Col N="1155" /> a Committee Stage Bill.  I agree with the Deputy who said that we should examine this Bill, section by section and line by line, on the Committee Stage.  Many Deputies who expressed their views here welcome nearly 60 out of the 62 sections of the Bill.  I suggest that, in particular, the section dealing with meetings near Leinster House, which are a particular interest to Deputies, should be closely examined by them when we come to the Committee Stage.  As I told Deputy Corish at a very early stage, I have quite an open mind on this matter.  That provision of the Bill is, in a very special way, the concern of Parliament and I ask Deputies to give what is here their very close attention and consideration between now and the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies, I think, agree that it is a good thing to take this provision out of the existing law&mdash;the 1939 Act&mdash; and put it into a Bill of this kind and also that it is a suitable time to go on with that proposal now when we can examine it in a calm and detached way. I have an open mind on the particular proposal.  I recommend the provision here to the House but if the House in <Col N="1156" /> its wisdom, on this particular proposal, has something which it thinks would be more acceptable, we can all examine it together to see if we can get on the Statute Book something acceptable to the vast majority of the House.</P>
    <P>I think the debate has answered much of the misrepresentation and removed much of the misunderstanding in certain sections of the public mind about this Bill.  The debate has shown that a large part of the Bill is very necessary and desirable.  I believe there is a better understanding among Deputies and the general public as to the essence of the proposals here.  By the time we give this Bill a thorough examination on the Committee Stage we shall have a most useful piece of legislation, a most useful piece of machinery that in the main is both badly desired and badly wanted by the public at large.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have said pretty well everything I wanted to say on the Bill, but there are two matters to which I should like to refer from the point of view of the tourist amenities of the Curragh.  In dealing with Donnelly's Hollow it would not be proper not to indicate some mention of the famous footprints of the famous boxer, on the one side, and the monument to treachery and tragedy on the other side of the Curragh, Gibbet's Rath, where, after '98, so many of our countrymen were massacred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be a complete misunderstanding in certain people's minds about the effect of this Bill.  The Bill is to provide for the continuance of the legal position which obtained before 1964 to enable those who have grazing rights on the Curragh to either graze those rights themselves or to let them to others for grazing.  That was the practice.  A suggestion has been made&mdash;deliberately made, I believe&mdash;in order to create misunderstanding that after this Bill is passed there will be no such thing as any rights being let.  That, of course, is nonsense.  Rights will be let, but there will be a difference: many people who are putting sheep on the Curragh at present without paying anything for that privilege will, as they had to do before 1964 and before the mistake was made in the Bill of that year, have to buy their rights at auction in the same way as they would take land for grazing in the ordinary way.  There is no <Col N="1159" /> reason whatsoever why those who want to graze sheep on the Curragh should not be quite satisfied and quite happy that, under this Bill, they will be able to do it quite legally by paying their just and fair share for that grazing, as they did, indeed, before 1964.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In the temporary absence of the Labour Deputy from Kildare I have the task of making a few comments on this Bill.  They will be neither as lengthy nor as informed as those of Deputy Sweetman.  Common land has been quite a headache over the years.  The Curragh seems to be dealt with in a different way from other types of common land.  I assume this Bill is designed to tie up a number of loose ends.  There are a few things in it I find rather peculiar and I should like the Minister to explain them when he comes to reply.</P>
      <P>One is the use of the word &ldquo;Maor&rdquo;. &ldquo;Maor&rdquo; has a certain connotation in this country and in other English speaking countries.  I cannot understand why it should not be possible to find another word about which there could be no confusion.  Foreigners might get the impression that the Curragh was a city with a &ldquo;Maor&rdquo; of its own, or even a number of them.  I know the idea is to prevent the unauthorised grazing of sheep.  It is a good idea.  It would appear as if the Wild West idea of chasing the other fellow's stock off the land and putting your own on the land seems to have persisted down in the Curragh right up to the present day.  You had not got anyone with a rope to hang them from a tree for doing so, so you have to do something else in order to ensure that it is done properly and legally.</P>
      <P>Subsection (5) of section 3 provides:</P>
      <P>At least three days before removing from the Lands sheep kept there in accordance with the Curragh of Kildare Act, 1870, and the Act of 1961, the owner of the sheep shall give notice of his intention to do so to the Maor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister interjected when Deputy Sweetman was speaking, and said it is all right, that it is written into the present bye-laws and works out all <Col N="1160" /> right.  Surely if we are writing something into law it should be possible to write in something that can be carried out.  The inclusion of a subsection such as this means that if sheep get sick or if, as happened here on a few occasions even in this century, a blizzard occurs which would destroy the sheep if they were not removed from the open plain, someone would have to give notice three days before. Otherwise the sheep would have to be left there until they were covered in the snow.  An otherwise good Bill can be spoiled by the inclusion of a meaningless section such as this.  The provision in relation to giving notice before they are put on is quite reasonable, but with regard to notice being given before they are taken off, in my opinion, the words &ldquo;in exceptional circumstances&rdquo; should be written in.</P>
    <P>There is another provision which I think is wrong.  It is the provision under which the Maor will have the right at any time to make the owner of the sheep get them together so that they can be counted and the brand checked. If the gentleman who was acting for the time being as Maor was an awkward individual and if, for any reason, he had a petty spleen, as could happen, against the sheep owner he could, in the middle of some busy time, go to the owner and say: &ldquo;I want to count your sheep.  I want to check on them.&rdquo; According to the law as laid down here, the owner must immediately drop everything else and carry out the instructions of the Maor. This is not workable.  Some provision should be made to avoid something like that happening.  Those are the only comments I have to make on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>It has taken the Bill quite some time to get this far particularly after the court case of 1965.  There is quite an amount I should like to see done on the Curragh.  It is a pity to see such a wide range of land being farmed in such a way as to grow the least possible amount of grass for good agricultural land.  It has not been manured for centuries I suppose, but certainly not in our lifetime.  It is just used for grazing sheep in the same way as sheep are grazed on the mountains of Wicklow or any other mountains in the <Col N="1161" /> country.  The land is now farmed in the same way as mountain land is farmed.  Very little grass is grown on the Curragh.  With modern agricultural methods that land could produce twice or three times the amount of grass it is producing at present, and we could have extra sheep as well.</P>
      <P>The Minister should seriously consider if he could create more claims. If he could do that, he could use the money to fertilise the Curragh every year and use whatever normal agricultural methods would be advisable. The Minister has jurisdiction over the Curragh but he does not get any revenue from it.  He has to pay four employees.  When in this age we need higher production it is sad to see the same type of farming that is carried out in the mountains being carried out on the Curragh.  The sheep are not fattened.  They are kept in store condition. Lambs are never fattened but are sold as store lambs.  In a matter of public ownership we should be setting a better example.  The county committee of agriculture put a few tons of lime in the Ballymany area some years ago.  It showed results but was only the start of what should be a manuring process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look at the land that has been fenced off we can see the amount of grass growing there where it has been fertilised, manured and landscaped. This makes you think that it should be done on the outside also.  Particularly on Derby day one notices the luxurious green grass growing there which is highly fertilised.  This shows what could be done in the Curragh.  The grass on the gallops and on the race track is exactly the same as it has been for the past 100 years.  I seriously consider that the Minister should set up a commission to investigate the possibility of creating more claims.  The present claims were created under the Curragh of Kildare Act, 1870, and consolidated in the Curragh of Kildare Act, 1968. The commission which was set up decided on a pattern of roughly one and a half sheep per statute acre.  The same number of sheep as were on that land in 1870 are on it today, but production on agricultural land in other parts of the country has gone up four <Col N="1162" /> or five times that amount.  Our exports of cattle in 1870 were quite small, something around 50,000.  As many as that are now exported in a month.  The land of Ireland is producing more as a result of progressive and good husbandry but here in the Curragh we are still standing where we were years ago. A State body should do more than stand stationary.  We have always thought that the State should set an example to the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>In the last Land Act the Minister for Lands left the way open for commonage to be divided up among the owners if they desired.  Here we are still consolidating to go back to that system. When the Land Act went through the ordinary common land on which a number of people lived was not being utilised to the full, or, perhaps I should say it was being used at a very low husbandry standard, so we decided that if the owners felt like doing so it could be divided up by themselves and added to their farms.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we would like to see any alteration in that regard but it just shows what is happening in other Departments which are setting headlines.  The Department of Defence is not setting a headline in the way the Curragh is managed.  Even in my short time in the constituency I have seen furze growing and spreading over quite an amount of land.  It is quite a long time since I was first in the Curragh.  It was when I was going to school but there was not nearly the amount of furze then, particularly on the hill near the Camp.  That furze has spread over the land and eliminated that part of it for grazing.  It shows what can happen when you let land go wild.  There is a great growth of furze which pushes out grazing there.</P>
    <P>I know we are getting money in regard to the claims but it is not being utilised to clear the land and leave it so that it can be grazed.  It is a pity that the road through the Curragh is the main arterial road to the South. It carries a very large proportion of our tourists who see this wide open space which is farmed so badly.  They see the furze growing abundantly on the section from the Camp and on towards Kildare.  You have it in other <Col N="1163" /> parts as well at the firing range and over at the Athgarvan side.  One of the golf courses there cleared part of this land and the good grazing there can be seen now.  This shows what could be done if the land was properly cleared.</P>
    <P>While I am on this subject I am reminded that there is a water scheme servicing the Curragh at present.  The Minister could take a few taps off that to provide troughs in different parts of the Curragh for the animals.  I am amazed that the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals have not approached the Department before now.  We often have long periods of drought such as at present when there is frost and snow in the Curragh and there is no drinking water.  There is need also for drinking water when the ewes and lambs come in April and May.  It is well known that a ewe must drink roughly a gallon of water, whether from grass or drinking water, every day.  I feel on humane grounds the Minister could seriously consider having some drinking water provided there for the animals.</P>
    <P>Drinking water has been provided on humane grounds in most places. In the past even on fair greens there was always some place where animals could drink.  There is grazing land for 6,212 sheep on the Curragh and something should be done to provide drinking water for them.  There is not even a well or anything like that at present. Now that the main water supply is going through it, it would be quite a simple operation to provide drinking troughs for the sheep.  There are several times when you have long periods of drought either in the winter or the summer and some provision should be made to provide drinking water for the sheep.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman last week mentioned that there was twice or three times the number of sheep being grazed on the Curragh at present but if he drove around the Curragh I would be surprised if he found even 6,000 sheep on it at the moment.  The present time is traditionally low in numbers.  It is from now on that the numbers are inclined to increase.  This <Col N="1164" /> happens particularly from April and May onwards as the grass comes on. I should just like to deny what Deputy Sweetman said because I drove around the Curragh during the last week and from a rough estimate of the number on it I would say there is nothing like the number of sheep he mentioned.</P>
    <P>I feel the Minister could consider increasing the number of claims and setting up a fund to buy claims from people who have them.  There are too many of them and this has been a tradition over the years.  It has been a tradition down through the years, with regard to those claim owners who keep sheep on the Curragh, that they set them out to other people and they in turn graze sheep on the Curragh. In such cases if people were interested in selling, the Department should have money there to buy them.  I should also like to see some system of regulating the setting of those claims on the Curragh.  It has been brought to my notice that there is discrimination regarding who can take claims and who cannot.  I was talking to a couple of men during the last week who have claims there.  We should consider people whose families for generations have been working with sheep and taking claims from the claim owners. A few years ago, they were told that under no circumstances would they be sold to them.  I think this type of discrimination is bad.  I feel that, in a Bill such as this, something should be included to stop the like of that and, if possible, that there would be a public auction of claims every year and let the highest bidder get the claim. It would be justified and people would be much happier.  With regard to the giving of notice to the head bailiff about putting sheep on and taking them back, there might be a point in certain cases concerning people taking them out quicker in special circumstances. I feel that it would be well if the Department were not too strict about the three days' notice and it were possible, in an emergency, for people to say to the head bailiff: &ldquo;We are taking them out now.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I feel very strongly about one item in the old regulations that would need to be considered seriously: it concerns the branding of ewes and lambs.  Under the old arrangement, they were to be branded in April or before 10th May.  If they are branded at that stage and shorn about a fortnight or three weeks later, then it would be completely against the Clean Wool Campaign of the Department of Agriculture.  If a brand is put on at such a late stage, I feel it will do quite an amount of harm to the wool and depreciate its sale value.  If the regulations could provide that a stamp would be applied immediately after shearing it would solve this problem and have no harmful effect on the wool. I do not believe the drafters of this Bill at any stage felt they would be going against the Department of Agriculture in the aim they have been trying to encourage in latter years.  If the mark could be applied after shearing, it would ease a lot of worries of people who have grazing on the Curragh. Then, in September-October, when they are no longer lambs and could be counted as sheep, the second branding would take place and would cover the whole period: those two brandings would easily cover the 12 months.  The brand the Department use is quite large.  It can be seen for quite a long distance.  Nobody would have any shadow of doubt as to what sheep they are.  I do not think the Department would like to down-grade the wool just for the sake of a few weeks.  I should like them to have a look at that point when the Bill comes up for Committee Stage, or later on.</P>

      <P>Yes, and although it is taken from the wash of the wool, which is the sheep's ordinary grease and waste of the wool, it will damage the wool&mdash;and particularly when you have such a large brand so that a big amount of the fleece is covered with it.  I always understood, myself, that it would not but I gather from inquiries I have made since this Bill was introduced that if the branding is done at a very late stage the wool will be affected.  In so far as that matter can be looked into and checked by the Department of Agriculture, I think it deserves consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>One point I would like the Minister to clear when he is replying is whether those claims were only agreed on a 99 year lease.  I think that they are there for all time, but it would be no harm to get it clear because there is a rumour going around that they are only there for a 99 or 100 year lease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The racehorse owners have permission to gallop on all portions of the Curragh.  I feel that it would be a good thing if a mutual agreement could be reached that they would gallop only inside the racecourse during wet weather.  They do quite a lot of damage to large portions of the Curragh in wet weather.  At other times nobody minds too much where they gallop but I have seen portions of the Curragh black from horses galloping on it in wet weather.  Normally we only have this very wet weather for a week or two in the late spring or early summer. If they could gallop only inside the racecourse at those times it would prevent a good deal of the trouble and would not damage the grazing for sheep too much.  There is an amount of grass inside the railings so there would be <Col N="1169" /> a good cushion and a good coverage there and it would take quite an amount of galloping to cut it up.  After the wet period they could go back again.</P>
    <P>The Racing Board have certainly done a good job in maintaining the Curragh and making it one of the finest racecourses in the world and an extremely good test for a racehorse. It probably accounts for much of the success that Irish racehorse owners have been having in England and the Continent in the last six or seven years. It has brought an untold number of tourists to the Curragh for Derby Day. I do not believe Hospitals Sweepstakes would have been able to put on a Derby if the Curragh had not been fenced in at the time.  It is recognised the world over as a real test of a horse. Quite a number of Derby winners have been beaten on the Curragh a month after Epsom.  Normally it is accepted that the Epsom Derby is a real test of a three-year old over a mile and a half and yet within a month a couple of them have been beaten on the Curragh.  It is recognised as possibly a finer test of a three-year old than the Epsom Derby.  This could never have been possible but for the closing in of the racecourse.  Years ago when the Derby was run if it was warm weather the whole course was like concrete and nobody likes chancing a very valuable horse on a course like that. I do not believe anybody would care to sponsor a race of the magnitude of the Derby if the racecourse were not fenced in and maintained as a racecourse should be.  It has made the name of Ireland and Irish horses well-known throughout the length and breadth of the world and the race has been shown by satellite in America.</P>
    <P>The Racing Board have carried out what was set out in the 1961 Bill. When the racecourse was fenced off they gave an undertaking that it would be kept in a proper manner as a racecourse should be.  They are doing all this and due recognition should be given to it.  They are making the Curragh racecourse one of the finest in the world.</P>
    <P>Regarding the four bailiffs or maors, they have no conciliation board to <Col N="1170" /> claim an increase in pay.  Most of the other civilian workers on the Curragh have got conciliation and I feel that, as these people are under the Department of Defence, they should come in with the rest of the civilian employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that, as they are a small group and only came under the Department of Defence when the Department took over the Curragh, they should be given consideration because they are on call 24 hours a day.</P>
      <P>One of the main troubles is the number of sheep that are killed on the main road going through the Curragh, particularly in the summertime.  I do not know whether it will be possible to fence that road and thus prevent cattle and sheep from coming out on the road.  When a sheep is killed, the bailiffs must go away and find somebody to remove the carcase.  Very few of these people can be on duty for 24 hours a day so if they are going off duty, they must find somebody to keep watch while they are away.  While going home at night, I have often seen sheep lying on that stretch of road outside Newbridge going towards Rathangan and I have had to get out of my car and move them out of the way before I could continue my journey. This happens, also, on quite a number of other roads.  The animals tend to lie on the dry ground.</P>
      <P>One section of the Curragh which is more or less out on its own is the Little Curragh.  I presume something will be done about leaving a way clear for people who have to move from one section to another there.  I believe that if a fence were put across the Curragh, it would put an end to the slaughter of sheep that takes place there.  There has been at least one fatal accident on that road caused by sheep. Anything that could be done to prevent such risks and to prevent the slaughter of the animals themselves would be very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am speaking on the Little Curragh, perhaps, the Minister might <Col N="1171" /> consider offering some of the funds, which may be made available to him, to the Land Commission so that the Land Commission could divide some of the land among local uneconomic holders who are to be found in that particular area.  There is quite a number of these uneconomic holders in that area and, perhaps, most of the plain could be utilised to bring their holdings up to an economic standard. Quite a number of those people are on the Milltown road as one goes towards Rathangan and there are others out towards Ballymany and towards Dunmurray.</P>
    <P>If the Curragh was properly manured and if the furze and scrub were cleared, it would be possible to have 10,000 or 12,000 sheep on it.  The Curragh not only provides grazing for sheep but it also serves as a recreation ground for a large number of people in the area. There is a pitch-and-putt course there as well as a golf course and when one looks at those courses and compares them with the rest of the plain, it is easy to see how much better they look. This is because of the fact that they are properly fertilised and generally looked after.  If the remainder of the Curragh were looked after in the same way a greatly increased number of sheep could be grazed there.  When we have got to the stage of bringing in a Bill of this kind, we should bring in also some of the other systems.</P>
    <P>Talking about the different roads going out of the Curragh, I am wondering if it would be possible to put cattle grids at various points there.  Driving through the Curragh one meets sheep maybe a mile or two away from the Curragh grazing on the side of the road, which is dangerous for the sheep.  I think the sheep owners would appreciate this facility, so that when they come along in the morning they do not have to travel miles along the road to find the sheep.  These grids are provided at the Phoenix Park at all the gates.  They keep stock from wandering into the park and the stock on the inside from coming out.  This could be usefully applied on the Curragh as a whole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1172" /> As long as the Army have been on the Curragh they have been a tremendous source of employment to the people in the surrounding area.  The Army use the Curragh as a training ground, with rifle ranges and so on. When armoured vehicles are being manoeuvred, could they not be kept to the worse section of the Curragh, and make sure that when these vehicles are crossing the roads they do not leave large lumps of clay&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy often swallowed a lot, too.  As I say, when the Army are doing manoeuvres I would ask the Minister to request them not to leave clay on the roads, as I have seen happening on a few occasions. To recap, I should like to see the Curragh farmed under normal husbandry and to see it manured, thereby getting a higher production from the land.  There should also be a fund there to buy up claims from people who wish to sell them.  These claims could then be made available for people who wish to put sheep out on the Curragh.  I should like if the Minister could consider some of those items when he is dealing with the Bill later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GodfreyTimmins" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this Bill because it has caused considerable worry to many farmers who have sheep grazing on the Curragh as distinct from people who own grazing rights on it.  One of the main reasons why these people are worried and upset about the position is that the Minister, in his opening statement, made no reference whatever to the people who have had traditional grazing rights on the Curragh for many generations.  Deputy Sweetman told us this evening that the position is now what it was prior to 1964 and that the people who have grazing rights on the Curragh can now rent these rights.  The people who were grazing sheep there were certainly of the opinion that the people who had the grazing rights had no right to rent them and for that reason, to my mind, their worry would certainly be fully justified because I think it is true to say that if the livelihood of any of us was affected in any way naturally we would resent it and do whatever we possibly could to redress that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to remember the position of these people who have been grazing sheep on the Curragh for generations.  I hope that at some stage in this Bill he will ensure that these people will understand their position more clearly and that certainly nothing that he intends in it will worsen their position in any way. The Minister made no reference whatever <Col N="1174" /> to these people in his opening statement.  Most of these people are farmers from West Wicklow and their only hope of survival, to my mind, is if they are allowed to continue grazing sheep on the Curragh.  The Minister should certainly insert into the Bill the provision that these people can have these rights.  I really do not think it is altogether reasonable to say that these rights should be auctioned.  I believe where people have had traditional rights for generations that they should not be auctioned every year.  The Minister and his Department can do something in that particular direction.</P>
    <P>The Department of Defence have other lands in other parts of the country. They have some land in Wicklow and the arrangement they have with the sheep-farmers with grazing rights on these lands is that they charge so much per head per month.  That would be a more reasonable way of dealing with the people who, all down the years, have had grazing rights on the Curragh.  My information is that at one particular stage these people paid 6/6d per head; then it was increased to 10/-; an attempt was made afterwards to increase it to £1.  It is true to say that for some years the people with sheep there made no money.  I do not believe that they will renege on paying what thy consider is a fair rent for their sheep.  A position may develop where certain people may not set their rights to the people who have been grazing there all down the years.  In that way I should like the Minister to ensure that these people's rights are protected, not alone from the point of view of getting them the rights but also of ensuring that they will not have to pay an exorbitant price for the rights. I should like to ask the Minister to look into that particular matter on Committee Stage at least.</P>
    <P>We all say we are interested in the small farmers.  Here is an opportunity for the Minister to indicate to a particular group of them his own interest in them.  If we had a situation in any part of the country where 30 or 40 people were being put out of employment there would certainly be a fuss kicked up about it.  If the rights of the farmers who graze sheep on the <Col N="1175" /> Curragh are not upheld and maintained we could have that type of situation there.  Most people there are small farmers who cannot exist on their farms as they stand and will have to be protected in so far as grazing rights are concerned.  I do not intend this as any criticism of the Minister but I hope by explaining these matters that he will understand my feelings and those of the farmers of West Wicklow who have had sheep grazed on the Curragh for generations.  I believe that the Minister is prepared to introduce the same type of system as he has in other lands owned by his Department and that would certainly meet the position and satisfy the people who are worried about the position at the moment.</P>
    <P>I should also like to endorse what the other Deputies have said in connection with improving the grazing on the Curragh.  Considerable improvements can be made there.  It certainly looks very bad for a Department of State not to do all they possibly can. Even if they could not do it themselves they could ask the Kildare Committee of Agriculture to improve these lands and in that way increase the number of sheep that could be maintained on the Curragh.  The Department encourage everyone to improve his own pastures and certainly they should do all that they possibly can to improve the pastures and the Curragh.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to say anything further at this stage but I would appeal to the Minister to try to ensure that the rights of the people and the farmers of West Wicklow who have been grazing sheep on the Curragh are protected under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not belong to the Constituency of Kildare but I am interested in the agricultural land of this country.  I have been looking at this very big acreage of land in Kildare known as the Curragh of Kildare.  I understand there are four and a half thousand acres under the Department of Defence there.  The Racing Board have portion of it.  It is very well used. The trainers' stables have portion of it and this is also very well used in the interests of the people and the economy of the country.  It is one of the finest <Col N="1176" /> racecourses in Europe and is used to a comparatively great extent.</P>
      <P>A large portion of the lands held by the State are not used for productive purposes.  One can pass through the Curragh southwards and find acres and acres of land covered by furze and scrub of all kinds.  I know of land in poorer parts of the country than Kildare being put up for auction during the past ten years which makes £30 to £40 per acre for tillage.  The Curragh land is good and dry and could be improved by manures sufficiently to grow excellent cereal crops. Therefore, is it not sad to find so much of it, in North Leinster, neglected because it happens to be in the hands of the Department of Defence?</P>
      <P>I am not blaming the Minister for Defence for this situation: it was handed to him in that way and, I have no doubt, he will hand it on to his successor.  Therefore, is it not left to some section of the community to step in and ask: &ldquo;Could this 2,000 acres of the Curragh which are not needed be fenced off and manured for grazing&rdquo;?  I do not know whether it could be let to Wicklowmen for sheep.  They have plenty of them and they would be prepared to pay any price you ask for the land provided it is manured and put into proper fertility.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Defence knows as much about livestock farming as any Deputy and I am quite sure he will agree that there are hundreds of acres on the far side of the plains of Kildare that could be put into proper fertility for grazing without much trouble.  We see in North Meath, in Cavan and on the Monaghan border, where I live, small farmers endeavouring to make a living out of wet land growing rushes and trying to improve their production by drainage grants.  They are not in the same position as Wicklow farmers, about whom Deputy Timmins spoke, who will have surplus stock to put on to common lands like the Curragh at small fees.  The small farmers to whom I am referring have to fend for themselves&mdash;to try to get grazing land at exorbitant prices.  What would some of these small farmers give for the right to graze on the commonage of Kildare?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> The point I wish to make is that the Department of Agriculture, who are instructing the farmers to get more from the land of Ireland in order to improve the economy of the country by increased exports of beef, should try to do something to improve at least half of the area of the Curragh by fertilisation. What would it mean to the State if that were done?</P>
    <P>I appeal, therefore, to the Minister for Defence, a practical man, to put the case before the Department of Agriculture and to ask them to do something about the wasteland of the Curragh.  I wish to remind him that since I came into the House I have seen the Phoenix Park improved.  I recall Deputy Clinton appealing to the Minister for Agriculture to put some lime and some other fertilisers on the Phoenix Park so that the people grazing stock on it could get a fair return. The Minister did not agree with him in the House but in the meantime, only weeks afterwards, I saw lime lorries spreading lime and tractors spreading manure on the Phoenix Park.  In the years since the early sixties, anybody who knows anything about livestock can see the improvement.  Again, I ask the Minister tonight to get the Department of Agriculture interested in the Curragh with a view to fertilising it properly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to intervene but it is obvious that the Minister for Defence will not have time to reply in the few minutes left before 10.30.  I rise solely to draw attention to the fact that the land in the Curragh has two purposes.  One is that it provides good grazing.  If we make it good pasturage, however, no longer will it provide good gallops and there is nothing as kind to a horse's tendons as an old pasture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a large area of the Curragh that could be developed in the way suggested here by Deputies.  It would make it very valuable for small farmers. It has always been a great surprise to me that no real effort has been made in this respect.  One had only to drive through it to see how unnecessarily poor the pasture is and any improvements proposed in the other aspect <Col N="1178" /> should be borne in mind because it is very important that it should be always a useful place for galloping horses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think when the Minister hears what I have to say he will appreciate that what I am saying <Col N="1179" /> to him is going to be more helpful to him than anything else in making his decision.  My only reason for raising this matter on the Adjournment was because as it is an involved case I saw no way of clearing it by way of question and answer at Question Time.  I am not making a charge against the Minister and in fact I hope to help the Minister in arriving at his decision by giving him some information which he may not already have.  I would appeal to the Minister to take the right view in this case.  The question related to exempted development and more specifically to exempted development for agricultural purposes.  The 1963 Planning and Development Act, in section 4, referred to &ldquo;development consisting of the use of any land for the purposes of agriculture or forestry, including afforestation, or development consisting of the use for any of those purposes of any building occupied together with land so used.&rdquo;&ldquo;Development consisting of the use of any land for purposes of agriculture.&rdquo;  Today, when we got a partial reply to this question, the Minister admitted that egg production would come within the description of &ldquo;agricultural purposes&rdquo;. The peculiar thing about this case is that initially this man did not apply for planning permission to the planning authority but he made application for a certificate of exemption.  He did this only for the reason that he needs this certificate if he is to get his grant from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  He needs either planning permission or the certificate of exemption in order to qualify.  He put in his application and the peculiar thing is that he did not get a reply to his application for exemption but he got a refusal of planning permission, planning permission that he never really sought.  The matter went to the Minister on appeal.  It was a case of something being appealed to the Minister that was never sought.  The Minister upheld the decision of the local authority in this case, namely he exempted on the grounds that there was no access to this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One might ask why was this field purchased for this purpose.  It was <Col N="1180" /> simply as a result of an advertisement in a newspaper.  This man is advanced in years and he has only one son.  He put an advertisement in the paper for a small area of agricultural land within six miles of Dublin.  The advertisement was answered and he bought this land to set up in business his married son who has three children.  These people have been in the poultry business for about 30 years.  They know their job and they know what is an economic unit and that this size of unit was necessary.  They complied with everything required by the Planning Act and with the Minister's regulations. It was never intended that regulations made by the Minister would completely override what was in fact embodied in the Planning Act, save in exceptional circumstances, circumstances which are stated in these regulations, which I looked up today, one of which is in regard to this question of access.</P>
    <P>Since the original application these people applied for access to this site and they got planning permission for this access.  Following that they did something which perhaps was wrong, they wrote to the Minister and said: &ldquo;Now that we have got this planned access will you reverse your decision?&rdquo; There is no machinery at the disposal of the Minister to reverse his own decision and this is something he could not do.  He replied more or less along those lines and that they could carry on with any exempted development in the future.  As I see it, there must be a fresh application because the circumstances have changed and it must be appealed to the Minister.  I was not aware that it had reached the stage that it was now a planning appeal before the Minister but since the Minister has made that known all I can do is appeal to him.  This is agricultural development and agricultural development generally should be exempted.  It qualifies because it is the right distance from the road and more than the minimum distance from the nearest house and consent for the development has been secured from the nearest resident who has no objection to it.  The question of a traffic hazard can arise under the regulations made <Col N="1181" /> by the Minister.  It is not necessary for me to quote these regulations because the Minister will have them at his fingertips.  All I will say is that on this particular road permission has been granted for many filling stations and garages to be erected and I submit that these stations are much more of a traffic hazard than these poultry houses could possibly be.  On that ground it should stand up on appeal to the Minister as not being a hazard in the same sense as a petrol station or a garage is.  Even since the original application was refused another petrol station has been permitted on the same road.</P>
    <P>As well as that, I would appeal to the Minister on other grounds.  This will be an export business.  These people have connections in England and they propose to export more than 50 per cent of their total production. As I said, it is a question of a man setting up his family, who were in England, and on the whole it is desirable development and should be permitted. I could go on talking about this matter but I do not think there <Col N="1182" /> is anything further that need be said except that when the Planning Bill was going through the House I sat through it and representations were made from many quarters, including all farming organisations, that they be allowed to have the freedom they always enjoyed to erect farm buildings whenever they wished to do so without any sort of restriction of the kind people normally meet with in the building of industry or of dwellinghouses generally.  We were given several assurances that this Bill would not apply to agricultural buildings and that we had nothing to be apprehensive about. For all those reasons I hope that the Minister will take a fresh look at this appeal and see that this is a very desirable development.</P>

      <P>On Wednesday last here during the discussion on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, Deputy L'Estrange made the following statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very interesting to listen to Deputy Corry's remarks about decency, honesty and honour and about people putting up arguments and voting in this House.  Deputy Corry is going out of the House and I want to remind him that he came in here and proposed amendments on the Cork Boundary Commission <Col N="1074" /> Bill and then went into the Lobby with Fianna Fáil to vote against his own amendments.</P>
    <P>That statement is untrue to the knowledge not alone of Deputy L'Estrange but to the knowledge of every Deputy in this House.  The facts are: this Bill was brought in from the Seanad on 11th March, 1965.  It was objected to by my esteemed colleague over there, Deputy Dillon, and myself and was adjourned until 23rd March.  In the meantime the Dáil dissolved and there was a general election.  On 6th May the Bill was again introduced into this House and was objected to by Deputy Burton and myself, and adjourned.  I moved the rejection of the Second Reading here on 26th May, 1965.  I was one of the tellers in the division that followed in which Deputy L'Estrange passed me there voting for my own amendment.  There was then a vote on when the Committee Stage would be taken and we were beaten on this by 50 votes to 12.  Deputy L'Estrange voted again and passed me there and I a teller.  The first amendment was taken on 10th June and was moved by me.  It was beaten by 55 votes to ten, and again Deputy L'Estrange passed me and I a teller in that division.  The second and third amendments were also beaten by practically the same number of votes.</P>
