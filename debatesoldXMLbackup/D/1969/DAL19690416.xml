    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether his Department have received complaints from telephone subscribers in the Dungarvan, County Waterford area relating to long delays in making contact with the local exchange as well as difficulty in getting connections with desired numbers; whether the complaints arise from (a) staff problems or (b) insufficient switchboard installation; and if he will have the complaints <Col N="1542" /> investigated and remedied at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>Complaints have been received recently from some subscribers in the Dungarvan area about delays in being answered by the exchange and delays to trunk calls.  Such delays occur at certain times because the switchboards and trunk circuits serving Dungarvan exchange are not now adequate for the increased volume of telephone traffic.  Work at present in progress on the installation of additional switchboards is expected to be completed within the next two weeks and further trunk circuits will be provided within the next three months, when the new underground co-axial trunk cable between Dungarvan and Waterford is brought into service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he proposes to take any steps to implement the Cooke-Sprague recommendation regarding the stabilisation of skim powder prices; and, if not, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Implementation of the recommendation mentioned could involve a subsidy on exports of skim milk powder and, as I indicated in reply to a question by the Deputy on 1st May last, any such subsidy would, in effect, represent a double subsidy on about one-fifth of the national output of milk.  It would benefit only the skim milk which is used for the manufacture of powder and would confer a special advantage on the sellers of that skim compared with sellers of skim for other purposes and the many farmers who use skim for livestock feeding.</P>
      <P>The skim milk powder manufacturers in conjunction with An Bord Bainne have formulated a scheme for the stabilisation of skim milk powder prices over a ten-year period.  I would have no objection to such a scheme provided it does not involve any losses for the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister enlighten the House as to how it can be true that the disease of protein deficiency <Col N="1543" /> can be endemic in Africa and the FAO seem to be wholly unable to bridge the gap between the need for powdered skim milk in protein poverty-stricken Africa and the surplus of that commodity which appears to exist now in all European countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no rational explanation except to say that we are not the only country experiencing difficulty in disposing of a relatively small surplus.  Other countries have had a very much larger surplus.  Attempts have been made to sell this surplus in all parts of the world and, where such attempts have been successful, the commodity has been sold at a very poor price indeed.  Much more would be available if the price were sufficient to induce the production of this commodity. While there may be a need for proteins there is no agency through which to obtain a price which would induce the sending of surplus supplies of skim powder milk to these unfortunate areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the FAO would be much better employed concerning themselves to bridge this gap between surplus and need in regard to this protein product rather than blathering about Malthusian theories in Rome?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>The booklet in question was compiled under my directions for the purpose of effectively refuting misstatements of fact which were published in pamphlets by the groups styling themselves as the Irish Association of Civil Liberty and the Citizens for Civil Liberties.  I take full responsibility.</P>
      <P>It would be contrary to established practice and it would not be in the public interest to allow individual civil servants who carry out the directions given to them to be identified and, thereby, intimidated in the discharge of their duties, as is clearly the purpose of this question.</P>
      <P>Copies of the booklet were distributed to Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, to the newspapers and to various organisations and persons who had shown an interest in the Bill or who asked for copies. The number of copies so far is 1,500 at a cost of £116 but the demand has been such that it may be necessary to print more.  As the type-set is retained, additional copies can be run-off at a nominal charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to September last year, there were very few prosecutions and, such as there were, attracted little publicity.  Since then 45 persons have been charged, some of them more than once, with offences related to drugs; 16 of these cases are still pending.  In all but one case so far dealt with, the charges were proved.  About half the offences were offences such as stealing drugs or peddling them: no inference could be drawn that the persons were themselves using drugs.</P>
      <P>As I have explained here, more than once, in reply to previous questions on the subject, the problem of drug-taking is primarily one for the Minister for Health.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, having regard to the number of industrialists inquiring as to the potential labour force in various parts of Kerry, he will arrange for the County Kerry Development Team to carry out a comprehensive manpower survey in the county.</P>

      <P>I am making arrangements to conduct surveys of the labour potential of certain areas on a pilot basis.  County Kerry has been selected as one of the areas to be surveyed because of the number of industrial and tourist promoters who have become interested in projects in Kerry.  The County Development Team has already conducted limited labour surveys in the county.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Kerry County Development Team, as well as the teams in the other western counties, was constituted in its present form in 1965.  The membership consists of the county manager, as chairman, the chairman of the county council, county agricultural officer, county education officer and county engineer.  Each team is provided by my Department with a full-time development officer who maintains close contact with all local and national organisations.</P>
      <P>Development has been proceeding at a rapid pace recently.  Since 1965 new industrial projects have been established in the county with a total employment potential of 650.  Proposals for the establishment of further industries are being examined and 13 small industry grant applications are at present being processed before being passed to the IDA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sub-committee of the team operates in the Gaeltacht and has been associated with the development of the Ballyferriter Co-operative Society which has received Gaeltacht Department building, management and machinery grants.  In addition, the team's <Col N="1548" /> activities in this area have resulted in hotel development and harbour improvements.</P>
    <P>Tourism is making satisfactory progress. New bedrooms in registered hotels and motels in the county have increased from 1,736 in 1965 to 2,609 now i.e. a 50 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>The team has been responsible, with the aid of a grant of £50,000 from the Special Regional Development Fund, for the development of an airstrip mid-way between Killarney and Tralee at Farranfore which should give a great boost to tourist and indeed industrial development in the county.  On the recommendation of the team assistance from the fund for a number of other projects has been promised.</P>
    <P>One of the main achievements of the Kerry team, as indeed the teams generally, has been to provide local expertise and leadership in the promotion of the economy of its county in conjunction with local voluntary bodies, private individuals and groups and State agencies.  I am satisfied that the team has made a notable contribution to development in Kerry and will continue to do so</P>

      <P>Payment of higher salaries on marriage in the Civil Service applies only to men who are in grades remunerated on a marriage differentiated basis.  In replacement of an earlier system under which all men were paid on the same footing, lower salaries are paid in these grades while they are unmarried.  This arrangement makes possible the payment to them, on marriage, of higher salaries and, in addition, children's allowances.  A claim for the payment of the appropriate married scale to reinstated widows who are serving in grades in which the scales are differentiated on a marriage basis is at present being dealt with under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>The Report &ldquo;Investment in Education&rdquo; published in 1965 estimated that the total number of full-time students in Irish universities would reach 19,000 by 1970, and about 21,000 by 1975.  The Commission on Higher Education in its Report published in 1967 estimated that the total of full-time university students would reach 23,000 by 1975.  I stated in the House on 11th July, 1968, that I anticipated an increase of the order of 6,000 in the total of university student numbers over the following six years. This would bring the total to about 22,000 by 1974.</P>

    <P>Projections beyond 1975 have not yet been made.  It will be for the Higher <Col N="1553" /> Education Authority in the first instance to make the further projections for which the question asks.</P>
    <P>I am aware that each of the university institutions has plans for the provision of additional facilities which should cater for the increased student numbers expected up to 1975.

      <P>Indeed, much of the philosophy behind the Deputy's supplementary question is my philosophy in regard to the new Institute of Higher Education in Limerick which is to have a system of higher education there that would be geared to the regional and national requirements of business and technology and administration and teacher-training.  It is precisely the same line of reasoning that impelled me and that impelled the Government to adopt this proposal which I am very glad to see is being welcomed by everybody concerned.</P>

      <P>I am not prepared to accept that our approach to and our reasoning in this matter are identical. I am concerned to ask the Minister, in view of the very large increase in student population, whether he would ask the Higher Education Authority to examine Faculties with a view to determining if there is any real academic discipline whereby their ultimate value to the students enrolled can be <Col N="1554" /> measured and, where such academic discipline does not exist, that the value of such so-called Faculties will be reviewed with a view to eliminating them if they are, in fact, making no material contribution to the students enrolled in them.</P>

      <P>My Question, No. 32, relates to people living in the 26 Counties, particularly people living in Donegal and working in the Six Counties.  I thank the Minister for saying that he is having the matter examined but I should like to point out that, while the Department are having it examined, the people are living under great strain.  Is there no way in which the Minister can step in and short-cut a lot of the legislation which his Department consider necessary?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Social Welfare Bill last year a very limited scheme was introduced to provide for cases where insured persons with an insurance record were remaining at home to take care of invalided parents.  That was the first time the scheme was attempted and we have gained a lot of information from it.  It is a complete innovation and we are very interested in the results.  It is easy to say that people are suffering as a result, but there was no such scheme in operation until a few months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is no excuse for delay.  So few people qualify for the <Col N="1562" /> scheme that it should be broadened more, much more than what the Minister envisages.  I am simply asking, in light of my experience as a Donegal Deputy, why people working in the Six Counties and who have to give up their employment to come home to look after aged or invalided fathers and mothers do not qualify, in view of the fact that they have not left the country and are still living at home?  They qualify in every other respect except that they have their insurance stamps put on in the North.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the good that would accrue from a scheme of that type, but we are examining the scheme and we have looked into it a lot already.  It would be difficult to segregate the type of person the Deputy is talking about in making the scheme apply generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has had under review for a considerable time the improvement of services aimed at the detection of cancer at the earliest possible stage.  This has been facilitated by the operation at 24 centres throughout the country of clinics attended by consultants from the Dublin and Cork cancer units.  It is open to any family doctor who wishes to have a consultant's opinion on possible early signs of cancer to refer his patient to one of these clinics.  Arrangements have been made for training additional consultants; two will complete training this year and a third next year.  This will make it possible to hold additional clinics.</P>
      <P>I am advised that family doctors generally are well aware of the early signs of the disease.  Many of them have attended symposia on this subject held at St. Luke's Hospital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.  As I pointed out in replying to the previous question there is a very wide range of clinical facilities throughout the country at present and certainly all family doctors are thoroughly alive to the fact of the increase in the various forms of cancer.  The House is aware that a great deal of publicity has been given to the fact of the increase in lung cancer in recent years and especially to the posibility and probability of a close connection between heavy cigarette-smoking and the incidence of lung cancer.  I can only hope that the public generally will avail of the opportunity to go to their family doctors frequently and, if so advised, to go for further examinations, or, indeed, whether so advised or not, to go for a general medical check-up from time to time, particularly the 30 to 40 age group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

The Department have issued pamphlets to schools and are preparing a film for distribution and showing in schools.  As I have said here so often and would like to repeat now, the real answer to this problem is to try to prevent young people from being foolish enough to start a very expensive habit. I say this with the Minister for Finance looking very hard at me because obviously there is a great deal of revenue involved.  All we can do is bring to the notice, particularly of <Col N="1569" /> parents and through them, of children, the deleterious effects of smoking.</P>

      <P>The terms under which land bonds are issued in payment of the purchase price of lands acquired by the Land Commission are laid down in the Land Bond Act, 1934, the Land Act, 1953, and the various Land Bond Orders thereunder.</P>
      <P>Bonds are guaranteed by the State as to payment of interest and ultimate redemption at par but such guarantee does not extend to day-to-day prices on the stock exchange and the Land Commission have no power to compensate owners for losses through fluctuation in the stock market.</P>
      <P>Land bonds created by the Land Bond Order, 1969, bear interest at the rate of 8 per cent per annum. Under section 26, Land Act, 1965, owners whose prices have been agreed in land bonds but whose lands have not yet vested in the Land Commission are eligible for payment in these bonds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to properties being purchased by the Land Commission on a voluntary basis for land bonds where possession is taken under an agreement for temporary letting pending clearance of the owner's title and final vesting of the lands.  It is a term of the letting agreement in these cases that the rent payable by the Land Commission to the owner will be paid in one sum on the date on which the bonds representing the purchase money <Col N="1575" /> are issued and placed to credit of the estate.  The lands cannot become vested in the Land Commission and the bonds placed to credit until the owner's title has been cleared, and there is in the arrangement, an incentive to owner to hasten lodgment of title.  It will be appreciated that promptness in the lodgment of documentary evidence of title and in discharging the examiner's rulings thereon is an important factor in determining when the lands can become vested in the Land Commission and the interest on the purchase money paid out.  Lettings of the type mentioned are usually of short duration and are generally arranged for the convenience of vendors. In exceptional cases where there are abnormal difficulties associated with the clearance of title, the Land Commission are disposed to consider favourably the payment of the rent under the letting agreement in instalments.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a point before that question is answered.  Does the Minister realise in connection with the Decimal Currency Bill, which, I think, most of us in the House realise must be introduced and implemented, that we in Ireland are in a most peculiar position in regard to the multiplicity of small businesses who depend for their systemisation on cash registers and that, unlike British or other industrial countries, the burden of reequipping cash registers will be positively appalling?  Cash registers constitute a capital charge on small business people who are already very hard pressed in the highly-competitive situation obtaining in the retail distributive trade throughout rural Ireland. In preparing this legislation, has the Minister had regard to that peculiar facet of our economic circumstances and has he not contemplated any provision, partial or entire, to meet it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Grants Acts and the Undeveloped Areas Acts fix an overall limit to the total amount of grants which may be paid for industrial development by An Foras Tionscal. Under the existing legislation the limit is £40 million.</P>
      <P>This limit will be reached in the very near future.  Total grant payments under the Acts up to 31st March, 1969, were £35,910,781 and expenditure on the provision of industrial estates had reached £2,060,030 by the same date.  This made a total expenditure by An Foras Tionscal up to the end of the last financial year of £37,970,811.</P>
      <P>The House is aware that comprehensive legislation to amend the Industrial Grant Acts and to amalgamate the Industrial Development Authority and An Foras Tionscal is being prepared.  I have to say that the preparation and drafting of this new measure has proved to be much more tedious than had been anticipated.  I can assure the House that it is being pressed forward as rapidly as possible, but there is little chance that it could be enacted before the present limit on grant expenditure, £40 million, is reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary that An Foras Tionscal should not be debarred from paying grants on commitments they have <Col N="1579" /> entered into under the existing legislation and consequently the enactment of this further interim measure raising the ceiling for total grant money from £40 million to £50 million becomes necessary.  This is the only purpose which this present short Bill has, and I recommend the Bill for the approval of the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This type of legislation making grants available for the whole country for the first time in 1956 was introduced by the late Deputy William Norton as Minister for Industry and Commerce, in the case of the Industrial Grants Act, and by Deputy Gerard Sweetman, as Minister for Finance, in the case of the Miscellaneous Provisions Act of that year, and was opposed by Fianna Fáil and particularly by Deputy Seán Lemass, and then adopted by them when they came into power.  In fact they have now reached the stage where £50 million will be spent within this financial year.  This means that another policy proposed by the Fine Gael Party while in the interParty Government and by Deputy Norton of the Labour Party has been adopted by Fianna Fáil, namely, that if all the countries of Europe decided to subsidise and to encourage by financial inducement the provision of jobs we would have to do it too, that the world is getting smaller, the Continent of Europe is becoming smaller as far as communication between countries is concerned and that if free trade moves slowly towards culmination we will have to take our place with other countries.  It is sad that the present Minister, who was not here and does not know the violent opposition of Deputy Seán Lemass at the time, with the full force of his Party behind him, should now find himself asking for more money for what was good parliamentary practice, good policy and necessary for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, let us not worry about the past.  This Party for the last seven or eight years, certainly for five years, have been advocating change in the application of these grants.  They were not alone because in the NIEC Report of 1962 it was the straight recommendation <Col N="1580" /> that the Government should indicate the growth areas.  The idea of indicating those growth areas would of course have meant that the local authorities and everybody else who had capital moneys to spend would know where to spend them, would know what roads to improve to a very high standard to take heavy traffic, would know what facilities to provide for workers, would know the housing requirements and could make their case for capital funds from the Local Loans Fund and could ask the Government, through their agencies, to carry out the necessary infra-structure work that should have been done.</P>
    <P>We now find ourselves in 1969 with the changes that were adumbrated from this side of the House announced in a press release from the present Minister some months ago and in the third paragraph of his speech he mentions the comprehensive legislation that is necessary.  He says it is taking far longer than he thought and it is much more tedious than he anticipated.  Be that as it may, in 1962 we had this report of the NIEC and nothing was done about it.  Nothing was done about it because the Government were more interested in political affairs.  They were more interested in the votes they would get in Leitrim, which I always use as an example, and what would happen if they decided that there should be an industrial estate and large-scale industrial development in, perhaps, Sligo.  Whatever the loss of votes one way or the other, it is necessary to accept the fact that it is better for an Irishman or an Irish woman to move from one county in Ireland to a neighbouring county or even to the far side of the country than it is for that person to move from his own county to Birmingham, London or Coventry. That would be fundamental in our national thinking and proper in the furtherance of our industrial future.</P>
    <P>In fact the spending of £50 million should have that thinking behind it as a prerequisite so that the spending of this money would not be clearly based on political advantage or disadvantage but on what was best for the country. As far as I can see, quite a bit of the comprehensive legislation mentioned by <Col N="1581" /> the Minister, if it follows the lines of his press release, is stolen from Fine Gael.  We have had for five years at our Ard Fheis a proposal for the institution of a small industries grant with different application throughout the country. There is, in addition, the objection we lodged to the fact that adaptation grants, when they were produced first by the Minister some years ago, did not take in supply industries that might perhaps, in free trade conditions find themselves completely wiped out by competition from abroad.  Unless the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement is changed, in 1975&mdash;I quote the words of the NIEC&mdash;72 per cent of our industrial products will be subject to the full blast of British competition. Therefore, the home market should be looked after as well as the export market.</P>
    <P>Adaptation grants were available only for export&mdash;orientated industries. We welcome the suggestion of moving on to re-equipment grants and find it a little gratifying, but only a little gratifying, that the Government and the Minister have adopted our suggestion after perhaps three, four or five years' waste. The failure of the Government to make the necessary changes over the years means that now, after they have been in office since 1957, they tell us that the legislation necessary for the changes in those grants is tedious and will take a long time to prepare, when we have been telling them over the last decade, certainly over the last six or seven years, that the changes were necessary. In fact, if the Minister's predecessors had been doing their job those changes would have been carried out one by one, so that we would now find ourselves on the eve of an election, or in an election year at any rate, with our industrial thinking or industrial legislation up to date and not, as we are, in the position of waiting for long and tedious legislation to be prepared after a run in Government of 12 years by Fianna Fáil.  This is entirely due to the failure of the Government to make these changes year by year.</P>
    <P>There is another factor which must be mentioned in relation to the expenditure of this huge sum of money.  We have had reports of international consultants <Col N="1582" /> such as Colin Buchanan and Partners in regard to where our industries should be sited.  These reports have not seen the light of day yet.  When I put down a question about certain areas in my constituency I was told here that this report was confidential and that it was improper of me to put down a question in relation to the development of industry in the north-eastern part of the State.  At that time, as chairman of Louth County Council I had had that report lying in my desk for nine months.  What are the Government doing?  Will they give us this information or is it, in fact, being deliberately withheld from us?  My view is that we should be a young State in a hurry, and the Minister should be a young man in a hurry.  The evidence is that such has not been the case.  The evidence is that we have been sitting down thinking of our votes and not heeding the recommendations of the NIEC.  We are heeding them now because we are approaching an election. But, no matter when this election is held, perhaps all that will happen before it is that the legislation will be passed.</P>
    <P>I am aware that from the Minister's press release that the people who applied for grants have been dealt with and they have letters to say that they are entitled to £X or £Y grant in relation to expenditure specified.  That is all they have.  The detailed legislation that will govern these grants has been delayed, wrongfully in my view, by the Government.  I welcome the fact that we are heading for an expenditure of £50 million but it would be wrong in relation to this expenditure not to say that there has been a wastage.  I deliberately refrain from mentioning individual cases but the Minister knows as well as I know that there has been a wastage of something in the order of well over £10 million.  I agree completely with those on the other side of the House who say in defence of this situation that we must take risks and that there must be failures.  I have no objection at all to the people in the Industrial Development Authority or in An Foras Tionscal or the Minister himself taking a calculated risk, because if we are to employ the number of people leaving the land and stem the <Col N="1583" /> tide of emigration we must take risks and we should be prepared to take them.  All I am saying is that, as opposed to what is said from the Government benches, the incidence of risks has been far too high.  I do not want to labour that point because it might perhaps tend to inhibit development of future industry here, but if the Minister wishes to have a list of industries which have failed he can have it from me privately or from most Deputies who have been here for the last 12 years.  The number of industries which have failed is far too high in relation to the expenditure on them.  I could visualise a ten per cent failure rate.</P>
    <P>I want to say also&mdash;again I will not mention individual cases but the Minister can have a list from me privately &mdash;that, where there have been failures and attempts were made to redeem the failure by getting somebody else into the industrial building that was left behind, very often the second inhabitant of the building was not nearly as important to the economy or to the local situation as the first.  It has been proved that, where there have been failures, employers of large-scale female labour have been induced to come in on the second occasion.</P>
    <P>It is my view that in many of these cases larger grants were given than commonsense would indicate as proper.  It would be wrong to mention individual cases but when one scans a list of grants and the amount of employment given&mdash;that is all you can do because most people who apply for these grants are pretty flamboyant when conjecturing about potential employment&mdash;one finds that in some instances industries have been set up in very expensive buildings, industries which will never have the same advantages for this country or for the local situation as the first inhabitant.</P>
    <P>In relation to the failures, I feel that the new departure&mdash;brought about perhaps by constant hammering for change from this side of the House&mdash; will bring about a better situation.  I feel, too, that there should be a change in relation to the method of payment of these grants.  If industries have to wait too long and are told that the <Col N="1584" /> legislation is not there but it may be there after six or nine months, you will find that some of them will move off to Northern Ireland or across the water to England.  This has happened far too often.  I can give the Minister an instance of a small industry in County Donegal with which I was involved myself.  A principal of the industry approached me.  He took up the matter with the county development team in Lifford.  The matter went on and on <i>ad nauseam</i> and he is now shifting the entire industry across to Scotland where he got action inside one month.  Therefore, the delay I have referred to in the passing of this legislation, at a time when other legislation was passed which had no interest for anybody except political interest, is something that has brought about the transfer of potential industries and, in this case, an existing industry from this country.</P>
    <P>If the Government are now voting £50 million, there is not the slightest objection from this side.  We were the first people to introduce this type of legislation.  The people on the far side of the House objected to it at that time and objected strongly, not only by their voices but by their votes.  We, on, this side, would not object to getting legislation through if it would mean that grants would be paid under the new system and that we would not have the situation I have indicated, namely, the losing of industries to other countries when they should be snapped up by what must be for many years to come a young State in a hurry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We in the Labour Party have no objection at all to an increase in the amount for the payment of grants up to £50 million, as proposed in the Bill.  However, I should like to say this: When grants are being given to industrialists we often find that people come along and apparently persuade those in authority that the employment potential is very high.  It should be a relatively easy matter for experts to estimate the employment potential.  For that reason I can never understand why an industrialist can say that he proposes to employ over a period of years 650 people and eventually finishes up with 55 and the State <Col N="1585" /> and everybody else seem to be perfectly satisfied.  This is the sort of thing which makes people a little bit chary about grants being paid.</P>
      <P>I do not go the whole way with Deputy Donegan in regard to the question of losses.  I would not agree that the amount of losses is as big as he says.  As a matter of fact, I think a certain amount of risk must be taken. If these grants are given only to those who can guarantee gilt-edged security, I am afraid the number of people coming here to start industries will drop dramatically.</P>
      <P>There are two reasons for the giving of these grants.  One is&mdash;and I think it is the most important one&mdash;the question of employment.  The second, of course, is manufacturing goods for export.  There is a third, which is manufacturing goods, which are not now manufactured, for the home market. That is not being pursued as far as it might be.  Possibly the small industrial grants may improve the position there.</P>
      <P>I also believe, and I have stated this time and time again in this House, that the use of the produce of the land for manufacturing purposes is not developed sufficiently.  I believe we are slipping up badly there.  Even though there have been recent developments as, for instance, in the processing of fruit and vegetables, I still think we are a long way behind.  Perhaps the Minister would try to encourage more of this type of industry?  It seems ridiculous that when one goes into a store one finds that perhaps 40 or 50 per cent of the processed fruit and vegetables on sale are imported.  That does not make sense.  We should be able to do more in that field.</P>
      <P>Hindsight is a wonderful thing and I was delighted to hear Deputy Donegan talking about the dangers likely to arise as a result of the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain.  We saw them at the time and we expressed our opinion by voting against the Bill which was supported by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Be accurate.  Do not put words in my mouth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always very careful, as Deputy Donegan knows, to <Col N="1586" /> put the right words in the right place. We greatly fear that the Free Trade Area Agreement will have very dramatic effects on employment if we continue to operate it as we have been doing and I mean by that, the further ten per cent reduction on 1st July.  If that comes off, we will need a lot more than this extra £10 million which is being made available here to try to make up for the losses in employment which will occur.</P>
      <P>We have all the goodwill in the world for the Minister and his Department on this question of trying to have as much industrial employment as possible. Some of my colleagues and, indeed, people on all sides of the House may disagree with my view on the siting of industrial undertakings in inaccessible places which affects the cost of the haulage of the raw materials, in places where the number of people available for employment is not sufficient.  When an artificial attempt is made to create an industrial estate, for want of a better word, where there are neither raw materials, roads nor workers available, this is not in the best interests of industry.</P>
      <P>I know that a certain amount of employment must be provided, and a certain effort must be made to try to provide employment in areas where employment is very badly needed, but where there is a scarcity of labour it is rather foolish to try to set up large-scale industries in the hope that people can be brought in from outside to work there.  A few years ago, with the exception of the Labour Party, everybody in this House was mooning about the right of the people in the EEC to a free exchange of men, money and materials.  I heard a Minister saying there was nothing wrong with the idea of people who were in the EEC, as they hoped we would be finding employment somewhere within the EEC and, if that was in Berlin or Paris or Luxembourg or Brussels, he did not see any difference so long as they found employment.  My colleagues and I in the Labour Party see a difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not think people should be treated as chattels and made to move not only from one area to another <Col N="1587" /> but from one country to another.  I agree that in this country it is a smaller matter to move someone from Dublin to Connemara or from Navan to Mullingar or Donegal or West Cork. That is a relatively small matter compared with what was considered as being feasible or the right thing to do in the EEC proposals.  The Minister is aware that the EEC countries now realise that the creation of an artificial set-up of industries in areas far away from cities and towns has not worked out well.  Industries which seemed to be thriving&mdash;and people were brought out from cities and towns to work in country districts&mdash;after a short time fell down because the young people were not prepared to stay, and they went back to the cities and towns.  I am not saying that grants should be given only to industries which are centred in cities and towns.  What I am saying is that the Minister and his officials should be very careful when giving these grants to ensure that the industry is placed where it has a chance of success.</P>
    <P>We have no objection to the increase. We feel that a much bigger effort is required if we are ever to attain the objective to which we are all supposed to be devoted, that is, full employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We should be concerned with the end product of this question.  I should like the Minister to give the figures of those who have secured employment in the past.  Like Deputy Donegan, I welcome the attitude of Fianna Fáil in reinforcing this measure which was brought in by this side of the House when we were in Government.  It is about time they saw the light.  I should like to say to the Minister that we will have a visitor to our city for the opening of an industrial estate next Friday.  I was at the opening of a big industry within a stone's throw across the road from this estate.  The Minister should look at that.  It was opened with a flourish. Deputy Seán Lemass was Taoiseach at the time and he was there.  All the dignitaries in the country were there. It was a big occasion and there was a lot of big talk.  We were all impressed when we heard 700 people were to be <Col N="1588" /> employed in that factory.  I want to warn the Minister against making this sort of promise to the people because this factory will be a warning to him. It is right across the road.  It is a fine shell.  It is the Potez industry.</P>
      <P>In regard to the allocation of these grants it is strange to see the faces of those who benefit either in grants or somewhere along the line.  I have seen gentlemen who appeared at by-elections all over the country for Fianna Fáil and it is rather strange to see those faces amongst those who are benefiting when the grants are being allocated. For God's sake cut out this political palm-greasing.  That is what it amounts to.</P>

      <P>I shall keep to the Bill.  All of us are anxious to see industry prosper and the only reason why I referred to the matter was that the implication was that, because a man is a supporter of Fianna Fáil, he gets a grant.  That is completely untrue.  Every case is studied on its merits.  The economy of this country was at a low ebb some years ago.  It is most desirable that we should put any money we can into industry, industry which will provide employment for our own people and keep our balance of payments healthy.  This legislation is designed to increase industrial grants. <Col N="1594" /> I am surprised at Deputy Coogan saying what he did because my experience is the opposite; I have had constituents coming to me who were interested in establishing industries in the constituency. I brought them along to see the Minister.  What their politics were was a matter of no concern to me.  As far as we are concerned in Fianna Fáil, we put the national interest before Party interest.  Every person is entitled to subscribe to whatever political Party he likes.  How many industrialists subscribe to the three Parties?  No person's name should be mentioned in this House.  It is a most uncharitable thing to do because the bearer of the name cannot defend himself here.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister is in a position to increase the grants.  This will be very much appreciated. Some industries may prove to be failures but, because a few fail, there is no reason to imply that a great many others will fail also.  If we had not been prepared to take risks we could never have had the magnificent industrial revival that we have had under Fianna Fáil.  It is no part of the policy of <Col N="1595" /> Fianna Fáil to help millionaires to establish industries.  I hope that the industrial revival will continue until such time as all our people find employment in their own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has not yet found it possible to introduce the comprehensive legislation he promised, particularly that part of it dealing with the amalgamation of the IDA and An Foras Tionscal.  This is the second occasion within six weeks, or so, on which the Dáil has had a special Bill submitted to it by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and only a short time before Easter we had a discussion on a Supplementary Estimate for Industry and Commerce.  The promised comprehensive legislation has been on the stocks for a long time.  I cannot understand the difficulty in formulating comprehensive legislation. Perhaps the Minister would explain, when he comes to reply, the reason for the delay.  There is need for a complete re-organisation of the whole approach to industrial development.  This is the third time in the past 12 months on which the Minister has stated that this new legislation is being prepared.  The delay is creating difficulties for those involved in negotiations for the establishment of new industries because the tendency is to postpone negotiations in the hope that the new legislation will result in bigger and better grants.  There is a good deal of confusion.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons why the Minister has had to bring in this Bill is that, as he said himself, the expenditure in relation to the provision of industrial estates will reach £2,060,000 and legislation is needed to extend the limit for financial assistance.  The proposed new legislation is vitally important.  It is, indeed, a matter of extreme urgency now in relation to the development of industrial estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to the matter of industrial estates only four or five weeks ago in the debate on the Supplementary Estimate. Within the past week, I read in a newspaper that the Minister informed some local development association that it is intended to provide grants for <Col N="1596" /> the building of advance factories.  If this is so, what will be the position of private individuals and development companies who have already committed themselves to the building of advance factories?  Is it a fact that such grants will be available?  Is the statement I read in that connection in a newspaper a week ago correct?  If such grants will be introduced, when will they become effective and will people who have already built advance factories be eligible for these grants?</P>
    <P>I regret very much that it has not been possible to have a more comprehensive and extensive debate on this vitally important matter of industrial development.  This Bill is purely an amending Bill to enable the Minister to increase by £10 million the limit available to An Foras Tionscal for payment of industrial grants.  I have no objection to the granting of this extra £10 million.  This Bill is absolutely necessary because the Minister, as yet, has not been able to introduce a new Bill.  I think nobody here has any objection to the expenditure of money to create employment in this country.</P>
    <P>By and large, despite criticisms and despite disappointments&mdash;and anybody engaged in industrial development will have experienced frustration, delay, disappointment and so on&mdash;An Foras Tionscal and the IDA have been doing an excellent job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I state that objectively; it is based on my experience of dealing with An Foras Tionscal and its officials.  At all times I have met with the greatest co-operation from them.  Nevertheless, we must not lose sight of the fact that mistakes have been made and that perhaps unwise decisions have been made in some cases.  As the Department of Industry and Commerce have reviewed the whole approach to industrial development, the whole machinery of grants, and so on, it is now high time that we formulated new ideas and new regulations for industrial development.  It is important to turn to good account the experience gained by the IDA and An Foras <Col N="1597" /> Tionscal in industrial development, in the allocation of grants, and so on, and to benefit by any mistakes which may have been made and which should have been examined by now.  In short, new ways of overcoming past difficulties should by now have been devised.</P>
      <P>In the course of debates during the past year on industrial development criticisms have been made that the financial assistance available to Irish industrialists has not been adequate. Certainly, statements have been made that Irish industrialists are not getting the same inducement or the same encouragement as foreign industrialists. This has not been my experience.  I have tried to assist Irish industrialists as well as foreign industrialists and the same co-operation and help have been available from the IDA.</P>
      <P>My advice was recently sought by two different people in manufacturing business in a small way who found it extremely difficult to get the assistance they felt would help them to put their small industries into proper shape.  A defect I have come across in a couple of instances in relation to incentives and to the assistance which is available concerns the availability of working capital for industrial development. About three weeks ago, a small manufacturing outfit in Limerick which had secured a substantial export order sought my help.  Because they had not the necessary working capital to stock up the raw materials, to employ extra workers and to gear themselves, there was great danger that they could not fill that export order.  Through contact with an independent financial institution, I was fortunate enough to be able to persuade that institution to grant the necessary financial assistance.  Particularly in relation to small industries, there is need for financial assistance other than grants and I would ask the Minister to bear in mind the question of working capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the problem of providing working capital to meet perhaps temporary difficulties or to fill certain orders, I might mention, in relation to home industries or to traditional Irish industries, a very serious and distressing matter.  I come from a region <Col N="1598" /> where, in recent years, a number of old-established industries have been forced to close down.  The Shannon Industrial Estate is a modern development with 20, or so, new industries. We have three instances where old, fairly substantial major industries have closed down.  There was the closure of one of our bacon factories.  There was the closure of a tannery in Limerick. At Sixmilebridge, County Clare, there was a very substantial woollen mills at one stage.  I visited this place last Sunday and it was the saddest sight I ever saw.  It is a building extending over 100,000 square feet within six miles of the Shannon industrial zone and it is in a semi-derelict condition, having been allowed to lie idle for the past 12 years.</P>
    <P>The time has come when there should be some section of the Industrial Development Authority, perhaps consisting of two or three experts, which could be called on when a traditional industry is getting into difficulties. In other words, there should be a rescue team.  Certainly, in my opinion two of those concerns in the Limerick region could have been rescued and put on their feet if proper assistance had been available in time.  I know that this Bill does not allow us to go into detail, but I felt that I should cover these points.  I am very disappointed that it has not been possible to introduce the new legislation.  There has been criticism all over the country about the delay in introducing it and there has been considerable confusion caused in the minds of potential industrialists. Perhaps the Minister might elaborate on this matter.</P>

      <P>I simply want to endorse the support given by Deputy Tully of this Party to these proposals to make available sufficient money to attract industry here or to promote it either from outside or internally.  I should like to ask the Minister if some of this money will go to finance small industries. About 12 months ago I had to get in touch with the Minister's Office about a potential small industry which would have been developed by a father and his two sons and the reply I received was that, while it was conceive <Col N="1599" /> templated that the scheme would be extended to cover small industries like that, at the time only a pilot scheme was in operation.  Would the Minister indicate if the scheme now extends to the whole country and if further applications can be made with the expectation of getting financial assistance either for extending existing small industries or starting new industries suitable for small areas of development, areas which could not benefit from the industrial estates but which nevertheless could give worthwhile employment in towns and villages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the debate one is provoked into making some remarks. Those Deputies whom I have heard speaking are among the blessed as far as their parts of the country are concerned.  Deputy Coogan comes from Galway where an industrial estate has been sponsored and Deputy T. O'Donnell represents the Limerick area into which a vast amount of money has been poured by the Fianna Fáil Government. Deputy Kyne represents Waterford where the same applies.  I represent a constituency of a different nature, one which is benefiting to some extent as a result of the industrial policy of the Government but not to the same extent as the areas which those Deputies represent.  It was not my intention to speak on this Bill but listening to one of the speakers one would feel that a supporter of the Government should not demand any help from the Government to establish an industry in the West of Ireland.  It would not be fair to say that this attitude was followed by the other speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One wonders how serious a person is in making such statements.  What was the statement that was made?  The statement was made that a person helped the Fianna Fáil Party in the various by-elections and this was followed by a statement that he got a grant from the Government.  He was challenged and was asked was this wrong.  He persisted and pointed out that the statements he made were on record.  If the person concerned was not entitled to the grant I have no doubt that this allegation would be <Col N="1600" /> made in the House and put in black and white in the Official Report. This was not done.  It was just left blank.  This is a most unfair way to approach this question.  After all, a considerable number of people in the West of Ireland support this Government and surely they are not to be precluded from grants or intimidated from seeking grants just because they help our Party?  Perhaps in the 1980's the other Party may be in power and their supporters may be in the same position.  They should not be precluded from getting grants just because they support the Government of the time. I heard the exchanges and the challenge has remained unanswered.  There has been no allegation made that this man was not entitled to what he got. As Deputy Burke said, this House should serve a different purpose.</P>
    <P>I have already stated that the area which I represent has little industry, although we are making some progress. We can never make any real progress in this area, or in particular parts of it, unless the problem is approached from a social rather than an economic viewpoint.  Perhaps I am asking too much from the resources of this State in saying this.  The logical approach should be, in regard to a lot of our problems, to look at the map of the West of Ireland and see the area which is most gravely depopulated. Then the planners should say to themselves: &ldquo;Here is an area in which we must keep people.&rdquo;  They should then set about constructing an industrial estate of some kind to solve the problem.</P>
    <P>I have very little training in these matters and my reading is limited for a number of reasons, but I feel that somebody sometime should decide to start a pilot scheme along these lines. They should go into the vocational schools and the post-primary schools and start to train a group of pupils over a period of years, and try to convince them that at the end of three or four years, as a result of specialised training, there will be a factory which will give them employment.  At first this may not show a profit but it will keep the population there.  They will acquire skills and, one hopes, the <Col N="1601" /> market will have been got for their products long before the factory is opened.  Gradually, in this way you will build up in these areas a certain amount of industry to retain the population.</P>
    <P>I accept that all industries cannot be social efforts but, at the same time, I think I am as justified in making this demand on the State on behalf of my constituents and other places in the West of Ireland as are others who have spoken here from areas enjoying many natural advantages and resources.  I believe that, if the present Minister gets any encouragement and help along those lines, he will be the one who would hope to adopt such a policy as this.  In the near future I hope we shall see some pilot effort along those lines&mdash;the education of the workers and the provision of the factories&mdash;and in this way provide an answer to the problems of the north-west of Ireland which I represent and Deputy O'Hara opposite represents.  If you look at the population map you will see the black area stretching across that portion of Ireland.  I think this is one solution that should be put forward for this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I gladly support the viewpoint of Deputy Dr. Gibbons.  He represents the Leitrim area.  As a Deputy from Mayo I thoroughly agree that a special case can be made for counties like Mayo and Leitrim, where little or nothing has been spent out of sums voted in this House.  I gladly support the present measure despite the fact that we in Mayo stand to gain&mdash;I say this from my past experience&mdash;very little from moneys voted by the House for industrial development and expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently addressed a Parliamentary Question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, which was answered by another Minister, asking him if he was aware of the urgent need for industrialisation in towns like Ballina, Killalla, Swinford, Charlestown, Ballyhaunis and others.  There is urgent need for such industrialisation, as is borne out by the fact referred to by Deputy Dr. Gibbons that we have had depopulation in recent times and also <Col N="1602" /> in the past.  Mayo lost a Deputy some years ago because of depopulation. More recently, they lost another Deputy, reducing their representation in Dáil Éireann to six, whereas it was usually eight and, I think, at one time, nine.  Consequently it is absolutely necessary to industrialise our towns if we are to retain people in the West of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have had experience of an industry being established in my home town of Foxford 70 or 80 years ago without any State assistance.  I think a nominal sum was paid by the old Congested Districts Board to start it.  It has made progress all through the years, even during the period when there was no protection of Irish industry.  The principal reason for that was that it produced a good article.  The products got into the export field and made steady progress.  It now employs something like 200 people in a small town with a population of less than 1,000.  That is a very creditable record.  This was done by private enterprise.  If concerns like Providence Woollen Mills and others that were engaged in industry before the establishment of our own Government and Parliament can be a success in such areas as Foxford it should be within the competence of the Government today, with all their resources, to do likewise.</P>
    <P>I have great confidence in the present Minister for whom I have great respect.  He is a man of ability and integrity, anxious to help in any way possible.  He has shown his concern by going down to Ballina and meeting members of his Party who, no doubt, pointed out the problems as I have done.  But the fact remains that we are still in the doldrums as regards industrial development.  It is true that small industries have started, employing 15, 20 or 30 people.  One can count them on the fingers of one hand.  I sincerely hope that, if in time we enter a free trade area, these industries will continue to expand.  Unlike Deputy Tully I have the greatest confidence in going into Europe and into competition with all comers.  I believe we can do it if we pull ourselves together.  One thing that always bedevilled us in this country was the fact that we were on <Col N="1603" /> the doorstep of one of the greatest industrial countries in the world with world-wide markets and experience and skill and many raw materials. They also had many of their markets in countries under their heel and had the great advantage of being able to export to them.  We were up against it from the beginning in trying to industrialise.</P>
    <P>We have made some progress.  I agree it is easy to see that progress.  I agree with Deputy O'Donnell of Limerick when he said progress had been made in the Limerick area.  I have seen it there and I see it in the Dublin area.  I have been a long time coming to the city and I can now see on the way from Lucan, or even from Kilcock into Dublin, industrial estate after industrial estate.  This is in a part of the country where I think it is not needed to anything like the same degree as it is needed in the West and in Mayo particularly.  Foxford has stability because of the industry there. It is possible to expand our towns.  I regret that a town like Ballina with a population of 5,000 or 6,000 seems not to be making the same progress as has been made in other towns of smaller population.</P>
    <P>The Government will need a crash programme to solve our problems, as pointed out by Deputy Dr. Gibbons, and nothing less will be sufficient.  If the methods that have been tried have failed to a large extent and are not capable of fulfilling our purpose, we must resort to other measures.  It is up to the Minister and the Government of the day, no matter what Government it may be, to take some action.  We must not continue to travel along the road that we have been following for such a long time.</P>
    <P>Time and again I have heard talk of an industry being started in some town or other.  For instance, it was proposed to start an industry in Charlestown. This proposal had the support of everybody including the local county council.  It had the goodwill of everybody but so far that industry has not started.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the new legislation is not before the House.  If it were, we <Col N="1604" /> would have an opportunity of passing judgment on it and it is my opinion that when it does come before us it will be subject to a certain amount of suspicion.  In all probability, we are facing a general election and people become very suspicious of anything that is proposed at a time like this and I suppose we cannot really blame them.  I do not think that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will bring in red herrings. He is not the type of man to do that; he would not be capable of doing it. However, I hope that the new legislation will be brought in here at an early date and I sincerely hope that it will bring some benefit to the people whom I am privileged to represent in part of Mayo.  There is an urgent need for it.  A change is long overdue.</P>
    <P>The method we have used down through the years has failed.  There is proof of that in the decline in population which is evident from the number of closed homes to be found all over the place.  It is a tragic thing that, although we have extended rural electrification to nearly every part of the country and have installed telephones all over the place, in so many places houses are now closed up.  The ESB poles have been taken up.  There are more than 500 of them dumped in my yard awaiting return to Swinford.  I agreed to allow the ESB to leave them there.</P>
    <P>With all this talk of new Bills and new legislation and talk of increased sums being voted for industrial expansion, it is just too bad that I should have this sad story to tell in this house. I do not grudge places like Limerick, Cork, Waterford or any other place anything that is given to them but I am pleading with the Minister, who, I believe, is very sincere and honest in his approach to his work and who does not make political cracks across the floor of the House, to give us a crash programme in the West of Ireland so that we can pull the situation out of the fire because it is in the fire at the moment.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will do something about it.</P>

I should like to confirm that the moneys being made available under this Bill will include money for the small industries programme and I should like to tell Deputy Kyne that, as I announced in the House some time ago, the small industries programme has been extended from 1st of this month to the whole country with the exception of Dublin.  It will apply to Dublin as and from 1st September next.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell raised a few points on which I should like to comment. He talked about a rescue team for traditional Irish industries.  In fact, an apparatus is in process of being formed which might be described as a rescue team for industries, not only Irish industries, but any industries which are getting into difficulties.  I am not in a position to give details of this at the moment and, indeed, it might not be appropriate to do so on this Bill but I wish to say that this is under way at present and details will be announced in due course.  I should like to make clear, however, that even the existence of such an apparatus cannot, of course, ensure that no industry will go bankrupt because this will happen if the industry basically is not viable.  The object is to try to find out in time the industries which are going wrong and to put them on a viable basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell also raised the point about advance factories.  I made it clear when announcing the details of the new legislation and again in the House on at least one occasion that the new legislation will provide that the IDA would be able to provide advance factories in any part of the country.  Under the existing legislation, An Foras Tionscal can provide only in an industrial estate but it is proposed in the new legislation to allow for the building of advance factories in any part of the country.  Of course, it is not intended to provide an advance factory in an area where there is a factory in existence not is it intended to dot the country with white elephants <Col N="1606" /> of advance factories.  I see no possibility of grants being made retrospectively available in respect of these except in the case of an industry which goes into a factory already built.  In such a case the industry will obtain a grant in relation to its expenditure on purchasing that factory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In the new proposals to make grants available is it the developer who will get the grant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a provision at the moment for the developer to get a grant after an industry has taken up an advance factory but not before. What is intended is to authorise the IDA, which will be the amalgamated body, to build advance factories in any part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell also complained as did other Deputies about the delay in bringing forward this legislation.  As I said when introducing this Bill, I am sorry that we have not got the legislation but the preparation of it has proved to be a more difficult task than we had anticipated.  The legislation is at present being drafted and will be brought forward just as fast as we can bring it forward but I can say that the delay has not been due to anything other than unanticipated difficulty in the preparation of it.  It is rather complex and indeed has to be tied in with other legislation relating to the Shannon Industrial Estate also. The House will see, I think, when it is brought forward that it is somewhat complex legislation but I want to assure the House it will be brought in just as fast as it is possible to do so. However, I should say I have no evidence available that the absence of the legislation has led to any projects which might have been brought forward being held back.  I have no evidence of that at all.  Indeed, in so far as the reorganisation of the IDA, An Foras Tionscal and so on, is concerned this is being proceeded with in so far as it can be done under existing legislation and a great deal of the reorganisation, preparation and recruitment, as Deputies have seen, has been going on near the organisation to grow under this legislation.  As I say <Col N="1607" /> I have no evidence that projects are being held up because of the absence of the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole object of it was to make it certain.  The original arrangement in which there is flexibility is at the top level for big important industries.  There is room for negotiation by the IDA of a package deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I mean, the package deal.  If we could have more specific information in advance of the legislation in relation to that it would help.  There is a bit of confusion in regard to the package deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing is that even when the legislation is enacted the package deal will still be a matter for negotiation and it will not be possible to say to people then: &ldquo;This is the position.&rdquo;  The whole object is to make it flexible at that level.  Below that level it will be quite certain. Those limits have been announced. Deputy Donegan said in relation to this that there was a small industry in Donegal which he was aware, he said, was going across to Scotland bag and baggage because of the absence of the legislation.</P>

I can assure the Deputy that in the preparation of those schemes I was not aware of any such proposals from the Fine Gael Party.  As I say, I am not denying either that there may be some substance in what he is saying but at any rate I can take some pleasure in the fact that he said this because no doubt when the legislation comes forward it will get a warm welcome and a speedy passage from the Fine Gael Party.</P>

I want to point out that while it is true the Fianna Fáil Party opposed this legislation originally it is untrue to say it opposed it just in principle.  What was said was that we did not think that the legislation at the time originally introduced was geared to what was required.  When we came in we amended it and made it work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Buchanan Report Deputy Donegan said something here today which he said on another occasion in the House, that he had a copy of the Buchanan Report on his desk as Chairman of the Louth County Council for nine months.  I think I told him on the occasion when he said it before, and I am telling him again now, that if he had it he had it long before I saw it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know where or in what capacity he had it, whether he saw some kind of draft or something like this.  I think I got a copy of that report fairly soon after it was completed and I certainly have not had it anything like nine months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy must be referring to a draft in relation to one particular region.  Is that what he is talking about?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I made it clear at all times that it was not intended, apart from the Limerick and North Tipperary region, to deal with the country piecemeal.  The reason why we dealt with Limerick and North Tipperary, as I have already made clear, was that we had already everything done there and the organisation was geared to it.  The Buchanan Report as such deals with the whole of the State.  It is with the Government at the moment.  There is something I would like to make <Col N="1610" /> clear.  I think there are too many people assuming the opposite.  Something that Deputy Donegan said seemed to me to indicate that even he was assuming that things like the Buchanan Report and NIEC Reports going to the Government should be implemented by them &mdash; Deputy Donegan is as well aware as I am of this but I want to make it quite clear as well.  The position is that any such reports which go to the Government are considered by them but the ultimate decisions on them are Government decisions.  Those things are merely recommendations to the Government.  There is in fact no certainly that the Buchanan Report, for example, will be accepted by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you think you should sit on a recommendation by the NIEC from 1962 to 1969 and now start to say you are going to do something about it?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The recommendation that there should be growth centres and infra-structure developed for industries in various places in the country.  You sat on that for seven years and you say you are going to do something now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy in regard to industrial development on a regional basis has been outlined by me.  It has been formulated partially as a result of the A.D. Little Report, partially as a result of the NIEC comments on that report and partially as a result of the overall view which was taken by me as Minister for Industry and Commerce and by the Government as a whole of this situation.  We did not accept all the items in either report but the policy decisions that were made were announced and those are what have been incorporated in the comprehensive legislation to which I referred earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make is that I do not care whether the NIEC, Buchanan or anybody else issues any report today, ten years ago or any other time.  Those are mere recommendations but the people who have the responsibility and who make the decisions are the Government.  The fact that reports issue from the NIEC or anybody else does not mean that if the Government do not act on them it is the Government who are wrong. It does not mean that at all.  I want to make this quite clear in the interests of parliamentary democracy, in which we are all interested.  This country is not being run and will not be run by groups, however eminent their members may be, who have not got the responsibility entrusted to them by Dáil Éireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy and myself are at cross purposes on this.  I think we are talking about different things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is getting out a side door if he can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Donegan also referred to failures.  He quoted a figure of £10 million.  I do not know where he got that figure&mdash;I think Deputy Tully expressed doubts about it and he was right&mdash;but I want to say that the information available to me is that there were 12 grant-aided firms which ceased production and are still closed and that of the grants paid to them the net amount, that is allowing the total amount paid less some amounts recovered, was £1,335,847.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a kindly figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There were a further 20 firms which closed down but were subsequently taken over and other industrial undertakings commenced in those factories and in those cases the net amount of grant involved was £1,358,548.  In most of the cases where a new firm came in the incoming firm got the benefit of the grant already <Col N="1612" /> paid.  They were not, of course, again paid a grant but they got the benefit of the grant because the premises were there and in some cases the plant was being used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask a question? Does the Minister include in this losses such as that of a very big firm, the name of which I shall not mention, in which there are still a few people employed, not very far from this House?  Does he include also a firm in the north-east portion of the country, not in my constituency but not too far away from it, where 500 people were to be employed and where, I am informed, there are now 11?  Were those two included?  The figure in those two cases, if the Minister wants to question my figure of £10 million, would increase the grants lost by £2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the first case the Deputy is referring to.  I cannot recall the second at the moment.  In the first case it is included, but I think the difference between us may be that I am talking here about grants paid.  The Deputy may in the cases to which he referred be including more than grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am including loans as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring solely to grants because that is what we are dealing with.  Even including loans, I do not know if the figure would come to £10 million.  This seems an excessive amount to me, but I have not done that sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was Deputy Tully who raised the question of the employment potential given when a new industry is announced.  He seemed to think that we were being grossly misled in this.  I do not think we are. It is not possible to say with full accuracy beforehand how many should be employed in an industry but it is possible to say it with reasonable accuracy.  There has been a survey of grant-aided industry published which shows what occurred in regard to industries that were in existence up to <Col N="1613" /> then, what happened between the estimated potential employment and the actual employment.  The Deputy can refer to that if he wishes to see what the position was at that time.</P>
      <P>I do not think I need deal with any other points except the allegation made by Deputy Coogan who, I am glad to see, has returned to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>It is worthy of comment from the Minister.  I would be disappointed if he did not comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Gibbons called for, and Deputy O'Hara supported the call for, a crash programme of industrialisation for the west of Ireland.  I do not think it is possible to mount it in quite the same sense that the Deputies mean but I want to tell them that under three main headings this problem is being tackled at the moment.</P>
      <P>The first is the Small Industries Programme.  The example Deputy O'Hara gave from the town of Foxford is a very good example of what can happen if an industry is commenced locally, utilising the services that are available and under the Small Industries Programme the services are available. I want to stress that the onus here is on the people living in the areas concerned, especially in relation to the Small Industries Programme; they must utilise the aids and incentives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second heading is the regionalisation approach which I have already announced.  It will mean that within the region in which Mayo will be situated there will be a local IDA office charged with the promotion and development of industry within the region.  There will be an organisation involving co-operation between the local authorities concerned and any of the bodies within the region concerned with industrial development.  This is aimed at decentralising to some extent <Col N="1614" /> the industrialisation programme, utilising local knowledge, initiative and enthusiasm and ensuring that there are people responsible, directly concerned with and having a knowledge of the local conditions within the region, as distinct from depending on the overall responsibility exercised heretofore from Dublin.  I feel this can make for a considerable change in approach to each region.</P>
    <P>The third aspect is one which is of some interest.  It seems to me&mdash;I am not saying this with certainty but it is based on what I have seen happening and on what I know is in the pipeline with the IDA&mdash;that there is a change taking place as far as promoters coming to this country are concerned, or some of them at any rate.  Promoters are now coming here with fairly largescale projects who say to us: &ldquo;We want to go to the west&rdquo; instead of our having to say, as we did heretofore, &ldquo;There are advantages in the west&rdquo; naming the additional grants and so on.  There is a change here.  There are a number of factors leading to it.  The point is that it is happening and Deputies will see that this is so in the not-too-distant future I hope.  It is a result of the development over the years of factors such as scarcity of labour in certain other parts of the country and so on.  What matters is that this is happening now and I think it is going to make a considerable difference as far as the west is concerned.</P>
    <P>The other point I want to mention is Deputy Coogan's allegations.  As Deputy Dr. Gibbons said, I asked Deputy Coogan on a number of occasions to say what it was he was complaining of, what he said was wrong and on each occasion he evaded the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that, when challenged to give names rather than make vague allegations, he gave a name.  This is true, but giving somebody's name means nothing unless you say what you are contending is wrong, and all the Deputy has said is that the man concerned was a Fianna Fáil supporter who worked in by-elections in <Col N="1615" /> different parts of the country.  As Deputy Dr. Gibbons pointed out, it is reasonable to assume that since approximately 50 per cent of our people support the Fianna Fáil Party, approximately 50 per cent of those obtaining grants will be Fianna Fáil supporters, and some will be active supporters.</P>
      <P>I want to deny categorically that there is, to my knowledge, any basis whatsoever for the allegation that industrial grants are being or have been allocated on a political basis.  I want to go further and say that, if Deputy Coogan or any other Deputy of this House, knows that this is not so, then he has a duty to bring the matter to light.  It is up to him to decide the best way to do it, but it is certainly within his responsibility and his duty to raise it in this House.  If he raises such a matter, there is a responsibility on him to specify what his allegation is, what he says is wrong, and to stand over it.  Deputy Coogan has not done that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of the Bill is to confirm an Order which I have made under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, on the recommendation of the Fair Trade Commission, in regard to the supply and distribution to retailers of jewellery, watches and clocks.</P>
      <P>Deputies have already received copies of the commission's report of their inquiry into this matter, but I propose to give here a brief summary of its contents.</P>
      <P>The inquiry was undertaken by the Fair Trade Commission on its own initiative following complaints from retailers that they were experiencing difficulty in obtaining supplies of jewellery, watches and clocks.</P>
      <P>There are 30 Irish manufacturers of jewellery, and eight watch and clock assemblers.  They normally supply their products direct to the retail trade. Some manufacturers and assemblers also import completed products and these are also supplied direct to the retail trade.  There are some 70 wholesale firms most of which are engaged in the distribution of imported products. There are several hundred retail outlets.  There are three trade associations representing retail jewellers and two organisations whose members are engaged in the manufacture of jewellery and in the assembly of watches and clocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirty witnesses representing trade associations, manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers were examined in the course of the inquiry.  Neither of the two organisations representing <Col N="1620" /> manufacturers and assemblers was involved in activities coming within the scope of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>The commission examined in detail the existing arrangements under which jewellery, watches and clocks are supplied to retailers.  They expressed the view that certain practices obtaining in the supply and distribution of these commodities to retailers are not compatible with the public interest. These practices include the confining of supplies to retail firms which comply with standards conceived or established by retail trade associations; commercial pressures on suppliers to confine supplies to such retailers by means such as the issue of lists of suppliers approved by retail trade associations; refusal of supplies to a retailer by reason of non-membership of a trade association or on representations by a competitor; and the recommending or suggesting of retail prices for watches and clocks.  The commission recommend that these practices should cease; that suppliers should be free to determine their own sales policy based on equitable criteria and that retail trade associations should be prohibited from collusive action designed to promote any restrictive practices detrimental to any sector of the jewellery trade or the public good.  The commission also recommend that no action should be taken regarding complaints made by some retailers that certain wholesalers were also selling goods retail.</P>
    <P>I have accepted the recommendations of the commission except that regarding the recommending or suggesting of retail prices for watches and clocks and I have made the Restrictive Trade Practices (Jewellery, Watches and Clocks) Order, 1968, to give effect to the recommendations which I have accepted.  As regards retail prices, I am satisfied that the terms of the Order and in particular the provisions of Article 7, will be sufficient to ensure a fair and competitive retail price mechanism.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, provides that an Order of this kind shall not have effect until it is confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas. The Bill now before the Dáil is the <Col N="1621" /> confirming Bill which is necessary to give force of law to the Order concerned.  With Bills of this kind, the Order which it is proposed to confirm may not be amended by the Oireachtas but may be accepted or rejected as it stands.  The matters with which the Order deals have been the subject of a detailed public inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission and their report sets out the arguments in favour of adopting the provisions embodied in the Order.  I can, therefore, recommend this confirmation Bill to the Dáil without reservation.  Its enactment should result in the development of a more competitive and diversified system of trading with consequent benefits to the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has said, this is a confirmation Bill and we have no power to amend it; we must either accept it <i>in toto</i> or reject it. There is not much point in opposing it because the Government with their majority can force it through unamended. This means that we in Parliament have really only the right to express our views on the matter.  It seems also that the Government have no choice but to accept this order. They have reached the point of no return in parliamentary arrangement and, as I understand it, this Bill must now be passed here this evening and be the responsibility of the Government.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House have always been solicitous that the consumer shall be protected and that there shall be fair trade.  However, there are two sides to every coin, and the other side of the coin is that there are items like cars, shoes, bicycles, radio and television sets the manufacturers of which have their agencies in certain cities and towns and do not sell their goods to anybody else.  One might find in a provincial town that there was one supplier for radio or television sets or one supplier of a certain make of shoes.  In fact, very often I have had requests made to me to do something about getting supplies of that sort of goods for somebody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all a question of agencies.  In <Col N="1622" /> my own business experience the company I am involved in is the sole agent for a certain operation which it does. This raises the question as to whether it is wise that we should insist that a certain make of watch or clock or a certain type of instrument or jewellery should be available to all or should be available to only one particular purchaser. There is the question of service and the question of stocking of spares. The idea of having agencies for a particular type of goods is that a comprehensive service in respect of spares and repairs is required.  Very often the main manufacturer in giving an agency insists upon minimum stocks of spares and a certain level of service which must be available to every purchaser of the article, be it a car, a watch or anything else.</P>
    <P>Therefore we on this side of the House approach the matter in the knowledge that we can do nothing about it.  We temper the view that it seems odd that jewellery should be the only article that is affected with the fact of which the Minister has reminded us here, that a commission sat on this and produced its findings. Again, a commission which sits and takes evidence is not a court of law and very often the findings produced, however honest and wide in approach, represent only an expression of opinion as a result of the evidence considered. It does not mean that it is a mortal sin or an offence against the State to behave differently from what the commission recommends.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to this legislation is that when it is passed it will be an offence against the State to behave differently from what the commission recommended except where the Minister says he has not accepted a recommendation.  We do not want to be accused of sitting on the fence in regard to this legislation, but we would wish to indicate our surprise that it is only in this particular line of trade that such a recommendation has been made and acted upon and that many other aspects I have mentioned have not been touched.  I do not think there are many of them that could be touched.  From a practical point of view it is impossible to have everybody <Col N="1623" /> providing a certain type of manufactured commodity for which there is a necessity for spares and service, because if the total volume of turnover drops then the spares necessary and the level of service necessary cannot be available.  Therefore there ought to be a stockist with a minimum turnover. I am not absolutely competent to say whether or not this is necessary, in relation to, say, an expensive watch, but if I purchased an expensive watch and wished to get service and spares in my own town I would expect that such would be available to me.  I am not certain that this could happen if everybody in the town could sell this type of watch.</P>
    <P>This is a case where the Minister has to make a decision.  He will accept that I am not approaching this in a spirit of criticism of him.  I am merely giving my thoughts and the thoughts of my Party on the subject.  We have considered this, and we do not know whether this is a right or a wrong thing to do.  Again let me say that because this is a confirmation Bill and because of the Government majority here, there is nothing an Opposition Party can do except to make comment upon it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I congratulate the Minister on introducing the legislation necessary to bring this Order into effect.  I am surprised at the attitude of the Fine Gael Party on this.  Deputy Donegan puts up a whole lot of suppositions that would not bear any examination at all.  An independent commission sat, heard evidence and produced a report which the Minister in his wisdom considered and felt was justified.  Now the Minister is bringing in legislation to implement that Order.  The pity is &mdash; this is something in which I agree with Deputy Donegan &mdash; that there are not more of them.  There are too many restrictive trade practices and the Fair Trade Commission should, in my opinion, be used a great deal more. Within the past week I had occasion to send to the Minister a request that a certain matter, connected with an entirely different trade from the jewellery trade, should be the subject of an <Col N="1624" /> inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission. We, in the Labour Party, welcome free trade.  We congratulate the Minister on bringing in this Bill and giving the Order the force of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. S.D. Barrett Mr. S.D. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.D. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a little bitteen of a Bill.  It is a short Bill consisting of five or six lines; the first section consists of three-and-a-half lines and the second section of one-and-a-half lines.  Looking at it casually one would think there could be nothing very damaging in it, but from the point of view of its presentation&mdash;I do not blame the Minister for this; I blame the system&mdash;it is a most dangerous Bill.  I shall not be coming back to this House after the Dissolution and, for that reason, I want once more to protest against something against which I have consistently and persistently protested in this House and to commend my protest to the Minister as something worthy at least of investigation.</P>
      <P>We have on the Order Paper item No. 21, Restrictive Trade Practices (Confirmation of Order) Bill, 1968. Some indication should have been given to the Members of this House as to the particular Confirmation Order involved.  I have always objected to administrative law.  I object to it being used in this Bill.  When it is being used, however, every effort should be made to make as public as possible the intention behind such administrative law. Unless a Deputy were particularly interested in this matter he could be unaware of the fact that this Bill was about to become an Act of this House. Any member of the public who wished to keep himself or herself informed would be in a similar position.  This is both wrong and undemocratic and I suggest to the Minister that in future, when Confirmation Orders are being made law, some indication should be given in the Title of the Bill as to what particular Order is sought to be confirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I object, also, to the manner in which the Bill is introduced.  It is a very bad thing that we should find ourselves, as the Minister tells us, in the position that we cannot amend an Order made by the Minister under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953.  That leads me to ask why legislation of this kind, <Col N="1625" /> passed in 1953, should have survived so long.  I should like every Member of this House to be in the position in which the terms contained in an Order, which we cannot amend, should be included in a Bill in the ordinary way, that Bill to follow the ordinary parliamentary process.  If that were done the information would be easily procured, readily assimilated and digested by Deputies and Deputies could suggest amendments either by way of deletion or addition.  As Deputy Donegan said, we find ourselves in the position that our hands are tied.</P>
    <P>Only two things can happen to this Bill: it can be passed or it can be thrown out.  As we cannot throw it out, I suggest to the Minister that he should withdraw the Bill.  He may ask why. The Minister has explained the process through which this Bill has come before the House.  There was a hearing before the Fair Trade Commission.  I suggest to the Minister that the recommendations of the commission may be sensible but the manner in which the commission set about investigating this matter in relation to the conditions which obtained in regard to the supply and distribution to retailers of jewellery, watches and clocks was highly irregular.  It is not the first time, I am sure, that such irregularities have occurred in hearings by the Fair Trade Commission.  In my opinion this arises from a misreading of section 7 (6) of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, which provides:</P>
    <P>An inquiry shall be held in public save in so far as, in the opinion of the member or members holding it, private sittings may be necessary to avoid any disclosure of confidential information which might materially injure the legitimate business interests of any person.</P>
    <P>I can well understand a private sitting so that the private business of a business man would not be published in the press.  But what happened at the particular inquiry in which I am interested at the moment?  We learn from the report of the inquiry, page 7, paragraph 3:</P>
    <P>Public sittings commenced on 20th July, 1967, and ended on 3rd August, 1967.  We examined on oath or <Col N="1626" /> affirmation 27 witnesses in the course of public sittings and evidence was taken from three witnesses in private.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Prima facie,</i> the commission was acting within its powers in hearing three witnesses in private but, in effect, what did this mean?  It meant that three witnesses went into that inquiry; it meant that nobody was allowed to hear their evidence; it meant that no note was taken of their evidence and those who opposed the viewpoints put forward by these three witnesses were not allowed to cross-examine these witnesses. This was not acting either in the intent or in the spirit of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Fair Trade Commission is empowered&mdash;I see no other empowering section in the Act&mdash;by section 7 (6) to act in a manner which is, in my opinion, very nearly, if not completely, unconstitutional.  It is certainly a denial of the ordinary principles of natural justice followed in the courts.  I would ask the Minister to inquire into this and inquire from the Fair Trade Commission if it is a fact that they did what I allege because I am not speaking from first hand; I am telling the Minister what I was told by people interested in this matter.</P>
    <P>I do not want to traverse the ground already traversed by Deputy Donegan. He has pointed out that there is certainly a case to be made for some modification of the Order, if not indeed the complete wiping out of the Order.  I do not think there should be imputed to the jewellery trade an intention to operate a restrictive practice.  The jewellery trade is very fully aware of the skill necessary for the proper operation of the trade.  I might remind the Minister that we have passed various Acts which acknowledge publicly that certain people must have certain skills before they can operate certain trades or professions.  The Opticians Act is one Act that occurs to me.  The retail jewellers would like to impress upon the Minister that their trade, particularly in regard to fine jewellery, watches and clocks, is a highly skilled trade, not alone from the point of view of the selling of these articles but from the point of view of advising customers&mdash;I believe they like to call them &ldquo;clients&rdquo;&mdash; and also from the point of view of <Col N="1627" /> storing watches, clocks and other goods which must be stored under ideal conditions to maintain their best condition prior to sale.  The jewellers object to the fact that under the dispensation which will be established if this Bill becomes law, one will be able to go in and buy a lollipop with one hand and, with the other hand, a very valuable 50-guinea watch from one and the same person.  I think the jewellery trade has a legitimate grouse.  I think their proposals to the Fair Trade Commission were legitimate.  Let me quote paragraph 35, which appears at page 18 of the Report of the inquiry into the conditions which obtain in regard to the supply and distribution to retailers of jewellery, watches and clocks:</P>
    <P>Broadly, the avowed objective of the three retail associations is that the retailing of jewellery, watches and clocks should be confined to firms which comply with standards conceived or established by the associations themselves.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;associations themselves&rdquo;, of course, are a conglomeration of the skilled jewellery trade&mdash;people who have amassed skills as a result of working for years in the trade.  Like many other trades in this country, the jewellery trade is one that in many cases passes on from father to son.  The Report continues:</P>
    <P>The principal argument advanced by the associations in support of their policy is that a high degree of knowledge and skill and a proper after-sales service are necessary for the effective conduct of the retail jewellery trade.</P>
    <P>This is not controverted anywhere in the subsequent portion of the Fair Trade Commission's Report.  It was established by the evidence brought forward at the hearing before the Fair Trade Commission.  Paragraph 35 goes on further to say:</P>
    <P>The associations apprehend that, if firms which do not possess these qualifications and facilities engage in the trade, the public will be badly served, and the jewellery trade will be brought into disrepute.</P>
    <P>I can understand the jewellery trade <Col N="1628" /> being worried about its trading being brought into disrepute.  However, what the Minister should be more worried about is that the public might well be very badly served under the circumstances which would arise as a result of the passing into law of this measure. The Report of the Fair Trade Commission does not controvert any of this.  In fact, it nearly accepts it by implication.  It continues:</P>
    <P>The crucial question is whether these considerations justify the application by retail trade associations of drastic measures designed to ensure that jewellery, watches and clocks will be sold exclusively by those retailers who, in the judgment of the associations, are qualified to engage in the trade.</P>
    <P>From that, I think the Minister will infer as facilely as I infer that the Fair Trade Commission accepts everything in paragraph 35 of its Report and simply goes on to say then&mdash;by the use of hyperbole, in my opinion:</P>
    <P>The crucial question is whether these considerations justify the application by retail trade associations of drastic measures...</P>
    <P>One would think the retail trade association were going out with guns to shoot anybody going into competition with them.  Far from it.  In my opinion, the retail trade are acting in a most decorous fashion.  When they found out that the hairdressers down the street were selling exactly the same sort of watch as the retail jewellery trade, they simply went to the wholesalers and manufacturers and said, in effect: &ldquo;If you sell to Miss Murphy down the road the same watches as you are selling to us&mdash;although we have all the skill to advise as to how to keep the watch and whether it is a good watch and although we have the skill to repair it afterwards&mdash;we shall not deal with you and we shall see that our colleagues in the jewellery trade will not deal with you either.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In a rather impudent way, first the Fair Trade Commission and then the Minister said, in effect: &ldquo;You cannot do that.  How dare you.  Anybody who damn well likes will sell a watch under any circumstances.&rdquo;  The small shopkeeper <Col N="1629" /> can hit his child on the head with a watch and sell that same watch over the counter the next day to a customer&mdash;which is something no member of the jewellery trade would do.  I am apprehensive about this particular exercise because we are living in days when people who hitherto could not afford to buy these watches can now afford to do so and they might prefer to go to the more homely surroundings of the local sweetshop or tobacconist than into a jewellery shop to purchase their watches or their fine and delicate jewellery.  At least 90 if not 95 per cent of the jewellery trade's customers know nothing whatsoever about what they are buying.  The fact that there was a jewellery trade in this country going back many centuries with fine conditions, was a safeguard for these people and was becoming increasingly more a safeguard as the retail market for that sort of jewellery became more widespread. Only highly-skilled people who had served their time could advise and give the service which the retail trade gives.  I shall not keep the House any longer on this matter because Deputy Donegan has very fully and ably stated our case.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister of one thing.  When discussing the Bill immediately preceding this one, the Minister, speaking of much more august bodies than the Fair Trade Commission, said that the Government were not bound to act on the Report or recommendations of NIEC or on the Buchanan Report.  Equally, the Minister is not bound to act on this. The fact that the people who signed it may be senior counsel or professors or lecturers at a university should not blind us to the reality that they can do damn silly things at times.  I submit that they did a damn silly thing in their Report to the Minister in this particular case.  It was stupid, piffling sort of stuff such as we read in paragraph 35 where they say, in effect: &ldquo;We accept what the jewellery trade says but does this justify our taking any drastic steps?&rdquo; The word &ldquo;drastic&rdquo; was a figment of the imagination of the august gentlemen who signed this Report.</P>
    <P>Nothing in the Report indicated that <Col N="1630" /> any drastic step would be taken by any retail jewellers' association.  For that reason&mdash;being powerless, as Deputy Donegan pointed out, to do anything to arrest any trend suggested in any portion of the Order we are asked to pass&mdash;I would appeal to the Minister, in the light of what Deputy Donegan has said and in the light of what I have said, at least to withdraw this Bill until such time as he has fully investigated the wisdom, commonsense or even the factual basis of the Report upon which he prepared the Order which this Bill seeks to turn into an Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I might deal, first of all, with the point made by Deputy Barrett about the conduct of the Inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission. I do not know whether what he said was correct and, as he said himself, he had it at second- or third-hand. All I can say in relation to it is that I shall inquire into whether that was correct and, if so, pursue the matter further.  On the merits of this matter, I think I should make it clear that it is not a question of picking out this particular trade and applying certain restrictions to it which we are not applying to anybody else.  In fact, there are similar Orders in operation in regard to a number of trades and similar kinds of regulations under the Orders are applied to them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett is doing less than justice to the Fair Trade Commission in the section of their report which he quoted and when he represented the commission as saying to the jewellers: &ldquo;We accept your argument but does this justify the drastic action which has been taken?&rdquo; He went on to say that it was not drastic.  It seems to be a more reasonable interpretation that the commission were saying that there were arguments in favour of what the trade association was saying but there were arguments the other way and where did the balance lie in so far as the public interest was concerned.  The commission came down in favour of taking away these restrictions in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear that the position is not as it has been suggested it was by Deputy Barrett and that under <Col N="1631" /> this Order the object is to free the suppliers from the pressure of the organised trade but the supplier is still free to determine the type of outlet he will supply and he may limit the number of outlets with which he is dealing.  There is nothing against this in the Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very unlikely but what he is required to do is to treat in the same way the outlets with which he deals.  The arguments that have been put forward here with some force were put before the commission and subject to the exception I mentioned when introducing the Bill I have been satisfied that the recommendations of the commission were the best that could be made in the public interest.  I do not pretend, nor do the commission pretend, as is clear from their report, that there is a clear-cut black and white in this situation.  This is not so as there is a question of the balance of advantage. The commission took the view that the balance came down in favour of freeing the suppliers from this kind of organised pressure of the trade.  I agree with that view.  I think this is so and I think it is in the public interest. I do think that the arguments advanced by Deputy Barrett and advanced by the trade at the hearing were grossly exaggerated.  As Deputy Burke said, I do not think that you are going to find watches and clocks in publichouses or that kind of place.  The trade will continue as it has done in the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. S Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions in the earlier Parts of this Bill deal with the establishment of a new structure of administration for the health services and with the financing of the services in the future: the later provisions consolidate much of the present law on the health services and propose a number of changes in the services.  The logic of the draftsman's science requires that the Bill be structured in this fashion, but I do not think that, in speaking on the Bill, I <Col N="1633" /> should follow the same order, because the nature of the health services, and not how they are administered, is of more fundamental importance.  Therefore, I propose first to speak on the provisions on the services in Part IV of the Bill.</P>
    <P>This Part essays to consolidate most of the present law on eligibility for the various health services, to propose a number of changes in those services and to express in a clearer and more codified form the general policy of the Government on their development.  On this occasion I do not, of course, intend to go into detail on each of the provisions in this Part of the Bill: that will be a matter for Committee Stage. Rather is it my intention to speak on the general policy underlying this Part and to refer only to the more significant changes which it proposes in the law on the services.</P>
    <P>The 1966 White Paper made it clear that the present Government had not accepted the proposition that the State had a duty to provide unconditionally all medical, dental and other health services free of cost for everyone, without regard to individual need or circumstances. Their policy has always been to design the services, and the provisions on eligibility for them, on the basis that a person should not be denied medical care because of lack of means, but that the services should not be free for all.</P>
    <P>In the application of this policy, about 90 per cent of the population have become eligible for hospital and specialist services but, as family doctors' bills do not impose the same financial burdens, only 30 per cent of the population is entitled to the general practitioner service.  The White Paper went on to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>By following this broad principle, there has been a more effective use of the necessarily limited proportion of the national product which can be devoted to the public development of health services than if an effort had been made to develop on a much broader basis a scheme with the features of a comprehensive free-for-all national health service.  The present services meet the essential needs of the population: in so far as <Col N="1634" /> it is now proposed to make changes in them, these changes are justified in each case by special considerations, which are mentioned in Part III of the White Paper.  With increasing prosperity in the future it should be possible to make these changes without adverse effect on the present services.  The social development of the State, in the Government's view, calls for future changes such as are now suggested but the Government would emphasise that their proposals do not represent a radical departure from the principles set out in the preceding paragraph.</P>
    <P>The basis for the Government's health policy, as thus expressed, remains unchanged and I should make it quite clear that there is no intention in the Health Bill to change it.</P>
    <P>Events since 1966 have, if anything, strengthened the case for this approach to eligibility for health services as against a policy in favour of having a comprehensive free-for-all service.  This issue was debated at some length a few months ago in this House and I do not intend to dwell on it at length now. I will but point out that our health services which, in 1965-66, cost about £33 million to run, are now costing about £51 million, including the deficit payments to voluntary hospitals. This increase has come without any spectacular changes in the services: it has arisen from increases in remuneration and prices and from some steady improvements in the existing services. As the House is aware, this increase in expenditure has not been unattended by financial problems at local and central levels.</P>
    <P>To make a big change in the scope of the services, whether by making all the services available to everybody free of cost or by extending general medical services to the middle-income group, would mean that, apart from the ordinary rise in expenditure which can be expected to continue, an extra sum, which I estimate could amount to a minimum £20 million a year, would have to be raised in some way.  It should not be assumed that this could be done by any form of central taxation, and certainly local taxation could not be called upon to bear a share of <Col N="1635" /> such an addition in expenditure. Neither should it be thought that insurance contributions would provide a source for such expenditure on such a scale, whatever advantages they might have as an ancillary source of finance.</P>
    <P>If, to pursue a particular political philosophy or to attempt to meet an alleged public demand, this Bill were to have proposed a widening in eligibility so as to admit all citizens to all the services, or most of them to most of the services, this would have been an irresponsible and foolish move.  For we must recognise that the amount of public finance which is available now for the health services, or which will be available at any time in the future will be limited.  If the additional money which can become available for the services is dissipated in an attempt to widen unnecessarily the groups eligible for them, then it logically follows that there will be little if anything left for the improvements in the essential services for the groups who have a real and clear need for them.</P>
    <P>What money will be available must be concentrated on the improvements on services for the care of the aged, for the development of general medical and nursing services for the lower income group, for bringing up to date our facilities for the treatment of mental illness, for meeting the large problem of the care of the mentally handicapped, for developing the preventive child health services and for other essential projects of this nature. Therefore, in putting this Bill to the House, I make no apology because it does not contain any spectacular proposals on the extension of eligibility for services.  That it does not do so is deliberate and well justified Government policy, as I have just explained.</P>
    <P>Within this general framework of policy, however, the Bill proposes a number of important changes.  The most notable of these is the intention, as expressed in section 56, to replace the dispensary system with a service offering choice of doctor in the general medical service for the lower income group, in so far as this is practicable. There seems to have been some misunderstanding of the intention behind <Col N="1636" /> this section and, indeed, Deputy Fitzpatrick in a comment when the Bill was published, suggested that the Government intended under the Bill to retain the dispensary system.  This, of course, is not so.  The dispensary medical service operates under section 14 of the Health Act, 1953.  Dispensary districts are governed by section 51 of that Act and district medical officers for those districts are appointed under section 52.  These three sections are scheduled for repeal by the Bill.  It thus clearly sounds the death-knell for the dispensary system as we know it now.</P>
    <P>The new legal basis for the general medical service will be primarily in section 56 of the Bill.  Under that section and section 25 the new service can be organised by making arrangements with participating general practitioners in such form as may be negotiated.  Section 56 requires that choice of doctor be offered in so far as it is considered practicable by the Minister.  There is nothing sinister in this saver.  Obviously, absolute choice could not be provided for in the Bill, as it could not be required of the health authorities that a choice be offered on, say, the Aran Islands or some of the remoter areas in the West. Apart from such areas, however, it is the firm intention to offer a choice of doctor by participating practitioners.</P>
    <P>Perhaps more important, it is the firm intention for all areas that the present arrangements of separate premises and arrangements for public patients will be ended.  The White Paper expressed the Government's proposals on this service as involving &ldquo;substituting for the dispensary service a service with the greatest practicable choice of doctor and the least practicable distinction between private patients and those availing themselves of the service&rdquo;.  This remains the Government's policy and section 56 of the Bill and the other provisions I have mentioned will provide the legal basis for this policy.</P>
    <P>While this major change in the general medical service cannot come into effect until the Bill has been passed and the necessary ancillary steps have been taken, I can report much <Col N="1637" /> progress in the preparatory work for making this change.  I have had a number of meetings with the Irish Medical Association and the Medical Union on these proposals and details of them have been discussed at several meetings between the organisations and my officers.  Substantial agreement has been reached on most things in these discussions and the essential features of the arrangements for the new service which I propose following these discussions are:</P>
    <P>Participation by doctors would normally be on the basis of an agreement with the health board;</P>
    <P>An eligible person would, subject to certain restrictions&mdash;mainly as to distance&mdash;be allowed to register with any participating doctor willing to accept him and would be allowed to transfer to another doctor after giving proper notice;</P>
    <P>Persons could be assigned to a participating doctor where this was necessary;</P>
    <P>Special arrangements would operate for group practices and partnerships;</P>
    <P>There would be control on entry by doctors into the service;</P>
    <P>Future vacancies in the service would be filled by public competition;</P>
    <P>Patients would normally be seen in the doctor's premises, but the health board would have power to make accommodation in clinics or health centres available to general practitioners where appropriate;</P>
    <P>Special arrangements would be incorporated to keep doctors in remote areas.</P>
    <P>Those who now hold posts as permanent district medical officers will be given guarantees in relation to entry into the new service which I have agreed with the profession and other doctors who are in general practice for a minimum period will also have an initial right of participation.</P>
    <P>I must report, however, that up to the present agreement has not been reached with the medical organisations on the method of payment of doctors under the service.  Both the organisations <Col N="1638" /> were required by resolutions of their members to seek payment on the basis of a fee for each item of service. I informed them that I would not favour such a system, mainly because of the complications and administrative expense in operating it and the difficulties in controlling abuses.  Initially, I favoured a system under which there would be a flat comprehensive annual capitation payment for each person on a doctor's list, but to meet the views of the profession I subsequently told the organisations that I would be agreeable to a modification of this so that there would be a separate payment to cover the doctor's practice expenses, a basic annual capitation payment to cover ordinary medical care and medical attention and, in addition, special fees for unusual items of service. After further discussions on this, which did not, of course, commit them to acceptance of this concept in principle, I sent to the organisations on 14 February last a detailed statement on this proposal and on the rates of payment.</P>
    <P>At a further meeting on 3rd April, the association and the union indicated that they did not consider that the rates of payment offered were sufficient and also made the case that my fears in relation to the fee-for-item-of-service method of payment might be allayed if the profession were to suggest adequate controls.  I did not accept what they put forward in relation to the rates of payment which I had proposed but, before considering this particular matter further, agreed that a small working party should be set up to consider the suggestions which they would wish to put forward on the controls needed under their suggested system of payment.  This working party is now being set up and I expect it to report shortly.  I cannot, in the circumstances, report to the House that the details of the system of payment have yet been agreed on, but I can assure the House that the professional organisations and myself are very anxious that this issue should be resolved soon. This is desirable on several grounds, in particular to end the uncertainty in relation to the future which has seriously affected the operation of the dispensary system in some areas.</P>
    <P>It is intended that, under this new <Col N="1639" /> service, drugs and medicines will, as far as practicable, be issued through retail pharmaceutical chemists.  Again, in preparation for the enactment of the Bill, this has been discussed with the retailers and also with the manufacturers, importers and wholesalers of drugs.  A large measure of agreement has been reached on the means by which such a service would be operated and I foresee no insurmountable obstacles to agreement on the final details of the operation of these arrangements.</P>
    <P>The practical problems involved in listing and pricing the various drugs, medicines and appliances and in calculating payments to chemists are very formidable.  Millions of prescriptions will have to be priced and paid for each year.  My Department have been involved in practical studies on the best methods of arranging for this and in this respect I would like to acknowledge assistance which we have obtained from the authorities in Belfast, Edinburgh and London who are responsible for operating similar arrangements.  The initial preparations for this part of the service are being put in train in anticipation of the legislation, because the date of the commencement of the new general medical service will largely depend on the date on which these arrangements can come into effect.  It cannot, I estimate, be earlier than the middle of 1970.</P>
    <P>These major changes will, of course, relate only to general medical services for what we now call the lower income group, or what is defined in the Bill as &ldquo;persons with full eligibility.&rdquo;  For others, family doctor services will continue to be arranged privately.  So will the purchase of drugs and medicines in normal circumstances.  However, section 57 (2) introduces an important provision to safeguard the middle income group&mdash;in the Bill defined as &ldquo;persons with limited eligibility&rdquo;&mdash;against having to meet, unaided high expenditure on drugs and medicines.  Much is done at present in this respect by the operation of the &ldquo;hardship clauses&rdquo; but I think the scheme under the new Bill will be <Col N="1640" /> better.  It will be clearly spelled out that expenditure by a person with limited eligibility over a specified amount in a period of, say, a month will be recoupable in whole or in part by the health board.  The minimum amount will be specified by regulations and will not be determined until this new provision is coming into operation but it is intended that it will be a sum which a person in the middle income group could readily afford to pay himself.  Two pounds a month might be an appropriate figure.</P>
    <P>I intend that this scheme should be simple to operate and should be clearly understood by the public.  It will mean that persons in the middle income group will know that they will not be expected to budget from their private resources for excessively high expenditure on drugs and medicines.</P>
    <P>In addition to these general schemes, there is provision in section 57 (3) under which health boards will be authorised to arrange to supply drugs without charge for long-term diseases and disabilities in persons of all income groups.  As the House is aware, such a scheme operates at present for diabetics.  This scheme will be extended to other conditions, such as cystic fibrosis and phenylketonuria.  For such conditions only rare households could afford the expense of the drugs and medicines required and it is right that an exception should be made here so that all income groups will benefit from this provision.  To sum up on these provisions for the supply of drugs, medicines and appliances&mdash;the lower income group will get everything free through, I expect, chemists' shops; the middle-income group will be guaranteed against excessive expenditure and the higher income group will be assisted as respects long-term and expensive items.  These changes, with the introduction of choice of doctor, will involve a considerable additional outlay of public money, which may be between £½ million and £1 million a year.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill, in codifying the provisions in the other health services proposes a number of other improvements and extensions.  Section 43, dealing with the definition of &ldquo;full eligibility&rdquo; departs from the old public <Col N="1641" /> assistance terminology under which &ldquo;persons unable by their own industry or other lawful means&rdquo; to make private arrangements for medical care were expressed as being eligible for the services.  This formula has been dropped in favour of more modern terminology and it is made clear that only the means of a husband and wife as well as a person's own means will be taken into account in deciding whether or not he has full eligibility. Furthermore, there is provision in section 43 (3) under which regulations can be made specifying classes of persons who will automatically be regarded as coming within this category. This will lead to general uniformity in decisions on eligibility and, as the regulations will be public documents, it will mean that in future the standards for assessing eligibility will be known. However, it should not be taken that this definition of classes to be included among those with full eligibility can be all-inclusive.  Because of varying circumstances, particularly in the agricultural community, it is necessary that the formula should retain considerable flexibility.</P>
    <P>Section 45 contains a new right of appeal on all decisions relating to eligibility.  There is no appeal at present on the question of issuing medical cards and the appeal in relation to inclusion in the middle income group is only of a limited nature.</P>
    <P>The only major change in Chapter II of this Part, dealing with hospital services, is related to the eligibility of children for these services.  At present, children of persons in the lower or middle income group are entitled to hospital services but children of those in the upper income group are entitled only in respect of defects discovered at school health examinations in national schools.  This leads to an artificial distinction. Many higher income group children do not attend national schools and, even in the case of those who do, it is often purely fortuitous that it is at a school health examination a defect is discovered.  The Bill will terminate this anomalous position, but will compensate parents in the upper income group by making in-patient services available for their <Col N="1642" /> children for permanent or long-term diseases and disabilities no matter where discovered.  The most important of these would be mental handicap.  As most upper income group people are covered by Voluntary Health Insurance, the loss of the right to free treatment on the grounds of discovery at school health examinations should be of no serious consequence to them, particularly in the light of the concession made for long-term conditions, which might not be fully covered by the voluntary health scheme.  These changes in eligibility are, in general, on the lines of recommendations in the Report on the Child Health Services published last August.</P>
    <P>Where in-patient hospital services are concerned there is at present a definite statutory provision under which charges up to 10/- a day may be made on persons in the middle income group.  This is being replaced by section 51 which contains power to impose charges by regulations. Policy in the exercise of this power can be determined from time to time and consideration given as to whether the present charges should be retained in their existing form, or modified, or dropped.  This issue could be affected by a future decision on the question of introducing a scheme of contributions by the middle income group for the services to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>In the case of out-patient services the Bill proposes to drop the existing charges for those services and to make the services available for all defects discovered at health examinations in pre-school as well as school children, as at present.  Again, these changes accord generally with the Report on the Child Health Services.</P>
    <P>The hospital services, are, of course, by far the most expensive sector of the health services.  I think that the present pattern of eligibility is generally satisfactory and, having regard to the existence of the voluntary health insurance scheme, there is no substantial pressure for extending these services to a wider group of the population. Accordingly, section 44 re-states the present definition of persons entitled to these services.  It will be noted, however, <Col N="1643" /> that under section 44 (3) there will be power for the Minister by regulations&mdash;which will be subject to the consent of both Houses of the Oireachtas&mdash;to change the definition of eligibility.  This power could be used to make allowances from time to time for changes in the value of money or it could be used to change the general formula for eligibility.  A suggestion in this respect was made in a Parliamentary Question by Deputy Donegan on 13 July, 1967, to the effect that the standard of eligibility for the services should be different for single people, married people and married people with dependants.  While the Government have made no determination of policy in this respect, I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that a change of this kind could readily be made under this section, without of course necessarily charging the total number eligible for the services.</P>
    <P>The provisions in sections 60 to 64 of the Bill relating to the services for mothers and children also have regard to the report to which I have referred earlier.  An important change from the present law is proposed in section 64 (1) under which an examination service for pre-school children will be arranged. The present law limits this to clinics and health centres operated by the health authorities.  By referring to &ldquo;other prescribed places&rdquo; in the new section, we leave the way open to bring the family doctors into this service. This was recommended for rural areas by the Report on the Child Health Services and, indeed, there is some feeling in the medical profession that family doctors in urban areas too should play a part in this service.</P>
    <P>Section 62 takes into account the change in the value of money since the maternity cash grant was first fixed at £4 in 1953.  This grant will be increased to £8 and a further concession is made whereby a double grant will be paid where there are twins, a treble grant for triplets and pro rata for any other multiple births.</P>
    <P>Another change of some importance is contained in section 67, under which, in assessing if a person is eligible for a <Col N="1644" /> disabled person's &mdash; maintenance &mdash; allowance, only the person's own means and those of a husband or wife will in future be taken into account. Under the existing law, regard is had to the means of sons, daughters, and parents and of any brothers or sisters normally resident with the person.</P>
    <P>While I dealt at some length earlier with the changes in the general medical services, my comments on the other provisions in the Bill on services have been brief, but the points to which I referred and, no doubt, many other aspects of the sections in this Part of the Bill will come up for discussion at Committee Stage.  I will welcome views from all sides of the House on the details of these provisions at that time and may I sincerely say that I hope because the principles behind these provisions may not be in tune with the political philosophies of all Members of the House, that this will not prevent them participating in fruitful discussion on those details?</P>
    <P>I would like now to revert to the earlier Part of the Bill, on the administration and financing of the health services. I hope that the general purpose is clear from the Bill and the explanatory memorandum circulated with it. The intention is to transfer the administration of all the health services to the new health boards.  The membership of these would be made up of representatives of the local authorities in the area concerned, persons elected by the medical and other professions and persons appointed by the Minister. The boards would thus, in the words of the White Paper &ldquo;represent a partnership between local government, central government and the vocational organisation&rdquo;. The arguments for making this change were given in the White Paper and were derived from two separate considerations.  First, it was clear in 1966, and has been made more clear since by the Fitzgerald Report on the Hospital Services that, for those services, the county is too small as a unit.  A much more effective service can be provided by grouping a number of counties for the administration of hospitals.</P>
    <P>A modern hospital service is an extremely costly and complex undertaking. <Col N="1645" /> It requires not only a great deal of money but a large number of expert medical, technological and nursing staff of whom there is a short supply.  In order to ensure that these expert staffs can work effectively it requires, too, that it should be based on large hospitals and large units of population.  Obviously, in a country with our demographic pattern, you cannot realistically expect to be able to base this sort of service on every county.  If then, as proposed by the Fitzgerald Report, our main general hospitals are to be located at a smaller number of centres, each catering for a number of counties, it follows that the administration of the service should also be based on groups of counties. The health boards will ensure that all counties participating in the service will have a say in its administration. They will also provide a means whereby persons, other than local authority representatives, with valuable knowledge or experience can be brought on to the boards.</P>
    <P>The case for grouping counties is not as clear, of course, for other services and, indeed for some of them, such as the child health service, one could well argue that the county remains a suitable unit of administration. However, the White Paper concluded that the main advantage lay in having all the health services within an area under a single body and that if health boards as proposed were to be set up, they should have comprehensive responsibility for all the services.</P>
    <P>I should mention that our views on this particular point have been confirmed by certain developments in Britain since the White Paper was published.  In two green papers&mdash;that is documents putting out ideas for preliminary discussion&mdash;one for England and Wales and another for Scotland, proposals were put forward for a system of comprehensive health boards like those proposed in the Bill to replace the present divided system of administration in those countries.  In general the idea of unified administration has been welcomed there and it looks quite likely that the next few years will see legislation in Britain for the establishment of health boards <Col N="1646" /> rather like those which we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>The second reason for the White Paper's advocacy of a change to this form of administration lay in the fact of the State's increasing financial commitment towards the health services. The Government, by the White Paper committed themselves to acceptance that the cost of specific further extensions of the services&mdash;such as that in the general medical service as set out in the Bill&mdash;should not be met in any proportion by the local rates and, indeed, since the White Paper was published the proportion of health expenditure met by the State has increased substantially.  This is another reason for the proposal for the transfer of administration to the health boards on the lines proposed.</P>
    <P>The health boards will be bodies outside the ordinary Local Government system.  The Bill proposes that the number of these boards and the area to be administered by each will be determined by regulations.  In accordance with section 4, the Minister is required to consult the relevant local authorities before making such regulations and the regulations must be submitted in draft for approval to each House of the Oireachtas before being made.  This means that there will, after the enactment of the Bill, be adequate opportunity for the local authorities, and later for this House, to consider the details of the scheme.  It also means, of course, that I am not in a position to give any firm indication to the House now on what the detailed pattern will be.  My Department have been studying the issue and, provisionally, I have in mind that the number of these boards should be about eight and that, as far as possible, the functional area of each will consist of a number of whole counties.  Furthermore, it will be appreciated that in designing the regions I will have regard to regions for other purposes, and particularly those for planning and development.</P>
    <P>Naturally, only a proportion of the members of each county council or other local authority concerned can be appointed to each health board.  It is proposed, however, by section 7 to <Col N="1647" /> associate other members of the local authorities with the work of the boards by establishing local advisory committees for each county or other appropriate unit.  These committees will primarily be there to advise on the provision of health services in their own areas but the board will have authority to delegate functions to them if that should appear appropriate.</P>
    <P>Sections 12 to 23 of the Bill deal with officers and servants of health boards.  These provisions draw much on the law on officers and servants in the Local Government Acts but there are some significant distinctions.  The most important of these is that the statutory office of chief executive officer to a health board will not be analogous to that of a county manager.  The latter performs all functions for a local authority except specified functions reserved to the elected members: the chief executive officer, under section 16 of the Bill will perform his duties on behalf of the board and in accordance with its decisions and directions&mdash; except as regards certain things in which he is specifically given functions by the Bill.  These will be mainly decisions on individual applications for services and on the control of officers.</P>
    <P>It has been said to me that there will be little practical difference between the operation of this provision and the normal relations between a county manager and the members of his council. That may be so, because a good manager will always act in concert with his council and without stressing his own sovereignty but I nevertheless think that the different legal status of the members of a health board <i>vis-àvis</i> the board's chief executive officer and other officers will be significant in giving considerably more weight to the authority of the members.</P>
    <P>I should mention that I have received representations from the medical profession that each chief executive officer should be a doctor.  I cannot accept this, as the primary qualifications for this office must lie in administration, but should a doctor succeed in competition in qualifying in this respect, I would be glad to see him becoming a chief executive officer.  This is a point <Col N="1648" /> on which I would be particularly interested to hear the views of other Members of the House.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting departure from Local Government law and practice in sections 22 and 23.  Local Government officers are subject to discipline by the manager and to removal from office on disciplinary grounds by the Minister.  Under the Bill, it is intended that the Minister will not be involved initially in disciplinary cases affecting officers of health boards, other than the chief executive officer.  The investigation of a proposal to remove an officer on disciplinary grounds would be in the hands of a special committee appointed under section 23 and the Minister would become involved only on an appeal.  This proposal is in accord with the general aim of devolving detailed functions from the Minister and his Department as far as practicable.</P>
    <P>May I now turn to section 40 of the Bill, dealing with bodies for the co-ordination and development of hospital services which should be looked at in conjunction with the earlier proposals on health boards.  This section in some degree reflects the thinking on administration of hospitals in the Fitzgerald Report.  That report advocated a separate system of hospital administration in which there would be a central body to be known as the Consultants Establishment Board dealing with the control of specialties, three regional hospital boards and, under them a number of hospital management committees.  This completely separate system of hospital administration is not acceptable, for reasons which I have outlined above and because of the administrative duplication to which it might give rise.</P>
    <P>However, certain features of these recommendations of the Fitzgerald Report have been embodied in the Bill. While the basic administration of hospitals will be in the hands of the new health boards and, for the voluntary hospitals in the hands of their boards of management, the idea of a central co-ordinating body and three regional hospital boards is incorporated in section 40.  The central body will be known as Comhairle na nOispidéal and its main function will lie in advising on <Col N="1649" /> the regulation of the number and type of consultant appointments in hospitals. It will also be concerned in the qualifications for such appointments and will have general advisory functions.  At least half of the members of this body will be hospital consultants.</P>
    <P>The three regional hospital boards based on Dublin, Cork and Galway will have the different function of being concerned in the general organisation and development of hospital services in the health board hospitals and the voluntary hospitals participating in the services within the regions.  Each regional hospital board will draw one-half of its members from the health boards within its region and the other half will be appointed by the Minister after appropriate consultations.</P>
    <P>Some critics have seen in the provisions relating to the administration of the hospital services an attempt by me, by the State, to end the traditional independence of the voluntary hospital system.  I have already stated that that is not my intention.  I repeat that now. We owe a great deal to our voluntary hospitals, to the religious communities and lay boards associated with them for the standards of hospital care and medical teaching which they have established and maintained during their long history.  It would not only be thankless but foolish for me if I were to attempt to end their independent status and put them all in a bureaucratic strait-jacket.  But having said that, and emphasised that, I know that I can expect those voluntary hospitals participating in the public services to accept certain restrictions and conditions in the interests of the hospital system as a whole.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary for me to labour the fact that the cost of running our hospital service is by far the largest element in the soaring cost of the health services.  The administrative machinery I am now proposing for the hospitals is aimed at securing a more efficient and effective service and a better return for the money we are spending. Obviously this must necessarily involve a willingness on the part of all hospital authorities to accept a planned and rational approach towards the <Col N="1650" /> future organisation and development of the service.</P>
    <P>Section 40 represents a compromise between what the hospital consultants might regard as the best form of administration for the hospital services and what the Government think public representatives at national and local level would accept for this purpose. Like most compromises, it will not fully satisfy everybody.  I have not yet got in detail the views of the organisations concerned on the actual text of the section but, when I have these views and have considered them I may wish to suggest some modifications in the section on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It became clear to us in framing the new form of administration that, with the establishment of these bodies and the general transfer of administration to the health boards, the Hospital Commission would no longer have a sufficient function to perform.  Accordingly, it was decided to include provision for the eventual dissolution of the commission.  The Hospitals Commission was established in 1933 mainly for the purpose of advising on the spending of money derived from the Hospital Sweepstakes.  Conditions were, of course, much different then from what they are now.  During its existence the commission has performed a very useful function and in recent years it has become involved, by agreement with the voluntary hospitals, in general work designed towards encouraging efficiency and economy in those hospitals.  The chairman of the Commission and its members and staff are to be complimented on the manner in which they have done this work.  That it is now proposed, because of the evolution of administration, to dissolve the commission reflects no discredit on them.</P>
    <P>The establishment of health boards and of the new hospital bodies will cause somewhat of an upheaval in health administration.  As well as the Hospitals Commission, the Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford Health Authorities, the seven joint mental health boards and the Western Health Institutions Boards will be dissolved. In all, as against the 12 or so new bodies being set up, 13 will disappear. There is also provision for the transfer <Col N="1651" /> of health staffs from county councils. These matters are dealt with in sections 33 and 36 of the Bill.  These sections will affect several classes of officers and many individuals.  The next of the Bill has been sent for comment to organisations representing the various categories of health staffs.  I would like at this stage to say that their views on any difficulties which they expect on the working of these provisions will be received most sympathetically by me, both before the enactment of the Bill and later.  If necessary, I will be prepared to bring in amendments in this respect on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Sections 26 to 32 of the Bill contain the provisions on the financing of the new health boards.  Their accounts will be kept in a prescribed form, they will be audited by Local Government auditors and the certified abstracts of accounts will be presented to the Minister and to the local authorities concerned. The Minister will present copies to the Houses of the Oireachtas. Budgetary control of health boards will be exercised under sections 29 and 30 as, under these sections, the authorised estimates of health boards will be binding on them and may be departed from only with the Minister's consent.  The chief executive officer of the health board will be given a function, similar to that which the accounting officer of a Government Department has, to ensure that the financial controls are properly observed.</P>
    <P>The sources of finance for the health boards are specified in sections 31 and 32.  The boards will be financed mainly by way of State grants and local contributions. The State grants will meet one-half of the total running expenditure and a further proportion as determined from time to time.  The local contributions will meet the balance.  The contributions for individual local authorities will be determined by regulations made by the Minister for Local Government, which will be presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The effect of these provisions, of course, is that there will be no such thing as a statutory &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; on the amount of the local contributions, but <Col N="1652" /> I should point out that the section is framed so that, should the Government of the day decide in future that such a freeze was desirable, it could be provided for.  I would personally not think it appropriate that future Governments should be firmly committed by the Bill in any way in this respect.  The decision on this is something which has to be taken from time to time in the light of the general financial circumstances&mdash;central and local.  Accordingly, section 31 in its present form seems to me to be more appropriate than one setting out a more rigid financial basis for the services.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains several other useful miscellaneous provisions.  By the transfer, under section 42, of the administration of the Dundrum Central Mental Hospital to the appropriate health board we should achieve a much better use of that institution as it should greatly benefit by co-ordination with other psychiatric hospitals in the area. A simple procedure for amendment of hospitals charters or private Acts is proposed by section 73: this will enable the boards of governors of hospitals to avoid the expense of private Acts.  Confusion relating to health authorities' powers in the removal of bodies of dead persons found in their areas, which has led to some distasteful incidents in the past, should be removed by section 74.  Finally, by the provisions of this Bill, certain repeals of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, and the proposals for the adaptation of those Acts under section 78, the remnants of the distinctive legal provisions on the provision of services for the mentally ill will be removed, so that the same law&mdash;as contained in this Bill&mdash;will apply in relation to eligibility for those services and the provision of those services as applies to other hospital services.  The only part of the mental treatment code which will remain will be those necessary provisions governing the procedures for the admission of patients to mental hospitals and the retention of patients in those hospitals.  I should hope that, in the future, a separate Bill will repeal these remnants of the Mental Treatment Code and replace them by a simplified procedure.  For the moment, I would point out that the Health Bill <Col N="1653" /> takes what might be called the penultimate step in removing the distinctions which have traditionally existed for the care of the mentally ill.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a highly technical document in its provisions on the administration of services, the financing of services and eligibility for health services but, basically we are discussing on it what the public authorities should do for our people as a whole in the prevention and cure of disease and in caring for the ill, the infirm and the aged.  I present the Bill to the House as offering what the Government consider the most rational solution to a number of the problems which arise.  I put it to the House with no apology for its not being something else, such as a Bill for the introduction of a comprehensive national health service: we do not think that the people need that or want that.  I hope the House will accept the Bill as offering the most reasonable vehicle for the future development of our health services in accordance with the general philosophy and traditions which have served this country well in the past.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute: &ldquo;Dáil Éireann refuses to give a Second Reading to the Bill on the grounds that:</P>
      <P>(a)  it fails to provide a comprehensive health service available to everybody based upon insurance principles;</P>
      <P>(b)  it retains the injustice of financing half of the cost of health services out of local rates; and</P>
      <P>(c)  it gives at the expense of local authorities and hospital administrators excessive powers to central government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I move this amendment on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.  I move it in a spirit of challenge and defiance, of public challenge and defiance of the Minister and his Fianna Fáil Government, who presume to say once again, after more than a decade of debate has proved otherwise to the country, that medical expenses do not cause hardship to our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1654" /> I move the amendment in a spirit of restating once again the Fine Gael philosophy of, and commitment to, the establishment in our midst of a just society, that is a society which so arranges its affairs that people with means, people with adequate income, and people of wealth contribute, when it is not difficult for them to do so, towards the insurance fund which ensures that no one is deprived of or is delayed in obtaining medical and hospital attention when necessary.</P>
    <P>We move our amendment in the conviction, which is recognised by every public representative in this country, that the rates are not the proper system for providing finances for the health services, a recognition which was spelled out in black and white in the Government's White Paper of 1966, which acknowledged that the rates were not the proper system for the financing of what they call further improvements or extensions of health services.</P>

      <P>At this time we have the principal local authority in Ireland in a state of disintegration because, after a decade of reluctance so to do, the Labour Party have at last sided with Fine Gael in refusing to be a party to an unjust system, to an unjust law, to an unjust extraction of money from the people.  In the atmosphere of that state of crisis, the State, as represented by the Minister for Health for the time being and the Government for the time being, proposes to project into the future this injustice which has been denounced by every local authority throughout the length and breadth of this land, by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour councillors alike; proposes to project, once again into the future, for later generations to suffer under, the system in which the State accepts responsibility for only one-half of the cost of the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1655" /> The Minister says it is still the policy of the Government not to charge the rates with future extensions or improvements in health services.  The Bill says otherwise.  The Bill says in section 31 that half the cost of the health services, past, present and future, will be paid by the State.  It makes allowance for a &ldquo;generous&rdquo; Government contributing more than half.  The Minister in his introductory statement said that provision was being made in this Bill so that at any time any Government could provide that their obligation would not exceed half of the cost, the half cost which is provided in section 31 and which we in Fine Gael entirely reject as unworthy, as unchristian, as contemptible, as insufficient.</P>
    <P>I shall not embarrass the Minister by thanking him for this miserable measure.  I know that Seán Flanagan, Deputy from Mayo, my one time professional colleague, an individual of generous disposition towards his neighbours, is not satisfied with this measure. I know that he sought a great deal more from the Government.  We know he has not spent idly the years since he became Minister; we know from his own utterances to the Dublin Health Authority, of which I have the privilege to be a member, from his own statements made in this House and elsewhere, that he wanted to do a great deal more.  Therefore, I shall express my sympathy with him that he has to come before this House and endeavour to justify such a mean, small-minded, begrudging and niggardly Health Bill as we are asked to approve.  Banquo wrote the White Paper upon which this is based.  It seems to me that Banquo walks tonight.  A very sad ghost must walk and I believe the Minister in his heart of hearts walks with him.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the great let-down.  It is the great denial of all that our people have been looking for.  This Bill leaves what is worst in our medical services unchanged.  This Bill does little that is good.  This Bill does much that is harmful. This Bill is evasive when it should be concrete.  This Bill is a mere shadow of what our health services should be. It strikes us in the Fine Gael Party that this Bill is a lazy and cute method <Col N="1656" /> of replacing positive proposals which could be criticised with a confusion of powers to make regulations, the extent, the worth, the application, of which we know absolutely nothing.</P>
    <P>The essentials of a good health service should be the provision of medical aid at all levels when required and the availability of all such medical aid with the minimum of difficulties, the creation of a system where such health services would be paid for out of income at a time when it would not be difficult to provide such payment.  A good health service would ensure that one would get medical attention as of right without having to prove in a time of need that one is a pauper; without having to prove in a time of need that one is destitute; without having to prove to bureaucrats or to politicians at a time of need that one is suffering from some serious and costly or malignant disease.</P>
    <P>The essentials of a good health service require that people will be free from worry in so far as it is humanly possible to provide such freedom.  The essentials of a good health service require that such a service should be free from all complications which are unnecessary.  The Fine Gael Criticism of this contemptible and utterly inadequate Health Bill arises because of the fact that, as in the past, medical attention in the future will not be obtainable free of payment at the time of need without proof of one's poverty; without disclosure of one's means and without, in many cases, crawthumping to politicians.  Our objection to this miserable measure arises because we are satisfied from the multitude of restrictions in the Bill and the greater number of yet undisclosed restrictions that the attention of a doctor and the care of a hospital will not be available immediately when required and there will be so many restrictions imposed that many people will, as they have done in the past, postpone getting medical attention until their impairment reaches such a stage that they have no alternative.  Because medical attention will be postponed for so long the cost of treatment and the cost of institutional care will be thereby multiplied.</P>
    <P>We, in Fine Gael, condemn this Bill because it does not arrange the <Col N="1657" /> finances of our society and of our income-earning community in such a way that people are enabled, without hardship, to make a small payment all the time, thereby ensuring that, when services are necessary, they can call upon those services without having to make payment at a time when their income is cut.  We, in Fine Gael, condemn this measure because we are satisfied it will ensure the continuation of a system under which people will continue to worry, not only about their sickness or disability but about the cost of trying to repair that sickness or disability.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael, condemn this measure because, rather than trying to make our medical services simpler, as we, in Fine Gael, have been advocating down through the years, and as the Select Committee of this Dáil advocated, this Bill proposes to make the system more complicated than ever. The Bill is silent when it should speak out clearly with regard to entitlement and, where it does speak out, specifying entitlement, in the next subsection it negatives all that contained in the provision with regard to entitlement.</P>
    <P>I refer specifically to section 44. Section 44 presumes to spell out those who are to be entitled to what is described as limited eligibility.  It describes as people entitled to limited eligibility persons insured under the Social Welfare Act, 1952; adult persons whose yearly means are less than £1,200; adult persons whose yearly means are, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, derived wholly or mainly from farming, if the rateable valuation of the farm or farms concerned (including the buildings thereon) is not more than £60; dependants of persons referred to in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).  When one reads on one finds that, within the same section, the Minister can wipe out section 44.  He can make a regulation at any time depriving from benefit many of the people mentioned in the section.  It may be that he may extend its provisions.  We would have no objection if he did extend them, but what we regard as rather Gilbertian is the writing into this section in a Bill of such great moment specific entitlement and then, in the self-same section, <Col N="1658" /> saying we can wipe out all that, allowing the Minister to vary it at any time in such manner as he may wish, subject, of course, to a resolution approving the draft, if passed by this House.</P>
    <P>One wonders why the Minister has gone to the bother of spelling out in the Bill entitlement to services based upon figures fixed three and a half years ago.  This ceiling of £1,200 was fixed in November, 1965.  It was extended to health services on All Fools' Day in April, 1966.  Three years later, after three substantial moves forward in earnings, the Minister proposes to fix as a ceiling of entitlement to benefits under the Act the ceiling which was regarded as suitable three and a half years ago.  Either it is applicable or it is not and, if at the time of the drafting of this measure it was thought to be unsuitable, then why write into the Bill a ceiling which is acknowledged to be three and a half years old?</P>
    <P>The White Paper of 1966, which was published after almost five years deliberation on health services conducted by the Select Committee of this House, acknowledged that rates were not a suitable form for the financing of health services.  It acknowledged that any extensions or improvements should not be financed in any part from the rates.  Yet the Government which published that White Paper now proposes in this legislation to go back on what it has published, to go back on its own acknowledgement that what it was doing was wrong, and it proposes to perpetrate a gross injustice because it proposes certain extensions&mdash;not substantial, God knows&mdash;and it proposes that the statutory obligation on the State for those extensions will not exceed any more than 50 per cent.  To us, in Fine Gael, that is a contradiction no Government can be allowed to ignore and, because of that, we are obliged to vote against this Second Stage of this Bill.  We believe this goes to the very root of our health services and it is because of the Government's failure to live up to its own admission of wrong that we now find ourselves obliged to repudiate the principles upon which health policy is based in this Bill.</P>
    <P>We, in Fine Gael, have pronounced <Col N="1659" /> our conviction that it is wrong to charge people for health services when their incomes are substantially cut through illness, disability or unemployment. We consider it is wrong to continue a system making a charge of any kind on insured workers in respect of their hospitalisation.  We have asserted, and we assert once more, our conviction that it is wrong to call upon people to make a payment of as much as 10s per day in respect of their maintenance in hospital.  The total income to our health services under the heading of in-patient charges amounts to no more than 1/60th of total health costs; the 1/60th part of total health costs are recovered in the form of 10s or smaller amounts per day in respect of in-patient treatment and maintenance. The mere preservation of this worries sick people, worries their families, costs an immense amount to administer and I suspect that, if the net cost were taken into account, you would find that figure of 1/60th would be down to 1/100th or thereabouts.</P>
    <P>Is there any point in maintaining such a system when it caters for such an insignificant part of the total service? Fine Gael think not.  If this were to be transferred from the existing system, from the present unsatisfactory system of 50 per cent contribution from the State and 50 per cent contribution from the local authorities, you would barely see a reflection of an increased cost.  Therefore, in the Fine Gael mind, it is unwarranted to continue to operate such a system which causes pain to the sick, to the suffering and to their families and which confers practically no worthwhile benefit on the community.  We are glad that the Government have finally come around to abolishing the miserable 7/6d or 2/6d charge in respect of outpatient treatment or X-ray.  There was never any worthwhile justification for these things.  For some years past the total overall contribution to health services from such miserable sums was no more than 1/600th part of health costs.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the White Paper and, indeed, long before that, we have been complaining about the delay on the part of the Government in <Col N="1660" /> abolishing these utterly ridiculous charges which cost more to collect than they ever confer in benefit on the health service generally.  If the State, the Minister and this Fianna Fáil Government are abolishing these charges one can assume from the rest of the Government's Bill that it is not due to generosity on their part but to a realisation that the collecting of these charges costs far more than it is worth. We in Fine Gael condemn this measure because it proposes to preserve the limit of 30 per cent of our population for entitlement to free medical services at all levels.  We consider that it is possible for our community, as it has been possible for all communities in Europe with the exception of the Laps in Finland, to organise a health service which would entitle everybody, as of right, to get medical services without charge at a time of need.  We have not ever heard from the present Minister for Health, from his predecessors in office or from any member of the Fianna Fáil Government any reason why we in Ireland cannot do the same as the rest of Europe.  Even countries notoriously behind in such legislation as Spain and Portugal are able to do more for their sick and infirm than we can do in this country, although we profess hypocritically to be ahead of Spain and Portugal.</P>
    <P>We reject this Bill because it makes no effort to extend the percentage of our people entitled to free medical services.  We say this in full knowledge of the reservation which some members of the medical profession have expressed regarding an extension of the number of our people who would be entitled to free general practitioner and institutional services.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland have every reason to be grateful to our doctors.  We have one of the best medical professions in the world.  They have achieved great things for our people and they have dedicated their services to our people far beyond the call of duty.  Notwithstanding our limited means, our medical men have achieved and have reached wonderful new frontiers in medical science.  They have devoted themselves&mdash;often without remuneration&mdash;to the assistance of the least privileged in our community. <Col N="1661" /> I think we can say, as regards the future, that they will do as they have done in the past.</P>
    <P>If the medical profession, at the recent conference in Killarney, expressed some reservations regarding extensions in the number of people entitled to medical assistance without charge, we must view that expression in the light of the present unsatisfactory position of what is now proposed.  We must accept that doctors are entitled to receive adequate remuneration for their services.  No trade unionist, no worker, no person who works hard and who expects to receive fair remuneration for his services, will begrudge doctors receiving adequate remuneration for their services.  The more skilled people will realise the justice of the claim for doctors to be paid according to their skill.  However, our medical profession has expressed reservations regarding the extension of the number of people entitled to free treatment because, under the system as it now exists and under the system as proposed, what would happen is that it would increase the case load of overworked dispensary and public service doctors who would receive no additional remuneration for their increased responsibilities and their increased work and, at the same time, paying patients and income properly deserved would be taken away from doctors operating in the private sector.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael are convinced that we shall continue to suffer here resentment on the part of the medical profession, caution on the part of the medical profession, fears on the part of the medical profession so long as we try to preserve here a system under which we confine entitlement to medical services without charge to only 30 per cent of our population.  If we did what every other progressive country in the world has done or is trying to do, if we opened up entitlement to medical services to all our people and the operation of them to all our doctors without reservation, we should then remove much of the fears and much of the reservations and much of the understandable caution on the part of the medical profession.</P>
    <P>The fact that it is now over three years since the infamous White Paper was published and that in the intervening three years the Minister has <Col N="1662" /> been unable to negotiate any acceptable system of remuneration of the medical profession is a terrible condemnation of the Minister and of his proposals.  It is unfair, I think, to expect the medical profession to work, as our society has expected them to work in the past, 60, 70 and 80 hours a week, and more, without compensating them for working such extraordinary hours.  Not only is it unfair: it is impossible for them to do it.  They are not doing it in other countries.  Our medical graduates are acceptable in other countries and they will not suffer a system here which will make such impossible demands upon them.  It is unreasonable to propose to the medical profession a scheme of remuneration which says to them that they are to accept a flat rate up to 10 p.m. and improved rates only after that, when there is no other vocation, profession or occupation or employment which would accept such terms.  This may be an argument which, translated into experience in the future, will result in even greater health costs than those we have previously experienced; but if this be so we must accept this as an obligation.</P>
    <P>We cannot expect our doctors to be our slaves and servants evermore without adequate remuneration and, therefore, while in common with most of our people I resent the recent resolution at the Killarney Conference of the Irish Medical Association refusing to work any system which would extend entitlement to health services, I say, with my colleagues in Fine Gael, that you must accept that doctors are entitled to fair remuneration for their services and if you would only approach our health services in the right way you would succeed in removing much of their worries and concern.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I speak from my own experience and that of other Members of the House, when I say that most doctors hardly know the value of money; their last concern at any time is about payment or rendering their accounts to their patients; but they have an obligation to themselves and to their families to ensure they receive adequate remuneration for the services <Col N="1663" /> they are expected to perform. They have performed near-miracles in the past for an inadequate income and if now, at this stage, at a time of seeming change, they assert their rights, they are entitled to assert them.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael are opposed to the new proposal in this Bill to apply a restriction on entitlement to free medical services in respect of defects ascertained in children in the course of school examinations.  As I understand it, it is proposed that in the future people who earn in excess of £1,200 a year will be called upon to pay for medical attention for their children. Now, to anybody earning less than £1,200, it probably seems that it would not be any great hardship on parents of children who are in the £1,200-plus bracket to pay for the medical care of their children, but we ought to call a halt here, for a moment to consider what the facts are.  One-tenth of our people are already earning in excess of £1,200 a year; within three years from now it is expected that one-fifth of our people will be earning in excess of £1,200 a year.  This points to the fallacy of applying, in a Bill of this nature, a ceiling of £1,200 a year.  If people are earning in excess of that figure the probability is that they are also purchasing and paying for the houses in which they are living and that they are also meeting certain other unchangeable and continuing obligations.  We in Fine Gael believe it is unjust to say to such people that in future they should be deprived of services which they enjoyed heretofore because their children are entitled to just as much as the children of the statutorily acknowledged poor and the children of the statutorily acknowledged rich.  All children should be treated alike and even the Minister will acknowledge that that should be so.  But the Bill proposes a change and proposes a change at a time when we know, as a matter of almost certain fact, that anything from one-fifth to one-quarter of our people will be deprived of free medical aid for their children within a few years because of the inevitability of increases in income.  This is a retrograde step. This is a measure which we regard as unjust by any standard.  But the degree <Col N="1664" /> of injustice is multiplied when you realise that such people are to be asked to pay even more in the future than they have in the past, through rates, for the provision of services from which because of this measure they are to be entirely excluded.</P>
    <P>We, in Fine Gael, express disappointment that the Minister in this measure is not taking steps, which in this House in reply to Parliamentary Questions he has acknowledged are justified, in relation to the treatment of people in hospital or elsewhere in respect of impairment suffered in the course of accidents where a third party is responsible for the injury.  It is beyond reason why we should not provide in this Health Bill a section whereby in the event of a person suffering injury in an accident caused on the road, in industry or elsewhere, requiring hospitalisation we could recover the costs of hospitalisation from the party responsible for the accident or the injury.</P>
    <P>The public generally do not realise just how stupid we are as a society. If a person with a blue card is knocked down on the road that person under our existing system is treated in hospital without charge.  We will just take a particular case.  The cost of the hospitalisation of that person might amount to £120 but we make no effort to recover the cost of that hospitalisation from the person whose negligence pushed the person into hospital in the first instance, because our courts have ruled that it is not permissible for a person who is the holder of a medical card to recover the cost of hospitalisation against the guilty party.  Therefore, the guilty party or his insurance company goes scot free.  What is the result?  The result is that the ratepayers pay 50 per cent of the cost and the taxpayers pay the other 50 per cent.  All that is necessary is a simple section in this Bill to provide that, where a person is hospitalised as a result of the negligence of another person, the cost of such hospitalisation and medical treatment would be recoverable against the person whose negligence caused the injury.  This would relieve the ratepayers and the taxpayers of the cost of providing for such a person.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1665" /> I cannot find any sound reason for failing to provide such a simple provision in this legislation or elsewhere. The time has long since gone when we should tolerate the Minister for Health saying that this is the matter for a Road Traffic Bill or tolerate the Minister for Local Government saying it is a matter for a Health Bill.  I think it is primarily a matter for a Health Bill. We should be endeavouring to remove from the ratepayer and taxpayer the responsibility for the cost of maintaining a person in a hospital or the cost of providing medical treatment for a person injured as a result of the negligence of another person, be it in the course of a road traffic accident, an industrial accident or any kind of accident where the injury can be attributed to the negligence of another person.</P>
    <P>I have been endeavouring here and elsewhere to obtain statistics to show the number of people receiving medical care as a result of accidents, either in hospitals or from dispensary doctors or private practitioners, and it appears that such statistics are not readily available.  I can think of one hospital in the Dublin Health Authority region which is on a major dual carriageway &mdash;I refer to Loughlinstown Hospital on the Bray Road&mdash;and, speaking from recollection, I think the position there is that up to 20 or 25 per cent of the cases in that hospital arise out of road traffic accidents.  As the Minister, from his private practice as a solicitor will know, there is hardly any road traffic accident in which negligence cannot be attributed to one or both parties involved. Certainly, damages are recoverable in respect of pain and suffering in practically all road traffic accidents and it appears to me and to Fine Gael to be entirely wrong not to recover the cost of hospitalisation and medical treatment in such cases from the negligent party.  If it could be recovered it would have a worthwhile impact in reducing the cost of health services. Therefore, whether the Minister does it or not, we in Fine Gael will be tabling an amendment on the next Stage providing that hospital and medical costs in the case of accidents which are attributable to the negligence of a third party should be recoverable from the negligent party.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1666" /> This may have some effect in increasing insurance premiums on motor cars or in relation to other insurance but we believe it is justifiable because there is certainly no justification in maintaining a system which amounts to this: that if you are going to knock down somebody on the road you should be sure to knock down a medical card case because you will not then have to pay anything for medical treatment, but if you knock down somebody not entitled to free hospitalisation it will cost you or your insurers or your employers a great deal more.  There is no justification for continuing such a system.  It amazes us in Fine Gael, in relation to a measure which is supposed to make comprehensive changes in our health services, that steps have not been taken, particularly by a Minister who has legal experience, to bring about this much required reform.</P>
    <P>I should like, personally, to express disappointment that the Minister has not taken the steps in this Bill that were promised to me many years ago by himself and his predecessor to reform the law in relation to the registration of births, deaths and marriages. This registration is at present performed by medical officers of health, but, as I have pointed out, in urban areas this means that the duty is performed by doctors who have no knowledge of the identity or activity of at least four-fifths of the people resorting to them for such registration.  In the Dublin area no more than 18 per cent of the people are entitled to general medical services which means that no more than 18 per cent of them have occasion from time to time to resort to the local dispensary.  Notwithstanding that, we continue to operate a system which requires that no birth, marriage or death will be registered unless necessary identifications and declarations are made to the local dispensary doctor who knows nothing about the accuracy of the declarations and still less about the identity of those appearing before him.</P>
    <P>The result is&mdash;I do not know if the Minister personally has experienced this but many other Members of this House have, and so have others&mdash;that if there is a child born to a Dublin family the father or mother has to go to the local <Col N="1667" /> dispensary, there to join a queue of people seeking medical treatment and wait, perhaps a couple of hours, in order to make a declaration before a person who knows nothing about the facts that are declared.  I cannot see why this measure would not be used to amend the system so as to allow such declarations to be made before any peace commissioner or commissioner for oaths and filed, without all this unnecessary waste of human time, in the Custom House or elsewhere.  When we can make provision in this Bill, as we do, for the publication of notices in relation to rat and mice infestation we should be able to provide for the relief of human misery and agony and avoid the waste of human time and effort involved in the registration of births, marriages and deaths.</P>
    <P>As regards the drafting of the Bill, may I say a word?  We appreciate the publication of the accompanying Explanatory Memorandum.  The Department of Justice, at least, have in recent years established the practice of writing into the margin of Bills references to the sections of existing Acts affected by the sections in the Bills being introduced. I urge on the Minister, if it is too late to do it in relation to this Bill, that in any future Bill produced by his Department, in the margin of the Green Bill, reference would be made to the sections of existing Acts affected by sections in the Bill.  That does help.  I appreciate that in the text there are some references to existing Acts but this is not exhaustive.  Absence of such references makes the reading of a Bill and its interpretation increasingly difficult.</P>
    <P>May I also suggest to the Minister and his advisers that explanatory memoranda should be enumerated in a different way?  It does not help in understanding a Bill to find the paragraphs in explanatory memoranda numbered in a different way from the sections contained in the Bill.  There is no point in enumerating paragraphs in explanatory memoranda unless the enumeration is similar to that contained in the Bill itself.  Taking page 3 of the Explanatory Memorandum you find that paragraph 11 refers to sections 17, 18 and 19 of the Bill.  You <Col N="1668" /> find that paragraph 12 of the Memorandum refers to sections 20-23 of the Bill.  It would be better to produce these explanatory memoranda in such a way that the section of the Bill is spelled out instead of enumerating the paragraph of the explanatory memorandum in a different way.  I do not mention this by way of carping criticism but in the way, I hope, of helpful comment so as to ensure that explanatory memoranda will be more explanatory and more helpful in the future because that I understand to be the intention of the production of such documents.</P>
    <P>If the State intended to contribute more in the future to the cost of health services there might be some justification for the proposals in the Bill to take from local authorities much of the powers which they at present have in relation to the administration of the health services but the Bill proposes to centralise authority in the hands of the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance to boot.  Indeed, the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Justice are also mentioned in this Bill as people whose almighty imprimatur has to be obtained in future to many of the things that are now conducted quite successfully by local authorities and by local health authorities.</P>
    <P>We, in Fine Gael, object in Opposition and we shall object in Government after the next general election to proposals which unnecessarily take from local level much of the powers which are at present most successfully operated by local authorities.  If there are any improvements in this Bill they stem, not from the imagination of the Minister for Health or his advisers, but from the humanitarian activities of local politicians and local health authorities who have run ahead of the Minister and have provided services even where there was, if I may say so, doubtful legal validity for the provision of such services.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Health Authority, for instance, has been providing assistance for meals-on-wheels, for the provision of home nursing and home services and for maintenance allowances for the infirm, the disabled, the blind and the <Col N="1669" /> aged far beyond what the Minister for Health recognised as being proper for them to do.  The Dublin Health Authority of which I am proud to be a member and in which we in Fine Gael are the dominant Party, have insisted on doing these things in defiance of the law because we are concerned with the provision of these health services and not with what the law says.  Rather, we are concerned with justice, reason and humanity.  Not even a Fianna Fáil Minister for Health would dare to challenge our right to do these things because if he did he would carry the public odium attached to challenging our right to do so.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, these things have to be done entirely at the expense of the Dublin ratepayers so that in so far as the Dublin region is concerned, the State is not contributing, as it pretends to contribute, 54.7 per cent of the total health cost but is contributing only 46 per cent.  Even the most anguished and the most impoverished Dublin ratepayer does not complain about the provision of many of the services which the Dublin Health Authority have been providing and which, for the first time, in this legislation are now being authorised by the State.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Health Authority know that there are other ways by which these services could have been provided. There are many people now being maintained long-term in institutional hospitals who would never be there at the colossal public expense of £20 per week and upwards if we had had in time the sanity of providing proper home nursing and proper domiciliary nursing to maintain them in an adequate state of health in their own homes and in the community.  We have in Ireland the greatest number of people per head of the population in institutions and this is because of the fact that we have a health service which is wrongly conceived.</P>
    <P>The health service is basically an ambulance or an emergency service. Of the total cost we provide only 5 per cent to protect people from falling into serious ill health.  We spend only 5 per cent on putting a fence around the cliff to stop people falling off and we spend the other 95 per cent in providing an ambulance service to pick up <Col N="1670" /> the injured, the maimed, and the sick at the bottom of the cliff and in transferring them to hospitals to restore them to the health from which they would never have diverted if we had provided a proper service to maintain them in their own homes and in the community.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael are in absolute disagreement with Fianna Fáil in relation to the health services.  We wish to provide a service which, by an increase of a mere 10 per cent in overall health costs, would reduce substantially the number of people in institutions and which would increase the amount of activity in which the general practitioner could engage to his own benefit.  We want to see a service which would reduce the amount of frustrating expenditure in which we have to engage in the building of institutions which are unnecessary to the proper care of our people.</P>
    <P>However, I shall return to the question of Part II of this Health Bill.  The interesting thing is that in the famous 1966 White Paper the construction of the health services was relegated to the very last chapter of the paper but in this Bill which, of course, is little more than a general election fanfare, most of the sections are devoted to the construction of new authorities which will not of themselves give any benefit to the community.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to abolish existing health authorities and to take powers from several local authorities which they now have in relation to health services.  He proposes to replace these with boards whose membership shall consist of persons described as &ldquo;persons appointed by the relevant local authorities&rdquo;, with &ldquo;persons appointed by election by registered medical practitioners and by election by members of such ancillary professions&rdquo; as he by regulations may specify.  However, in relation to this, it is fair to point out that these boards will not be representative of local authorities and will not be representative of the ratepayers.  In fact, they will not be representative of the taxpayers either.</P>
    <P>There might be some justification in changing the system if the State were <Col N="1671" /> acknowledging in this Bill that it would accept more responsibility for the financing of health services but that is the very thing that the Minister is at great pains to avoid in the Bill.  He is not going to accept responsibility for any more than 50 per cent of the cost of the service.  He proposes to take from local authorities the powers which they now have.  Persons appointed by the relevant local authorities to a health board are not to be less than half of the total membership, which means that they probably will not be getting any more than half anyway.  The other members of the new health boards are to be appointed in the first instance by the Minister.  They are not to be elected.  One can very properly ask why the Minister is not proposing to allow the medical profession and &ldquo;ancillary professions&rdquo;, by which I presume he means pharmacists and others, to elect their members to the first boards.  Is it because the Minister fears he might not have control over them?  I believe that is the reason.  If the Minister was genuine in his intention to have those bodies democratically representative of the community and the profession he has had three years in which to conduct negotiations with the medical profession and ancillary professions to ensure that they would set up the necessary system of election for appointment to those boards.</P>
    <P>What has the Minister done in the last three years?  Nothing, absolutely nothing.  He has done absolutely nothing to get those bodies interested in setting up the machinery for electing their own representatives to those boards.  Whether it be this Government or any other Government which are in power in this country, it is fair to say at least a portion of the people appointed by the local authorities will be in sympathy with the Government of the day.  Therefore, what this Bill is proposing to do is to set up in place of the existing health committees or local health authorities a system under which more than half of the representatives will be the creatures of the Minister, will be the creatures of the Government of the day, afraid to offer criticism, never with the guts to stand up against the Minister and always <Col N="1672" /> anxious to carry out his whims and fancies.  One suspects that some of those appointees will be people promoted out of the Department of Health to facilitate promotions within that Department, which has never been slow to create bodies outside itself in order to facilitate promotions within the Department.</P>
    <P>Those new boards are not provided for in this Bill.  The number of them or the construction of them is not provided for in this Bill.  Although we have had three years in which the Minister has had ample opportunity for discussion with the relevant local authorities in regard to the organisation to be provided in the future, there is no provision made for these boards in this Bill. It is not good enough to say that any regulation to set up the boards must be approved by Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann.  The Minister and his advisers know it is not an infrequent experience that regulations are put on the Table of this House which are never properly examined because of the multitudinous pressures and distractions operating here.  It is wrong to bring in a Bill in the closing hours of the Eighteenth Dáil to establish new health authorities and new health boards in this country without spelling out exactly the authorities, the powers, the regions and areas that these health authorities are to govern.</P>
    <P>On section 5, I would ask the Minister a question which, as a lawyer, he will understand.  Section 5 sets out the general provisions regarding health boards and states what the powers and liabilities of the boards shall be.  Section 10 sets out the general provisions regarding the joint health boards.  If you go to section 40, subsection (3) you will find bodies for the co-ordination and development of hospital services. There is a distinct difference between the provisions applying to the new health boards, the joint health boards and those other bodies.  I should like to get some clarification as to why there is variation, as set out in this Bill, in the provisions applying to all those bodies.</P>
    <P>I now want to refer to section 7, subsection (3) which provides for the membership of local committees which are to include members of the council <Col N="1673" /> of the county or county borough for the relevant area.  It is not clear here that the members of those local committees will be members of the relevant health boards.  While one would have a certain desire to see maximum local representation given, it might be undesirable to have people on local committees such as are envisaged in section 7 who would not be aware of the problems of the regional committee.  It would be preferable to ensure that at least some members of the health boards would also be members of the local committee.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer now to section 12.  This provides that each new health board&mdash;I understood the Minister to say there will be eight of them&mdash;will have a chief executive officer.  It is provided that before the establishment of a health board the Minister may request the Local Appointments Commission to select a person for appointment as chief executive officer.  We would prefer to see that left entirely to the Local Appointments Commission.  We resent the provisions under section 12, subsection (9) whereby the Minister may make a temporary appointment of a chief executive officer.  We ask ourselves if this means that the Minister may choose, before the establishment of a health board, his own particular nominee, that this nominee may operate for some considerable period of time before the Local Appointments Commission are asked to make an appointment, thus giving the Minister's appointee preference when the pernament appointment arises.</P>
    <P>We consider that to be objectionable and unnecessary and we would urge on the Minister that he would deprive himself of that power of temporary appointment.  We believe it is perfectly feasible for the Minister to ask the Local Appointments Commission to make the necessary selection before the bodies themselves come into operation.  It should not be necessary in any circumstances for the Minister to make his own preferential temporary appointment in advance.</P>
    <P>Section 23 contains something which, although I understand the meaning of it, could easily be understood to mean something else.  I refer <Col N="1674" /> to subsection (2), paragraph (b) which states:</P>
    <P>an even number of other persons of whom half shall be selected by the Minister from a panel of persons nominated by such organisation (or organisations) as is (or are), in the opinion of the Minister, representative of the class of officers to which the officer concerned belongs, and half shall be selected by the Minister from a panel of persons nominated by the chief executive officer to the health board.</P>
    <P>I would suggest the replacement of the fourth last word, the preposition &ldquo;to&rdquo; by the word &ldquo;of&rdquo; and it might be further clarified by the insertion in the second last line of the words &ldquo;persons nominated for that purpose&rdquo;, that is the purpose of the removal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and I propose to table an amendment, but the matter is so obvious that the Minister might wish to anticipate me by making the necessary amendment.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to section 30 as evidence of the kind of unwarranted new restriction which the Minister seeks to impose upon local authorities and health authorities and which we in Fine Gael believe is being applied, not for the purpose of improving the health services, but of preventing their further improvement.  I believe that the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Government are concerned at the extent to which local authorities and health authorities have run ahead of them.  They are concerned that public opinion, as expressed through the local politicians, is ahead of the State and has forced upon the Government, an unwilling Government who do not believe in social justice, a Bill for meeting the cost of a service which our people say must be met.</P>
      <P>Section 30 proposes for the first time in our health legislation a limitation on expenditure by health boards which is phrased in the following words:</P>
      <P>A health board shall not, save with the Minister's consent, incur expenditure for any service or purpose within any period in excess of such sum as may be specified by the Minister in respect of that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1675" /> We, in Fine Gael, consider that that section is too restrictive and too absolute.  It is a crippling restriction which is deliberately framed as such to prevent any further improvement in our health services, to prevent the kind of improvement and humanitarian advance which has taken place in recent years, notwithstanding the best efforts of Fianna Fáil to stop it.  This is provided so that no development or improvement can take place, no relaxation of the penal health code can occur unless it receives in advance the benediction of the Minister.  We are now replacing the experience of men in the field, the local dispensary doctors, the social welfare workers, the local politicians, with the say-so of officials in the Custom House who are far removed from the urgent needs of the people. We believe this is a retrograde step. Health services ought to be tuned to the immediate personal needs of the people.  They ought to be responsive to human problems and human difficulties. God knows they seldom, if ever, percolate through the corridors of power to the isolated Minister for Health and his advisers in the Custom House.</P>
    <P>Do Deputies realise what section 30 means?  Under this Bill, instead of a health authority being able, as in the past, to say: &ldquo;Whether the Minister wills it or not we must provide and will provide such a service&rdquo; in future they cannot provide any service until the Minister gives his advance approval.  If in the future a health authority estimate that the number of medical card cases which they may have will be 20,000 and receive the Minister's approval to that figure, no chief executive officer, no employee of the health board concerned can give to the 20,001st person applying a medical card without receiving from the Minister for Health the necessary advance approval.  All the discretion, all the degree of responsibility which local officials and local health authorities have been able to apply in the past to human situations, to personal problems, is dissipated, is melted, is destroyed beyond redemption by this Bill and by section 30 in particular.  In other words, as long <Col N="1676" /> as there is a Fianna Fáil Minister for Health in power any further improvement in our health services is blocked, is destroyed, is nipped in the bud.  We in Fine Gael regard this as deplorable in the extreme and as contrary to the interests of our people.</P>
    <P>Section 31 is the basically objectionable section at which we take umbrage in paragraph (b) of our amendment because it retains the injustice of financing half the cost of health services out of local rates.  In case there was any doubt regarding the Minister's intention in section 31 he was kind enough to explain himself in his opening statement in which he said that the purpose of retaining it was to allow the Government at any time to return to the 50 per cent limitation which is imposed by section 31.  This is in total conflict with the White Paper that was published by this Government when they were sweeping with a new broom in the autumn of 1965 and in the spring of 1966, in which the Government acknowledged that health services should not be paid for to any great degree out of the rates.  Notwithstanding that acknowledgment, limited and begrudging as it was, that it would apply only to future extensions of the health services or what they called improvements, this section 31 contradicts the Government's own three years old admission that rates should not be used to finance any extensions to or improvements of the health services.  Can we have confidence in a Government who contradict their own White Paper and take three years to do it, three years of doing nothing, three years which resulted in the failure and disappointment of this utterly inadequate Health Bill?</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to section 35, paragraph 9, page 20 of the Bill which provides that:</P>
    <P>The Minister may by order provide for the transfer of any specified health institution to a regional hospital board and may in such order provide for the application of any provision of this section to such transfer in the same way as it applies to a transfer to a health board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1677" /> The effect of this would appear to be to entitle the Minister to give away property belonging to a local authority, property which was built at the expense of the local authority, property which had been maintained in the past by a particular local authority and to give it away in such a manner as would deprive at least some of the people within the area of the local authority in question of the benefit of the services of such an institution in future.</P>
    <P>It may well be that a re-orientation of our health services required the pooling of resources, particularly capital resources, and a better use of them.  We suggest, however, that, if this power is sought by the Minister, he should also provide that he can increase the grants to be made from the Exchequer to such local authority as is deprived of an institution, to compensate it in respect of rights and opportunities and property lost in an institution so given away.</P>
    <P>In regard to Part III I want to refer to section 39 which provides:</P>
    <P>Whenever a health board is satisfied that useful service is being or will be rendered to persons requiring institutional services by the provision of such services in an institution in its functional area, the health board may, on the request of the governing body of the institution and with the consent of the Minister, provide for the institution any land which is shown by the governing body, to the satisfaction of the health board, to be required for the efficient performance of the functions of the institution or for the purpose of restoring or enlarging it.</P>
    <P>I understand that the 1947 Act extends the meaning of the word &ldquo;land&rdquo; to cover any property.  It does not just refer to &ldquo;land&rdquo; without any hereditaments. I want to urge upon the Minister that the provision in relation to institutional services needs expansion, and that we should not confine it to institutional services in the nature of what has up to now been understood by institutional services, that is, services in relation to in-patient care in hospital.  We should also provide that the kind of gift or donation or acquisition which is provided for in section 39 <Col N="1678" /> can be given in respect of societies which provide home care, or day centres, or anything of that kind.  It should not be related only to institutional care which suggests treatment for people in bed, or in-patient treatment. It should be possible to allow gifts to be given to the multitude of voluntary associations which are providing meals on wheels, clothing, home nursing, home social welfare care, and other treatments of that kind for people who can and should be maintained in their own homes and in the community. I would suggest that section 39 does not go far enough.</P>
    <P>In section 40 the Minister proposes to establish by regulation a body to be known as Comhairle na nOspidéal.  We in Fine Gael resent, in relation to this section and other sections, the fact that so much is not done in this Bill which could be done, and that, in default of doing it in this Bill, it is proposed to do it by way of regulation.  Comhairle na nOspidéal will obviously be a very important authority in the future.  We believe that whatever the Minister has in mind, whatever he vaguely describes in the section itself, should be spelled out in particular detail so that Members of Dáil and Seanad Éireann can properly assess it.  There is no provision, as I understand it, to have the regulations made by the Minister establishing Comhairle na nOspidéal reviewed by this House or by the Seanad.</P>
    <P>It is sought in this Bill to give power to the Minister to establish a body which will interfere radically with the running of the voluntary hospitals, which will jeopardise the authority and responsibility of the local authorities, which will interfere with the religious orders and dedicated and charitablydisposed people who own the voluntary hospitals in the running of the hospitals in the future.  We are not prepared to give the Minister the kind of dictatorial powers which he seeks by way of regulation in section 40.  We believe they are not warranted.  They certainly are not justified by anything the Minister has said to date or in his opening statement.  The scope of dictatorship which the Minister seeks in section 40 is not warranted by any of the needs <Col N="1679" /> for the better running of the voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>I now move to Part IV which deals with the new norms for testing eligibility for the health services.  Section 43 proposes to replace the Victorian formula which entitles people to free medical services if they are unable out of their own income or other lawful means to provide the services with a new and equally objectionable phrase which entitles them to the services if they are &ldquo;unable without undue hardship&rdquo; to arrange the services for themselves. This is giving new life to the means test.  This is once again drawing across our society a new boundary, a new division between people with means and those without means.  It is proposing to establish once again in relation to the health service an apartheid, a distinction which is not justified by our requirements.</P>
    <P>Up to now objectionable and all as the Victorian formula was, it was left to each local authority to interpret it according to their own experience.  We appreciate that this has meant a tremendous variation, a variation of from 18 per cent of the population entitled to free medical services in the Dublin region, to as much as 50 per cent of the population in the Carlow area and other areas and providing for an average entitlement of 30 per cent to free medical services.  This might point to discrimination and inequality of treatment, but it may also point to a system which is responsive to local needs and requirements.</P>
    <P>It is proposed now to replace this with a new formula which is unknown, new regulations which are yet unstated, new rules and new tests which are not to be adaptable to local requirements and needs, or compelling necessities of any individuals, prepared by the Minister according to rules which at this stage he is keeping to himself and will not disclose to the House.  I appreciate that it is provided that regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House but, as I mentioned earlier, that is not an adequate protection because our experience has been that the daily pressures on the services of politicians are such that <Col N="1680" /> regulations of this kind, which go to the root of the availability of health services, may well pass without getting the kind of examination they would receive if they were provided in a Bill such as this which is supposed to be so momentous.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael appreciate that in accordance with the undertaking by the Government in their three year old White Paper, and in accordance with the undertaking repeated by the Minister to recent conferences of the medical associations, it is not proposed to increase the number of persons entitled to free medical and institutional services. We in Fine Gael consider this to be wrong, to be against the interests of our people.  We consider that the Minister's suggestion does not answer the needs of our people and on that account we will vote against it.</P>
    <P>We do not believe that it is true to say, as Fianna Fáil say in the White Paper and as the Minister repeats today, that hardship is not caused to 70 per cent of our people by medical expenses. It is caused.  Day in and day out and week in and week out, there are families suffering hardship and want and considerable worry in paying for medical services and many families amongst that 70 per cent of our people are undergoing that kind of unnecessary suffering and hardship and loss and misery because Fianna Fáil assume that they are doing all right and refuse to come to their help.  We in Fine Gael reject that because we know that, whatever Fianna Fáil statistics may suggest to them, the experience of life proves to the contrary, and I suggest that even the Minister for Lands should acknowledge that what I say is true.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier section 44 and I shall not advert to it at any length except to reiterate that section 44 suggests that certain people are to be entitled to what is called limited eligibility.  The level of entitlement fixed by the Bill in that section may be completely destroyed by the section itself which allows the Minister to wipe out of existence altogether by regulation a section or the Bill itself.  We resent both sections 43 and 44 because they <Col N="1681" /> both ensure that medical services will not be available either on full eligibility or limited eligibility without proof and they require, as in the past, that medical services should not be available unless people go cap in hand to some local official or to a politician.</P>
    <P>In section 45 it is proposed to introduce a new restriction.  At present people who are regarded by a local authority as being in receipt of an income in excess of £1,200 a year may appeal to the Minister against such assessment, but the appeal lies to the Minister.  Now it is provided under section 45 that the appeal may be to a person being either another officer of the health board or a person, not such an officer, appointed or designated by the Minister.</P>
    <P>We do not consider it is worth while providing an appeal to another official of the same health board as has rejected the application in the first instance.  Any health board will operate under a certain policy and if one official operating that policy turns down an application, it is practically inevitable that an official of the same health board will turn down the appeal. That is the end of the appealing provisions in this section.  The sure way of killing people, the sure way of blocking a person from getting benefit is for the Minister to appoint the appeals officer from the health board which refuses the first application.  We consider this to be wrong.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting to realise that even where the appeal lies not to an authority independent of the Minister or the local health authority but to the Minister himself, as now operates, up to one-third of the present appellants succeed in their appeal.  That is a very large proportion.  The Department of Health are not noted for generosity, but nevertheless one-third of the persons who appeal against the findings of the local health authority succeed in their appeal, because the appeals are made to some person who is independent of the local authority concerned. We believe it is wrong that, as is now proposed, the appeal should be made not to the Minister or the Minister's Department but to another official within the authority which has turned <Col N="1682" /> down the application.  This is a worthless appeal.  We in Fine Gael think it is an effort to reduce the number of successful applications.  We regard it as highly objectionable.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to say if I am right in assuming that for the first time there is a right of appeal against the refusal to grant a GMS card, that at the moment there is no such right of appeal but that now it is proposed to give that right.  We would regard that as desirable and as an advance, but we think it is a pity that, if that advance is, as I understand from the Minister's nod, being made, the Minister should make the retrograde step of seriously qualifying the existing right of appeal in relation to what is called the middle income group.</P>
    <P>Section 48 is a provision which entitles the health authority to recover charges from people who receive benefits without entitlement to them.  Can the Minister say if this entitles a health authority which has maintained a person in an institution or has provided medical care for a person to recover from the person's estate when the person dies the cost of providing such care?  This matter, to say the least of it, is in some doubt.  There is at least one law case pending on this issue of whether or not the health authority may recover from a deceased person's estate the cost of maintaining the deceased in a mental institution during his lifetime, the estate consisting of farm lands which could not be converted into liquid assets for the purpose of paying for care during the person's life.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that it is proposed in this Bill to provide that a dependant's income will not be taken into account in ascertaining entitlement to service in the future.  It may well be that a case can be made for recovering from a deceased person's estate the cost of that person's maintenance during life, but if it is proposed to do this, I would suggest it ought to be spelled out in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The case I have in mind is that of the maintenance of a person for 30 or 40 years in a mental hospital. The only property was an under-used piece of land whose capital value is quite substantial.  I think the claim of the health authority would be for about £12,000.  If the land were sold for £24,000, one can see the moral justification for the recovery of money from the estate, particularly when it might be some remote relatives who could not have cared less about the deceased who might benefit if the local authority did not recover the money.  It is the kind of problem that ought to be provided for here because it is fair to argue, I think, that distant relatives, or others, should not benefit where the community has been bearing the cost of the maintenance of people in institutions. At the same time it is highly desirable that there should not be any resort to the capital of the infirm or the sick, mentally or physically, but it is permissible, in my opinion, and proper that the State should recover from the estate of such deceased persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 52 refers to the right of a person entitled to treatment under the Bill to opt for in-patient services of his or her own choice.  We will all agree it is desirable that people should be given that choice.  However, it is also provided that the Minister may make regulations to prescribe the payments people may make or which will be made to such people in respect of such treatment.  I would urge that such payments by the State or the local authority in respect of services provided for people making their own choice should not be less than what the State or health board has to pay in respect of treatment in a public hospital.  The practice to date has been that the State has paid less in respect of people making their own choice than it is prepared to pay in respect of those who go into public wards.  The result has been that the State pays a great deal more because the State is driving into public wards far more people and the cost to the health authority and to the Exchequer is <Col N="1684" /> much greater than if people made their own choice and received a payment from the State commensurate with what the local authority is paying in the public wards.  I would urge on the Minister that he should be generous when he comes to make regulations under this head.</P>
    <P>Under section 57 (2) provision is made to enable the Minister to refund the actual expenses incurred by people obliged to purchase drugs and medicines and medical and surgical appliances.  I paraphrase the section because my reading of it is that it entitles people to a refund of actual expenses.  At the moment many people who are not entitled to general medical service card benefits are enabled to obtain drugs or medicines and medical and surgical appliances and they are entitled to receive the benefit without paying the bill.  They are entitled to receive these things either direct from the health authority or on receipt from the health authority of an authority to them to go and collect the equipment or the drugs.  My reading of section 52 is that, in future, whether they have the money or not, they must pay the bill before they get any refund or assistance from the health board or from the Department.  We regard this as providing assistance too late because the effect will be that many people will postpone getting the kind of drugs and medicines or medical or surgical appliances which they can now get by making arrangements with the health authority in the first instance.  We would urge upon the Minister that he should take a second look at this and ensure that the necessary assistance is given at the time of need and that it is not postponed until such time as the bills are paid because, if it is left as it is at the moment in this section, the people will in many cases put off getting the drugs, medicine or equipment until they fall over the cliff and land at the bottom; then they will have to be carted away into an institution and maintained there free of charge.</P>
    <P>We, in Fine Gael, and the Dublin Health Authority welcome the provision which enables a health board to provide home nursing without charge.  We have been giving this service for many years, with no assistance <Col N="1685" /> from the State, and entirely at the expense of the local ratepayers, but it has had this beneficial effect: for the first time in 30 years in Dublin, notwithstanding the increasing population of elderly people, we now have as of today no waiting list for institutional care for old people.  That is because we have kept these old people at home in good health.  We have prevented old people from going into institutions. Heretofore, until we provided home nursing for the old and infirm, the only care for such people was in St. Kevin's, in St. Mary's, or somewhere else.  They could join the queue awaiting entry and, if they survived until they had reached the top, they were in, but often too late to be cured.  Now we provide out-patient clinics in St. Kevin's and St. Mary's and old folk centres which constantly review the old people, advise them and provide medical services for them.  The result has been that we have been able to reduce substantially the number of old people looking for care in costly institutions, in which the cost of the care is five to six times greater than the cost of keeping them at home and in the community.</P>
    <P>On section 59, might I express some reservations?  The section says that a health board may make arrangements to assist in the maintenance at home of sick and infirm persons or their dependants or of persons eligible for institutional assistance under section 54 of the Health Act, 1953, without charge or at such charge as the chief executive officer of the board considers appropriate.  This again confirms what is being done by many health authorities, including the Dublin Health Authority, but it does not go far enough.  A number of health authorities are at the moment providing assistance for widows and children.  A widow is not necessarily a sick and infirm person or a person eligible for institutional assistance but, because the health authority provides some kind of home help for a widow with young children, the widow is able to go out to work and thereby provide an adequate income for the home.  I suspect this is an omission through accident and not through design and I would urge that <Col N="1686" /> another look be taken at the section to ensure that cases of that kind can be provided with home help.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be carping in my criticism.  The Minister knows my generous heart.  It expands as big as Deputy Burke's at times.  Section 62 repeats, 3½ years after the famous White Paper, the promise to increase maternity grants from £4 to £8.  I do not know, and the Minister does not know as of certainty, on what the maternity grant is spent, but I think it is fair to regard it as &ldquo;beer money&rdquo;. The increase from £4 to £8 does not even compensate for the increase in the price of beer since 1953, when the grant was last fixed at £4.  If you are going to have a maternity grant to assist a mother who has given birth to another citizen you ought to make it something decent, like £20 or £25, and not just a miserable £8.  I understand the price of the pint when the maternity grant was £4 was 1/2d and that was after Deputy MacEntee's famous hairshirt Budget of 1952.  The price of a pint of beer today is anything between 2/7d and 3/-.  The beer money to celebrate the birth of a new citizen is not even sufficient to compensate for the increase in the price of beer.  It is unworthy: it is miserable.  If it is proposed to increase it at all, make it something decent to allow the mother to buy some clothing or pay enough to buy a pram or some other necessary equipment for the child.  A sum of £8 would not go very far in these days. It is not worth spelling out in a 15line section in such a Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 63 proposes to provide milk for mothers and children where the parents are unable, from their own resources, to provide the children with an adequate supply of milk.  This certainly goes back to the Queen Victoria formula.  Again, either we should be generous about providing this or we should leave it out altogether.  I do not think it does anything which is worthwhile spelling out in this section. It is certainly not doing anything which is not already being done by any health authority worthy of the name.</P>
    <P>Chapter V deals with other services. It provides that a health board shall make dental, ophthalmic and aural treatment and dental, optical and <Col N="1687" /> aural appliances available for persons with full eligibility and persons with limited eligibility.  This is repeating a section that is already in the 1953 Act and that is not being implemented. There is no penalty clause here applicable to the Minister or to any health board which does not implement it.  Is there any sanity in asking this Legislature to enact a section of this kind when the State fails to take the steps necessary to ensure that a health board is in a position to apply it?  It is like saying that a health board shall keep everybody alive&mdash;full stop&mdash;and nothing more.  We need to do a great deal more to ensure that they are in a position to provide these services. Otherwise, we should not go through the mockery of suggesting in a Bill that we are going to provide something that, in fact, we are not going to provide.  This leads to justification for the conclusion that this is no more than a bit of window dressing which must be put in the window because it was promised years ago&mdash;even before the last general election&mdash;but, because of its absence, it had serious consequences for the Government at the last election and it must now be inserted here before the Government are found wanting twice over.</P>
    <P>Section 66 deals with rehabilitation services.  I should like to make this comment.  Subsection (2) provides that, for the purposes of subsection (1) of Section 66, a health board &ldquo;may provide and maintain&rdquo; premises, workshops, farms, gardens, materials, equipment and similar facilities for rehabilitation.  Under present law it is provided that health authorities or local authorities may make &ldquo;arrangements for the provision of&rdquo; these premises, workshops, equipment, and so on.  Why the change in terminology? It suggests that health authorities are to be stopped doing in future what they may now do, namely to provide grants, subsidies, equipment and premises to voluntary bodies which are giving premises, workshops, farms, gardens, materials, equipment and similar facilities for the education and re-training successfully to work of physically and mentally disabled people.  I would urge upon the Minister to take a look <Col N="1688" /> at this.  We, in Fine Gael, believe that much of this work is better done by the voluntary agencies than by the local authorities or by any institution of State.  The section as it is drafted suggests that the obligation is an exclusive one and would not entitle the health authorities or health boards to give assistance to other people in these things.  I suggest we ought to be aiming at an expansion of help to voluntary bodies, and I think it is in the mind of the Minister, judging by utterances I have heard him make on many public and, indeed, on private occasions.</P>
    <P>I shall not refer to Chapter VI except to say once again that we are horrified at the extent to which this House is not legislating for health reform but is being asked to give to the Minister and to faceless officers untold powers to interfere with existing and future health codes.  We think it is entirely wrong.  Public health is a matter of sufficient understanding by everybody in our community to be put before this House and for the lines to be laid on which the engine of the health services can run.  We think it is wrong that from this Dáil and from Seanad Éireann we should delegate this terribly important responsibility to people who will not be answerable to this House or to the community in general.</P>
    <P>On section 75, my comment is primarily one for Committee Stage. Of all things, it deals with the Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919. Having regard to the many omissions in this Bill one might wonder why we are dealing with that Act, but I gather that it is because of a request by at least one health authority so to do. Section 75 provides that, notwithstanding section 11 of the Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919, whenever a health board is unable to trace the occupier of land, a notice under section 5 of that Act may be served by affixing the notice on or to a gate, door or a prominent part of the land.  The degree of inability is not quite satisfactory. I think it ought to read &ldquo;...it is unable after reasonable efforts...&rdquo; or something of that nature.  Otherwise, the section as drafted will still leave health authorities in a state of uncertainty as to whether it is now open to them, having made certain efforts, to affix notice to the <Col N="1689" /> land.  Primarily, this is a matter of drafting.  Being a lawyer, the Minister will understand the difficulties which arise in relation to the service and the giving of notice, and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  I am moving away from it now.  I would appreciate an explanation by the Minister of section 76, the understanding of which, I am afraid, has somewhat escaped me.  It may purely be an accounting formula: I suspect it is.  However, it is not quite clear in itself&mdash;even with the reading of section 31&mdash;what is intended.</P>
      <P>On behalf of Fine Gael, I should like to express disappointment that the Minister proposes to transfer public assistance from health boards and health authorities back again to local authorities.  If public assistance has any meaning it is because it provides social service because it provides subsidies to individuals to keep them and their families as healthy, viable human beings.  Public assistance is essentially a social service.  Mark you, it is proper to say it should not fall on a local authority and it should not fall on a local health authority or local health body.  It ought to be conducted by the State Welfare Department but as long as the State is unwilling to accept responsibility for this, which we in Fine Gael believe it ought accept, then if it is to be left at local level it should be left to the health authority which has some experience in and understanding of human problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to say that there are not many public assistance cases which are not health cases as well and the kind of case problem which arises for relief in the field of public assistance is the kind of case problem which comes under the notice of the public health nurse, the social welfare worker, the local dispensary doctor and the multitude of people concerned with human beings and their health problems.  It is beyond us why the Minister is now proposing that public assistance, which has been successfully conducted by health authorities for many years past, should be transferred back to local authorities, to the sanitary sections of the local authorities, to the section of <Col N="1690" /> local authorities concerned with sewers and rat infestation and leaking roofs and so forth.  Public assistance is a human problem; it is not a structural problem or a sanitary, physical problem and ought to be preserved within the responsibility of health authorities or health boards, it does not matter what you call them.  Certainly it should be left to the care of those dealing with human beings and not those dealing with the physical problems which are the prime concern of the sanitary section of local authorities.</P>
    <P>We believe that the proposal in this Bill to transfer public assistance away from the health authorities back to the physical, sanitary services is an effort on the part of the Minister for Health to put a brake on the development of the health services.  This is the clear message in all sections of this Bill, that the local people, the local authority and the people themselves are running ahead of the Minister and the Department and making demands which the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party are not prepared to accept and want to apply the brake of central authority to stop all this.  We have had that in many sections of the Bill and here we have it in relation to the service of the last resort, the public assistance, and we in Fine Gael find that that is wholly unacceptable.  That is why, although we appreciate the possibility that our political opponents will take unfair advantage of it because we so do, we in Fine Gael have decided to oppose this Bill because it preserves most of what is wrong. It does little or no good and if it does any good it more than destroys that good by the amount of harm it does. It proposes little or no improvement in our health services but it is making certain that beyond yea or nay as long as the Fianna Fáil Government remain in power and as long as they have the control they now seek under this Bill there will not be one more whit of improvement in our health services, the improvements which everybody with a conscience desires, improvements which everybody in pain or suffering has a right to demand of our community.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons that we oppose this Bill.  It fails to provide what the White Paper said it would at least <Col N="1691" /> examine.  It fails to provide what the Minister himself accepted as worthy of consideration, a comprehensive health service available to everybody based upon insurance principles.  It retains what the White Paper, the Minister and many Fianna Fáil Deputies and councillors, including Deputy Joe Dowling, have accepted as being wrong, the injustice of financing half of the cost of the health services out of the local rates.  I have heard no person denounce that in more vehement phrases than Deputy Joe Dowling in the Dublin Corporation and in the Dublin Health Authority and I will be looking forward to hearing his equally vehement condemnation in the course of the debate on this Bill.  I have no doubt that what you need in public life is responsible people, people of spirit and responsibility and I am sure he will refuse to lend any support to a Bill which continues what he and his colleagues in Dublin Corporation accept, and keep shouting that they accept, as being wrong.</P>
    <P>We reject the Bill because it gives excessive power to the central Government without any additional burden being accepted by central Government for the cost of the services.  The only justification of the White Paper for interfering with the rights of the local trations is spelled out in the last chapter in the White Paper, in which they state to the Health Bill, in which they state there is no justification for any interference unless the State is going to bear additional costs; if the State is going to bear additional cost then the interference must take place.  This Bill says: &ldquo;50 per cent, thus far and no further&rdquo; and having said that it says: &ldquo;We are going to wipe your eye and take away powers you had.&rdquo;  We regard that as wholly unacceptable.  May I finish on a personal note by sympathising with the Minister on having had to justify such a miserable piece of legislation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully admit to a failure on my part, after a long and careful study of this Bill, fully to understand it.  I do not feel ashamed of that because the same admission has been made by newspaper correspondents and political observers, by Irish Medical Association doctors, by radio and television personalities and local government officials.  I admit to being somewhat bewildered by the phrasing of the Bill, by the regulations in it and the various other matters which are all part of it, to a most unusual extent. What the people will think of it, the people the Bill is supposed to serve, and I presume interest, is anybody's guess.  Seasoned newspaper personnel who can usually grasp things and clarify difficult phraseology admit that they see little in the Bill except difficult cross-references and so on.  It is impossible to assess the value of the Bill until we realise what regulations the Minister will make.  Therefore, I propose to treat the Bill on the basis of reserving judgment until we may get, through discussion on the various Stages, more detailed information from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan, for one who put down a motion refusing the Bill a Second Reading, made an amazingly long attempt to discuss it in full.  I have not the ability, perhaps, nor the eloquence and certainly not the hard neck to go through the tortuous performance we have had here since about 7 o'clock. If the Bill is so innocuous or useless, the Deputy took a very long time to say so.  I could say it much more <Col N="1693" /> quickly.  I propose to give the Bill fair consideration.  I told the Minister for Health on the Estimate that I would examine the Bill on behalf of the Labour Party and consider it and see what, if any, good points it contained. Such points would have the support of my Party.  We believe in gradual progress.  Points in the present Bill that would improve present standards would certainly get our support.  If there are objectionable features, we shall oppose them.</P>
    <P>While I did not expect the Bill would come up to what the Labour Party would desire for the people we hoped that at least certain things would emerge.  As far as I can judge, there are advances, but where these are of a definite character they are very limited.  In his opening speech on the question of eligibility for a medical card the Minister quoted the old Poor Law phraseology that was enacted in the 1953 Act in regard to notification of entitlement to a medical card&mdash;unless you are unable to provide for yourself, and so on.  The change in this 1969 Act is not wonderful.  It means the very same thing&mdash;unless you cannot provide for yourself you will not get a card.  That is only a point of interest that is of very little importance; what matters to those on the receiving end is whether they get the card or not.</P>
    <P>What we like are the improvements. I freely acknowledge that the new eligibility test will be based only on the earnings of a man and his wife and not on the combined income of the family.  That is an improvement which merits the support of my Party.  Under the 1953 Act originally eligibility depended on the income of the bread-winner of the family and dependants, I think, who were over 16 years of age were entitled to a medical card in their own right provided their income did not exceed a certain amount.  But, under the new regulations made under the 1953 Act, these benefits were lost because the total income of all people earning and living in the house was combined.  A vast number of families were thus deprived of the useful benefits of a medical card.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to assess the value of <Col N="1694" /> the power the Minister is taking to define by regulation the classes of people who will be eligible.  If it means that he will define, say, old age pensioners, and widows and orphans as eligible and, as I would hope, all who are insurable under the Social Welfare Acts, that would be a further improvement. I do not know what the Minister will do but at least he is taking power to do something.  Prior to this, eligibility was based on a variety of considerations. What the county manager or an executive officer in County Tipperary thought was right was not what somebody in Wexford or Waterford thought was right.  There was no uniformity.  With the new system let us hope we will have uniformity and that people will know their rights and that there will, perhaps, be less need for them to appeal to local representatives or politicians to fight cases for them. It is an improvement but how good it will be is difficult to say.  Certainly, if the Minister uses this power as I hope he will, it will do a certain amount of good.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the power the Minister is taking to vary the degree of eligibility by regulation in cases of limited eligibility.  I think the Minister is wise in giving himself this power and I see this as an improvement.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Ryan refer to the right of appeal to the Minister.  I was very keen on this and I pressed the Minister's predecessor, the late Deputy O'Malley, to have this right of appeal provided.  Having given the right of appeal, I would be disappointed if the Minister adopted the tactics Deputy Ryan suggested he might adopt, of appointing an official of the same authority that had refused the application to try the case again.  If that were done the right of appeal would not be of any value, but I do not believe any Minister who would bother to introduce the section would contemplate such a procedure.  My only fear is that, because of the almost complete authority that will apparently rest in the Minister's hands on most questions, a right of appeal to the Minister will be much the same thing.  Let us hope it will be something like the right of appeal in the case of old age pensions <Col N="1695" /> and that appeals officers will be appointed who will decide things, something on the lines of old age pensions appeals.  To take a case from one individual and let somebody else have a look at it is, I think, an advantage and I welcome that change.</P>
    <P>I have found a number of improvements in the Bill.  There are omissions and things with which I disagree but I want to be fair and point out what I hope will be good.  Where an in-patient in a hospital has a certain choice, where he can opt, for instance, to go to a nursing home instead of a hospital or somewhere other than the local authority hospital, I think he is in a better position than he was formerly.</P>
    <P>One particular individual who suffered an accident at work opted to go to a doctor whom he knew would put him back at work almost immediately.  Since he did not go to the local authority he could not get any refund of medical fees because under the Act governing occupational injuries he should avail of his local authority doctor.  However, in his opinion the local authority doctor was not capable and so the man went to somebody else.  Under the new regulation, I believe, he would have that right and I think it is only proper that he should have that right.</P>
    <P>The abolition of special charges for out-patients is a good thing.  This had more of a nuisance value than anything else.  While 7/6d may not seem a lot, it could prove quite expensive for a person who had to have a number of X-rays at 7/6d each.</P>
    <P>The detection of children's defects for those other than in the national schools also is a very good thing.  The fact that children even in pre-school days can be treated and can get corrective medicine and surgery is a very welcome change.  On the question of children in the higher income group, I heard Deputy Richie Ryan speaking about the one-fifth and proving that one-tenth at the moment will gradually become one-fifth.  I do not think one will find a great number of children of the higher income group in national schools.  There is not a lot of validity in the arguments he made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1696" /> The main advantage that I see in this Bill is the choice of doctor.  This has been a long and badly-felt want.  I have known of numerous cases where a good doctor-patient relationship could not be possible because of the fact that a person was compelled to attend a local dispensary doctor in his area and that person, in private life, might have had a difference of opinion with the doctor only a week before-hand or, worse still, his wife might have had a difference of opinion with the doctor.  In circumstances like that, it was desperate to find that a person had to submit himself for treatment to that doctor, notwithstanding the fact that the doctor would be more than likely to treat him to the best of his ability.</P>
    <P>I am glad, too, that it will be possible to get drugs from the local chemist, in whom the person will have confidence.  These are advances, perhaps limited, but, in my opinion, they are very worthwhile advances.</P>
    <P>The question of limited eligibility for drugs in the cases of long duration illnesses is also covered in the new Bill, but I think that this was fairly well exercised even under the old Act. It certainly was in my local health authority.  But perhaps this was due to the pressure we exercised on them and due, too, to the very fine type of county managers we have had, both the late county manager and the present one. Nobody suffered any great hardship as long as they went through the proper channels and sought the help of the officials there.</P>
    <P>The increase in maternity grants is also very welcome.  The increase from £4 to £8 will be an advantage to the type of person who needs the money. I know there are isolated cases in certain places where the money is used to buy drink but I do not think that that should be used as a reason for ridiculing the grant.</P>
    <P>I find a lot of good points in the Bill but, as I promised when I spoke on the Health Estimate, I shall treat the Bill as I see fit and the points I am making now are my personal views. I give them for what they are worth and, where I come across things I do not like, I will be just as frank about them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1697" /> The easing of the means test for dental, aural and ophthalmic surgery is very welcome.  Eligibility will now depend on the income of the man and his spouse.  This is something which I very much appreciate.  The real value in the improvements to the Bill are, in my opinion, the choice of doctor and the fact that persons can go to their own chemist for drugs.  There may be many other improvements in the Bill but we shall know this when we know what regulations the Minister intends bringing in.  There are odd dangerous sections in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The question of 10/- a day for the middle-income group is removed and the Minister may fix an amount.  Now you know 10/- a day is the maximum. At least you are guaranteed it will not be more than that.  It could be anything from 1/- up. Under the new regulations, what happens if the Minister says it can be 15/-, £1 or 25/-?  That certainly would not be an improvement.  I would like it spelled out that there will be a maximum charge for days in hospital over which it cannot go.  I am not too happy that the Minister will just have the power to make the regulations for this.  This is one of the bad effects of the Bill which I see.  I will be endeavouring to persuade the Minister, or I will be endeavouring at least to make a case, that he should not or cannot go beyond a certain limit.</P>
    <P>Section 68 is a section where authority is being given to health boards to carry out tests for certain diseases.  It strikes me from the drafting of the section, which I do not want to read out now, that in those cases there will be compulsion.  I would like to see a provision that no person will be compelled to accept those tests, that they will be taken only of a person's free will.  This may be a very small point.  While I appreciate that most people would be very willing to accept the tests and that the health board will have the power to carry them out I do not think there should be compulsion because if compulsion comes into it there will be much less ready response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things I hoped to see in the Bill was that all insured workers would be covered.  I believe and understand from what the Minister has said in his opening speech that the cost of health services lies very heavily, right up to the top, on the middle-income section.  I believe that much of the man days lost is caused by this.  An enormous figure of man days lost was given to me by the Minister for Social Welfare in reply to a Parliamentary Question. I have mislaid it but I know the number completely outweighed the number of days lost by strikes, whether official on unofficial.  If medical services were made available right up to the insurance limit of £1,200 it would repay itself and much of the time lost by sickness would be recovered, less hospitalisation would take place and there would be less medical attention needed.  The mere fact that people have to pay £1 to a doctor for a visit, which means a lot to a man earning £13 a week, plus the cost of prescriptions, forces people to keep going until they reach the stage where they are compelled to drop out and give up employment.  When this happens there is a long stay in hospital and very often people develop chronic illness which lasts for the rest of their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought that under the new Bill the question of hospital charges, even the 10/-, would be abolished.  I know the maximum of 10/- is very rarely charged.  It is certainly not charged in many local health authorities.  The charge varies from a couple of shillings a day and in the case of a long duration of illness a nominal sum per day is accepted.  Nobody feels that 10/-a day is an extraordinarily heavy charge but if it is imposed over a long period it involves great hardship. Say a person falls and breaks a hip and is in hospital for nine months. The 10/- a day for that period represents a considerable sum of money to that person.  I hoped all hospital charges would be abolished.  There is also the threat of having to go to court because of non-payment.  The Minister admitted that to sue a person with limited means in order to recover money is not a profitable exercise. That is the reason why I hoped this <Col N="1699" /> type of hospital charge would be dropped.  I do not know what the cost would be but I should imagine it would not be extraordinarily high.  It would probably be only £250,000 or so over all the various voluntary and local authority hospitals and so on. I should imagine that the administrative expenses offset would be about £150,000.  I also hoped there would be absolute choice of doctor, specialist and hospital, but I see there is not. That would certainly have been a great improvement.</P>
    <P>On the question of new boards, I disagree somewhat.  I know we must have new boards if there is a regional control but I still feel the local authority representatives, the people elected by the people, should have at least a majority on these boards.  I know they are catered for as to one-half the membership of those boards but the Minister can nominate the other half and also reserves the right to nominate the chairman and vice-chairman.  If they are opposed to one another, one anti-Minister and the other for the Minister there is an equal balance.  The appointees of the Minister are the deciding factor here.  This is a great loss to local authorities in regard to their rights to be adequately represented on those boards.  I recognise the fact that doctors, nurses and pharmacists have a right to be appointed but local authorities, the representatives of the people and the ratepayers should have the largest representation and the final say.  The nominees of the Minister on such boards would not have to be elected.  The elected representatives should have a majority.  If you had two from, say, Waterford, two from South Kilkenny and two from Carlow that would be all right.  I would like the majority of the board to consist of public representatives.  I would want the election of a chairman and vice-chairman to be the right of the elected representatives rather than of the nominees of the Minister.  The members of local authorities are the representatives of the people who pay the piper and they should be entitled to call the tune.  There is a good deal to be said against the system of appointments suggested in the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1700" /> I read with interest that the Minister said to the IMA that he was prepared to sit down with them and discuss this with them and if there were difficulties he would iron them out.  I wonder would he extend the same courtesy to Deputies who would be anxious, not maybe to sit down with him, but to stand up before him and put their points of view at a later Stage, say, Committee Stage?  Would he agree to give them the same co-operation as he has promised the IMA?  I agree he must co-operate with the Irish Medical Association and it is only right he should hear their views and accept them as far as he can but I warn the Minister that this Bill is for the people not for the IMA&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or the doctors, and I would like to see the interests of the patients put first.  Certainly improvements should be made for the other people but the Bill is for the patients.  I would ask the Minister to remember that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make one other point.  It relates to the Children Act, 1908, and the Adoption Acts.  The Minister is aware of the unpleasant tragedy which took place in Waterford when an adopted child lost its life in circumstances of which I am sure the Minister is well aware.  I have not mentioned the matter here before because for a period it was <i>sub judice.</i> Somebody was being tried before our courts. The fact is that the same thing could happen again.  Our local authority nurses have not got the right in certain cases to carry out the provisions of the Children Act in relation to children adopted under the two new Acts.  I feel it is the duty of the Minister to implement amending legislation to the Adoption Acts.  If the Minister has examined the Waterford case he knows that that baby should not have been handed over to the care of that woman.  It was done illegally because she was not competent within the terms of the Acts to accept the child. It is the duty of the Minister and I appeal to him to plug the loop-holes and to see to it that adoption regulations will be enforced vigorously <Col N="1701" /> and enforced by the nurses of the local authority.  They are the most competent people to carry out the work of supervision.  As well as being social workers they are midwives and people with a high medical skill.  A child, whether adopted or not, needs regular attention.  A child is usually adopted by a woman who admits, by the very fact of taking the child, that she has no previous experience of the handling of infants but wishes to do a good act and needs the assistance of qualified, experienced people.  However, as I understand it, under the Adoption Acts nurses have not even the authority to visit these adopted children if they have been put through private adoption societies.  I would ask the Minister to examine personally that position and if necessary to bring in, either by regulation or, if necessary, by amendment of the various Acts, some safeguards so that the Waterford tragedy will not be repeated and so that we will learn from that case and thus safeguard other lives.</P>
    <P>I should like to promise the Minister my support and the support of my Party for the parts of the Bill that we feel are some improvement.  The Bill is not anything like what we had hoped for, but we know that you just do not go forward immediately.  Even in the event of the Labour Party coming into power at the next election they could not immediately introduce a complete social health service.  Any step forward will meet with our approval.  The only regret we have, I think, is that the Bill has been so obscured by the various regulations, amendments and sections that it is very hard to get to whatever value it contains.  Let us hope that on the Committee Stage we will be able to examine the Bill more closely and perhaps do something to improve it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Before commenting on the Bill I should like to pay tribute to Deputy Kyne for his very fair and constructive contribution.  It was in sharp contrast to that of Deputy Richie Ryan who made one comment which was worthy of Boyle-Roche.  He said the Bill did no good but if it did any good that good was undone by the Minister.  I do not know what to make <Col N="1702" /> of that but it certainly was not a constructive contribution to the Bill.</P>
      <P>A Health Bill is one of the most important Bills that can come before the Oireachtas.  Before going into detail on the Bill we should examine our attitude to a Health Bill and find out what a Health Bill seeks to attain or what it should seek to attain.  It should not only preserve that which is good in preceding legislation but it should try to improve and should try to eradicate any defects in previous Acts.  In this latter half of the twentieth century it is very necessary that any health legislation we enact should, apart from ensuring that the ailing body shall be tended, also ensure that the dignity of the individual is preserved to the highest degree.  We have seen in neighbouring countries Health Acts being brought in, containing some provisions which surely cry for vengeance, provisions which reduce people to the lowest form of living or perhaps of dying.  I am referring to Acts in other countries which allow practices which are the very negation of the dignity of a human being.  While we in this country have not yet had to face the problems that other countries have had to face, even though we are a small country we could perhaps, by our outlook and in our legislation for the care of the ailing and the old, set an example that might remind those in permissive societies of decent living and the need to ensure dignity of the person.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House believe, and I am sure this belief is shared by the people in the Opposition Parties, that as far as our resources will allow any ailing person, whether he is suffering from an organic disease or has merely grown old, should be given the best treatment that our medical schools and our physicians can provide.  Indeed, by profiting from what is good in other countries, we should be able to boast that no person because of lack of means will be without the necessary medical care to restore him to good health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill seeks to bring that about as far as we possibly can.  We have had many Health Acts since the State was founded and no doubt each of these brought some improvement.  It <Col N="1703" /> is very easy to be emotional when discussing Health Acts.  During the last 20 years we had displays of emotion over Health Acts which contributed little to improving these Acts, though they may have sounded well and perhaps impressed a section of our people who do not think too deeply.  This day is passing and the people realise now that the Government are doing their very best to give us a really good health service.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill which one cannot absorb in one hour's reading.  I am sure the Minister will be helped by Members of the House after a thorough examination of the Bill and, if necessary, it can be amended.  On reading it, one realises the vast amount of work the Minister and his officials have put into it.  It is a step forward. Of course there are defects in it but these defects are there, not because the Minister does not want to remove them, but because of the fact that our resources are not unlimited.</P>
    <P>We must be factual.  We must get the best possible medical services for which the people are prepared to suffer taxation.  It is being realised more and more that a completely free health service is a mirage.  We have heard in other countries the slogan: a health service free for all; but we must realise that there is no such thing as a free health service.  It must be paid for in some way.  Therefore it is our duty to ensure that the people who can pay will pay and that those who cannot pay will have the best possible service.</P>
    <P>When a wage earner is in hospital he has the additional worry of wondering how he will meet his hospital bill. This worry must be removed so that when he is better he can lead a full life without having to face a colossal hospital bill.  We know that we cannot have a perfect society and that no matter how hard the Minister tries to bring in a perfect Bill he cannot do it, but we must do our utmost to help the Minister and his advisers to perfect this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are several sections which one could dwell on for quite a long time. In the time at my disposal I do not propose to do so, but I wish to refer to <Col N="1704" /> certain categories of our people who are suffering.  I want to refer particularly to the aged in our institutions.  It is not good enough to pack an old person into an institution and say: &ldquo;There you are.  Society has done its duty.  You are packed into an institution. You will not starve.  You will have shelter.&rdquo;  I suggest that we must go further.  We must ensure that, even though it is sometimes necessary to put old people into institutions, this does not become the pattern.  We must strive to keep our old people at home. The Minister has helped to do this by the provision of the home nursing service. We must seek to maintain the dignity of the old.  This will cost money, too.  It is very easy to put an old person in a home and leave him there but that is not enough if we intend to build the society which we all want to see.</P>
    <P>We must go further and ensure that the old person or the mentally retarded person is not just cast into an institution and forgotten.  We must provide the best possible service because our treatment of the old and the mentally handicapped is one of the things which preserves a proper balance in our society.  In other countries old people are subject to many dangers in institutions, so much so that they fight to the last before going into an institution because they are afraid of the fate that awaits them there&mdash;and not from natural causes.</P>
    <P>On this aspect we must have regard to the nurses in these institutions who dedicate their lives to looking after these people.  We must ensure that these nurses and doctors are paid the highest salaries possible.  Unless we have a contented medical staff in an institution it will not be a good institution.  These nurses and members of religious orders must be made aware of the fact that we are behind them and that we recognise the work they are doing.  We must play our part in ensuring that they are rewarded financially.  Of course there are many religious orders who do not think of a reward in that way but, at the same time, we must ensure that they are not taken for granted and that society appreciates their efforts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1705" /> Parents of mentally retarded children have the frightful worry of wondering what will happen to the children when the parents die.  The Minister spoke yesterday at a function outside this House and he gave very satisfying statistics showing that the number of places for these children is increasing all the time.  Until medical science can overcome such problems as mental handicap, if ever, we must show that there is a place for them in our society. If necessary they must be put in institutions and, if not, our outside services must cater for them.  While institutional treatment is sometimes necessary, and sometimes the only answer to particular problems, it is also very costly indeed.  If you examine <Col N="1706" /> the figures you will find that hospitalisation eats up a tremendous amount of money.  Therefore we should try to keep people out of institutions.</P>
    <P>I made a suggestion before in relation to local clinics having a mobile squad of doctors and nurses who could perform minor operations in the homes.  If the maternity hospitals in this city and other cities can provide such a service I do not see why we cannot have it extended to cover simple ailments.</P>
