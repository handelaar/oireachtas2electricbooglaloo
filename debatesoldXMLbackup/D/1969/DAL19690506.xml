    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the total imports from Italy during the year ended 31st March 1969 or to the nearest available date; the exports to Italy for the same period; and what action is contemplated by the Government to correct the imbalance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney) (for the Taoiseach) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney) (for the Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>Particulars of trade with Italy for the year ended March, 1969, are not yet available.  During the year ended the 28th February, 1969, imports from Italy amounted to £8.1 million and exports totalled £1.8 million.</P>
      <P>Imports, into Italy and other countries of the European Economic Community, of the main agricultural products are subject to EEC regulations. Since 1966, the import levies on cattle and beef have brought our very valuable export trade in these products with the EEC almost to a complete standstill. Representations in the matter have been made to the EEC Commission and member states of the Community. In the case of dairy products, imports into the EEC from Ireland have ceased.  The Community itself has a vast surplus of dairy produce, the disposal of which is affecting world markets generally.</P>
      <P>Where we have an adverse trade balance with another country, such as Italy, our aim is to improve the position by encouraging the expansion of exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="452" /> Trade promotion, as well as the promotion of other foreign earnings, is a priority function of our embassy in Rome, which will continue to make itself available to assist Irish exporters interested in the Italian market.  A senior officer of the embassy is engaged full-time on this work.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the wide range of grants, incentives and services which the Government have made available to exporters, through Córas Tráchtála, has recently been expanded by the introduction of new incentives and services aimed at stimulating and assisting a more rapid development of exports to markets other than Britain. The full range of grants, incentives and services applies to exports to Italy.  I might add that Córas Tráchtála propose to carry out market investigations in Italy for selected products later this year.</P>
    <P>I hope that the additional incentives which the Government have made available will encourage Irish manufacturers to increase their efforts to expand their exports to such countries as Italy.  In the ultimate analysis, it is on the efforts of the exporters that our prospects depend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, who is replying for the Taoiseach, not agree that the incentives have been a failure and that we now have an adverse trade balance with Germany, France and Italy of almost £40 million? Should something not be done to encourage trade with those countries? During the past year we purchased £6 or £7 million worth of goods from Italy that could have been manufactured at home.  I refer in particular to shoes and clothes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the time has come when we must say to these countries: &ldquo;If you are not prepared to <Col N="453" /> purchase from us, we shall not purchase from you&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's assertion that the incentives have failed does not give a clear picture of the position. The Deputy must concede that difficulties brought about by EEC regulations have affected us.  We have been endeavouring to do all we can in this direction.  On the other hand, may I say to the House and to all people concerned that if every person in the community were as concerned about the adverse balance of payments that we have with some of these countries as the Government are they would not buy these foreign produced goods but would stimulate the sales of our own goods?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that despite the individual adverse balances that may exist with these particular countries, the success of our export incentives and of all the services that the Government have provided to assist exports has been shown in the returns of record exports that have been building up year after year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by CIE that rapid transit lines invariably involve far heavier capital expenditure than conventional mainline railways.  For example electrification and automatic sophisticated signalling would be required with the result that more and not less subsidy would almost certainly be involved.</P>
      <P>Foreign experience is that all rapid transit systems for commuter services have to be heavily subsidised by the Government or municipal authorities.</P>
      <P>This is not to say that rapid transit lines might not be justified but this could be established only after a comprehensive transportation study covering all forms of commuter transport, private and public, and taking full account also of the other community interests which are obviously affected, i.e. business and housing developments, preservation of existing or development of new amenities, environmental changes etc. CIE and the local authorities are carrying out an examination of the issues involved in Dublin.  The problem is a complex one and will require considerable time and study before firm proposals can emerge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley (for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish printing firms, known to have the capacity to produce the telephone directory, were invited to discussions with officers of my Department before the invitations to tender for production of the telephone directory for the years 1970 to 1974 were issued.  The purpose of these discussions was to discuss type faces, layout, etc., so as to ensure that conditions which Irish printers might <Col N="459" /> not be able to fulfil, would not be included in the invitation to tender.  Two of the printing firms concerned produced sample lists of subscribers' names and telephone numbers as an indication of type faces available. Apart from this, I have no knowledge of any work being done by a printing firm in connection with the 1970 telephone directory, the contract for production of which has not yet been placed.</P>
    <P>I am aware that printing unions were perturbed about a clause in the invitation to tender for production of the telephone directory for the years 1970 to 1974.  The insertion of the clause in question, which required firms tendering to furnish precise details, if they planned to have any portion of the work done outside the country, was in accordance with standard contract procedure in my Department.</P>
    <P>A proposal to have a substantial portion of the work connected with the production of the directory done outside the country would not be acceptable in present circumstances.  I am concerned, however, that the telephone directory should be as up to date as possible at the time of publication and I am not prepared to exclude the possibility of a small proportion of the work being done outside the country, if this would result in speedier and more efficient production at economic rates.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the views of the Acting Taoiseach today run entirely contrary to what the Minister has just said or are we to take it now, when the Ministers say as much work as possible should be done in Ireland, they mean as much as possible so long as they are not found out sending it abroad?  Does the Minister not agree that this is not a question of CIE calendars, that it is a question of the telephone directory for the coming five years?  Is the Minister aware that what actually was done was, first of all, arrangements were allowed which gave an unfair advantage to certain contractors and, secondly, the company which made the arrangements with the German organisation was given an unfair advantage over other interested <Col N="460" /> parties?  Does it not appear as if the question of having this work done in the State means something different? The Minister feels this work cannot be done in the State.  In effect, that is what he is just saying, and we are now getting it done on the Continent in order to have a directory which we can read and it does not matter how many people are left out of employment as a result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is putting words into my mouth which, of course, I did not use.  The simple facts of the matter are these.  There have been developments only very recently in the printing industry as a result of which certain firms here have computer and other arrangements which necessitate a very small amount of work being sent abroad and being done in a very short space of time as compared with that in which it could be done previously.  Until this development took place it was not necessary to have regard to the particular clause to which the Deputy has referred because there was no question of any of the work being done outside this country.  But because of this development, it was necessary to have regard to this clause in order to ensure that the preference for Irish firms was given.  To do this it was necessary to ascertain exactly how much of the work is being done in this country and how much outside. This was for the benefit of Irish firms.</P>
      <P>Secondly, as I have indicated in the reply to the question, it would not be accepted at all that anything other than a very small proportion of the work being done outside the country would be satisfactory for the purpose of giving a contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <P>Would the Minister take it that if in future the Government say that some of the work can be done out of the country they mean in effect that all of it must be done in the country?  Surely the Minister must in this instance insist&mdash;and he is answering for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;that all of this work which is simply routine work, no matter what way the Minister may like it wrapped up in technical terms, can be done in this country?  Surely we are <Col N="461" /> satisfied with the type of telephone directory which can be printed here and we need not send to Germany to have it done, particularly if this results in people being left unemployed in the city here as a result of it?  Surely at least the telephone directory could be printed here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>As reported in the public press, an application was made to me on behalf of a group including Independent Newspapers Ltd., the Irish Press Ltd., the Irish Times Ltd., the Cork Examiner and the Creation magazine group for a licence to operate an international commercial sound broadcasting station, based in Ireland.  This application was dated 10th April, 1969.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amending legislation would be necessary to enable me to license any organisation other than Radio Telefís <Col N="462" /> Éireann to operate a public broadcasting station here.  Apart from the considerations of policy which would be involved in changing that position, the long and medium wavebands are, as is well known, seriously congested.  The feasibility of operating a high power station here giving international coverage without causing harmful interference, and violating international agreements to which we are parties, has been examined from time to time by engineers of RTE and of my Department, but no satisfactory solution has been found nor has one been offered in any of the various proposals for commercial radio that have been made to me by interested parties over the years.  Obviously I would have to be satisfied on this aspect before other aspects could be considered.</P>
    <P>The question of entering into negotiations with the group has not therefore arisen.  If such a valuable broadcasting concession were available for grant to private interests, the normal procedure would be to invite applications from all interested parties.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister seen a report in the papers in the last few days stating that smuggling had now reached a figure of about 10,000 pigs per week from Northern Ireland? Does the Minister believe that this is so, or is it half true?  If it is true, is it not a serious situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been various reports in the papers.  Their estimates of this smuggling business have varied from 1,000 per week to 10,000 per week.  As I have indicated in the reply to the question, I am not in a position to give any reliable estimate as to what the volume of this trade is at the moment.  I would certainly feel there is such a trade going on.  The cause of this is that our prices here are more attractive than the prices which can be obtained for certain weights of pigs on the other side of the border. We have had almost continuous contact with the Revenue Commissioners, whose business it is to try to prevent this practice.  However, I must repeat that I have not any reliable estimate of what is really taking place.</P>

On this plea, and on the assurance that all the fish processed in the firm's factory from fish imported in this way under licence was for reexport and that all home caught fish would be given priority, the limited <Col N="468" /> licence was granted.  It was on the understanding that it would mean workers would not be paid off that we granted them this limited licence.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government what steps are being taken in accordance with good urban renewal planning practice to make sure that no local authority makes urban plans without first discussing the proposals with all affected parties and with residential or business interests in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Urban renewal schemes will normally be the subject of objectives contained in the development plans made under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  Those whose property would be affected have the statutory right to make their views known when the plans <Col N="473" /> are publicly displayed in draft form. Having considered any objections or representations made as a result of objectives about urban renewal contained in the draft plans, it is a matter for the planning authorities concerned to decide whether or not to retain the objectives in the final plans.</P>
      <P>Direct action by the planning authority to secure renewal may not be necessary.  The general pattern seems to be that urban renewal policies are flexible and that most planning authorities would welcome action by the private interests concerned in carrying out desirable renewal schemes.  In some instances private interests come up against serious practical difficulties in trying to secure agreement between a number of owners in order to assemble an area of reasonable size and shape for development.  In such cases it may be essential for the planning authority to intervene if re-development is to take place at all. Such re-development cannot, of course, go ahead unless and until the planning authority secure possession of the property in the area concerned and they can only do this either by reaching agreement on disposal terms with the private interests affected or by seeking to acquire the property compulsorily. If compulsory proceedings are resorted to, the owners and occupiers can object to the Minister and a public local inquiry would have to be held before any decision on the relevant compulsory purchase order can be reached.  I am satisfied that the interests of owners and occupiers of property in areas that may become the subject of renewal schemes are fully safeguarded in law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that good urban renewal planning practice requires that people be consulted before plans are prepared, and does he accept that Dr. Lichfield, in relation to the central Dublin planning area, pointed out that his mandate did not permit him to consult with the people before drawing up his plan, and that he considered that would be a difficulty?  If the Minister is aware of these things, as he must be, will he ensure that in future consultation will take place before the preparation of even the first draft plan in cases of <Col N="474" /> comprehensive urban renewal such as that which is contemplated for the centre of Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is open to local authorities to provide that such consultation should take place.  Of course, what the Deputy refers to as the Lichfield plan is not a development plan. It is merely an advisory document and a plan is to be made by the planning authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</b><i>(Cavan)</i> asked the Minister for Local Government what steps are being taken to consult with all property occupiers in central Dublin affected by the Lichfield Plan, to ensure the least possible disruption of business and fair compensation; and if he will particularly require that full and frank negotiations take place with the people concerned before any further deals are made by the Corporation or its agents with outside interested parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The document which the Deputies describe as the Lichfield Plan was an advisory document commissioned by the planning authority for a part of the central city area.  I understand that in the revised statutory draft development plan for Dublin which is now on public display no part of the area in question has been designated as an obsolete area within the meaning of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, but that the area is described in the draft plan as a comprehensive development area where it will be the policy of the planning authority actively to promote and assist re-development. It is open to any interested parties to make objections and representations to the planning authority with regard to the contents of the draft plan and such representations and objections must be considered by the planning authority before the final plan is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only firm proposal for re-development of part of this area of which I am aware is a re-development scheme which has been proposed for an area of about seven acres bounded <Col N="475" /> by Moore Street, Parnell Street, Chapel Lane and Sampsons Lane.  I understand that this scheme was the subject of detailed discussions between local interests and representatives of the planning authority before any steps were taken to try to put it into effect. The planning authority decided to make a compulsory purchase order for the area affected and to enter into negotiations with a private development company, which was already the largest landowner in the area, with a view to having the proposed re-development carried out in partnership with the planning authority.</P>
    <P>A compulsory purchase order was accordingly made and submitted to me for confirmation in June, 1968.  Objections to the order were received and a public local inquiry was held in September and October, 1968.  The evidence given at the inquiry will be fully considered by me before I make a decision on whether or not the order should be confirmed.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the interests of existing property owners and occupiers in the so-called Lichfield area and in any other area which may become the subject of urban renewal proposals are fully protected by law.  There is nothing to stop the existing owners and occupiers from carrying out re-development themselves but in many cases it may be essential for the planning authority to use their powers to ensure that comprehensive renewal schemes are undertaken.  Obviously such schemes can only go ahead if the planning authority are able to take over all the properties affected and they can only do this either by free negotiation or by invoking compulsory powers in order to acquire them.  If they seek to acquire the properties affected compulsorily, owners and occupiers have the statutory right to object to the Minister and to have their objections considered at a public inquiry.  If property is eventually taken over as a result of a compulsory purchase order which has been confirmed by the Minister, the parties affected are entitled to compensation and, where appropriate, allowances for disturbance and loss of goodwill.  If the amount of compensation cannot be <Col N="476" /> settled by agreement, the matter must be referred to the official arbitrator for settlement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister ensure that Dublin Corporation will not so actively promote and assist foreign development, in secret, that the interests of people who are actually working or living in the area are harmed and are overlooked because that, I suggest, is what has been happening? The corporation have been assisting foreigners in secret and Dublin people who have worked there and are giving employment in that place are being ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is so.  As I pointed out, the interests of the people concerned in the area are adequately safeguarded and what the planning authority have been doing is promoting the renewal and re-development of this particular area but, as I said, objections have been made, a public inquiry has been held, and the report will be considered in detail by me before any decision is made.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 44 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the January-March quarter of 1969, approximately 64 per cent of persons borrowing house-purchase loans from local authorities had incomes of less than £1,050 a year.  The remainder, almost without exception, had incomes not exceeding the limit of £1,200 a year.  The value of applications for loans with local authorities at 31st March, 1969, was £9.4 million compared with £6.1 million at 31st March, 1968.  On these figures, the existing income limits clearly do not inhibit <Col N="482" /> the successful operation of the scheme, and I do not propose at present to increase them.</P>
    <P>Local authorities may advance loans, without reference to the income limit, to tenants of local authority houses who surrender their tenancies on getting a loan and to persons whose loans are financed from sources other than the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <P>The determination of income for loan purposes is, by law, a matter for the local authority.  Authorities generally determine income by reference to gross earnings, but I advised them by circular letter H.6/68 of 17th May, 1968, to adopt a liberal interpretation in assessing overtime, where, for example, a person has worked an unusual amount of overtime in a particular year in order to accumulate funds for the initial deposit on a house, on marriage.</P>
    <P>Supplementary grants are outright cash payments to the recipients.  House purchase loans are repayable by the borrower on terms which generally cover the full cost.  Different limits for grants and loans are, therefore, not anomalous and I do not propose, at present, to widen the loan scheme in the way the Deputy suggests.</P>

      <P>Article 11 of the Dublin Parking Bye-laws 1962 provides that the driver of a motor-vehicle must comply with all directions given to him by a garda in uniform in relation to the parking of a vehicle or its removal from a place where it is parked.</P>

Is it not the position that a garda may not issue a direction based upon the personal convenience of Ministers who may be in Government Buildings and want to have their cars parked near the door?  There is no obligation on members of the public to respond to a request.  A direction must be based upon a statutory provision.

    <Col N="490" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The child concerned was not a foster-child, in the sense in which that term is normally used.  It was a child placed with a view to legal adoption and a widely-publicised allegation that legal adoption would have been impossible because of the ages of the prospective applicants, or one of them, is based on a misreading of the Adoption Acts and is without any foundation.  The placement is governed by the Adoption Acts and the Health Authority, as such, has no function in the matter.</P>
      <P>The child was placed with a view to legal adoption by a registered adoption society who arranged for the transfer of the child from another family who were temporarily taking care of it.  The society had obtained testimonials from several responsible people as to the suitability of the proposed adopters and their own inspection of the home also gave a very favourable impression.</P>
      <P>As it turned out, the placement had a tragic end.  The child died, apparently as a result of beatings administered by the adoptive father who was thereupon charged with murder.  A jury found him not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.</P>
      <P>The Adoption Board is the authority with statutory responsibility for supervising adoption societies and dealing generally with adoption.  The board has carried out a full investigation and are satisfied that no blame attached to the adoption society.  I am not prepared to go behind the decision of the board.  I do not agree that anything should be done that would amount to putting in the dock the members of a private, charitable organisation against whom the only charge was that they failed to do well a charitable work which only they and societies like them are willing to do at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In justice to those concerned, I can also say that both the board and adoption societies in general are conscious of the need to ensure that the safeguards to be adopted are kept under constant review.  As it happens, this particular society, of its own volition and with a view to achieving the highest possible standards in its work, completely re-constituted itself last year and is now, with the help of a <Col N="491" /> number of additional members, operating a much more elaborate system of examination of cases than obtained previously.</P>
    <P>This, I am glad to say, is typical of the attitude of adoption societies in general.  Far from objecting to supervision by the board, these societies have welcomed such supervision, as a means of helping them to achieve their own objective of securing the highest possible standards in their work.  If, however, it were to happen that a society failed to exercise proper care in the placement of children for adoption, the board would have ample powers to take remedial action.</P>

      <P>Before the House adjourned on Thursday evening I was <Col N="492" /> speaking of the serious drug problem which seems to exist in the city of Dublin and in other parts of the country.  I stated that the problem seems to be getting progressively worse and that drugs are being peddled in clubs, schools, public houses and other places where young people meet.  I thought the time had come when everybody interested in the welfare of society, in the welfare of our young people&mdash;and this included not alone the parents or relatives of these unfortunate people but also teachers, clergy, politicians&mdash;should take an active part in trying to eliminate this scourge which seems to be gripping our people.  Taking up any of the daily papers one sees headlines on this subject: &ldquo;Gardaí in City Swoop&rdquo;; &ldquo;Nearly Died After Drug Party&rdquo;; &ldquo;Drugs.  Desperate Men Answer SOS&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It looks as if we of this generation have failed the young people.  This situation is an indictment of our failure to provide adequate ways and means for these young people to get rid of their superfluous energy.  I believe prevention is much better than cure.  I am not certain that the Minister has anything to do with it, but I believe there should be more clubs, sports fields, <i>et cetera,</i> properly supervised, so that our young people could meet and engage in more healthy recreation and pastimes.  If they did, it might keep them away from drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are rather slow in dealing with the drug problem.  Sufficient clinics to treat drug addicts should be set up and set up immediately before the problem gets any worse.  As far back as 18th October, 1966, I raised this question in the House.  I asked the Minister for Justice when he intended to introduce legislation so that clubs where drugs were available could be subject to the same controls as dance halls.  The Minister said he had read the report in the paper to which I had referred and that the Garda had no knowledge of the kind attributed to them.  He further told me he had no legislative proposals under consideration in relation to clubs of this kind, but that the Minister for Health had already stated in reply to a question on 5th October, <Col N="493" /> and I quote: &ldquo;that he intends to introduce legislation in relation to the possession of certain drugs and related matters.&rdquo;  That is almost three years ago, and although I asked questions recently, we have not even yet been told that the Minister intends to introduce legislation but that a working party has been set up.  Much valuable time has been lost, and we should have learned the lesson that they have learned in England.  In England in 1962 they were saying there was no problem; now they all admit they are faced with what can only be described as an awful problem affecting the community and afflicting the youth of that country.  I went on to ask the Minister was he aware that drug addiction was a potential danger among Irish people, that now was the time to nip it in the bud.  I further asked him was he aware that as regards drug addiction Professor Wilson said in Trinity College on 12 the October, 1966:</P>
    <P>If we do not make our plans now for its prevention, Ireland will have the same problem in the field of drug dependence that faces other countries in our western civilisation.</P>
    <P>That was very good advice from Professor Wilson at that time, but the Government, in their arrogance, refused to listen to it.  Is it not now the time to take steps to cure this scourge?  Deputy B. Lenihan, when Minister for Justice, said, when the problem was brought to his attention:</P>
    <P>I have no responsibility for hysterical newspaper reports or professors' reports.</P>
    <P>That was Deputy B. Lenihan, Minister for Justice.  Valuable time has now been lost in coping with this problem. Had the problem been tackled when that advice was given it would not have reached the dimensions it has today. Some years ago precautions were taken to avoid the introduction of foot and mouth disease into this country.  Every credit is due to all those involved&mdash;the Government, the National Farmers Association and everybody else&mdash;for the manner in which they coped with the threat to our cattle at that time.  Today we are confronted with a problem involving <Col N="494" /> our young boys and girls who are sowing the seeds of their own destruction because of drug addiction and we should learn from what has happened in Britain and elsewhere. Clinics are urgently needed to deal with these young people and to prevent the spread of this scourge of drug addiction.</P>
    <P>With regard to the assessment of means, I have been told that when people have money invested the dividends are reckoned at ten per cent or 12 per cent whereas in actual fact they may be only five or six per cent.  The actual dividend percentage earned should be taken into account and not some utterly illusory figure.</P>
    <P>There should be a new deal for nurses.  The Minister must be aware of the unrest that exists at the present time.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> today carries a photograph of nurses attached to St. Joseph's Hospital in Limerick taking part in a march through the streets.  It should not be necessary for these dedicated people to take to the streets to draw attention to poor conditions and bad pay.  They do very important work.  We are all aware of that.</P>
    <P>With regard to domiciliary treatment, I am one who believes that the old age pension should be increased to £5 per week.  This is Fine Gael policy. Can the State afford it?  It can easily afford it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall relate it to the Bill.  If the pensions were increased relatives could look after these old people in their own homes.  In Mullingar it costs £10 a week to keep an old person in a home; in Dublin it costs £17 or £20 a week.  If these old people were kept at home the taxpayers and ratepayers would be saved their maintenance in homes all over the country. The increased pensions, too, would be spent locally.  The majority of people are much happier in familiar surroundings, looked after by members of their family or their friends.  It was Goldsmith who said:</P>
      <P>
        <i>And, as a hare, whom hounds and horns pursue,</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="495" />
      <i>Pants to the place from whence at first he flew,</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>I still had hopes, my long vexations past,</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Here to return&mdash;and die at home at last.</i>
    </P>
    <P>Our old people would be content in their own environment and the State would save a good deal of money in taxes and rates.</P>
    <P>With regard to the rates, Dr. Ryan, when Minister for Health in 1953, said that the health service would only cost 2/6d on the rates.  We all know what has happened.  Again, in 1965, we were promised that the rates would be stabilised at the figure they had reached then.  That was another promise that was not kept by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I do not approve of section 48 of the Bill.  Hospitals should be community hospitals.  At the moment many people who contribute heavily to the cost of our health services gain no benefit from these services.  A dispensary doctor is under no compulsion to attend to them should they be so unfortunate as to fall ill and require medical attention.  These people should be allowed to avail of local medical and hospital services, instead of being compelled, as they are now, to go into expensive nursing homes.  Indeed, when a hospital caters for all sections in a community the experience is that standards are maintained at a very high level.  Community hospitals are the pattern in Britain and on the Continent.</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal with the Brown Book which gives an outline of the future hospitals system and the report of the consultative council on the general hospitals, especially as it affects us in the Midlands.  As a Deputy representing the Midlands, I certainly am not in favour of their report and I am prepared to oppose it here and anywhere else in this country. The people of Mullingar and of Westmeath are very much concerned at the threat to close our county hospital. What we have in Mullingar, we want to hold.</P>
    <P>Mullingar has been neglected by this Government.  Industries have gone to other parts of the country but we have <Col N="496" /> not one Government-sponsored industry in Mullingar.  We are proud of our hospital there and we shall do what we can to hold on to it.  Irrespective of politics or anything else, everybody in Mullingar and in County Westmeath appreciates our wonderful hospital.  We appreciate the dedicated care of and attention to patients in the county hospital from the county surgeon, the county physician, the good nuns who run the hospital, the doctors and the nurses.  We do not want to see this fine hospital turned into a glorified convalescent home.  That is an appalling prospect for County Westmeath.  The public representatives of that county came together at a public meeting: we cannot lend our support to such a radical and far-reaching proposal.</P>
    <P>Mullingar serves a vast hinterland. Very happy relations exist between the doctors and the staff in that hospital. There is a wonderful spirit of goodwill there which is conducive to the speedy recovery of patients.  If they go away to a general hospital in Tullamore, as is envisaged in this report, those people will be merely digits in a larger institution: they will become just numbers in a book.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister some questions about the setting-up of this consultative body; he resented somewhat the questions I put to him.  We had medical men only on the board.  I believe it was wrong to have medical men only on this consultative council.  Surely some laymen, who would put the point of view of the layman, should have been considered?  I asked the Minister if it was just a peculiar coincidence that all the surgeons on this consultative council got hospitals for their own areas.  We have eight from Dublin and I think they got four hospitals in Dublin&mdash;two regional and two general hospitals.  We had a few from Cork&mdash; and Cork also got them.  We had a few from Limerick&mdash;and Limerick got them.  Similarly with Galway.  But, from Castlebar, Sligo, Tralee and smaller areas we had men on this consultative council and, lo and behold, they also got a general hospital in their respective areas.  Had the Department their mind made up beforehand and were these particular people picked and told &ldquo;This is the place where we want <Col N="497" /> them&rdquo; or did each man fight for his own locality or his own area and get a general hospital for his own area&mdash;and to heck with the rest of the country? Either one or the other happened because it seems to be too much of a coincidence.</P>
    <P>Our hospital in Mullingar was opened in June, 1936, with a bed complement of 84.  In 1969&mdash;33 years later &mdash;the bed complement is 103.  We have cots for 21 babies including, I think, cots for 16 newly-born babies.  The birth average per month is 45&mdash; approximately 540 a year&mdash;in the maternity section.  There is an average of 66 medical cases per month and an average of 117 surgical cases per month in this excellent hospital.  It is reckoned to be the busiest of the county hospitals so far as road accidents are concerned as it is located at the junction of three trunk roads.  It might be no harm to remind the Minister that 304 male patients were admitted to the wards last year and 126 female patients, making a grand total of 430 cases taken into this county hospital last year.  From 1st January to 18th April, 1969, 185 patients were admitted.  Forty-six nurses are employed there; 27 domestics and, in all, 105 people are employed there.  There is plenty of room for expansion in the hospital grounds.  Plans are with the Department for the past five or six years as we felt the hospital should be extended. Westmeath County Council passed the plans which were then sent to the Department for approval but so far we have not got the approval.</P>
    <P>Beside the county hospital, we have a newly-built county clinic where 12 persons are employed.  As well as that, a new home or hospital was built by nuns in Mullingar recently with a bed complement of 100.  Fifty-three persons, including the reverend sisters, are employed there.  This home needs the presence of the surgical facilities nearby.  One of the primary reasons the town of Mullingar was selected was because of the excellent county hospital close by.  Also in Mullingar, we have Saint Loman's Hospital which serves three counties and has a bed complement of 1,050.  This hospital uses the <Col N="498" /> county hospital in Mullingar for surgical, medical and, indeed, sometimes, maternity facilities.  The Minister is aware that there is a move on foot to give psychiatric nurses a surgical, medical and general nursing degree.  There will need to be a local hospital in which to train Saint Loman's nursing staff.  At present that is part of the Department's programme.  As well as that, we have in Mullingar what was known in the past as the old County Home.  Over the years we have spent well over £500,000 doing up this home and converting it into a first-class hospital. It is now called Saint Mary's Hospital and it also incorporates what was known as Saint Anne's, the old fever hospital.  It has a complement of 230 beds, 25 nurses and a community of nuns.  Those 230 old people in that hospital are constantly in need of surgical, medical and pathological facilities, X-rays, etc.  If the general hospital is to be in Tullamore how are we going to get those patients over to Tullamore and back again?  This general hospital should be in the town of Mullingar.</P>
    <P>In Castlepollard we have Saint Peter's, which is a maternity hospital with 130 beds.  It serves a wide area and there is a need for a surgical unit close by for maternity cases which are abnormal. Also, within a radius of seven or eight miles, we have Saint Joseph's Hospital at Coole, which has 100 beds. There is also need here for a surgical unit such as we have in Mullingar but we will not have it if the general hospital is to be in Tullamore.  We also have South Hill, Delvin, erected about four or five years ago, and which has approximately 120 beds.  Again, there is a need for a surgical unit close by to cater for acute surgical cases.</P>
    <P>Another point in favour of keeping the hospital in Mullingar is the fact that Mullingar is convenient to Dublin, 48 miles away by road, or roughly an hour's run in a motor car, or a 20 minute flight by helicopter.  There is a first class road to Dublin, which we have not got anywhere near Tullamore. I wonder is the Minister familiar with the winding road from Mullingar to Tullamore?  It is one of the worst and most dangerous roads in the country. Leaving Mullingar and going west the <Col N="499" /> nearest major centre is Ballinasloe, which is 40 miles away, and going north-west the nearest major centre is Castlebar, 84 miles away.  If you travel north-north-west you have Sligo, which is some 80 miles away, and 30 miles to the north-north-east we have Navan. It is mentioned in the Brown Book that the old and infirm are more prone to accidents and need more surgical facilities than others.  If you take surgical facilities away from Mullingar you will be denying those facilities to approximately 330 patients in St. Mary's and in the Sacred Heart Home.  Another reason why we should keep it in Mullingar is because of its convenience to St. Loman's and the three outside hospitals which are within a distance of ten to 15 miles.  It is in an ideal location for those hospitals which require surgical facilities so often.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to ask what is to become of the emergency medical cases in the hospitals I have named.  There is no transport either by air or by any other means for them and nothing can make up for immediate hospital attention where time is vital and surgical aid must be given at once.  Everybody will agree that if people do not receive this immediate attention they may die before they complete the journey to hospital. No mention has been made of transport nor has there been any reference to the elements.  In the last 20 years I have seen County Westmeath snowbound for six or seven weeks.  If anything like that happens in the Midlands how does the Minister envisage these patients will be transported over narrow and bad roads to Tullamore? All around Mullingar there are main roads and it is natural to expect that they will be kept clear, or cleared fairly quickly, if we have snow or frost for the length of time we have had it in the past.</P>
    <P>We must also take into consideration the fact that relatives need to visit patients fairly often.  It is a help and an encouragement to patients if relatives are able to visit them every three or four days or at least every week.  If the hospital is transferred to Tullamore people in Westmeath may have to travel 40 or 50 miles to visit patients in hospital.  Even at present it may be a <Col N="500" /> hardship for people to have to hire cars to travel to visit relatives in hospital.</P>
    <P>The step envisaged by the Minister is a retrograde one.  In Westmeath we made another suggestion to the Department and to the Minister.  I know the Minister may tell me that the Government have only accepted this in principle but on 17th January the Minister said, in Athlone, that he entirely agreed with this.  He also outlined the proposals in the report of the consultative council on general hospitals as to the future of the hospital system in the country.  He stated that he accepted these in full and that it would probably take eight to ten years to implement them.  He stated that Tullamore would have the general hospital for the area.  I remember this well because I made a note of it.  He said that the people of this area would get much better treatment in Tullamore than they had in the past.  In the Dáil on 12th December the Minister used the words &ldquo;in principle&rdquo; and Deputy Tully, who is in the House now, stated &ldquo;but can be changed&rdquo; and the Minister immediately said &ldquo;I did not say that&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We want to be told definitely what is going to happen.  I know that there is a general election to be held very soon, perhaps on the 18th or 19th June, and we know that the Minister at present wants to quibble over this. It is only natural.  We have such a thing as political expediency and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We want to know where we stand as regards this hospital for Mullingar.  The suggestion we made was that a general hospital should be built at Mullingar and another one at Portlaoise.  In the Brown Book the council did discuss the possibility of having a general hospital in Mullingar and another in Portlaoise. <Col N="501" /> If you look at the map I think you will agree that if there was a general hospital in Mullingar and Portlaoise it would serve the needs of the Midlands and of the whole country much better than by adopting the present proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryPDockrell" hpid="Mr. H.P. Dockrell Mr. H.P. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H.P. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to be very brief.  I do not welcome this Bill as it does nothing to alter the present position regarding payment for health charges through rates.  I had expected that the Government promise that the health charges would be held at the 1965/66 level would be kept. There is no sign of that in this Bill. The present Dublin Health Authority estimate is a little over £12 million and on that body we are told that the normal increase from year to year is ten per cent, so that the ratepayers of Dublin city, county and Dún Laoghaire may look forward next year to a health estimate of over £13 million with only the same services as they get this year&mdash;nothing additional.</P>
      <P>It is a little disconcerting to read the Minister's remarks as reported in the Official Report, volume 239, column 1652, where he says:</P>
      <P>The Bill contains several other useful miscellaneous provisions.  By the transfer, under section 42, of the administration of the Dundrum Central Mental Hospital to the appropriate health board we should achieve a much better use of that institution as it should greatly benefit by co-ordination with other psychiatric hospitals in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why has the hospital to be transferred to the backs of the ratepayers in order to have co-ordination&mdash;that is the word the Minister uses?  Dundrum Central Mental Hospital was formerly known as the Criminal Lunatic Asylum.  Its title was changed in 1961. It is the only institution of its kind in the State and it caters for those unfortunate enough to receive jail sentences and who are transferred there due to mental breakdowns.  It also caters for offenders who are found unfit to plead or have become insane before proceedings take place. It caters for prisoners from three prisons, Mountjoy, Limerick and <Col N="502" /> Portlaoise and it caters for the State in general.</P>
    <P>Heretofore, the hospital was run by the State and financed by State funds. Under section 42, it now appears that it will be paid for in future by the ratepayers of Dublin city, county and Dún Laoghaire.  I protest very strongly at that imposition, especially on Dún Laoghaire, but also on the city and county.</P>
    <P>It is a retrograde step that children of higher income group parents who may be attending national schools will lose entitlement to hospital treatment on the ground of discovery at school health examinations. When people complained of the high health rate this was one thing from which you could say they benefited. Now it appears you cannot say anything like that.</P>
    <P>There are three classes involved in the composition of the boards the Minister proposes to set up under the Bill: those elected by the local authorities, those elected by the medical profession and those appointed by the Minister.  I should like the Minister to tell us how many doctors it is proposed to have and how many of his own appointees.  It seems to me that the medical profession should be included in an advisory capacity rather than taking part in discussions on the board.  Time may prove me wrong in that.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter I wish to raise and that is the appointment of Mr. Garvin to the Dublin Health Authority.  It appears to me that his appointment, which was made by the Minister for Local Government, should have been made by the Minister for Health under the Health Act.  That would have meant that both Houses of the Oireachtas would have had a chance of discussing the appointment.  I wonder if the Minister has considered the matter and if he agrees with my view that the appointment should have been made by himself and not made, as was the case, by the Minister for Local Government under section 52 of the Local Government Act, 1941.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. S. Flanagan) Sean Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is customary to pay tribute at this stage to the many <Col N="503" /> Deputies who took part in the debate and I do this gladly.  First, I should like to congratulate the Labour Party for having adopted a constructive approach and, in particular, Deputy Kyne for his excellent keynote speech. The House has come to expect this sort of contribution from this particular Deputy.  Labour as a Party and its individual members have contributed substantially to the discussion.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, Fine Gael as a Party took a destructive line.  Their spokesmen were entirely destructive in their approach but there were sufficient backbenchers in the Party who made sensible and helpful contributions to enable me to congratulate Fine Gael also on the useful role they played despite the efforts of their leading spokesmen.  Finally, I wish to thank the members of my own Party for their critical approach.  We have never been afraid of self-examination.</P>
      <P>To return for a moment to Deputy Kyne's speech&mdash;he raised a point that was reiterated throughout the debate, namely, that it was difficult to discuss the Bill without knowing the regulations that are to be made under it and he said that the Bill cannot properly be considered until the regulations are also available.  This is a perfectly valid criticism. The view was expressed rather forcefully by certain Fine Gael speakers, in particular Deputy Ryan, that the Bill as drafted is merely evasive.  I reject this and positively accept responsibility for the way in which the Bill is drafted and I propose to explain why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has always seemed to me that in matters connected with health, where one is dealing with human problems, the greatest flexibility is desirable.  It is one thing to lay down statutory provisions in regard to, say, drainage work or hotel grants.  Here, everyone is entitled to the protection of a statute and also to its exactitude.  Where health matters are concerned it is an entirely different thing.  One is dealing with human problems and human circumstances and these differ from case to case, from individual to individual, from family to family.  So that my desire is that when the Bill becomes an <Col N="504" /> Act the Minister will not be tied by statutory clauses which prevent him from exercising the necessary flexibility of approach.</P>
    <P>It is the easy way out to cover everything by statute and then, when a particular case comes for scrutiny, to say simply that the Minister regrets that owing to the provisions of a particular section he is debarred from taking any action and is, in fact, powerless.  This is easy, clearcut and inhuman.  I want, instead, to have as many enabling clauses as possible so that the regulations, which, after all, have to be laid before the House, can be changed from time to time and can also be drafted in such a way as to take account of individual circumstances.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it seemed to me that Deputy Corish in his speech more or less answered his own question when he began by saying that people were entitled to know exactly where they stand and protested over the fact that this Bill does not clarify the situation for people as to where they stand in relation, say, to eligibility and then went on to point out the injustice of the situation where a person was refused merely because he was earning a few shillings over the stated standard level.  I hope that Deputy Corish will accept this as a valid point and that the House will accept it as valid and will accept that it is desirable as far as possible to have flexibility so as to be able to take account of human circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of this which I should like to emphasise.  One constantly hears my Party and this Government criticised adversely for giving away their functions to independent bodies.  I have been subjected to obloquy by certain members of the Fine Gael Party in the course of this debate for accepting total responsibility and that means the responsibility of answering for every single thing that I will do and that my successors will do on foot of this Bill and answering here in the House.  Nothing can be done at any stage on foot of this Bill except with total ministerial responsibility to the Oireachtas.  It seems to me that Deputies like Deputy Richie Ryan should make up their minds what they <Col N="505" /> want, should follow through the logic of what they are saying, if there be logic in it, and having done so, should make up their minds as to whether they want responsibility by the Minister to the House or not.</P>
    <P>The regulations, of course, when drafted, will flesh out the Bill.  They will as far as possible try to eliminate the present disparity of application of the 1953 Act as between one health authority and another.  In this respect, surely, the regional boards should be a help since they will cater for very much larger areas than exist at present.  Even so, as I have already said, I propose to draft regulations in such a way as to give the Minister and those who will have the job of applying the regulations the necessary flexibility to have regard to individual circumstances.  Indeed, in this connection it is interesting to note that Deputy Fitzpatrick of Cavan abused me in regard to the maternity cash grant being actually spelled out in the Bill and suggested that it should not have been so spelled out, that this should have been done by regulation so that the cash grant could be amended from time to time as the Minister desires.  Perhaps, those two eminent lawyers, Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Ryan, would get together and make up their minds which approach they consider fair.</P>
    <P>Indeed, in the course of his long, rambling and silly diatribe Deputy Ryan missed the whole point and purpose of the Bill.  At this stage I will say no more about his two hours and 40 minutes exercise, which was rightly attacked by Deputy Kyne, than to say that vituperation is a very poor substitute for constructive argument.</P>
    <P>But later on in the debate Deputy T.F. O'Higgins chose to contribute and he cannot escape the criticism that he at one stage was himself a Minister for Health and that he had the responsibility for three years of dealing with these problems.  Perhaps, he would like to hear what he said in 1956 when he was Minister for Health and had the responsibilities that I have today.  He began by praising Deputy Dr. Ryan and I quote from column 243 of the Dáil Debates of the 11th April, 1956:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="506" /> I think that the speech we heard today from Deputy Dr. Ryan was a very fine speech, a speech made by a man who has had years of experience in dealing with the subject of health and the provision of health services; and he joined with me in expressing the hope that we would see the end of dissention on these matters.</P>
    <P>In the same speech, Deputy O'Higgins said that he had no apology to make to the House or to anybody else for the fact that he and his advisers had had long consultations with the medical profession with a view to working out a suitable system of working the Health Act of 1953.  The then Minister for Health also stated that it was not a very fair approach for Deputies to criticise him because of the fact that the burden on the rates was increasing.</P>
    <P>I deplore Deputy O'Higgins's contribution to this debate.  He is, of course, very skilful at avoiding the gravamen of any issue and in skirting around the edge of subjects, scattering flowery verbiage to left and right.  He gazes in myopic wonder at the self-created image of himself.  He did nothing whatsoever to improve the knowledge of the people of this country as to what Fine Gael's proposals actually are in regard to the health services and neither did Deputy Ryan nor any other member of Fine Gael. Neither did Deputy O'Higgins choose to answer the questions I put to him in replying to a debate here a couple of months ago when I asked him to spell out for the benefit of the people how Fine Gael would finance a scheme which I then said, and now repeat, would cost a minimum of £70 million a year and possibly considerably more.</P>
    <P>The fact is that when Deputy O'Higgins was speaking in 1956 as Minister and asking for an end to dissention, he was in the DC3 age of a £7 million contribution by the State. We have now reached the supersonic age of approximately a £30 million contribution by the State to health services.  In addition to that amount, the ratepayers will have to pay approximately £21 or £22 million this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="507" /> If I am correct in saying that a comprehensive health service on the lines suggested by Fine Gael would cost approximately £75 million is it not a fact that to divide it in the ratio, one-third, one-third, one-third would involve the ratepayer in a greater and not a lesser contribution for this year than the one that all Deputies in this House have so bitterly complained about during the past month?</P>
    <P>I share their concern about the burden on the rates and I also share the concern of Deputy Dockrell whose concluding remarks were to the effect that the increase in the cost of the health services bears very little relation to the amount of improvement in the health services.  I shall refer here, if I may, to a report of a seminar held in Moscow in June or July last when this very point was made by distinguished professors.  One professor pointed out that the upper trend in expenditure on health services is common to all countries and he also pointed out that the increase in the cost of the services was not reflected by a similar improvement in or extension of the services themselves.</P>
    <P>The principal reason for this is that, in common with other countries, the administrative costs are steadily increasing and this is something which is not merely common to all other countries but appears to show no sign whatsoever of abating.  The demands for increased pay for various workers and in particular nurses, come from every side of the House and from members of the general public also.  To take that as an example, Deputies even went so far as to say that nurses were being treated shabbily.  Perhaps, this is true, but I know that their pay and conditions have been improving considerably during the past few years.  I had great pleasure in applying the 9 per cent, eleventh round increase to nurses and I was glad to be able to agree to the implementation of the arbitrator's recent award.  At the present time, negotiations are in progress with a view to reducing the fortnightly working period from 85 to 80 hours, it having been reduced two or three years ago from 90 to 85 hours.</P>
    <P>I would not claim even at this that <Col N="508" /> nurses are being adequately paid but I am pointing out that the impact of an all round increase to them is considerable. The eleventh round alone involved something in the region of £625,000.  I should like in this connection also to point out that I as Minister do not have a direct function and that the claims are dealt with either through negotiation with the County and City Managers Association or by arbitration in the event of this failing. At the present time&mdash;I think Deputy L'Estrange referred to this&mdash;there is agitation by the psychiatric nurses in regard to their conditions and pay. This is the subject of Labour Court deliberations at the present time and I have no doubt whatever that as a result of the Labour Court recommendations substantially more will have to be paid to the psychiatric staff and I would be the last to say that they are not welcome to it.  I am merely emphasising that to pay more to staff does not necessarily mean a better service and I am illustrating the broad statement I made that the total cost of our health service, while increasing rapidly, is not necessarily reflected in comparable improved services.</P>
    <P>To return to the subject of the financing of the health services, I was to some extent disappointed with Deputy Corish's otherwise very helpful speech.  I was looking forward to his spelling out for the people his Party's proposals for financing their scheme. The Labour Party brochure which was issued recently seemed to indicate that no part of the cost of their suggested comprehensive health service would be paid for out of rates.  On the other hand, Deputy Corish clearly stated that some part of that cost, indeed, would have to be borne by the rates.  I should like to know what part, what proportion.  I feel the people are anxious for an answer to that question too.</P>
    <P>I was also disappointed that no clear statement was made for the benefit of the House and of the people as to how the social fund which is to take care not merely of health matters but of social welfare matters as well should be built up.  How much the levy would be of individual income, what proportion <Col N="509" /> of our people would be excluded from the obligation to pay the levy? Those are questions which all our people are entitled to have answered. It is not enough nowadays, where we are spending what are vast sums of money&mdash;I regard £1 million a week as a vast sum of money&mdash;simply to get up here and say our services in regard to this, that or the other are insufficient and should be improved, that the public need and are demanding a comprehensive free health service.  You must tell the people how they are going to pay for it because words will not pay it for them.  You must spell out for them how this is to be done.</P>
    <P>I am not offering any objection in any way to Deputy Corish's speech or, indeed, to his Party's general contributions. I am merely asking them kindly to let me know, to let the House know and to let the people know exactly how their comprehensive health system will be financed.  I am saying with regard to Fine Gael that at this stage they should be ashamed of themselves trotting in here with half a dozen different sets of proposals, one from Deputy Esmonde, one from Deputy Dillon, one from Deputy P. O'Donnell and none from Deputy Fitzpatrick, who refused to give his ideas when I challenged him in the House on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>They require to have the manner in which it is to be financed spelled out, which has not been done.  As for Fine Gael, I must tell them the people will not accept the undetailed proposals on the lines they have been suggesting for the past few weeks.  They seem very confident about <Col N="510" /> winning the next election.  Maybe they will.  I do not know.  They always seem to be confident about winning the next election but they rarely do.  Indeed, if I could have a few million copies of Deputy Ryan's keynote speech on behalf of Fine Gael printed it would give students of Irish politics a number of good reasons why Fine Gael have been in the wilderness for so long and are very likely to be left there by the people after the next election.  I say now, and I repeat what I said before, instead of fulminating here and indulging in abuse let the Irish people know exactly, precisely and officially on behalf of Fine Gael how those proposals are to be translated into LSD.  I have to have money to administer the services. When they are sitting over there they do not have to have anything but verbiage.</P>
      <P>There are a number of specific points I think I should deal with.  Before doing so I think it is only right to say that I would have no hope whatever of being able to deal with all the points made in the course of this very long debate.  Deputy O'Connell made a very long speech in which he praised the Bill for certain things and also dealt at some considerable length with what he stated were omissions from the Bill.  I do not think he was right because it seems to me he misunderstands the purpose of a statutory instrument which, after all, is not an essay of general intent on the part of the Minister or of the Government but is, as I say, simply a statutory instrument to enable policy to be carried out.  Deputy Barrett, for instance, suggested there should be a consolidated Act on the health service and if this was going to cause more delay it would, perhaps, be a good idea but it seems to me that this is a job for the future.  It is quite a tedious one as I know, having been involved in a couple of consolidation measures in this House in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan suggested that the first appointment of doctors to the health boards should be by election, and not, as proposed, by appointment by the Minister.  There is only a practical difficulty preventing this happening.  In fact, there were discussions between my officials and the representatives of the doctors on this very point and they <Col N="511" /> agreed with the procedure proposed in the Bill simply because the health boards will not be in existence at the beginning.  Therefore, the best compromise was to have a limited period of office for the first appointees and establish the necessary election machinery during that time so that election could take place thereafter.  It was also suggested by Deputy Ryan that officers of the Department of Health would be appointed as members of boards.  I wish to make it quite clear that it was not intended that any member of the health boards should be from the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde made the point that the Bill is designed to increase the power of the Custom House.  I do not know how a doctor could say this, because he ignores the fact that the medical profession is being brought into health administration on a wider scale at all levels through membership of health boards, regional hospital boards and Comhairle na nOspidéal. In fact, what the Custom House is doing is delegating power to outside bodies with professional representation.</P>
    <P>Deputy James Tully, with many other Members of the House such as Deputy Michael P. Murphy and, perhaps, half a dozen others, expressed grave concern about the loss of power of the local representatives as a result of the formation of health boards. Indeed, towards the end of his speech, having called me a dictator, an autocrat and having employed several other words of similar connotation, when he knew there was one he left out which he hated to miss, he turned to one of his colleagues and got from him the word &ldquo;totalitarian&rdquo;.  He was quite happy to sit down when he knew he could add that one to the other words which described me.  He had said I was dictatorial, autocratic, arrogant and now totalitarian.</P>
    <P>I want to say this about the health boards.  There is obviously something in the point that by creating health boards and abolishing the local authorities we are certainly making a radical change in the structure of the administration of the health services in this country.  All I wish to say about <Col N="512" /> it&mdash;and, perhaps, this will be more appropriate on the Committee Stage&mdash; is that when the regional idea was first discussed three years ago there was general acceptance on its validity and, indeed, that acceptance included Deputy O'Hara of Mayo, who made quite a strong attack on the health board idea in the course of his very useful contribution to this debate.  I am not saying anything to Deputy O'Hara for having changed his views since 1966.  He may have been wrong then, and right now.  We had a measure of acceptance of the idea of regionalisation three years ago.  There was, indeed, widespread acceptance of the idea of active, close co-operation between elected representatives&mdash;doctors and lay people&mdash;on the lines that were set out in the White Paper at the time. The real point here is that where hospitals are concerned, it is obviously necessary in the interests of the public that this service should be as efficient and streamlined as possible, particularly when one considers the increase in the cost of hospitalisation.  It is also obviously desirable that the local authorities should have their say in hospital administration and in all the other work of the health boards.  I can think of no better way of ensuring that than by having a minimum of 50 per cent of the board elected representatives of the people, and having, in addition, local committees which would, perhaps, be exclusively, though not necessarily exclusively, elected representatives who would advise the board in regard to a particular area. Where doctors are concerned it is an excellent thing that they should be directly involved in the administration of the health services in which they have such a stake.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I have no apology whatever to offer to the House for having ministerial nominees on the boards.  I do not see why the Minister, whoever he may be or from whatever Government he may come, should not have the right to choose his own nominees for the board when the State is paying the greater proportion of the cost and will continue to pay a still greater proportion as the years go by.  The Minister's nominees will not constitute a very large section <Col N="513" /> of the board.  Fifty per cent or more of the elected representatives take care of so many nominations; 30 to 35 per cent will be elected representatives of the medical profession.  That does not leave the Minister with a great deal of leeway, but only with 15 to 20 per cent of the membership of the board. The Minister might nominate fewer than that when we see how things work out.  I have no apology to make for that.</P>
    <P>I do not regard it as dictatorial except on the basis that a Minister acts in an irresponsible way.  I am not prepared to assume that I or my successors, from time to time, will so act. Therefore, I totally reject the charge that these people will be simply the Minister's hatchetmen, or that it will be a case of &ldquo;jobs for the boys&rdquo;, as was suggested by some Deputies during the debate.  I should hope that the nominees of the Minister would be lay people of considerable standing who would be likely to give valuable advice and help to the board in the exercise of its very onerous duties.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I should deal with is the misconception of Deputy Tully in regard to Party political representations from various county councils on the health boards.  The Deputy seems to have missed the fact that in rule 2 of the Second Schedule it is specifically laid down that each political Party on a local council may secure proper representation on the health board.</P>
    <P>This is a clause which gave rise to an amusing incident in Ennis where a certain Party have rather a monopoly of power in the council.  One of the Independent members of the council suggested to me that that particular Party might take all the seats on the council if the Minister did not make regulations to the contrary.  When he suggested that that would be the farthest thing from the thoughts of the Fianna Fáil councillors, I had one of the compensations of political life, a good laugh.</P>
    <P>To finish with, the whole question of the health board, if Members of the House can come up with a better idea or a better system than that suggested <Col N="514" /> by us, I should be more than willing to consider it.  Incidentally, I do not accept the view put forward by a distinguished columnist in the <i>Irish Times</i> to the effect that the creation of regional hospital boards is still another example of the decay of rural Ireland.  I do not think that is so.  On the contrary, the points made in the report of the consultative council on the general hospitals service&mdash;the Fitzgerald Report&mdash;are based on inescapably right arguments and are valid. They call for a radical re-organisation of our hospital services in the interests of better services to our people. Regional hospital boards, therefore, are not properly attributable to rural decay, though that may exist for other reasons.</P>

      <P>Deputy John O'Leary asked me not to split the Kingdom of Kerry.  I would have to take refuge in Newfoundland or some such place if I attempted to do that.  I merely wish to reiterate here what I said in Kerry, that the Kingdom would not be divided.  It seems that Kerry and Cork would form a suitable health board region but that will have to be thrashed out during deliberations on the Committee Stage or later.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies, including, I think, Deputies Murphy and Creed, suggested that county managers can listen to representations from members of county councils and that the CEOs of the new health boards will not be approachable in the same way.  There is nothing to stop a member of a board from making representations to the CEO exactly on the same lines as a member of a county council does to the county manager at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was disagreement as to whether the CEO should be a doctor. Deputy L'Estrange came down firmly on the side of having a doctor as CEO, Deputy Hogan O'Higgins said that one or two might be desirable, and our view is that what is important is that the person appointed as CEO should be a first-class administrator because administration, after all, will be the principal function of the CEO.  I am <Col N="515" /> sure doctors themselves would be the last to suggest that by acquiring their MB and other degrees they thereby acquire administrative wisdom as well. If a doctor happens to have suitable administrative ability there is no reason why he should not be a CEO, but I would expect in the normal course that the vast majority would be laymen.  I must make it clear that a person will not at the same time be a county manager and a CEO.  That is a misconception expressed by a number of Deputies which I should like to put at an end.</P>
    <P>Deputy James Tully mentioned the adverse effect on County Meath of the partial attempt at equalisation of the rates burden which I undertook last year.  This was envisaged in the White Paper.  It is very difficult to do but I do not regret having tried to do it and I will continue to do it in the future because I believe the poorer counties should have anything that is going in leeway and that the richer counties should be willing to recognise that right.</P>
    <P>Deputy Timmins made a very brave speech in the circumstances.  He spoke directly after the former Minister for Health, Deputy O'Higgins, had regaled the House with his third piece of utter rubbish in the past three months.  In the course of his speech, Deputy Timmins asked about the 10/- a day hospital charge.  He was not the only Deputy to do so.  Deputy Kyne had mentioned it earlier on.  The question is whether it is worth keeping power in the statute to make a charge on the middle income group as at present.  The 10/- a day charge is not in fact extracted in many cases but only a proportion of it.  It yields £750,000 a year, less £150,000 for the cost of collection, and the £600,000 net which accrues is worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I consider it better that we should incorporate in the Bill clauses which will enable us from time to time to have regard to changes in the value of money and which will have regard to the situation of our people and their ability to pay.  I should hope that the time will come when fewer people will be even applying for medical cards, <Col N="516" /> because at the present time a very high proportion apply for medical cards not because they cannot afford to pay their family doctors but because the cards represent an insurance against the cost of hospitalisation should they become ill.  I believe the vast majority of our people could afford to throw away their medical cards if they could be given an assurance in regard to hospital charges when illness arrives.</P>

      <P>The next matter I should like to deal with, but only briefly, is the subject of drug addiction, which was mentioned by Deputy L'Estrange, and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House knows, a working party on drug abuse is sitting at the present time and I should hope will report to us in the near future.  I think the situation in this country is that we do not yet have a serious problem in regard to drug addiction.  Any opinion offered in this must be offered with some diffidence, but I believe that what the potential of the problem may be in the future is one thing; what it actually is at the present time is another.  In the meantime I would prefer to offer no concrete opinions other than the one I have expressed, and I have expressed that merely because I believe that the working party should not be badgered into producing a <Col N="517" /> report by a particular time because of the urgency of the situation.  I believe that, if they produce a good report, a month or two months, at the present time and having regard to the present situation of this problem in this country, will be time well spent.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, reject the statement made by Deputy L'Estrange that we have failed our young people.  This is an extremely delicate, sensitive area of human behaviour and Deputy L'Estrange and others might choose to realise that we are operating under a system of individual free will and that mere governmental action in this or any similar sensitive area is not guaranteed to achieve success or indeed to prove useful at all.  At the same time, I do think that by establishing certain facilities and by appointing the working party, which will report soon, we have taken cognisance of the situation in a responsible way and we have not failed our young people or indeed any others in that regard.</P>
    <P>Various Deputies mentioned extension of payment to people looking after their parents, their old.  I must say I have sympathy with this point of view and hope that the representations I made to the Minister for Social Welfare in this matter will be favourably received.  I should like to see, and I hope will see very soon, a considerable improvement in the way we apply benefits, allowances and so forth to the handicapped and to people who have to give up the possibility of employment&mdash;which also imposes a handicap on them&mdash;and various other categories.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not yield to anybody in this matter.  Enshrined in this Bill, as the House can see, is my determination to try to ensure that people who suffer from disability, handicap of a long-term nature, will be relieved of the financial burden involved and that the healthy community should accept the burden of paying for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also think that our children should be given the best possible start at the earliest possible moment.  That is why there are radical changes suggested in <Col N="518" /> regard to the child health service.  In the first place, the statutory requirement that children be discovered at a school health examination is to be eliminated so that the children will not be told that merely because they were not examined at the school health examination but by their family doctor they are not entitled to treatment. This is an example of the inflexibility in existing Acts which I wish to put an end to in the present Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no apology to make for the other changes which involve taking away certain existing rights from the higher income group in regard to the child health service.  In reply to Deputy Percy Dockrell, I do appreciate that this is taking away something; but in return we are giving to these people, irrespective of their income, the right to absolutely free treatment should their children require hospitalisation as a result of mental or physical handicap or other long-term or permanent disease.  I am perfectly certain that if Deputy Dockrell asks his neighbours, and he has many of them in the higher income group, they will regard this as a much better situation than the present one where they can get a free service for their children if they are discovered at national school but then, because of their income group, they have to bear the full weight at least for a time of hospitalisation for a physically or mentally handicapped child.  We want to put an end to the situation where, irrespective of income, children represent a severe continuing burden on their people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the middle income group is concerned we want to put an end to the fear of excessive cost of drugs. This obviously is not merely in regard to permanent or long-term disease but is also in regard to a long, acute illness, perhaps stretching over a matter of months.  This can represent a considerable hardship and again without actually spelling it out in the Bill, but enabling ourselves to do so by regulation, we are trying to ensure that people in the middle income group will not have to pay more than a reasonable amount to cover the cost of their <Col N="519" /> drugs.  It was suggested by many speakers that we should remove this burden from the middle income group altogether.  With this I do not agree. Just as I made the observation in regard to the people in my own county, in Donegal and elsewhere, who have medical cards and who do not really want them except as an insurance against hospitalisation, so I do not think it is desirable that we should offer completely free drugs to people in the middle income group.  Indeed, I would not exclude the possibility, after discussion here, of charging some small fee to the lower income group for their drugs, though no decision in this regard has yet been made.</P>
    <P>I now turn briefly to the vexed question of the Fitzgerald Report, which I touched on earlier, to say that I am conscious of the fact that this is a highly explosive subject, particularly for Deputies and other public representatives who come from areas where a change in the function of existing hospitals is recommended&mdash;places like Mullingar, Monaghan and elsewhere.  I do appreciate that Members of this House, county councillors and others are now, and will in the future, be subject to very strong pressures from local interests to preserve their hospitals, to preserve their amenities and facilities.  &ldquo;To save our hospitals; to keep our very good doctors and our surgeon and his staff: to prevent downgrading&rdquo;&mdash;that is just a representative selection of the phrases that have been pouring into my office in recent months since the Fitzgerald Report was published.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should read briefly, as Deputy Carter did, from the first part of one of the more important paragraphs in the report.  At page 17 the report says in black type:</P>
    <P>There are altogether 169 separate hospitals providing acute medical, surgical and maternity services.  Most of them are inadequately staffed and equipped.  In County Hospitals, the single consultants in surgery and medicine are isolated from colleagues in their fields.  Many maternity patients throughout the country have not convenient access to the services <Col N="520" /> of a consultant obstetrician.  Inadequate operating theatre, out-patient, laboratory and radiological facilities are keeping patients in hospital longer than necessary.</P>
    <P>The report uses even stronger words on page 20 at paragraph 3.5:</P>
    <P>We are satisfied that the present structure of our hospital organisation is outmoded and is now a hindrance to good medicine, good teaching and economic operation.  We believe that if it is to be adapted to meet fully the requirements of modern medicine this can be achieved only by radical changes, involving a departure from many long established concepts in regard to organisation, staffing and operation of hospitals.</P>
    <P>I believe that the arguments in this report are inescapably right, as I said before.</P>

      <P>As the House knows, the Government have accepted in principle that these recommendations are correct.  Perhaps I should refer to something Deputy Hogan, who is a surgeon himself, pointed out.  He said that when he was going through university they produced a pathologist and that was all there was to it.  Now there is no such thing as a pathologist. There is a biochemist and a haematologist and half a dozen others.  In his time there was also a general surgeon. Now there is no such graduate, and there never will be again.</P>
      <P>These are the realities of the specialisation that has taken place in medicine in the past few years.  I share with Deputy Dillon and others certain misgivings in this regard.  It is not necessarily a good thing that this narrow specialisation is taking place but, unfortunately, I do not control it and we do not control it, and that is what is happening.  We therefore have to take into account the developments in medicine and try to streamline our hospital structure accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hogan accepts the principles behind the Fitzgerald Report.  He accepts them because he is aware that <Col N="521" /> people like himself and his counterparts throughout the country will be irreplaceable in years to come when they cease to hold their present position. There is no doubt in my mind that, as a result of these changes, there will be less of a feeling of contact between patient and hospital than there is today. There is no doubt whatsoever that the close personal relationship that exists between a surgeon in a relatively small county hospital and the communities throughout the country can no longer exist then.  The surgeon will certainly be a much more impersonal figure in the hospital in the future than he is today, but that is how medicine is developing.</P>
    <P>I should like Deputies to read this report, and read it in full.  It is not often that Deputy O'Hara does not do his homework but he admitted that he had not read the Fitzgerald Report when he was making certain observations. I should like Deputies to read that report.</P>

      <P>I want to suggest to Members of the House that it is easy to be a follower of public opinion, but we should be leaders of public opinion and not sheep.  Members of the House, and others outside it as candidates whenever the election is held, could make political hay at my expense and at the expense of my Party because of the recommendations in this book. I do not think they are doing a service to themselves or the people in their locality by trying to hold on&mdash;on behalf of these people and for the wrong reasons&mdash;to the hospitals which this book rightly says are outmoded and which, if no action is taken, except to try to keep them open, will fade out in about ten years anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hope that Members of the House will be responsible enough to stand up in the areas affected and say: &ldquo;The report is right.  I appreciate that you do not like having to send your child who is suffering from appendicitis, 20 miles further than you would have had to send him last year.&rdquo; Appendicitis, which was referred to by various delegates, is specifically mentioned <Col N="522" /> in the report.  Statistics prove that the mortality rate in respect of appendicitis is significantly lower in hospitals of the type suggested here which are fully equipped and have all the necessary staff and ancillary services, than it is in hospitals such as those which Deputies are imploring me to retain.  I intend no adverse criticism of any person operating in any one of these hospitals.  I have nothing but the highest admiration and esteem for them and the wonderful work they have done.</P>
    <P>I accept that what these experts say is true, and that we should try to end a hospitalisation system which has grown up over the years and is now outmoded and involves gross duplication and, above all, involves in acute surgical cases lack of facilities to which patients appear to me to be entitled.  Members of the House should remember that hospitals do not exist for doctors.  They do not exist for relatives.  They do not exist for nurses or nuns.  They exist for the patients. If Members of the House and other public representatives keep that fact in their minds, and are clear about what is recommended in the Fitzgerald Report, I think they will not be prepared to fall in with emotional local attitudes, and they will become the leaders which they were elected to be.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister any views on the private beds in our own county hospital in Castlebar and the private fees charged?  I had something to say on that a number of years ago. I was not afraid to shout about it.  Has the Minister any comment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is something which can be dealt with as a matter of detail at a later stage.  I am appealing to members of the House and other public representatives in this regard. I have said in reply to questions about Wexford, Mullingar and other hospitals, that obviously it will take a number of years to complete this whole process.  I have also said&mdash;and I meant it&mdash;that discussions will take place with representatives of the hospital authorities and also with health authorities in regard to the proposed changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible that the consultants in <Col N="523" /> their report overlooked vital matters which they should not have overlooked. It is possible; in my opinion it is improbable, but that is something on which I remain to be convinced because I do have an open mind.  I merely have a desire to create a hospital structure which will give the patient a better service, and it is immaterial to me if the location of a particular hospital is shifted 10, 15 or 20 miles provided that the principles laid down in the report are still capable of valid application.  What I am not prepared to contemplate is a departure from the recommendations which would be so radical as virtually to retain the present outmoded hospital system which the report rightly recommends should cease.</P>
    <P>Alone of all the Members who contributed in this debate Deputy P.J. Lenihan drew attention to the nature and purpose of the community health centre.  Too many people have accepted that to change a hospital from a county hospital to a community health centre thereby automatically involves its downgrading.  Deputy P.J. Lenihan drew attention to the value and merits of the community health centre and explained what it is all about.  I should like to thank him for that and take the opportunity of saying a few words myself to spell them out.  In the first place, the community health centre, when established, will bring consultants for outpatient sessions in a way and on a scale not now practised.  This is bringing specialist medicine to the doors of the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said before and I repeat now&mdash;in spite of Deputy Ryan and others saying here that I have refused to accept the insurance principle&mdash;that not merely will I accept an idea from Fine Gael or the Labour Party but I will thank them for it.  The only interest I have is in providing a better service for the people, and I will stand up on any platform and thank the Labour Party, the Fine Gael Party <Col N="524" /> or any other party or individual who suggest ideas to improve the service for our people.  In addition, maternity, medical, psychiatric and geriatric cases will be catered for in the community health centre.  The general practitioner will be integrated in the work of the community health centre in a way that does not apply in any county or district hospital at the present time. He does not have to hand his patient over to anybody under the community health centre idea but can continue to accept responsibility alone or shared when his patient goes in for treatment.</P>
      <P>They will, therefore, have to continue to be hospitals even though they may be called community health centres.  If it would suit Deputy Treacy or others who complain about the disappearance of hospitals in the whole of Tipperary, to call them hospitals instead of community health centres, I do not mind; that is only nomenclature.  All that is leaving is facilities for acute surgery, but through the community health centre you are bringing medicine to the people and integrating the general practitioner in the service in a way that has not operated before.  When the people come to realise what the community health centre idea is, instead of objecting to the downgrading of their hospitals, they will be bursting to be the first in the queue for the establishment of a community health service in their own areas.</P>
      <P>I hoped that we would be able to avoid silly and unnecessary political controversy at local levels about this matter.  I have no personal axe to grind in this thing because we do not have any such controversy in my own county.  However, in an effort to avoid creating unnecessary political controversy I have already given an undertaking that I will set up pilot community health centres in two or three areas of the country and in that way try to demonstrate for the benefit of the public the advantages of the community health centre idea as envisaged in the Fitzgerald Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick and others asked questions about the method of appointing doctors.  With the commencement of the service every permanent MO will be entitled automatically <Col N="525" /> to take part in the service if he so desires, and in addition every other doctor who has more than a minimum number of years practice&mdash; I think two has been agreed&mdash;will have the right to participate in the new service if he so desires.  After that there will certainly be restrictions on entry into the service.  This is something that was objected to; I cannot remember what Deputy dealt with it. The reason for this is that under the present system the standard of entry into the service is high.  Everybody who knows how the service operates will realise that this is so.  We wish to retain at least sufficient control to ensure that a doctor will have a certain minimum experience and minimum qualifications before he will be entitled to participate in this service at all.</P>
    <P>I do not foresee any real difficulty in applying this principle and I do not foresee any objection to it being forthcoming. We must keep up the standards of entry into the service so that, even with choice of doctor, a doctor will have to have minimum degrees, including, perhaps, certain minimum post-graduate courses as at the present time.</P>
    <P>I think that covers at least the principal points that were raised in the debate.  I should perhaps sum up by saying it is obvious from the temper of the House and from this debate that there is wide public dissatisfaction over the amount of rates that people have to pay at the present time.  This has been expressed on all sides of the House.  It is also certain that the improvement envisaged in this Bill will have the effect of substantially increasing the total overall cost of the services next year.  For example, the mere fact that the means of the husband and wife alone will be taken into consideration in the future in regard to applications for medical cards and also in regard to applications for disability maintenance allowances will lead to greater expense.  I cannot forecast. Indeed, I would shudder to think that the progression might continue on the same basis as it has over the past few years because, if it did, then the bill for health services next year would be something like £65 million.</P>
    <P>The problem is a very serious one. <Col N="526" /> People are demanding bigger and better services.  I do not believe they are demanding a comprehensive free service but, through their representatives, they demand maximum facilities, for instance, for mentally handicapped children.  The provision of these facilities is a priority and always has been. Money will never be an obstacle in the provision of facilities for the mentally handicapped.  Money has never been an obstacle and Deputies like Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i> should remember, when they are speaking here, that they are in Dáil Éireann and not in the district court. If Deputy Fitzpatrick has any method of speeding up the solution to the problem I shall be glad to have it.</P>
    <P>There are demands for other services. I agree the dental service should be improved.  It has, in fact, been improved over the last 18 months, but it is not yet the kind of service we would like it to be.  Further improvements in the service will cost more money.</P>
    <P>I have an open mind on the question as to how the health service should be financed.  I hope the deliberations of the inter-departmental committee will yield some practical help in the form of a workable insurance scheme within the next 12 months.  I should like to think the solution is as simple as has been suggested by certain Deputies here.  I only wish it were.  The problem is a very serious one.</P>
    <P>The emphasis in the Bill is on prevention, a charter for children, if you like, to ensure that our children will have the best possible opportunity of achieving good health.  Radical changes have been made so that every income group will be protected from the effects of long-term or permanent disease.  The precious gift of health enjoyed by those in regular employment puts on those in such employment the obligation of looking after those who are not blessed with the same good health.  The obligation does not, in my opinion, rest on the State.</P>

The aim is prevention and the emphasis is on the preventive aspect of our services. Through the reorganisation of our hospital services we hope to achieve the integration of the entire community, both at the community health centre and at the health board level; and we hope, in that way, to involve people more closely in their own health and that of their children.  Nothing associated with this field of activity is easy. Everything about it is complex and expensive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boand)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 2, to delete lines 18 to 21 and insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;habitable house&rsquo; means a house situate in the functional area of a housing authority other than&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a house in relation to which a housing authority have made a closing order, a demolition order or accepted an undertaking under section 66 (5) of the Act of 1966, or in relation to which a notice under section 3 (1) of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1964, has been given, or</P>
      <P>(b)  a house which in the opinion of such authority is in a ruinous condition;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is to bring within the scope of the Bill houses which, although still inhabited, are not in good condition and to do away with the difficulty that under the original definition if a person demolished a house without permission, the housing authority could be faced with the problem of establishing that the house was a habitable house without even having seen it.  We are now proposing to define &ldquo;habitable house&rdquo; so as to mean any house in the functional area of the housing authority other than a house which in the opinion of the authority is ruinous or in respect of which the local authority have served a dangerous building notice, or made a closing or demolition order, or accepted an undertaking on the grounds that it was a dangerous structure or unfit for human habitation. In the case of a house which is demolished without permission in future, if this amendment is adopted, the local authority will merely have to <Col N="530" /> check their own records to see whether they have taken action under the 1964 or 1966 Acts.  If they have not taken such action they will be required to establish whether the house was in a ruinous condition.  This was a weakness in the Bill as drafted and this will make it more effective.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> There is not much objection to this amendment.  As I see it, were it not for this amendment a person who sought to demolish a house for which a closing or demolition order had been made might still have to apply to the council for permission to demolish it. This amendment will do away with the necessity for doing that.  In other words, a person who owns a house in respect of which a closing order or a demolition order has been made, or where the owner has given an undertaking not to use it for human habitation, may in future proceed to demolish it without applying to the housing authority for permission to do so.  The only matter that appears to need some clarification is in regard to paragraph (b) of the amendment which says: &ldquo;a house which in the opinion of such authority is in a ruinous condition.&rdquo; What exactly is meant by the word &ldquo;ruinous&rdquo;?  Does that mean that it is ready to fall, or that there are no windows in it or there is no roof on it?  It appears to me that the word could give rise to some&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I suppose we could have a long argument about this.  Section 2 of the Bill says that &ldquo;Subject to section 9, permission shall be required under this Act in respect of&mdash;&rdquo; paragraphs (a) and (b) which deal with demolition or the change of the use of any habitable house.  What we are doing here is defining what we mean by &ldquo;habitable house&rdquo;.  I clearly understand paragraph (a) of the definition because that deals with houses in respect of which closing orders have been made, or in respect of which demolition orders have been made, or in respect of which an undertaking has been given not to use it for human habitation.  Paragraph (b), however, refers to &ldquo;a house which in the opinion of such authority is in a ruinous condition&rdquo;.  If I am the owner of a house, I will know whether it falls within paragraph (a) of that definition and if it does I know I need not apply under section 3 of the Act and that I can go ahead and knock it down if I want to, or use it for a shop or anything else, but how am I to know whether the house is in a ruinous condition or whether the local authority think it is in a ruinous condition?  If the local authority are of the opinion that it is, then I need not apply under section 3 but it would be very difficult, if not impossible, for me to know the mind of the local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authority, of course, must interpret &ldquo;ruinous&rdquo; in the ordinary way.  If an individual believes that the house is in a ruinous condition, then he can interpret it himself. <Col N="532" /> It may appear perfectly obvious to him that it is in a ruinous condition but personally I think he would be foolish to do that.  The more obvious thing to do would be to make the application under section 3 in a case where the local authority had not already made a decision in respect of the house. Any individual will be capable of forming an opinion himself as to the condition of the house and the local authority would be required to interpret the word &ldquo;ruinous&rdquo; in the normal way and there could eventualy be an appeal to the court.  My own opinion would be that an individual would be foolish to do that and that he should make an application in respect of any house that did not come under subsection (a).</P>
      <P>The original drafting was that &ldquo;habitable house&rdquo; means a house which in the opinion of the authority is &ldquo;reasonably fit for human habitation or is capable of being rendered so fit at reasonable expense&rdquo;.  If that were to stand and a person did demolish a house without making an application to do so then, although no official of the local authority might have seen the house before it was demolished, in such cases the local authority would have to establish that prior to being demolished the house was reasonably fit for human habitation, and that would be very difficult.  The substitution of paragraph (a) is making it more effective.</P>

In my opinion a person would be foolish not to make the application.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I certainly think he would be foolish.  I have no quarrel at all with paragraph (a) of the definition.  That is clear and can be ascertained and the owner of the house knows where he stands in relation to it because registers are kept by the local authority or he will have <Col N="533" /> received notices or will have given an undertaking.  But paragraph (b) says:</P>
      <P>A house which in the opinion of such authority is in a ruinous condition.</P>
      <P>But when I inquire how a person is to know that the council will take the view that the house is in a ruinous condition the Minister tells me that the house-owner will have to take a chance and that he would be foolish to take that chance.  I agree with that.  I think it is a dangerous and loose sort of definition. If it is to stand at all it should read: &ldquo;...or a house which is in a ruinous condition&rdquo;.  The owner could then say: &ldquo;This house is in a ruinous condition and I am going to knock it down&rdquo;.  If he did that, when the house is knocked down he can still be prosecuted because the council could say: &ldquo;We were not of opinion that it was in a ruinous condition.&rdquo;  I think the Minister should delete the paragraph altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If we did what the Deputy is now suggesting we would really be getting back to the present position.  The local authority would, in fact, in every case have to establish positively that a house was not in a ruinous condition.  Here, what we are providing is that if a person does knock down a house without making an application because he genuinely thinks it is in a ruinous condition and if the local authority agree, then the authority can allow him away with it.  But, as I said, anybody would be foolish to do that because not only must he think it is in a ruinous condition but so must the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally speaking, if the local authority believe the house is in a ruinous condition they will have declared it as such in one of the various ways mentioned under paragraph (a). This provision is to provide that action need not be taken when the local authority knows that, in fact, the house was in a ruinous condition.  If we were to put it in the more positive way the Deputy now suggests, then anybody could knock down a house and the local authority would have to prove positively that the house was not in a ruinous condition.  They might not have <Col N="534" /> had an opportunity of inspecting it beforehand and they might find it very difficult to establish their case.  Here, it says that they must be &ldquo;of opinion&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>As the Minister said here there has to be a second opinion, that of the local authority, to confirm that the house is in a ruinous condition because if we leave it to the opinion of the owner alone, as the Minister says, we merely bring about the anarchic situation which has obtained up to now as a result of the Minister's own regulation in the original Act.  We found the situation existing in Dublin where people began to knock down perfectly good houses. Hence, we had perfectly legitimate agitation on the basis of the kind of speculation which arose out of that big loophole in the regulations which permitted the demolition.  The regulation, in effect, negatived the whole basis of the Planning Act.  I agree with the Minister on this occasion that if we are to correct the regrettable situation which has obtained in which we have seen avenues of perfectly good houses knocked down because of this loophole in the old Act, we must put the local authority in a position to intervene on behalf of the community whether a house, in fact, may be demolished.  If we give the sole right to the owner of the house, the situation will be as before.</P>

But here, in paragraph (b), you have also excepted from clause 3 &ldquo;a house which in the opinion of such authority is in a ruinous condition.&rdquo; The question I pose is: how is the owner of a house to know whether or not the local authority thinks that the house is in a ruinous condition?</P>

That would then impose an obligation on the owner to get permission in every case other than the cases excepted by paragraph (a). These are ascertainable cases.  But here you may have a man who may genuinely believe that a house is in a ruinous condition and he proceeds to demolish it by virtue of subsection (b). He may then find when that is done and the house is not in existence that the local authority says: &ldquo;That house was not in a ruinous condition.&rdquo;  It would be more in the interests of the owner of a house to have the more stringent condition imposed on him of applying under section 3 for permission. If by &ldquo;ruinous&rdquo; is meant a house without a roof or a house without doors or windows or a roof and that sort of thing, everybody would know that was in a ruinous condition but this is the sort of legislation and the sort of section in Acts of Parliament that I disagree with because nobody knows what they mean.  The owner of the house here must ask himself the question: &ldquo;Is this house in the opinion of the local authority in a ruinous condition?&rdquo;  That is an absurd question because he cannot <Col N="536" /> know that unless he asks the local authority.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> But the section tells him that this is the case in which he need not ask the local authority.  If you put into the section: &ldquo;Having made inquiries from the local authority...&rdquo; you are inviting him by this subsection not to go near the local authority and to go and demolish the house but at the same time you are providing the local authority with the right to prosecute afterwards.  That is unreasonable.  The Minister cannot have any argument with me.  Far be it from me to give any owner of a house the right to determine whether he should knock it down or not.  That is the very thing I am complaining about and about which this Party have been complaining for the past two or three years.  That is why we introduced the Bill in the Seanad to amend the Planning Act.  I believe that was the measure which gave rise to this one.  I have made the case as clear as I can.  I also disagree with people who say that if the Bill were to read: &ldquo;...a house which is in a ruinous condition&rdquo; it would give the owner the right to say whether or not he should demolish it.  In my opinion, he would have to establish that it was in a ruinous condition if he was prosecuted by the local authority.</P>

It is a subsection which says that he need not apply if the house is in a ruinous condition and in all other cases he must apply.  Therefore, if he is prosecuted, in my opinion, that would be a matter of defence for him to bring himself within the exception provided by this paragraph (b).  If the Deputies clearly understood the case I am making, they would realise that it is a reasonable case.  I do not want an owner of a house to be put in a position where he does not know where he <Col N="537" /> stands.  My argument is as simple as that.  Here I submit we are saying to the man &ldquo;If the house is in a ruinous condition you need not go near the council&rdquo; but then the council can come along afterwards when the house is knocked down and say that the house was not in a ruinous condition. In the meantime the house has been knocked down and no one can say whether it was in a ruinous condition or not.</P>

      <P>This is the type of provision that is normal.  It is in the Dangerous Buildings Acts; it is in the Planning Acts.  There are certain developments classified as being exempted.  But there may be cases of doubt and in cases of doubt people sometimes seek planning permission but, at the same time, claim that it is an exempted development.  In such cases the local authority will tell the person whether it is exempted or not. There are very few people who would not be able to say whether or not a building was in a ruinous condition and in such cases they could claim that it was not necessary to apply for permission.  If this paragraph is dropped, I think local authorities would have to deal with a lot of applications for permission which are really pointless.  I agree that it is not all that important but it is a usual type of provision to have in this type of legislation.  I think the legislation would be better with it in.  However, at the same time, I think the advisable thing for anybody proposing to demolish a house that did not come under category (a) would be, certainly, either to make application or to ask the local authority to confirm his opinion that the house was in a ruinous condition.  I should like to retain the paragraph because it is a usual provision. It is in both the Planning Acts and the Dangerous Buildings Acts but the more important things in this amendment are in subparagraph (a).</P>

    <P>Section 4 provides the machinery whereby the housing authority shall give a decision on applications made to it for permission to demolish a house or for permission to change the use of a house from a private dwelling to some other purpose.  It is very properly set out in subsection (5) of that section that the housing authority shall give a decision on an application made to it within a specified time and the time specified is described in subsection (5) (a) (ii) as &ldquo;the appropriate period&rdquo;.  The appropriate period, in round figures, means five weeks from the date of the application if no inquiries have to be made by the local authority; and if such inquiries have to be made it is five weeks from the date of the supplying of the information required by the local authority.</P>
    <P>The object in imposing that time limit is to make sure that the owner of a house who wishes to demolish it will know where he stands within a reasonable time.  This sort of provision has always been inserted in the Planning Acts.  Indeed, in the old Planning Acts of the 1930s a time limit of, I think, two months was set and it was provided that the local authority had to give a decision within two months of an application being made to it or within two months of the required information being supplied to the local authority.</P>
    <P>This is very reasonable because otherwise a person could make an application to the planning authority or the housing authority and he might not get a decision on it for six months, 12 months or even five years.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I shall read subsection (5) for Deputy Kitt's benefit.  The subsection states that:</P>
      <P>(a)  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  an application is made to a housing authority in accordance with section 3 for a permission under this section, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  the housing authority do not give notice to the applicant of their decision within the appropriate period.</P>
      <P>a decision by the authority to grant the permission shall be regarded as having been given on the last day of that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (6) provides for an appeal to the Minister and the Minister provides in this Bill that the <Col N="543" /> machinery which applies in the case of an application to the housing authority shall apply in the case of an appeal to the Minister, save that there should be no time limit and that the Minister can have as long as he likes to consider the appeal.  My views on this method of appeal from the decision of the local authority&mdash;in this case, the housing authority&mdash;are well known.  I do not think that the appeal should be to the Minister.  The Minister has, more or less, come round to my way of thinking because he has put another Bill on the Order Paper to amend the Planning Bill of 1963 in relation to appeals.  He proposes to set up some sort of an independent tribunal or body to deal with this.  That is only by the way.  As I say, here we have an appeal to the Minister against the refusal of the housing authority to grant permission to demolish or to change the use of a house or against the granting of such permission subject to conditions.  As I say, the procedure in regard to the appeal is to be on all fours with the procedure applying to the original application except the Minister will have as long as he likes to give his decision.</P>
    <P>I think some time limit should be imposed on the Minister.  I am not speaking of the Minister now as an individual.  I am speaking of the holder of the office of the Minister for Local Government.  It is only reasonable that a householder should know where he stands and that he should not be kept on the long finger indefinitely.  If he is not allowed to demolish this house he may have other plans or he may have to make other plans but as long as the decision is withheld he does not know where he stands.</P>
    <P>I know of a case in which an appeal against the decision of the planning authority is going on for about two years.  It is not an answer to that to say it is the fault of the applicant because in the case I have in mind the applicant gave all the information he was required to give.  The Minister's inspector held an oral inquiry nearly 12 months ago&mdash;it is certainly more than 9 months ago&mdash;but notwithstanding that the decision on the appeal has <Col N="544" /> not yet been given.  It is against that sort of thing I want to provide and I think it would not be unreasonable to write into this measure that the Minister must give his opinion within so many months of getting all the information he requires.</P>
    <P>It is all right to say if a person has a grievance, if an applicant appeals and the Minister is not giving his decision within a certain time the applicant can come to this House, through his public representative, and raise the matter here.  He might be slow to do that and human nature being what it is it might not be wise to do it.  That is the case I am making.  I do not think it is unreasonable.  If my amendment were accepted <i>in toto</i>, as it is here, it would mean that the Minister would have to give his decision within five weeks of this receipt of the application or within five weeks of the receipt of all the information asked for by the Minister or his Department following the receipt of the application.  I can see that five weeks might be too short but this was the handiest way of putting down this amendment to ventilate this grievance.  I would be satisfied with a longer time but I would certainly say a period of three months should be ample to decide an appeal and give a decision.  As I said, the wisdom and the sound commonsense behind the case I am making now has long since been recognised in so far as the local authorities are concerned.</P>
    <P>It has been recognised in the Town and Regional Planning Act of 1934 or 1935, the Town and Regional Planning Act of 1939 and the Planning and Development Act of 1963 and it is recognised again in subsection (5) of section 6 of this Bill.  It is thought necessary there to provide that the owner shall know where he stands within a reasonable time.  In the Planning Acts it is two months and in this measure it is five weeks.  All I am saying is that that should be carried on into the appeals subsection of this section.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned a case of which I am personally aware in which the appeal is going on for most of two years.  Certainly, the Minister's Department must accept responsibility for <Col N="545" /> almost 12 months of that delay.  We could have a case, as, indeed, in the case I am talking about, where a youngish man invested well over £1,000 in buying two public house licences and then applied for planning permission to build a house.  The £1,000 is frozen for the time I have mentioned. In the meantime the court order is nearly running out.  I am putting those facts on the record to show the necessity for the provision I am now asking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>One would agree about the period for the local authority being five weeks to make up their minds about whether the application can go through or not and to decide whether they will give permission, but one wonders how exactly are the local authorities equipped to perform this service in the five week period mentioned here?  I know in the Dublin area if tomorrow morning applications for demolition and alterations coming up under the Bill in which people wish to get rid of sound property or property they wish to demolish for another purpose were received the inspectorate available in Dublin Corporation is, in my opinion, understaffed to cope with the requirements of this measure. Whilst it may be good to say in &ldquo;less than five weeks&rdquo; I just wonder how, in fact, local authorities, perhaps, are equipped to carry out this provision under the Bill?  I am glad to see the housing authority must have regard to the state of repair and the inadequacy of the housing available in the area.  This is extremely important. Here I should like to ask whether the local authority, in considering the housing available in any area, would have regard solely to the amount of municipal housing in the area or all private and municipal housing?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I see you are going to stick to the amendment first. I think the same provision would hold in regard to the amendment.  I presume the reason is that the Minister <Col N="546" /> feels he is equipped to do this.  Does the Minister or his Department feel that they can, in fact, enforce this period of &ldquo;less than five weeks&rdquo;, which is the period mentioned here for the local authority?  Like Deputy Fitzpatrick, we are all aware of the limbo that cases appear to be in when they go to the Custom House.  Apparently, it is like &ldquo;the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller returns&rdquo; because nothing has returned from that limbo of forgotten applications in the Custom House.  Do the Department feel they are, in fact, equipped to open up the dusty archives in which many of the applications lie seemingly forgotten?  If the Minister feels confident that his Department can live up to the challenge of meeting requirements within five weeks fair enough.</P>
      <P>I may say from my experience I cannot see any local authority being able to do so.  I would support Deputy Fitzpatrick that if this provision is to have any meaning, then there must be a period set to the Minister's examination. We must not allow applications to go through, as they apparently do at the moment, to study on top of Mount Olympus.  For many years no Minister does not feel up to meeting the five-week period of determination, I would be prepared to suggest that the Minister merely stipulate a period, not necessarily holding himself to five weeks.  I do not reflect personally on the Minister in saying this, but perhaps he has to deal at present with many years backlog of applications. The public impression is that the Custom House must be filled to the roof with forgotten applications.</P>

      <P>I certainly will.  I have given my opinion on planning before and I will certainly give it again.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  The effect of the amendment would be that, in the event of the failure of the Minister to determine an appeal within five weeks, the developer would get permission to demolish or change the use of a house by default. This is the case under the Planning Act at present, but the period, of course, is a period of two months.  It must be obvious that this would not be a desirable thing to happen.  The difference between appeals and original applications <Col N="548" /> should be clearly understood.  It is a general principle that there is not a prescribed period laid down for the decision on an appeal.  The reasons are obvious, because the ability of a Minister to determine an appeal within a prescribed time may be affected by factors completely outside his control. The Minister may have to get the views of outside bodies who either cannot, do not or will not give their opinions within the time which would enable him to comply with the prescribed time limit and, at the same time, give the appeal adequate examination</P>
      <P>It is all right for Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i> to say that the wisdom of the time limit in the case of applications to a local authority has been recognised.  This is a completely different thing.  An application to a local authority involves only investigation of the proposal by the local authority.  It involves only proposals within the local authority area.  Appeals against decisions by the local authority involve arguments and counter-arguments as between two parties at least, and they involve also the whole country.  As Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i> has mentioned, they often involve members of the legal profession, who are not always as efficient in dealing with matters as Deputy Fitzpatrick says he was in this particular case.  We had a case mentioned here before of a long delay in a planning appeal.  When I looked it up, I found that a request for additional information to the applicant solicitor had not been dealt with over a period of five months.  In many cases delays in appeals were caused by the inertia of professional people of one kind or another, acting on behalf of the applicant himself.  Very often an appeal would be delayed in an endeavour to explore to the full the possibility of reaching a decision which would be acceptable to the parties involved and fair to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick obviously believes that the insertion of a time limit for dealing with appeals would be a help to applicants.  It is obvious it could very well work in the other way, particularly if it did not give time <Col N="549" /> for an adequate examination of the case.  If a decision had to be made quickly it might appear that the only feasible thing to do would be to assume that the local authority had been correct and to endorse the decision of the local authority, although a fuller examination of the whole matter might have resulted in the conclusion that the applicant's case was correct.  Deputy Fitzpatrick is making a mistake in pressing this type of amendment. Appeals will be dealt with as speedily as possible.  It would be foolish not to make it possible to give every appeal adequate investigation.  Applicants are entitled to have the assurance that their applications will be thoroughly investigated rather than that they should be dealt with on a hurried basis and in a period of time that might not be sufficient for a thorough investigation of the appeal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister take a six months period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not think it is desirable to lay down any definite period because, as I said, the time can be, and often is, drawn out in an endeavour to reach agreement between the parties involved and, at the same time, ensure that the decision will be fair to the community as a whole.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy M. O'Leary's suggestion that the five-week period allowed by the local authority is too short, I do not think it is.  If the House feels that that period should be extended to two months, as in the case of planning applications, I would not oppose it.  It is felt that five weeks should be sufficient to deal with this type of application.</P>
      <P>Deputy M. O'Leary alleged that there were a large number of forgotten applications in the Custom House.  Of my own knowledge, I know that is not so.  Apart from anything else, I want to point out to Deputy O'Leary that the Custom House does not deal with applications.  It deals with appeals in cases in which decisions have already been given by the planning authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a completely different thing and obviously involves a <Col N="550" /> much lengtheir process.  Because the views of the planning authority and of the party making the appeal&mdash;and possibly also of third parties&mdash;have to be ascertained, and because on many occasions these people are represented either by legal people or technical people of one kind or another, delays are inevitable.  There are not any forgotten applications.  There are some applications which are difficult to decide, that take longer than others; but generally speaking, in view of the large volume of appeals, I do not think the average period taken to deal with them is excessive.  I am convinced, therefore, that it would be wrong to impose any time limit in the matter of dealing with these appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I regret I cannot agree with the Minister. In the first place, the Minister seemed to make the case that it should take longer to determine the appeal than the original application.  I find it hard to accept that.  By the time the appeal stage has been reached, a lot of the spadework has been done: the file has been complied, the premises have been inspected and reported on and the arguments for and against are already available to the Minister.  Therefore, one would think it should be easier, or less difficult, to deal with an appeal than with an original application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made the case that sometimes professional people dealing with these appeals are dilatory and slow in furnishing information.  That may be so: there are exceptions to every rule.  Very often the professional people engaged are not members of the legal profession but engineers and architects.  At any rate, my amendment does not seek to impose a restriction on the Minister which would permit the time limit, whatever it is, to be shortened by the failure of the applicant to supply information, because if my amendment is accepted the time would begin to run from the date the Minister has got all the information he requires. That is as clear as ABC.  It is clearly provided for in subsection (5), and my aim is to provide that the period of five weeks should run from the date of the application or from the supplying <Col N="551" /> of any additional information the housing authority might require.  The time would begin to run only from the date on which the Minister has got all the information he wants.</P>
    <P>In moving the amendments, I expressed the opinion that five weeks may be too short, but for goodness' sake, give us a time limit, let it be five weeks, five months or even six months, as Deputy O'Leary suggested. In such circumstances, the applicant could proceed on the understanding that a firm decision would not be delayed longer than six months.  He would know he can be held up for six months but no longer.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to keep on harping back to the case I am interested in professionally.  The oral evidence was taken in that case on 30th June last. It was over and finished with as far as the applicant was concerned: he had done all he could be expected to do&mdash;he had subjected himself to examination and had put his cards on the table&mdash;and all that poor man could do was to wait for the result. There were all sorts of technicalities hanging on the result.  I was pushed about the matter of renewing the publicans' licences which the applicant had purchased, and all I could say was: &ldquo;Keep quiet for a minute and I hope we will have a decision in time to clarify the position at the annual licensing session of the district court in September.&rdquo;  Now, I hope we may be ready by next September.</P>
    <P>I point this out only for the purpose of emphasising the necessity for a time limit.  I will be satisfied with six months, which is a good long time.  Then, a professional person could say to a client: &ldquo;We will get a decision in two months, three months.  Have patience and we will know where we stand in six months at the outside.&rdquo;  I do not think that is unreasonable.  Courts are sometimes blamed for holding things up.  If the Minister has not the necessary staff in his office to enable him to give a decision on appeal within six months, he should provide himself with the necessary staff, especially where the rights of citizens are being interfered with and where it is in the interests of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="552" /> I trust the Minister will reconsider his opinion.  I realise that probably it would be against Departmental policy to accept a time limit or to impose regulations which would restrict the discretion of Departmental officials.  I am not saying that the holding up of these matters is done for the sake of holding them up, but sometimes it is difficult to understand why they are being held up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say only that it is not correct to state that the arguments for and against are already available to the Minister in an appeal. The appellant submits his case against the decision of the local authority and the ground for the appeal must be submitted to the local authority for their observation.  These observations must be made available to the appellant for his comments and it is only after that process has been gone through that the examination of the case can start in the Department.  Even at that stage, it may appear that there is very little between the two cases and that there may be some prospect of a solution being worked out acceptable to both parties.  Therefore, it would be unjust to the appellant to lay down a definite time limit.  It is all right to say that the appellant will know that his case will be decided in a period not longer than six months, but it will be poor consolation to the applicant to realise that the result of that stipulation is that his appeal cannot get adequate consideration.</P>
      <P>In many of these appeals, six months is adequate; but in others it is not.  Deputy Fitzpatrick should appreciate that.  I cannot deal with the case to which he refers because I do not know what the considerations are.  There have been many cases, for instance, in which oral hearings had been arranged and in which one of the parties felt unable to go ahead on the date decided and put forward a case for an adjournment.</P>

If a decision must be given, in spite of the fact that the case has not been fully examined, then I think that would be unfair to the applicant rather than to the local authority.  I can well understand the frustration of people whose appeals take a long time to deal with but some of them are very complicated and I think the suggestion <Col N="554" /> of Deputy Fitzpatrick is not a good one.</P>

      <P>As I remarked, section 4 is highly necessary.  A five week period is given to local authorities to decide on applications.  I want to raise the question as to whether the local authorities, as they are staffed at present, can cope with this provision. I am all for the provision being instituted and it is then a problem for the local authorities to see whether they can fulfil the demand.  Certainly in the city of Dublin I can see difficulties, having regard to the present staffing position, as to how exactly they will be able to comply with this provision. I certainly think a terminal period of five weeks is reasonable.</P>
      <P>Before a local authority decide on an application for demolition, regard will be had to the supply of housing available in the area.  Will this be restricted purely to municipal housing, or will regard be had to the overall supply of houses in an area?  With regard to the provision of alternative accommodation, or contributing to the cost of alternative accommodation, the question is: what cost is reasonable? What cost could compensate someone for a loss of accommodation? The cost of providing alternative accommodation in Dublin could be quite astronomical.  There are many people who may have had tenancies for a number of years who would find it very difficult indeed to get alternative accommodation.  What would it cost to compensate them for a fresh quest for housing as things stand in Dublin today?</P>
      <P>The provision in relation to adjoining buildings is also necessary because we have had cases of almost deliberate sabotage of adjoining houses in demolition work.  There were numerous instances of this in Dublin over the past two years.  I want to ask what kind of contribution to the cost of providing alternative accommodation is understood here?  What would be the criteria of the local authority?  It is very hard to see that any financial contribution, in the present conditions in Dublin city, would compensate anyone for a loss of accommodation that takes place as a result of an application like this.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I want to say very briefly, now that this amendment has been rejected and the section stands, that I should like to avail of this opportunity to urge on the Minister to see to it that there will be no undue delays in his Department in dealing with these appeals.  I do not expect the Minister to overcome the shortcomings of the applicants or the applicants' advisers, but I am appealing to the Minister to see to it that, in so far as he and his Department are concerned, there will be no delays and that decisions on appeals will be given promptly.  It must be conceded that these delays inflict great hardship. This House has given the Minister the Planning Act and is now giving him this measure in the interests of the community as a whole.  Having done that, the House is entitled to expect that the interests of individuals will not be interfered with any more than is necessary and that undue hardships will not be imposed on individuals by unreasonable delays.</P>

      <P>I have seen certain cases where efforts have been made to have families evicted from places on the pretext that the places are dangerous.  Is there any provision to protect families who are living, say, in flats over shops; the landlord requires these for business purposes, has someone come along and declare one wall dangerous and these people are evicted?  I do not know whether it comes under this or not, but it is a serious situation that could develop to the detriment of the families concerned. There is one other point.  It says here &ldquo;within five weeks&rdquo;.  What happens if the authority does not give permission or does not make a decision within five weeks?  Is there some penalty against such an authority?</P>

      <P>Where the local authority just falls down on the job <Col N="557" /> what action does the Minister take?  It would be serious if a house was demolished and the adjoining houses were damaged in the process.  There should be some protection for the people in the adjoining houses.  This is happening all over the city.  There was a case the other day where a house was declared dangerous and demolished, but the adjoining houses were damaged in the process.  The tenants seem to have no redress as yet in matters like this.</P>

      <P>With regard to Deputy O'Leary's fears that local authorities may not be able to deal with applications under this Bill within the period laid down, I can only say that I believe and my Department believe that five weeks is an adequate time to deal with these applications.  If Deputies feel strongly that the period of five weeks should be extended, I would be prepared to agree to some extension, but five weeks was deliberately put in because it was felt this was sufficient to deal with this type of case.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Leary says, it is provided that the local authority will take into account the question of the supply of housing available in the area.  This does not mean municipal housing only; it means the availability of houses for the people as a whole.  The question of the provision of alternative accommodation or the making of a contribution towards the cost of providing alternative accommodation by the housing authority is a matter for decision by the housing authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure Deputy Fitzpatrick that there will be no undue delays in the Department, that every effort will be made to streamline the procedure and have appeals dealt with as quickly as possible.  It is obviously desirable that appeals should not be decided except on the basis of adequate examination of the whole case both for and against the proposal.  If a decision on an application is not given by the housing authority within the period of five weeks, that permission is then available by default.  That is the same as the position under the Planning Act, that is, if the decision is not given within two months then the applicant can <Col N="558" /> assume permission by default.  The question of the protection of adjoining buildings is dealt with under the Bill.</P>

      <P>The local authority, I think, can be depended upon to make sure that that will not happen.  It does not happen, except in very rare cases, under the Planning Act that permission is obtained by default.  Local authorities are able so to arrange their affairs as to ensure that these things come up for decision within the statutory period. The only provision that can be made, if a time limit is laid down, is that, if the decision is not given within that time, then that permission may be obtained by default.</P>

      <P>We are trying to remove loopholes.  Legislation has been passed here which appeared to be comprehensive when going through but later it was discovered that a coach and four could be driven through the Minister's own regulations.  Are we leaving similar gaps in this Housing Bill so <Col N="559" /> that, because a local authority fails, for one reason or another, to give a decision, development goes through by default?  Have we no authority, either under the Minister or elsewhere, to look for penalties in such an event?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Deputy suggest?  It can be assumed that the local authorities will arrange a system so that it is practically impossible for it to happen, so that applications will automatically come up for decision before the statutory period has elapsed. There are upwards of 20,000 planning applications dealt with in a year and very few, if any, go by default, because planning authorities arrange their internal organisation so as to ensure that the application will come up for decision before the statutory period has elapsed.  You either lay down a statutory period within which applications must be decided or you do not.  Deputy O'Leary really seems to be arguing against any limit.  I do not see what else can be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that this section runs parallel to section 19 of the 1931 Act.  That section provided that a landlord, who failed to keep a house in repair or allowed it to fall into bad condition, could be served with notice to repair the property and, if he did not comply with the notice, the local authority could enter on the property, carry out the repairs and recover from the landlord. If the landlord refused to pay, the local authority could avail of the ordinary process of the law to get the money by instalments, or to take goods belonging to the landlord or whatever other method appeared appropriate to them.  If they failed again they could go to the tenant and repeat the entire process with the tenant.  My experience in the Louth County Council and Drogheda Corporation has been that this is a bad section because it has been utilised to cover up the fact that <Col N="560" /> new houses were not being built and it has resulted in the repair of houses which should have been certified as unfit for human habitation.  We had the situation in which houses which were not suitable for reconstruction were actually reconstructed and at the end of five or ten years the people had to be rehoused out of those houses. Very often trouble arose because a person in a reconstructed house was not regarded as eligible for a new house since there was a file somewhere saying that the house he occupied was fit for human habitation.  I am puzzled as to why this section is included in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I regret my few remarks should get that kind of response from some of the businessmen on the Fianna Fáil benches.  I suppose it is a case of bad consciences.  It is true that people have deliberately set out to wreck perfectly sound property. This is a very important provision. There have been cases in which the lead has been stripped off the roofs to ensure that the property would deteriorate all the quicker, and that at a time when we have a grave housing shortage.  This will be a question of staffing because there will have to be much greater surveillance and more frequent inspection to ensure that property is not allowed to run down so that the speculator can go in and enrich himself at the expense of the unfortunate tenants.  There are hundreds of people at the moment living <Col N="562" /> in property which has been described as unfit for human habitation.  The local authority have been unable to house these people.</P>

      <P>We hear a good deal about these office blocks.  In an affluent society it is inevitable that there will be a great number of factories built.  If we are to take Deputy O'Leary's contribution literally workers are not to go into any office block at all: they are to work out in the rain. They are not to dare to turn a house into an office block, good, bad or indifferent. They may not even say: &ldquo;This house is declared dangerous&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We must be reasonable in all things. We had the position here in 1963 that more houses fell down in the area I then represented than had to be taken down by the dangerous buildings section of Dublin Corporation.  It is not correct to give the impression that houses were taken down wholesale. With other members of the housing committee of Dublin Corporation, of which Deputy Denis Larkin was Chairman, I was a member of many deputations, and the Minister always received us courteously and listened sympathetically to our representations. As a result, we started the Ballymun housing scheme under which 3,000 families have been housed.  There are still some houses which are dangerous.</P>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that I am all in favour of decent accommodation for workers in this country.  There are places in Dublin where unfortunate clerical workers are trying to carry on their duties under very unsuitable working conditions and the same can be said of some Government offices also.  The conditions are a danger to the health of those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be fair.  We cannot go so far east that we will be west again or south that we will be north again or <Col N="563" /> any other way you like to put it.

In a completely socialist State, nobody can do anything without the permission of a dictator and anything he demands must be done.

We are all agreed in our condemnation of the ruthless demolition of houses in this city in the past few years&mdash;not just in the past year, as I have heard it stated&mdash;for the purpose of serving commercial interests. I remember being told by a dispensary doctor about a house which was being demolished.  He was told that the two children who were ill would have to be moved immediately as they were in a dangerous building. He, with his limited knowledge, did not see anything dangerous about it.  He called in an architect to inspect the building and was told that there was nothing wrong with the house and that it did not need to be demolished.  Of course, when he raised his objection the night marauders were in, stripping the roof of this house and leaving it exposed for this poor family who lived at the top of the house.  This is one example of what happened in Dublin over the last few years.  The Minister will agree that the reckless demolition of these houses created a housing shortage because everybody who was evicted helped to swell the Dublin Corporation's housing waiting list. Then these houses were repaired for conversion into offices but the people could not return to them.  This was very wrong.  We see a glaring example of this situation in the pock-marked city which we have.  If the Housing authority decide what houses will be demolished&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to Deputy O'Leary and to Deputy O'Connell, they are missing the point. I do not want to infringe the rules of order but this is relevant to the section. We must not lose sight of the fact that this section, and indeed the whole Bill, is an emergency measure designed to deal with a particular situation which, when all is said and done, is a temporary emergency and marginal matter, the fundamental problem of housing, which we cannot go into, being a much bigger thing.  What I would like to say about this section, to balance what Deputy O'Connell says, is that it is all right where clearly you have a habitable house but there are a lot of old type tenement houses all over the city about which, even if the Minister or the Corporation were to devote an exorbitant amount of money to them, because of age or fundamental structural defect, nothing could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary may not have been a Deputy when this occurred but for as long as I can remember there was a problem in the older part of Dublin to the north, ranging from Temple Street, Dorset Street, Queen Street, Blackhall Place and around that area, <Col N="569" /> where there were buildings 200 years old which had been allowed to deteriorate into abominable slums.  At one time this city enjoyed the unenviable reputation of having nearly the worst slums in Europe.  Those of us who knew that area were confronted not with the problem of keeping the people in the houses but with the problem of the people coming to us and saying: &ldquo;For God's sake, will you get us out of this?&rdquo;  It was a very interesting social experiment&mdash;the Ceann Comhairle will pardon me for referring to this but it is relevant to the question of repairs&mdash;to find that when these people were housed properly in new estates, the first being Cabra, they blossomed forth into good citizens.  I will not name the precise location for Deputy O'Leary because people have their sensitivities and do not like to be pinpointed, but if the Deputy wants the addresses I will give them to him privately.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should know that there are areas still in that constituency where houses are being maintained although uninhabitable and where the best thing that could happen would be for these houses to be cleared out.  Any attempt to assist the existing landlord to maintain people in those houses is doing a disservice and keeping people living under sub-standard conditions and defeating the prospect of the people bettering themselves.  To come now to a much more recent experience in regard to this, several years ago the situation was brought home forcibly by two tragedies.  The first was in our constituency&mdash;we have the honour to represent Bolton Street&mdash;and that tragedy was followed up by the Holles Street collapse in which two children were killed.  From my own knowledge I know that we had the greatest difficulty getting these houses condemned. Deputy O'Leary will know that by now the Queen Street-Blackhall Place area has been demolished, as well as the whole of Dorset Street, but he might be interested to know that representatives both of the Corporation and of this House spent anxious nights personally watching houses in Dorset Street in case they would collapse and so as to see what could be done because the machinery of the public <Col N="570" /> authority was too slow.  I remember also one night of crisis in Blackhall Place where, if it had not been for the priests in Halston Street who accommodated the people temporarily in a school, these people would have had to remain on the streets because nothing that could be done would have made those houses habitable.  They were unrepairable.  If they had been patched up they would still be dangerous and our problem was to see that no temporary patching was done.  It is interesting to see this change of attitude in the House because one of the Deputy's colleagues was down there with us at the same time.  Our anxiety was to get houses condemned and we had great difficulty in doing it.  There are still houses that I believe should be condemned and cleared.  This is the background to this section.</P>
    <P>More specifically in regard to this section, what I find difficult to see, in its interpretation, is how it can be enforced.  Clearly, if there is a case such as Dr. O'Connell is talking about where there is a really habitable house which for purely commercial reasons is being removed, the Deputy will not have to push me very far to be in sympathy with him.  But I want to see the other side of the coin and the dangers in this Bill and the danger that we in this House should think that there is a panacea or general remedy, or even a significant contribution to the solution of Dublin's housing problem in this Bill.  There may be a peripheral problem to deal with.  If the Deputy gives me evidence of that I shall need very little convincing.  But let us not enlarge on the problem or be swept away in consideration of another aspect of this matter, just because this other aspect is there.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the House would permit me to make what is, strictly speaking, an irrelevant observation although it is still related to this Bill?</P>

I merely mentioned the fact that the Dublin Corporation are so much understaffed as regards architects <Col N="572" /> that they cannot possibly inspect every single house or dwelling that may be dangerous.  The Minister knows it is a fact that there are not sufficient architects employed in Dublin Corporation because they cannot get them. We have a serious shortage of architects. This is very important: what I said was that we cannot and Dublin Corporation cannot possibly provide architects for every case of a building that is reported to be dangerous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was in the Chair I referred to the fact that section 19 of the 1931 Act seemed to do everything covered by this section 5 and from that point of view it is possible that there is an element of window-dressing in this Bill, as suggested by Deputy O'Leary.  I was amazed to find Deputy de Valera, a man of some sensitivity, talking about the happening in Dorset Street in Dublin and elsewhere and saying that there was no panacea.  I say there was a panacea; there is none now.  If the Deputy's Party had not cut down the number of houses built in the years 1958, 1959, 1960 and 1961 to 50 per cent of what had been built previously, the sad fatalities referred to would not have occurred.  That is a matter of finance and general local government law and I do not want to dwell on it in here but I must refer to cross-talk between the Minister and myself.  When I said that in my 14 years in this House and the Seanad I had never made a personal remark to any Deputy, the Minister retorted: &ldquo;Deputy Donegan, indeed!  Of course you did.&rdquo;  I have vigorously contended in the House with the Minister himself and with everybody else on the opposite side.  I have contended with some of my own Party members in the Party-room as hard as I could but I do not think that I have ever gone further than making a humorous remark to another Deputy.  Perhaps the Deputy might not consider humorous or perhaps my humour might differ from his but I have never made a personal remark. I have never called anybody a coward and I have never yet tried to hit anybody in the passages.  If the Minister wishes to make this charge against me I should like to know if he will now <Col N="573" /> substantiate it and say when I made a deliberately personal and insulting remark to any Member of this House or the other House in the 14 years I have been here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>To clear up a point on section 3 without going into any general discussion, it is a fact that this matter of deliberately bringing property into disrepair and afterwards demolishing it and putting an office block in its place has been a burning question in Dublin and other areas. This section seeks to end that situation and it is very important that it should do so.  We regret it has not been done sooner.  The idea that by welcoming such a section we are in the same breath condemning people to live in existing bad conditions is of course quite wrong.  The rehousing of people depends on the standards we have and I suggest that in all the older parts of the city people must be rehoused.  I think that those in the older Corporation housing schemes should also be considered for rehousing because the standards of the 30s are not the standards of 1969.  That is by the way.  The point we now strive to make is that the immediate priority in Dublin is not office building but the provision of houses, not the provision of better office blocks but the provision of better housing.  Any building programme that is to succeed must put its resources to work at the point of greatest need, which is not office blocks but housing. That is a matter of priority.  It is exceedingly wrong of Deputies to suggest that we were talking about iron dictatorship when we are merely talking about a system of priority when it comes to buildings.  We do not suggest that somebody should not make legitimate profit in certain areas but we see that the profit is being made out of office blocks which we cannot afford at present.</P>

Despite the temptation to deal with this subject, my decision is to leave this to the appropriate occasion and, that being so, there really is not much point in my intervening at all because, in fact, in so far as this section of the Bill which we are supposed to be discussing is concerned, the only dispute is between Deputy Donegan on behalf of the Fine Gael Party and every other Deputy in the House.  The only argument here is whether or not this provision is required in the Bill.  I say that this is vital to the Bill and, as far as I know, every other Deputy, except Deputy Donegan, agrees that it is vital.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Donegan's sole intention is to disrupt the proceedings of the House, he is at liberty to do it as far as I am concerned but I listened to Deputy Donegan speaking twice on this Bill and, as I said, the only dispute I can see in so far as this section is concerned is between Deputy Donegan and the rest of the House.  I say this section is vital to the Bill and <Col N="575" /> that the Bill would be pointless without this section.</P>
      <P>I may say that as Minister for Local Government I do not know of any case in which demolition of houses took place in the absence of permission for development of the sites. Deputy O'Connell talks of ruthless demolition of houses but no evidence has been produced in the various debates that we have had here of ruthless demolition of houses in the absence of planning permission having been granted for alternative development of the sites and that is why I say that the control that we are seeking to provide under this Bill could not be operated under the Planning Act because in the case of any demolition that we know of, in the City of Dublin at any rate, planning permission had already been obtained for the development of that site.  So, it is quite clear that if it was necessary to seek planning permission for demolition, there were not sufficiently strong planning considerations to reject such application.  Therefore, that shows, as I have been claiming all along, that it is only under housing legislation that this question of the demolition of habitable houses can be effectively dealt with and that the proposal to deal with it under the Planning Act was just an impractical suggestion and one that would not secure the objective that we have in view of preventing the demolition of habitable house in conditions of a shortage of housing accommodation.</P>

      <P>I am saying that I do not know of any case in which that happened.  What we are trying to provide against in this section is the case of the individual, the speculator as he is referred to, who, in order to circumvent the provisions of this Bill, will deliberately allow a sound, habitable house that is needed to house people to deteriorate into such a condition that it will be no longer habitable.  It may be, as has been suggested, that in order to operate this section properly, <Col N="576" /> increased staffing will be necessary. This may or may not be true.  It seems to me that if there is to be really adequate inspection this will probably be so and certainly the whole exercise of bringing in this legislation will be futile if there is not adequate inspection and if those people who would deliberately allow, or, indeed, deliberately cause, a house to deteriorate are not discovered in time to operate this provision but this is in my opinion vital to the Bill and I agree, as far as I can see, with the rest of the House, except Deputy Donegan, that that is so.</P>

      <P>I want to point out that what I said was&mdash;and this has not been dealt with by the Minister&mdash;there is nothing in this section that is not contained in section 19 of the Act of 1931 which, in my view, gives the same power which I as a member of a local authority have seen operated by that local authority.  I described precisely what could be done: the buildings could be entered; the reconstruction work could be specified; if the landlord did not do it the local authority could enter upon the building, could avail of the grants given and seek the money from the landlord, could take his goods from him if he would not give the money; could then put an instalment order upon him and then repeat the entire process on the tenant, if they wished so to do.  I have asked the Minister is there anything in this section that could not be done under the Act of 1931.</P>

      <P>I would draw to the attention of the other Deputy for my constituency, Deputy de Valera, and the Minister, that they will recall that a whole street disappeared in the last three years.  Dorset Row disappeared from the map of Dublin. A <Col N="577" /> public street was closed in at either end and the houses on either side were knocked down.  That was under the conditions prevailing up to now.  I do not know that it ever received any attention.  A public thoroughfare was closed in at either end.  The older inhabitants can remember that houses existed on either side.  These were definitely sound houses.  Probably people could point out other instances around the city.  In no sense were these houses bad.  They were good houses. They were in the centre of the city. They had many more years of useful life.  Their retention could have saved a strain on the municipal housing position. But, because the existing situation allowed a complete open game to those involved in the business, this street was taken over for commercial purposes. I recall the case of Dorset Row, in which a public street was taken over for commercial purposes.</P>

      <P>The 1931 Housing Act has of course been replaced by the 1966 Act and part of the provision to which Deputy Donegan refers is of course that these repairs must be possible at reasonable cost.  Here we are dealing with a different situation. We are dealing with a situation in which a house is deliberately allowed to fall into disrepair and the question of its restoration at reasonable cost does not enter into the provision in this Bill.  As well as that, obviously the section of the Housing Act to which Deputy Donegan refers deals with cases of tenanted houses but this provision deals with habitable houses whether they are inhabited or not.  It deals with the case of the habitable house of which vacant possession is obtained and which is deliberately allowed to deteriorate in order to try to circumvent the other provisions in this Bill. There is an obvious difference.</P>
      <P>I have not got the complete volumes of the Dáil Debates here which would enable me to look up instances of Deputy Donegan's past conduct in the House.  Perhaps, he would go through them himself.  I can only rely on my own experience.</P>

The Minister, having said that, should give the instances during the past 14 years in which I, in this House or the other one, suggested improper dealings in regard to any Member of this House, or instances in which I was insulting or provocative. I am entitled to that and if I do not get it I shall have to take the matter up, either now or later, with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Section 9 is a far-reaching section.  It is a section that excludes certain buildings from the Bill and in my opinion it could undo everything that the Bill sets out to do.  The section reads:</P>
      <P>(1)  This Act shall not apply to the demolition in whole or in part or the use otherwise than for human habitation of any habitable house where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a planning authority or the Minister has, before the passing of this Act, decided to grant a permission or approval under section 26 of the Act of 1963 for development involving the demolition or change of use, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection to that but I regard subsections (2) and (3) as being dangerous. It is very difficult to follow <Col N="579" /> what exactly subsection (2) means. The subsection reads:</P>
    <P>A permission under this Act shall not be required in relation to the use otherwise than for human habitation of part of any habitable house for, but only for, so long as the house is principally used as a dwelling and the change of use does not cause to reside elsewhere a person who, immediately before the change of use, was ordinarily resident in such house.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to understand that subsection and while I am doing my best to follow it, I believe it could operate in the following way.  A person could have a large house set out in flats and if the halldoor flat became vacant and was vacant for some time, the owner of the house could decide to turn the ground floor of that house into an office and, in my opinion, subsection (2)  of section 9 would relieve him of the necessity of applying for permission to change the use of the house because, of course, the ground floor or halldoor flat being vacant, there would be no question of anybody being compelled to reside elsewhere as a result of the change in use.  The community could be deprived of this house which was ordinarily used for human habitation.</P>
    <P>I know the subsection says that the house shall be excluded from the measure for, but only for, as long as the house is principally used as a dwelling.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us what he has in mind in relation to subsection (3) which says:</P>
    <P>This Act shall not apply in relation to the following, namely&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the demolition of a habitable house in case the demolition is of a class, or complies with conditions, prescribed for the purposes of this subsection,</P>
    <P>(b)  the use of a habitable house otherwise than for human habitation in case such use is of a class, or complies with conditions so prescribed, and</P>
    <P>(c)  a habitable house situate in an area which for the time being is so prescribed.</P>
    <P>This subsection, in so far as I can see, <Col N="580" /> gives the Minister power to make regulations prescribing certain things which, in effect, exclude whole streets or areas from this subsection.  It is a pity that some of the Labour Deputies who spoke at such length on some of the other sections did not remain to try to find out what this particular subsection means.  It is my opinion that we are dealing with this measure because the Minister was enabled to make regulations under the Planning and Development Act and when he was making those regulations he decided that demolition was not development and, therefore, demolition was excluded from the Planning and Development Act.  In other words, it became unnecessary to get planning permission to knock down a house or to knock down a whole street of houses That is the only reason why the Minister found it necessary to introduce the Bill with which we are now dealing. As I have said, subsections (2) and (3) of section 9 can undo all that the other sections, especially section 3, sets out to do.  I shall not say any more at this stage but I should like the Minister to tell me and to tell the House what, precisely, is the meaning of subsection (2) and what he has in mind in subsection (3).</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think subsection (2) is so difficult to understand. The type of thing we have in mind is the case of, say, a widow who has lost her husband and decides to utilise a room in the house for the purpose of dressmaking, hairdressing and so on and the change of use obviously does not involve the displacement of any person from living accommodation.  In the case Deputy Fitzpatrick put forward, that is the conversion of one flat in a house into an office, that clearly involves the loss of a full unit of accommodation and therefore I think it would be clearly outside subsection (2) as the change of use would entail any person who was resident in the flat getting out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The flat is a dwelling. What Deputy Fitzpatrick is putting forward would be a change of use of a complete dwelling.  If it is a habitable dwelling then permission would have to be obtained under this Bill, when it is passed.  Clearly the changing of use of a complete dwelling from a dwelling to an office does involve the displacement of any person residing in it.  The mere fact the flat happens to be vacant does not change the issue.  I agree that subsection (3) is a subsection which may never be necessary.  What is intended is that it may at some later stage appear to be desirable to exempt from the provisions of this Bill some particular class of building.  I think many Deputies will see there may be no necessity for this Bill to operate at all in certain parts of the country. That is the idea of subsection (3): to give power to prescribe by regulation either the omission or exemption of certain classes of premises or the exemption of certain areas from the application of the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is not definite that this will ever be required.  If Deputy Fitzpatrick has any strong objection to this subsection I have no objection to dropping it.  It may be desirable to bring an amendment at some stage to insert it into the Bill but I agree there is no obvious need for it at the present time.  It was felt it was desirable to have it in in case it was needed.  As regards subsection (2) I think it is necessary to have that in and to me it is quite clear that the case of changing the use of a complete flat would be outside that subsection.</P>

There are cases, and this is likely to happen in certain areas of the city, where you have a complete house, say a five-roomed house, with two rooms on the ground floor and bedrooms above where, as in the case mentioned by the Minister, a widow is left without her husband and the family may elect to live in the top storey and to let say the two front rooms &mdash;what is in effect the ground floor&mdash; as an office.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am obliged to the Minister in so far as subsection (3) is concerned and I would be glad to accept his proposal to delete it.  The Minister quite fairly says that it is not necessary now and I think he goes further to say that it does not appear to be necessary in the foreseeable future.  If it becomes necessary an amendment can be brought in to cover this.  I do not entirely agree with the Minister about subsection (2).  We would all have the greatest sympathy with the poor widow who finds it necessary to turn one or two rooms into a dressmaking business, a hairdressing saloon or even to let portion of her house in order to augment her income. However, we would find, if that subsection is put in to facilitate the poor widow, that wealthy or unscrupulous landlords would come in on the bandwagon to avail of that.  I do not agree with the Minister that changing the use of the entire flat, which was occupied but vacant at the moment, would not exclude it from this subsection.</P>
      <P>Say the flat is vacant for a month and you change the use of it into a workshop or an office room, this would not cause anybody who is residing in the flat immediately before the change of use to reside elsewhere and that is the text of the subsection. The Minister relies on saying that the flat is a dwelling.  Subsection (2) says:</P>
      <P>A permission under this Act shall not be required in relation to the use otherwise than for human habitation or part of any habitable house.</P>

A house means <Col N="583" /> a building or a part of a building which is used as a dwelling.  I suppose then a flat would be regarded as part of a building.  I can only say if that is so my main objection to subsection (2) would then be removed.  I can only suggest to the Minister between now and when he brings this Bill to the Seanad that he satisfies himself that that is in fact so and that subsection (2) does not provide a loophole for somebody by degrees to turn a house which was let out in flats to some other industrial or commerical use.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> We on this side of the House welcomed this Bill when it was introduced. We recognised that a coach and four was being driven through the Planning and Development Act, 1963, in so far as the obvious intention of that Act was being evaded.  It was being evaded because of regulations made by the Minister which declared that the plastering of the outside of a house and the demolition of a house were one and the same thing.  Following those regulations it was possible to demolish one house, two houses, or a whole street of houses.  In that way houses which were badly needed as dwellings in a city in which there is an acute housing problem were being either demolished altogether or changed from dwelling houses into office suites, <Col N="584" /> or commercial buildings of one sort or another.  We felt so strongly about that position that in 1967 we introduced a Bill into Seanad Éireann to amend the Planning and Development Act in order to ensure that such houses would not be demolished or changed into offices or buildings other than dwelling houses.  What is being done in this Bill would have been done equally well in the Bill which we introduced into the Seanad in 1967.  The Minister thought otherwise.  He thought the Bill we introduced in the Seanad was not as effective as the measure which he introduced here some time ago and with which we are now dealing.  The pity is that the Minister did not introduce this Bill into Dáil Éireann sooner.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I want to give credit where credit is due.  I have often had occasion to complain that the Minister adopted an unreasonable attitude about either legislation proposals or electoral proposals.  I want to go on record as saying that the Minister behaved in a most reasonable manner in so far as this Bill was concerned. The only exception was his refusal to impose a time limit on the Minister with regard to appeals.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I welcome particularly the deletion of subsection (3) of section 9.  It is very important.  In my opinion, if subsection (3) of section 9 had been allowed to stand part of this Bill, then the Bill might as well never have been introduced. The deletion of subsection (3) of section 9 is a very worthwhile amendment.  I wish to thank the Minister for accepting it.  The Bill only does what we say should have been done in 1967.  The two amendments which I <Col N="585" /> have mentioned are a considerable improvement on it.</P>
      <P>Deputy P.J. Burke, in one of his sanctimonious speeches, spoke about the necessity of providing proper office accommodation for workers.  I entirely agree with the sentiment, but I say there is only one thing more necessary than proper office accommodation for workers and that is proper housing.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera referred to this as a temporary measure and as a measure necessary to deal with an emergency.  I can only hope that the emergency will soon be cleared up. I can only hope that, until such time as the workers of this city and of the country as a whole are provided with proper living accommodation and dwelling houses, it will not be possible to pull down dwelling houses and convert them into luxurious office blocks whether those office blocks are for the use of the Civil Service or any other workers, whoever they are.</P>

      <P>I would not know. I was half way home by then.  During the debate we had two Dublin Deputies who knew what the conditions in Dublin were like.  This Bill applies to the whole country, but mainly refers to Dublin.  It was only right to have people who knew the conditions in Dublin speaking on it.  The reference which Deputy Burke made to office blocks replacing houses, and that workers needed to go in out of the rain, was, I think, beside the point altogether.  So far as the office blocks are concerned, the people working out in the rain do not go into the office blocks except to collect their pay.  They are allowed in for that, if their boots are clean.  The Minister says that buildings were not knocked down in the city. The buildings in Mountjoy Square have been half-knocked down and left in a <Col N="586" /> dangerous condition for a long period. The Minister might be able to use his influence to have something done about them.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a good measure and the only pity is that it was not introduced long before now.  A lot of damage was done, perhaps not to as great an extent as has been alleged&mdash;we all like to exaggerate at times&mdash;by the indiscriminate pulling down of buildings. From time to time many of us were embarrassed when some of our friends or erstwhile friends engaged in this business.  Buildings were allowed to go into disrepair so that the unfortunate tenants could be put out and the buildings demolished.</P>
      <P>I wish to make one other comment on this matter, because the Minister seemed to be adamant on the question of the type of person who condemned buildings.  I have experience of being in a building during the dangerous building scare in this city when one of these people came in.  I have no hesitation in saying that he had no qualifications whatever and he admitted this. However, he condemned the building and put the owner to the expense of £1,400 to £1,500, though an architect had said the repairs were not necessary. A person without qualifications said they were necessary and they had to be done.  I am sure the Minister is aware that was the situation.  Perhaps, there are not enough trained people available and, perhaps, they could be better employed than in inspecting buildings, but where inspection involves expensive repairs being carried out, it should be by somebody other than an ordinary person without qualifications.  The Bill will be welcomed because it will undo something which could have been harmful.  The Minister said this matter could not have been covered in planning legislation.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that the preservation of buildings, not having them knocked down, to be replaced by office blocks and to give the local authority much greater power in this respect, is desirable.  I hope, however, that the Bill is not designed just to give way to some pressure that is being put on by the Georgian Society or the Old Dublin Society or such people.  The corporation gave way to pressure by these people and Georgian buildings in Seán McDermott Street were preserved at a cost of £1,000 per room at that time.  It would cost £3,000 per room now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These buildings are nothing more than substandard slums and there is no point in preserving buildings if they are to remain slums.  Similar buildings were pulled down and replaced by brick-faced structures and they provide comfortable, modern dwellings sought after by many people who wish to live in the city centre.  Those people who demonstrated in Islandbridge should see what is being done to provide modern flats for working class people.  Let us ensure that buildings <Col N="588" /> can be pulled down if they are to be replaced by habitable accommodation but do not let us do what is being done in London&mdash;pulled down buildings being replaced by office blocks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass's remarks have tempted me to repeat a point I made on Second Stage about a danger in this Bill.  It is precisely that this Bill might, from the long-term point of view, react on efforts to solve the housing situation.  Deputy Lemass said that the experiment to preserve old houses in the north side of the city and, so to speak, to adapt them, was not a success and that it does not compare with properly designed new buildings. The kernel of this Bill is that it gives power to the Minister which is necessary in the present situation. When all is said and done we are dealing with a peripheral problem in the housing situation in Dublin and as Deputy Lemass has said the important thing is to get ahead with the provision of proper housing for the future.</P>
      <P>That will involve the demolition of many existing dwellings and the practical problem is to supply the new as quickly as we destroy the old.  Deputy Tully spoke of the type of persons carrying out inspections and I can assure him from my personal experience on sites during the crisis of falling houses, in Mountjoy Square, in Dorset Street, in Queen Street, in Blackhall Place, the problem was to get the buildings condemned.  It was not a question of people being too willing to condemn and to force repairs. The trouble was that, there being no alternative accommodation available for those people, they were being left too long in dangerous circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am mentioning only my experience and there are two sides to every story.  I speak at this stage only to reinforce what Deputy Lemass has said.  If this Bill is looked at coldly in its context, it is not a general remedy for the housing situation.  It will not do much to help in the long run.  It is a holding <Col N="589" /> operation.  If misused&mdash;this may be an unpopular thing to say&mdash;such a provision could operate in a directly opposite way to that in which we wish it to operate.  I should like to say, therefore, on the Fifth Stage of the Bill, that its proper application will be as important as its passage through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a housing Bill, not a planning Bill.  It has not been brought in, as Deputy Fitzpatrick has said, because a coach and four was being driven through the Planning Act.  If the Planning Act had been found to be deficient in any way, it would have been amended. This Bill had nothing whatever to do with it.  As I have said, there has been no evidence that the Planning Act was being circumvented in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know of any way in which demolition of houses took place in which permission for some other development was not obtained.  This legislation was introduced because it was decided by the Government that in existing circumstances it was desirable to have effective control over the demolition of habitable houses and the matter we desired to be taken into consideration in this connection was the question of the need for housing accommodation in the local authority area concerned.  Clearly then it was housing legislation that was required in order to provide this effective control to ensure that housing considerations would be the deciding factor.  It must be quite clear that, if planning considerations did not preclude the development proposed on the site of these houses, then planning considerations could not preclude the demolition which was an essential part of the whole proposal and that obviously, since there were cases of habitable houses being demolished, the only way of dealing with it was through housing legislation, through legislation that would promote the taking into consideration of the question that there was a housing shortage and that it was not in the public interest that useful and sound housing accommodation should be removed and replaced by other development which did <Col N="590" /> not conflict with planning considerations.</P>
    <P>I refute the suggestion that what we are proposing to do could have been done in any effective way whatever under the Planning Act.  The Planning Act could not be utilised for this purpose. There is ample evidence available in this city to show that that is so because, as I said, in every case that I know of where houses were demolished there was in existence already permission for alternative development. That shows that planning considerations could not have secured the retention of those houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete the words &ldquo;twenty pounds&rdquo; where they occur and substitute where they first occur &ldquo;one pound per day for each sheep&rdquo; and where they secondly occur to substitute &ldquo;one pound per sheep&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make it quite clear that a person who brings sheep illegally on to the Curragh will do so in such a way that it will be quite certain he will not gain a benefit from it.  Twenty pounds for three or four months for 100 sheep or so would be the cheapest possible grazing.  There is in the section provision for a continuing offence but <Col N="591" /> I think that is a continuing offence after the conviction.  If it meant that on the consideration of any prosecution it could be considered as a continuing offence before the conviction, I would not have the same objection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the amendment because, if it were accepted, it would mean that one would have to be sure of the exact number of sheep involved.  That would mean having to count the number of sheep on the Curragh.  If there were 6,000 sheep there it would be practically impossible to be sure how many trespassers there were.  If somebody was taken to court for having ten sheep trespassing and he could prove that there were nine or 11 it could possibly mean that the case would be thrown out.  Anybody who deals with sheep knows that it is hard to be accurate.  This would involve a lot of extra work.  It would mean taking all the sheep through the pens and counting them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is £20 for 500 or £20 for two.  There is some logic in the amendment, is there not?  I am sorry, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the amendment, it is for each sheep trespassing on the Curragh.  In the Bill, whether a person has one sheep or 500 sheep, it is the same.  It may seem unfair but one must look at the practical end of it, at how the regulation is to be implemented.  If it is not as it is set out in the Bill I feel it would cause a good deal of trouble because it is very hard to be definite where numbers of sheep are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Stage of this Bill we had a long discussion on this and it was alleged, and was not contradicted, that up to 3,000 sheep had been illegally put on the Curragh.  It struck me when Deputy Sweetman put down this amendment that if they were to be fined £1 per day per sheep for 2,000 or 3,000 sheep it would be £2,000 or £3,000 per day, a pretty hefty fine.  I would not go along with Deputy Crinion's argument at all because as Deputy Corish interjected, this simply means that if a <Col N="592" /> man is going to break the law at all he will break it in a big way.  There is no point in putting in a couple of dozen sheep if you can put in 2,000 or 3,000 for the same fine.  As far as the question of having to take them through the pens in order to count them is concerned, Deputy Crinion knows there is an easier way of counting sheep than that and I think the short cut would be taken in a case like this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I forgot that.  It is not a question of how many sheep there are.  The deterrent is what counts and I think the ultimate deterrent is making the fine big enough to frighten people who apparently have been bullying their way on to the Curragh for free grazing while others have been paying their way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that would be a deterrent.  We must remember there are four people on the Curragh&mdash;the maor and his three assistants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that this leaves it open and that a person can be fined the same amount for having 1,000 sheep trespassing as a person who has ten or 20, but we must look at it this way.  The Act was contravened on a technicality three or four years ago. I would say that there would be a grave danger that we could not get a prosecution through if we did not have the exact number of sheep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Crinion would be wise not to rely on his interpretation of the law in the hope of avoiding a conviction.  Of course, it is quite clear that when the maor or the deputy maor brings up the person concerned, he will have to prove that there were at least so many sheep belonging to that person.  At present a man out of a cottage who put a couple of sheep on the Curragh would be penalised in exactly the same amount as a person who put 300, 400 <Col N="593" /> or 500 sheep on the Curragh, and that is bad legislation.</P>

      <P>Much would depend on how the district justice would deal with the case of a man with three sheep as distinct from someone with 1,000 sheep.  The penalties proposed in section 6 of the Bill, as introduced, are maximum penalties and if the district justice would, on conviction, impose the maximum penalties specified, I think that would suffice.</P>
