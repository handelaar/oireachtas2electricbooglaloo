      <P>Does the Taoiseach not consider, in view of the statement of the Minister for Finance on television on 18th March, that we should be debating the state of the economy in view of the fact that the Dáil will not meet for two and a half weeks?</P>

      <P>I proposed last week that there should be such a debate but <Col N="1220" /> it has not been possible to get agreement. I suggested, first of all, that we might debate the Third Programme this week.  I think Labour Party Members asked if it could be done and they specifically suggested that the state of the economy be included in that.  I said I was agreeable.  Then it was conveyed to me that the Opposition Parties thought that the time available this week would not be sufficient to debate the Third Programme and the state of the economy.  Then I had a suggestion conveyed that I could make a statement on the state of the economy on the Adjournment and that the Adjournment Debate on Friday would cover that item.  It was conveyed to me then that that would not be satisfactory either.  The third suggestion put forward was that we debate the Estimates that would require to be taken this week including tomorrow and include in that debate the debate on the economy.  That was not satisfactory either.  Now we have come to the situation that we have found agreement on the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>May I say that the position is that the Taoiseach suggested to the Whips that he would make a statement.  The Whips disagreed with this because they wanted a discussion on the Taoiseach's statement.  Can the Taoiseach say whether there is any good reason why we should not meet next week to have an Adjournment Debate?</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1221" /> I do not think it is necessary.  The Opposition Deputies had an opportunity of taking this debate this week. Nevertheless, the debate on the Health Estimate was continued over a period of three weeks.  There was plenty of opportunity last week to wind up the Health Estimate.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;Minister for External Affairs.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate provides additional funds for the repatriation and maintenance of destitute Irish persons abroad.  This is an aspect of the problem about which we have spoken and expressed concern for some considerable time.  The attitude of the Government has always been that if Irish persons get into financial difficulties in Britain or elsewhere and require assistance the services available at the Embassy there will ensure that they are provided with a passage back to this country.  That attitude was criticised on many occasions as being inadequate, unfair and unsuited to the problems which affect a number of Irish persons who get into economic or financial difficulties.  The Minister for Labour announced last year at the opening of a new employment exchange that it was proposed to introduce some scheme, the details of which have not yet been published, to provide assistance for Irish emigrants who get into difficulties.</P>
      <P>The problem has two aspects: there is the need to provide guidance and information at certain centres for Irish people seeking advice, and the need to provide some means whereby those who become financially embarrassed can be assisted and, to whatever extent possible, rehabilitated.  This problem mainly concerns Irish emigrants in Britain.  While, no doubt, cases occur of Irish people getting into difficulties elsewhere, most of the people who leave this country for countries other than Britain have arrangements made to find employment or have contacts through which they secure positions either in advance of their emigration or shortly after arriving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time has come to review the procedure which has been in operation. It is true that a great many active and <Col N="1224" /> well organised voluntary organisations in Britain, many of them Irish associations or organisations in which Irish people play a significant part, provide assistance for and guidance to people seeking such assistance or advice.</P>
    <P>However, some form of recognised information and advice or welfare centres should be established in conjunction with the Irish Embassy in the main centres in Britain.  Obviously it is beyond our resources to establish welfare centres in all cities, but there are key places such as Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and London where large numbers of Irish immigrants traditionally go to seek employment, where in many cases they keep in close touch with each other.  It is mainly in the places I have mentioned that the particular problems occur and that is where such centres should be established. This type of assistance should, of course, be associated with the voluntary organisations which already work there and which, as I say, have given very considerable help and, indeed, material assistance in one form or another to Irish people needing it.</P>
    <P>The other problem which has been discussed here is the lack of any form of control on young persons going to Britain.  The most serious aspect of the whole question is: The moral and other dangers and personal risks of all kinds that confront young persons going to Britain without any family connections, in many cases without adequate guidance from parents or guardians, who, merely on a contact, possibly a friend or some other contact, travel to completely new environments where conditions are entirely different from what they are used to.  I do not want to labour or exaggerate the gravity of this situation, but it is serious.  Most Deputies who have been dealing with this problem and those religious and social groups who have been devoting their time to this work in Britain have all adverted to and expressed concern about this particular problem.  This is a problem the solution of which must involve some form of control.  Because of the administrative difficulties involved and because of a reluctance to impose control, Departments and, for that matter, Governments have shied away from tackling the problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1225" /> Once people reach a certain age, or are beyond what is normally regarded as the age of total dependence, then obviously neither the State nor any institution can provide safeguards other than those which their own experience or the experience of others makes it possible for them to operate. There is considerable evidence that many children or 15 or 16 years of age, and even younger, emigrate to Britain annually.  Estimates have put the proportion of our young people who emigrate at that age and who become social and moral problems at a very high figure indeed.  I am sure there would be general agreement to operate some system of control even if that involved the issuing of permits or certificates of some sort to the effect that these young people in that particular age group have either their parents' or guardians' consent to go or are going to some suitable and safe home or hostel under the control of a reputable organisation or, in the case of a household, family or person, that that household, family or person has the approval of the parents or guardians.  There is, of course, the possibility that this system of control would be abused.  It is a fact that it would not be 100 per cent effective, but that is no reason why such a system should not be introduced.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of this matter is the making available as widely as possible of detailed information based on economic and social conditions in particular centres in Britain.  The information service of the Department does supply worthwhile information and facts about certain matters, but much more detailed information is required. Emphasis should be laid on the acute problem of accommodation in the large centres of population in Britain.  The shortage of accommodation has long caused concern to the voluntary organisations.  It has been the subject of comment, oral and written, over a lengthy period.  If advice were provided about the prospects of particular types of employment, the accommodation available or the difficulties in securing suitable accommodation, that would naturally be of great assistance to prospective emigrants.</P>
    <P>I think that one of the reasons why <Col N="1226" /> nothing on these lines was done in the past was that there was a recognition, or approval, of emigration.  Irrespective of how we may feel, as individuals, about emigration, emigration is a social and economic fact.  Emigration will continue.  It is, as I say, a social and economic fact and, as such, it should be faced.  We have an obligation to do as much as is humanly possible to help our emigrants.  It is not possible, of course, to provide for every contingency and for particular cases.  The kernel to the problem lies in the danger of young persons emigrating without their parents' or guardians' consent and without adequate information about conditions in particular centres in which they are at the mercy of social and economic conditions totally differend from those to which they have been accustomed and in an environment which is alien to their normal experience. There is, therefore, a vital necessity to supply facts about housing, employment and conditions generally.</P>
    <P>The manpower section which the Department of Labour is in process of organising is, of course, vitally interested in and concerned with this problem. Its success will depend not merely on the availability of employment but also on the adequate training, or retraining, of Irish emigrants who are anxious to return home if suitable vacancies occur.  It was with considerable interest that I read the statement of the Minister for Labour at the time. Like many others, I am disappointed that so little has been done in the interval.  So far as one knows, no actual steps have been taken to date to implement that proposal.  If the Irish Embassy in London and the various offices I suggest compiled information then it should be possible for the manpower section of the Department of Labour to have available for Irish emigrants in Britain details of vacancies here and information about prospects to facilitate not merely their return but also their retraining where that might be either advisable or necessary.</P>
    <P>This is a Supplementary Estimate and one is therefore confined to some extent in regard to matters relating to general policy.  One of the criticisms <Col N="1227" /> made about the foreign service generally is the fact that information on trading conditions is not sufficiently widely disseminated or given to organisations and firms here which are anxious to have that information.  Part of this problem is bound up with the activities of CTT and, indeed, is intimately concerned in many ways also with the work of Bord Fáilte.  In many ways it appears to me that, with the increase in the activities of Bord Fáilte, and the development of the services provided by CTT in respect of trade and commerce, and the extension of CTT into areas other than the dollar area to which they were originally confined, the services which the Department provided in a number of cases either no longer exist or are being covered by three separate bodies: in respect of tourism and all it connotes by Bord Fáilte; in respect of trade by CTT; and in respect generally of information as well as trade by the Department of External Affairs.</P>
    <P>The need to co-ordinate effectively the areas of operation of these different national agencies should be examined with a view to seeing where they impinge on each other, and to what extent the services overlap.  In a number of cases the offices abroad of Bord Fáilte and CTT and the staffs are in the same building.  Of course, the embassies and legations are separate. The need to make the maximum possible use of the resources which are available involves some system of coordination and co-operation.  It may be that some of the criticism which is expressed from time to time against one or other of these agencies, is because the persons using them and persons seeking information or assistance find that they have applied to one when in fact they should have sought the assistance of the other.</P>
    <P>When trade loomed as a major question after the war, during the period of the inter-Party Government, at one time we concentrated on advising our embassies to exert to the maximum extent the effects which the staff of the embassies could make in respect of trade and the development of trade, <Col N="1228" /> and in giving the advice and information which was sought by exporters and traders here as well as in channelling on to persons abroad information which they sought about trade prospects here.</P>
    <P>Since then CTT has developed and, although in a number of cases we have trade attachés or officials assigned to specific duty on trading matters&mdash;this applies particularly in certain embassies&mdash;there has been a substantial development of the facilities and services provided by CTT.  Here again it seems to me that the need is to co-ordinate the services and get the maximum benefit out of the limited, taken as a whole, number of staff and, at the same time, to use to the maximum advantage the fact that we now have a different type of set-up from that which we had ten or 15 years ago.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of the information services to which I want to refer this morning, is the question of making known our attitude on particular problems.  Over a long period we have raised the matter of assistance to people affected by the war in Nigeria and Biafra.  There is, no doubt, widespread national concern because of the large number of Irish missionaries, Irish teachers and Irish lay people who have given most valuable services in places like that, and in the area where there is continued fighting.  It is outside the province of this debate this morning to discuss this matter at any length, but I feel one of the matters that have caused concern to many people here is the apparent inability to do much to resolve this problem.  Of course this is a very complex question. As has been stated in the course of discussions here and elsewhere, there are many hands operating to stir up trouble and to continue to stir up trouble there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not proposing to discuss it but, at the same time, I feel the assistance that we can give in the way of providing relief should be made obvious in the sense that it should be clearly understood that any action we can take as a nation to provide <Col N="1229" /> that relief will be taken.  We should publicise through the information section of the Department what we have done in a political way or in any other way, as well as in respect of relief.  We should use the services which are there to make known our attitude and our concern and we should use our voice and vote, if necessary, to bring peace and some form of stable conditions to those troubled areas.</P>
      <P>I note that there has been a very substantial rise in the cost of travelling and incidental expenses, and also in respect of entertainment.  To what extent these increases are due to increased costs or to more travelling is not clear.  It is a matter of note that the total Estimate has risen very steeply in recent years.  It now represents a figure of over £1 million which is roughly double what it was, say, ten years ago.  That is a very substantial increase and one which means that we should utilise to the fullest extent the services which are provided.  There is an obligation on all to ensure that the services provided by the Department of External Affairs and our foreign services generally give the maximum assistance possible to Irish people who seek that assistance in any way or in any place abroad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion here last night on subhead B of this Supplementary Estimate for travelling and incidental expenses came around to the point that much of this additional travelling expenditure seems to be necessary because of the small number of embassies which we have abroad and their distribution.  If I might be permitted to make a few points in that connection, I should like to say that it has always been a cause of some wonder to me that in the whole continent of Africa we have but one embassy.  It is very difficult to see how the ambassador there and his staff can do an effective job in the whole of that continent.  To bring the matter more strictly within the subhead, I might say that it is easy to see how travelling expenses must, therefore, necessarily be so high.  Similarly, in the continent of South America we have but one embassy.  How the ambassador and his staff there can be expected to cover <Col N="1230" /> the whole of that continent, it is difficult to see.</P>

      <P>With regard to subhead D and the provision of an additional sum for the repatriation and maintenance of Irish citizens abroad, I am concerned as to what happens with regard to the repatriation of Irish citizens from any country where we have no representation.  I wonder if the Minister could tell us whether any arrangements can be made in that respect with any other country so that Irish citizens who get into difficulty in countries where we are not represented are looked after or sent home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under subhead G, I am very glad to see that the figure for entertainment has had to be greatly increased this year.  I feel that, up to now, the Department of External Affairs has perhaps not done enough in that respect to project the image of this country. I believe that the increase is due to a considerably greater number of foreign conferences, and so on, being held in this country.  This is most commendable. I am sure this House would not quibble at further spending by the Department under this heading or, indeed, under the heading of information services because, like many people, I feel we are rather parsimonious with <Col N="1231" /> what we give this Department for the purpose of projecting our image abroad.  There is very little that we need to be ashamed of and we should, through information services, entertainment, and so on, do very much more to take advantage of and to utilise the goodwill which exists for us in so many parts of the world.  This, I think, could be utilised by the Department, particularly with regard to trade.  There must be many parts of the world where we are not represented but where there is an immense fund of goodwill for us which we could tap for the benefit of our trade and balance of payments.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Cosgrave, I urge on the Minister that the maximum be obtained from such embassies as we have abroad for the purpose of increasing trade, particularly in countries where there is a strong Irish connection through people of Irish descent or where there is strong goodwill for this country.  Deputy James Tully was speaking here last night of what was done by the Meath football team when they went to Australia and of the amount of good they were able to achieve for industry and commerce generally in this country.  That pattern can be repeated in many other places. I feel that the Department has tended to confine itself abroad strictly to diplomatic matters.  It might have made use of its information and entertainment services to boost the trade of this country to a great extent.  It is no harm to remember that most countries do in fact use or almost abuse their foreign diplomatic services to a great extent to boost trade and to promote a favourable image of their countries.  I would urge on the Minister that every opportunity be availed of by his Department to do the same for this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Whilst there are many things that one would possibly be tempted to discuss in relation to the Department of External Affairs, we are confined on this Supplementary Estimate to the narrow scope of the subheads.  However, in recent years, at any rate, the affairs of this Department have received a pretty welcome airing in this House.  I think the Department <Col N="1232" /> is the better for the opening-up of its affairs on Estimates in this House and that the public, generally, is in a better position to judge just how this Department operates and exactly what its successes are.</P>
      <P>In general, I would say that, in recent years, at any rate, the criticism the Department has received in this House has been of the wrong kind because it has emphasised an area in which the Department is not culpable, namely, expenditure.  Whilst there has been an increase in expenditure in recent years &mdash;what Government Department has not had that experience?  &mdash;it should be said that the Department of External Affairs is run on a shoestring in relation to its responsibilities and to the task which the Dáil wishes it to carry out.</P>
      <P>I should just like, on a few of the points raised here, to mention some issues.  Of course, everyone can agree that more should be done for the emigrants in Britain.  It is very often mentioned in this House that there should be certain controls over young people and minors emigrating from this country to Britain.  I often wonder whether there is not as much danger in a young person at a tender age moving from certain parts of this country to other parts in search of work as in moving to Britain.  There is a tendency to see Britain as having a totally pagan environment in comparison with this country and our relative security.  I would say that such comparisons are unfair to the vast majority of English people who have as high standards, and perhaps in many cases higher standards, than we like to imagine we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this question of controls I cannot see how, if we have children going out to work at 14 and nobody raises any protest about it, one can become practically hysterical in regard to the lack of controls when they go to Britain.  If one is to be logical one must introduce more rigid controls in regard to a higher school-leaving age if we are to prevent minors moving into an environment to which they are unsuited. If we have, as we have. a free trade in children being employed within the country it seems illogical to think that <Col N="1233" /> suddenly we can bring in controls over the free movement of minors between here and Britain.  Of course, the whole pattern of emigration to Britain has become almost a way of life in this country.  As one who worked in England for a period I know the feeling of being totally lost in an environment one does not understand, a feeling that in all senses one is a refugee, somebody who has lost his own country.</P>
    <P>The official attitude to the Irish in Britain, of course, has been extremely ambiguous because we have had Ministers going to Britain for St. Patrick's Day and telling the Irish &ldquo;to get lost&rdquo;, to become absorbed in Britain and to forget their nationality, and therefore it is unfair to criticise the Department for not being as vigorous or as enterprising in this area as we would like them to be.  We make speeches about the tragedy of the Irish being in Britain but, in effect, we are saying to them &ldquo;Stay there, we cannot bring you home; we cannot afford to&rdquo;. The Irish in Britain in times past played a tremendously important part in the political development of the country and a very crucial part in our movements at home.  I hope they will do so again in the future.  I am not one to say to them &ldquo;get lost, become absorbed in Britain and become British citizens&rdquo;.  This country must hold out the hope, the only hope for which many of them live, that some day they may get employment at home.  That is an obligation the country has as much to the Irish people in Britain as to the young people growing up here.  It will be another day's work to know whether the present policy will be sufficient to do this.  The most concrete expression of our interest in the people of Britain would be to build up our economy and to give them a chance of obtaining employment here. There must be over one million Irish-born people in England at present and the majority have no wish to become absorbed in their surrounding community. Their sole wish is to return home.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, a task that we are not fulfilling at the moment.  We are not doing as much as we should in <Col N="1234" /> regard to employing our skilled tradesmen in Britain&mdash;skills they have acquired over there&mdash;to obtain jobs at home.  One may cynically observe that there are not that many jobs going at home but there are certain key jobs going which non-nationals have filled in recent years and which could have been filled by Irish nationals if they had been informed about them.  Recently on television we heard a young man, who admittedly had emigrated further than Britain, complaining that it was not possible to apply for a job at home because of delays in receiving newspapers and so on and the job would have been filled before the application was received.  Employers should be asked if they are considering their obligations to Irish men and women abroad who have the appropriate skills and who would be able to fill the specialist jobs they advertise.</P>
    <P>I do not have any pat answer to this problem but certainly in regard to the Irish in Britain who have acquired skills there it appears to me that those skills could be applied at home if we had a proper system of job advertising or job notification.  At the moment these people are unaware of specialised opportunities that may occur and we have the unfortunate result that perhaps a German, a Swiss, or a Frenchman may be filling a position which an Irish national could fill.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of information services more should be done by the Department in regard to official information being available about the foreign policies of this country.  There is one school of thought which says that we cannot afford to have a foreign policy because we are too small.  We may be a small country but we are a motherland of importance, one of the motherlands in the world with a large and well-scattered population all over the world which has shared a common ancestry.  Therefore we have an obligation, and a certain importance which perhaps is disproportionate to our size. While the pamphlets which we publish about the United Nations are informative and give us information about certain international issues, we must do more to inform people about our attitudes. Did we do sufficient to explain <Col N="1235" /> our attitude and our complete disapproval of the brutal interference in the affairs of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Union?  Was any pamphlet or official bulletin published which was devoted to our condemnation and disapproval of that affair?  I know that the Department of External Affairs do publish what is perhaps a collector's item, a bulletin which is mainly literary.  I do not get this bulletin and I do not know who is on the mailing list or for whom it is designed.  The copies I have seen have been quite interesting possibly because they concentrated exclusively on literary aspects, but it appears to me that that bulletin is explaining ourselves to ourselves.  How exactly do we explain ourselves to others?  How do we explain our foreign policies to others?  Other European countries with larger budgets than we have publish a wide range of topical pamphlets and bulletins explaining their policies and attitudes.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that our policy on the Nigerian conflict could be subject to misrepresentation because we have not published in any brochure or bulletin a consistent line explaining our predicament in the matter of Nigeria and possibly the outside world has, with some justification, come to the conclusion that on this issue we have maintained a shameful silence.  We have not done sufficient to explain why, in the mind of the Government of the day, they feel that shameful silence is the only course open to us.  Have we explained sufficiently the tragic dilemma which the Government felt existed in the Nigerian conflict?  As far as I can understand, we have made very few comments; we took no worthwhile initiative at the United Nations or with any of the powers supplying arms and certainly, overall, we did nothing to explain our attitude in any bulletin that I have seen issued by the Department.</P>
    <P>We may say that nobody is interested in what we think on this conflict but I do not agree with this.  If we have a foreign service we must constantly explain our approach on issues as they come up.  We should also explain&mdash;this may be difficult&mdash;the rather tortuous <Col N="1236" /> course of silence we have adopted on the Vietnam conflict.  These are all matters which should be mentioned in bulletins.  It is not sufficient to think we have done our job in this area by printing once a year a Civil Service-like, monotonously-produced pamphlet of the speeches at the United Nations. We should not think that it is sufficient to produce an external affairs bulletin each week.</P>
    <P>One might ask if we have the money to expand the service in this area in which it should be expanded.  There is a real need to be filled because foreign affairs and their proper conduct mean business also in many ways and more business orders for this country.  I suggest it might be considered.  We should seriously consider a scaling-down of the size of our embassies abroad.  Do we fully utilise the massive embassy building we have in London?  There are other large monuments of embassies scattered on the Continent.  There is also the question of the distribution of embassies, but I am referring now to the matter of size.  Are these buildings appropriate to what we are trying to do today as a small country with an active foreign affairs policy?  How often do we fully utilise the plant capacity &mdash;to call it that&mdash;of the London Embassy? Are its rooms called into service once a year for two or three parties, perhaps?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that more money should be available for the information services.  I do not know why we need the large building we have for our Paris Embassy.  It is in a centre of high prestige and we would probably get a very good price for it. This House would not chase the Minister to get the full price for it.  I think we should be explaining ourselves better, possibly, to the French public if we had more journals available in France outlining our policies and our approach to European questions rather than having a big, mouldering building on our hands which is not used and which probably costs a good deal to maintain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1237" /> I am not critical of the Department's general handling of its expenses. It is a Department which, in general, is run on a shoestring but I suggest that it may be attempting to live up to a rather faded image of what diplomacy should be about which I do not think relevant to our situation. Neither do I think that we need today, with the now remote prospect of EEC entry, two embassies in Brussels.  One building would do the job.  Without going into the matter in detail, I suggest that we should take a fresh look at the size of our embassy buildings and decide whether we need them as they are with their high maintenance costs and whether smaller buildings would not serve our purpose and allow us more scope for more ambitious projects in publications, in journals and in staff.</P>
    <P>Official entertainment has provided a rich stalking-ground, unfortunately, for those criticising Estimates.  Of course, a certain amount of entertainment is necessary for this Department. I do not know if we can get any information on this point or not, but I am curious about the basis on which people are selected to be invited to official functions in Dublin by the Department and whether there is any rule of thumb about their selection. Who turns up at these functions?  How is a decision reached that certain professional people, industrialists or others, shall be invited to functions at Iveagh House?  Is this a diplomatic secret, a matter of protocol not to be shared with the Irish people?  It may be an open question as to whether it is necessary so to share it.  I have been curious about it because it appeared to me from the one or two functions that I have attended that there is a regular turn-out: the same faces appear at each function.  I suggest in the case of official entertainment that if we have important guests we should try to get a cross-section representative of the Irish people rather than trot out the same people time after time.  This would give such official guests a better idea of the kind of country they are visiting than if they are meeting only fellow-travellers of the Government in power on each occasion and perhaps getting a totally wrong idea of the state of affairs here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1238" /> At official entertainments in other countries it is the practice that a visiting guest is given the opportunity of meeting people in Opposition politics. This is something that could be considered. Visitors may get a very wrong impression if they think there is only one Party and one political philosophy in the country.  They may not fully understand the forces at work in the country.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the idea of providing further information for the Irish people working abroad.  The economy, unfortunately, is not such that one can promise all of them employment at home at present but certainly there are key jobs available and if we had some way of informing those abroad that such jobs were available we might see more skilled people in Britain returning home.  As distinct from Deputy Cosgrave I would change the emphasis and say: it is our duty to keep the Irish in Britain fully informed about any possibilities or opportunities of returning home rather than that it is our primary duty to let them know about conditions in the British economy, should they go there in the future.  Admittedly, emigration has been with us for a long time but the task before us as a country is sufficiently large for us to realise that unless it can be tackled this country will go the way of all flesh.  That does not mean that we can ever rule out a certain amount of voluntary emigration but our problem is that too many of our people are forced to go abroad. Possibly more could be done by maintaining better contact with the Irish people in Britain.  I know that the London Embassy has done quite an amount of work in attempting to keep in touch with the Irish people scattered throughout Britain.  The majority of the Irish people working in Britain are doing jobs that people of no other race would do.  They are doing jobs which, in fact, the native English would refuse to do.  They are in transport, catering and badly paid jobs.  These people spend their lifetime wondering whether an opportunity will ever come for them to return home.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the Department.  I cannot say that it is the fault of the <Col N="1239" /> Department that Irish people in Britain are not informed of job opportunities at home because we have had cases of Ministers of this country who, on our national feast day, went to Britain and told the Irish there to forget their Irish background and to become British citizens as soon as possible.  With such an ambiguity in official attitudes it would be difficult for the Department to know what its role should be regarding the Irish in Britain.  It is about time we made our minds up on an overall attitude towards these people and let them know whether or not we still regard them as fellow Irish men and women.  They should be able to look forward to a time when our economy will be such as to give them an opportunity of returning home.</P>
    <P>Official entertainment may be one way of explaining this country abroad. Perhaps it lets people see that we are civilised, normal and quite pleasant.  It seems to me that one of the assets which the Department has been selling in recent years with a relative degree of success in certain areas is our cultural heritage which is Anglo-Irish.  However, Gaelic, mainly Anglo-Irish.  However, perhaps the Irish embassies abroad are not doing their best to explain, when the British embassies, for instance, describe Yeats as a British poet, that in fact he is Irish.  When the great figures of Anglo-Irish literature are claimed by British embassies as part of the English cultural heritage, I think it is up to our embassies to explain the matter more accurately.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Department might consider the idea of sponsoring one or two notable Irish artists abroad.  This would do a great deal for this country in important circles.  Too little of this has taken place in recent years because of the risks and costs involved.  The Department have a duty to the visual arts to show that there are artists in this country who are of quite a high standing and who have something distinctive and national to say, something of which the country has no need to be ashamed.  Perhaps if the Department had one entertainment less and devoted the cash so saved to sponsoring such one-man exhibitions abroad, it would <Col N="1240" /> be doing a great deal of good.  There is a lot of prestige to be gained by emphasising that Ireland has an old traditional culture.  In other words, the sponsoring of such works of art by Irish citizens would create an overflow of goodwill in other areas which at first one might think were far removed from this domain.</P>
    <P>More could be done as regards this matter of bulletins explaining ourselves to people abroad.  We could have more of these journals.  At the moment there is a great lack of them, at least by comparison with many other European countries.  I do not know in how many languages we publish bulletins explaining our foreign policies, whether they are in French, German or Spanish or whether we rely overmuch on explaining ourselves in publications in the English language.  At any rate, it is obvious that we could be running a very satisfactory information service on the publication side while we are restricted to the few things we have. The foreign policy of this country will be subject to constant misrepresentation unless we fulfil this need of having sufficient publications to explain it. Under this subhead one cannot enter into any full scale discussion of our foreign policy.  It is not possible under this Estimate to discuss our policy on Biafra, Nigeria or Vietnam, of which I am very critical.  I disagree with our policies in those areas and in one area in which we have Russian and British imperialism at work&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not intend having a discussion on it.  Even if one could accept all the points of our foreign policy, the fact is that it would be insufficiently explained as things are at present.  The number of official journals are not adequate, their scope is not adequate and possibly staff is not adequate to do a good job in this area.  Therefore, I would suggest a reorganisation of resources, even within the budget, from some of the areas I have mentioned.  If the Department did this, they would be doing a good job both for themselves and for the country.  I regard the Department of <Col N="1241" /> External Affairs as one of the most important Government Departments, but perhaps I am in the minority in holding this view.  It is a Department which is a key factor in explaining this country abroad and explaining its policies.  By so explaining its policies it ensures for us possibilities of market expansion for our products so as to ensure that our economy will survive and prosper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to delay the House very long but I think I should avail of the opportunity presented by this Supplementary Estimate to say a few words on the topics which arise on it in which I am particularly interested and which in recent months I have raised at Question Time. I suppose it is true to say there is no subject which arouses such controversy or such argument as the question of emigrant welfare.  Every Deputy who spoke on this Supplementary Estimate last night and this morning referred to this question.  Under subhead D&mdash; Repatriation and Maintenance of Destitute Irish Persons Abroad&mdash;there is an additional sum of £3,000 being sought by the Minister.  Having studied this problem pretty closely in Great Britain through frequent contacts with Irish organisations there, it is my opinion that the term &ldquo;emigrant problem&rdquo; is very often grossly exaggerated.</P>
      <P>There is quite a lot of controversy in regard to what the Government should do to help Irish emigrants abroad.  The Minister, in reply to questions here recently which I had tabled, referred to the fact that it was difficult to find money to help emigrants abroad because the Government were utilising all the money they could get to provide employment at home and thus prevent further emigration.  I believe, despite what some people might say, that there is an emigrant problem in Great Britain and, without in any way bankrupting the Government here or knocking the Budget completely out of hand, a small amount of money wisely allocated in Britain would go a very big way to help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To put the thing in its proper perspective I have here a report of the Irish Centre in London for the year ended 31st December, 1968.  Despite what we may hear to the effect that <Col N="1242" /> the annual emigration rate is reducing, this report shows an increase of 432 in the number of persons who looked for help from the Irish Centre in London.  This report is a very valuable document because it crystallises and produces interesting figures and facts in relation to what we have come to know as the emigrant problem.  The report states that the centre's welfare officer found that new emigrants came totally ill-equipped for the task of finding employment.  Rather surprisingly, it noted that the number of girls under 18 years of age arriving at their centre had decreased in 1968 but, rather alarming and disquieting, it noticed an increase in the number of arrivals over 45 years of age who looked for help in the welfare office and that more than half of those are married.  It has to be assumed, therefore, that their emigration disrupted family life for their dependants as well as for themselves.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have advocated an increased subvention to welfare organisations catering for Irish people and have suggested that there is a number of important centres in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and so on.  In recent years I have been in Manchester, Sheffield, Birmingham, London, Portsmouth&mdash;in about ten different centres of Irish population&mdash; and my conviction is that there are only two centres which present problems. They are two centres which are in urgent need of generous assistance from the Government.</P>
    <P>This £3,000 in the Supplementary Estimate will not provide the type of assistance which emigrant welfare organisations in Great Britain today are seeking.  The Irish Centre in London was established through voluntary effort and is doing a tremendous amount of work.  In London, a large centre of population where there is a definite emigrant problem occasioned by the housing shortage and all the other social and psychological problems which a young Irish emigrant has to contend with, the Irish Centre is doing a magnificant job but it is a disgraceful state of affairs that our Government would not give some subvention annually to help the Irish Centre. We have all heard on radio and seen <Col N="1243" /> on television features about the Irish Centre and the work of Father Dore and Father Eamon Casey.</P>
    <P>In recent years I have been in the Irish Centre in Birmingham several times.  This is run by the Oblate Fathers and, like the centre in London, is doing a tremendous job.  The work being done in London and Birmingham is, as I have said, on a voluntary basis. I was horrified on a recent visit to Birmingham, where I spoke to Father Murphy, who is in charge of the centre there, to find when looking through his budget and accounts that a considerable portion of his time is taken up fund-raising and that instead of being able to devote his full time, skill and ability to the work of emigrant welfare this unfortunate man is grossly overworked and after his day's work in the office, interviewing people, trying to help them find employment, housing accommodation and so forth, has to go off at night to various functions, such as dances and to organise raffles to finance the work of the centre.</P>
    <P>There is an unanswerable case for an annual subvention by the Government to the Irish Centres at London and Birmingham.  The Minister has often stated that if we give money to one centre&mdash;I think Deputy Tully referred to this last night&mdash;there would be an avalanche of applications from other areas.  I do not believe this is true. From my observation over the last five or six years the problem is really acute only in the two largest centres of population, London and Birmingham.</P>
    <P>I was ashamed and appalled, as a public representative, at the manner in which the work of the Irish Centre is being hampered through lack of funds. I asked Father Murphy recently and his predecessor Father Byrne on another occasion what they were looking for and what way could the Irish Government help them.  They both said that they had the framework and the qualified persons, both nuns and lay people and all they wanted was money.</P>
    <P>When I was leaving Father Murphy in Birmingham a few weeks ago he said that if they could only get a grant of £4,000 or £5,000 per annum their work in the Irish Centre in Birmingham <Col N="1244" /> would be very, very easy and that he could organise a proper, efficient social service in that centre.</P>
    <P>From my experience of visiting Irish centres and discussing this question with clergy, religious and others, there is a feeling of bitterness among the Irish people in Great Britain, particularly among the people who are doing such tremendous work to help Irish emigrants.  They feel bitter against the Government or the official attitude down through the years with regard to this problem.  It is an appalling state of affairs that an annual subvention of £4,000 or £5,000 could not be made to the Irish Centre at Birmingham.  The requirements of the Irish Centre at London would probably be greater.  I would reckon that £10,000 per annum would be needed for London and £5,000 per annum for Birmingham. This sum is small when we take into account the annual expenditure paid by the Department of External Affairs to the various personnel in posh embassies, who spend their time going from one party to another while there are unfortunate people being helped through voluntary work, raffles, whist drives and dances.  I deplore this situation and sincerely hope that before long this, or some other Government, will face up to the situation, and will realise that it is a relatively simple matter and that we can help those centres in a very practical way by voting them a few thousand pounds per annum.</P>
    <P>The Leader of my Party, Deputy Cosgrave, mentioned the centres at Liverpool and Manchester.  The situation there is not so acute.  There is a tremendous example in Liverpool of an Irish Centre having been established through local initiative and voluntary effort.  The Irish Centre in Liverpool is a tremendous example of what the Irish people have achieved in Great Britain.  There is a beautiful building there for the Irish Centre, providing a social centre for the Irish exiles in Liverpool.  It is also a shop-window for Irish goods.  It is, in fact, promoting tourism to this country and doing valuable work.</P>
    <P>The Irish Centre in London owes nothing to the Government.  It was <Col N="1245" /> built by the local initiative of Irish people there.  The same applies to Manchester.  There is a very fine Irish Centre there which is being run on first-class lines by Irish people who have a sense of responsibility, and who have done a good job.  I do not want to labour this question but I feel very strongly about it.  I see no reason whatsoever why money could not be made available to help, particularly, the Irish Centres in London and Birmingham.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister for Labour, Dr. Hillery, speaking at a Fianna Fáil meeting in Clare, indicated that his Department was examining how it might help in the matter of operating some type of employment agency for Irish emigrants.  In other words, his Department is setting up some type of information service which would keep Irish people abroad informed of job opportunities at home.  This has been referred to by other speakers.  This is a very necessary service.  I have found, as I am sure other Deputies have found, that frequently one receives letters from constituents who have had to emigrate inquiring about the possibility of obtaining employment in Ireland.  There is no doubt that there are many hundreds of Irish people who have emigrated and who have acquired qualifications and skills of various kinds abroad which could be utilised effectively in Irish industry here.</P>
    <P>The only other point I want to make &mdash;and I think it was referred to by Deputy Cosgrave&mdash;was that in view of the continued increasing expansion of the work of Córas Tráchtála, the IDA, and Bord Fáilte, perhaps the whole structure of Irish representation abroad may have to be reviewed.  In so far as our embassies abroad are concerned, and particularly in relation to trade, the fact that we have an unfavourable balance of trade with every country where we have a representative is a sad reflection on the work of those embassies in the matter of promoting trade.  There will have to be much greater co-operation and co-ordination between the work of trade attachés in the embassies and the work of the representatives of Córas Tráchtála, the IDA and Bord Fáilte.</P>

      <P>Deputy T. O'Donnell put forward a proposition that a mere £5,000 would be sufficient to take care of all the problems of Irish emigrants living in Birmingham and a mere £10,000 would do the same for the Irish emigrants in London.  If that is his estimate of the size of the problem, why does he not think of applying the same sort of principles as have been applied to many other fund-raising programmes in this country in recent years?  Within a few weeks or months there was more than 100 times £5,000 gathered for a charitable purpose.  In other collections for &ldquo;charitable purposes abroad,&rdquo; without any connection with Ireland, the sums gathered were 20 or 30 times as much as the sums he has mentioned in relation to these two centres.  I have said to many people in all Parties of all shades of political view that the only way that I can see in which the problems of the Irish emigrants in England can be helped to a solution is through voluntary funds.  Once the Government come in to give a fixed sum to an individual or to a group they have to give equivalent sums to people or groups who can prove equivalence in their requirements.  It is absolutely foolish to think that if small sums such as the Deputy has mentioned were to be given to one or two centres in England, indeed to one centre in one enormous city, we would hear no more about the problem or that it would do satisfactory work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>London consists of more than Camden Town.  The Camden Irish Centre at present has accommodation for a number of Irish men and women. Their proposition was that they should be granted £100,000 in order to build accommodation comprising 25 or 30 rooms.  There are many other Irish centres in London in which Irish emigrants live.  What would even another 20 or 30 rooms do for the problem of accommodation in Camden Town alone?  In Camden Town there are something over 9,000 homeless families of all sorts.  In another area of the City of London that I have read about there are something like 90,000 families living in 30,000 of what they <Col N="1247" /> call &ldquo;abodes&rdquo;&mdash;three to a flat or three to a house.</P>
    <P>That is the great problem that faces the Irish in Britain and faces the English people also.  The British Government in recent years have put enormous resources into creating decent housing conditions for their people but the problem is so overwhelming in large centres that they just have not got on top of it.  It leaves Irish people who go over there or English people who grew up in England and who are living in London with this great handicap in finding any sort of reasonably decent accommodation.  There is this problem of gross overcrowding with four or five people to a room and allowed to be in that room only until 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock in the morning and not able to come back until 10 o'clock at night.  That is the situation which young Irish people face if they go to those centres and the addition of accommodation for 100 of them to the Irish Centre would not cure it.</P>
    <P>However, what the organisations and societies who have got together voluntarily in the Irish Centres in London, Birmingham, Liverpool and other cities have done is magnificent.  They have been able to encourage Irish people who are inclined to go a little bit astray or who cannot help themselves. They have been able to give good advice or, if people could not take care of themselves, to get them sent home. We have in recent years tried to organise such Irish groups all over England and Scotland.  We have a special officer whose duty it is to organise such groups.  In the last three years or so I have persuaded the Minister for Finance and the Government to allow us to bring back at State expense youngsters, young girls or older people who are incapacitated and are not able to take care of themselves.  The number has not grown very greatly.  In the first year the number was about 37.  This year, so far, it is less than 100.  This does ease a burden which was very heavy on these voluntary organisations of helping people in need to get over the most acute part of their problem.</P>
    <P>We must remember that the individual in England has greater benefits from the State during periods of unemployment <Col N="1248" /> or illness than people have here.  We are always hearing this thrown at us by members of the Opposition Parties when they are lauding the social services in Britain and denigrating the social services we have here, but when it comes to a situation of this kind they do not mind advocating that money the Government might make available should be spent on adding to the social services available in Britain to a certain section of the people and not spent on the improvement of social services here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully made a suggestion yesterday which I would like to see followed up.  It was that we should get a group of all Parties to discuss this situation.  We all have the same emotional approach to any human being in need wherever he may be or whatever his class, race or creed.  We all have the same emotion and would like to help but we want to help our people in Britain in a way that will not discourage them from getting out and helping themselves.  We do not want to turn them into mendicants, hanging around centres where they will get additional funds to those they have got from the British Social Services Bureaux.</P>
    <P>If the Irish people in Britain who have very generously supported the centres set up in the various cities there had a few trustees in Britain who could receive the collections organised by all sections of the Irish people in Ireland or in Britain, these trustees would be able to take a decision to help reasonably when propositions were put to them.  Voluntary trustees would have the power to say, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;, and would not be under any legal compulsion to give equal sums to everybody who approached them and could prove an equivalence of need on paper.  The only way we can do a good job is by helping the Irish in Britain to look after themselves.  We cannot afford to keep Irish people abroad from the cradle to the grave.  If we were to try to cure the housing conditions in, say, Camden Town alone&mdash;without speaking of any other part of London or any other part of Britain&mdash;in order that every Irish person who goes there would get reasonable accommodation, it would take <Col N="1249" /> many times the amount of money that we can afford to spend to give reasonable housing conditions to our people and keep them at home.  It is much cheaper for the Irish taxpayer to keep these people at home than abroad.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to say to an Irish-man or Irishwoman who goes abroad, whether it is to England, the United States or Canada and who finds that he or she cannot get along: &ldquo;Come home and we will share what we have with you.&rdquo;  It would be foolish for this Parliament to set out on a programme indicating that Irish people who go abroad and who cannot make a go of it there ought to have right to call upon the Irish people to maintain them in the country where they cannot succeed. We know that by far the greatest part of this problem of Irish emigrants is related to emigration to Britain.  But Britain is not the sole country in which Irish people find they cannot make do. Anyone who knows the great cities of America or Canada or elsewhere knows he can come across worse cases in some of these cities than can be found in Camden Town or any of the other slum areas in Britain.</P>
    <P>As I say, I have given a great deal of consideration to this problem over the years.  When we came back into office 10 or 14 years ago, whatever length of time it was, there were people emigrating at the rate of 100,000 a year and there were no services by the State to help them in any direction.  One of the first things I did was to try to get someone to organise the Irish people in the various cities to form groups to give information about housing, accommodation and jobs to those who approached them.  At the time the housing conditions in Britain were very much worse than they are today.  They were simply appalling in places like Birmingham.</P>
    <P>A number of these groups have done very well in coping with the great number of demands made on them, and certain of them have succeeded in making a great deal of money from their other activities.  If you take Liverpool alone, it is only a few years ago that the local Irish groups there, who are very hardworking and have always been interested in Ireland and in the <Col N="1250" /> Irish people, bought a very fine old establishment and refurbished it at a cost of something like £30,000.  They have succeeded in the last few years not only in providing information and assistance to Irish emigrants looking for it but also in paying off £10,000 of the £30,000 overdraft they got.</P>
    <P>More recently we have established this other system of taking home at State expense the young or the old or the middle aged who need protection and should be at home.  We are insisting on arrangements being made for their care here.  That is the best line of approach, and if further help is needed it should be given on a voluntary basis from the Irish people, as voluntary subscriptions are given for the relief of distress in other countries.  There should be very little difficulty in getting agreement between representatives of the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party on the appointment of trustees in Britain who would be given the right to disburse whatever voluntary funds were given to them in Ireland or elsewhere in order to improve the lot of our emigrants over there.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about that problem so often that I do not think I need enlarge upon it on an occasion of this kind when we are merely debating a Supplementary Estimate.  However, I should like to say just one word about Deputy Cosgrave's suggestion that we should establish a control of young people leaving here.  During the war we were able to establish a control on travel from here to Britain but that was because Britain wanted to have control on her side.  The control was really by Britain and not by us.  The people who wanted to go to Britain had to have some sort of travel permit issued here which they presented in Britain and, if they went there without being furnished with this document, they were liable to be run into jail. The situation is quite different today. Indeed, I remember at that time the Labour Party being very loud in its denunciation of the restriction placed on Irish people.  The Labour Party claimed Irish people had a right to go wherever they liked and whenever they liked.  Such a control now would be quite ineffective unless the British thought it in their own interests to <Col N="1251" /> exercise a similar control on their side. As well as that, the young people today of 14, 15, 16 and 17 years of age would be no less capable, I believe, of finding a hole in the hedge or a way across the wall than the young people were 50 or 60 years ago.</P>
    <P>Remember, too, we have a border, unfortunately, between ourselves and the North of Ireland, a border which extends for 270 miles.  Even if the British established a control on their side, it would be both difficult and expensive to control the entire border and I believe they would not even attempt to do it.  Without the co-operation of the British, control is impossible. We could not make it effective on our own.  Of course, one of the best controls would be if those who talk so much about Irish emigrants to Britain would, instead of emphasising the size of the pay packets, describe the conditions under which the emigrants may find themselves compelled to live and the percentage of their pay packets they may have to pay in order to get accommodation, accommodation which has sometimes been described by Irish novelists, and particularly Irish writers from Donegal, as dosshouses.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should visit Camden Town or some of the other overcrowded areas in Britain and see the conditions for himself.  He will find conditions there today as bad as they were in the time of Patrick MacGill. Just before the Deputy came in I had told the House that in Camden Town alone there are 9,000 homeless families. In another area in London there are 90,000 families living in 30,000 abodes, such as small flats or houses.  That is the situation our people face when they go to Britain.  They have to pay very dearly indeed merely to get a shelter for the night or for a week.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully also complained that we were not giving sufficient help to Irish exports.  He asked why we did not do something about exports to Australia.  I have here a Press release from one of our very successful exporters.  Exports to Australia are not very great, but they have improved enormously in the past few years.</P>

      <P>In 1965, they were £194,000 odd and, in 1968, they were £1,554,000 odd.  That is quite a considerable increase.  One Irish exporter who had, in that period, increased his exports very considerably had this to say to the Press&mdash;it was in connection with Irish Ropes and was issued to the Press on 18th April, 1966:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1258" /> In particular Mr. Denver would like to mention the invaluable assistance available to Irish exporters to Australia through the Department of External Affairs, the Irish Ambassador in Canberra and his staff.  Much of the Tintawn success story is due to this valuable co-operation and, indeed, it must also have contributed to the recent considerable increase in other Irish exports to Australia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>On our files we have tributes as generous as the one I have quoted to the work that is being done by Irish ambassadors in many parts of the world, but that does not keep Deputy Tully and others from denigrating the work they are trying to do. Several other questions were raised but I do not think they are quite <i>ad rem</i> to this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary suggested that we should cut down official entertainment and spend the money in propaganda about our attitude to all the problems in all parts of the world.  It is true that the official entertainment vote has gone up very considerably over the past number of years.  The functions of the entertainment fund have greatly changed in the past ten or 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1259" /> The title on the Vote for the Department of External Affairs should not be &ldquo;Official Entertainment&rdquo; but &ldquo;State Hospitality.&rdquo;  We are very glad to see various international organisations using Ireland as a venue for their conferences&mdash;annual conferences, and so on.  All Departments of State and a great number of semi-State and voluntary organisations always have their eyes open when they go to conferences abroad and try to persuade the organisers of these international conferences to use Dublin or Ireland as a venue&mdash; and they have been very successful. Indeed, in the past few years, the number of international conferences held in Ireland moved from 18 to 81 and these are very big groups; some of them can go as high as 800 or 900 or 1,000 or 1,100 or 1,300 or 1,400 in odd cases.  The expense of this entertainment has been borne by the Department of External Affairs for a number of years although the basic function of the subhead has greatly changed.</P>
    <P>I have suggested to the Minister for Finance that the expense of State hospitality would more appropriately be borne on the Vote for the Department of Finance than on the Vote for the Department of External Affairs because 90 per cent of it is spent on other Departments in having functions for these various organisations or important foreign visitors who come here.</P>

The Cultural Relations Committee have a fund and one of their activities is to help in the display abroad of the work of Irish painters and sculptors.  They also help Irish lecturers to give lectures abroad on cultural subjects.  From time to time, they have helped drama societies to go abroad and to perform in other countries.  There is a limited amount of money for that purpose.  The Cultural Relations Committee do their best not only to publish books or to assist in the publication of books of cultural value but also to help Irish artists to carry live displays of Irish culture to the stages of other countries.</P>

      <P>Is ar fhorbairt na tionsclaíochta sa Ghaeltacht is mó a chaithfear an t-airgead atá i gceist.  Faoi mar is eol do na Teachtaí, téann Gaeltarra i gcomhar le tionsclaithe eile, a bhfuil eolas teicniúil agus teacht ar mhargaí acu, d'fhonn tionscail a bhunú agus, chomh maith leis sin, tagann siad i gcabhair ar thionscail bheaga gan páirt a ghlacadh iontu.

      <P>I welcome this Vote because any Vote that gives more money to Gaeltarra Éireann to spend in the Gaeltacht is always welcomed by any Deputy who represents the Gaeltacht. I am beginning to think that the Gaeltacht is becoming overloaded with officials.  There is a factory in Kilcar and I do not know who is in charge of it.  A number of young people who enter the Civil Service through examinations are then passed on to the factories throughout the Gaeltacht.  I do not think they are improving the image of the factories.  It would be much better to procure some person with technical know-how to put in charge, particularly in a factory such as that at Kilcar.  Only last week I asked the Minister about this and informed him that some official had requested a number of the employees to take a week's compulsory holidays but when it became known in the district that I was going to raise the matter here another official came along and put them on overtime and they worked 24 hours of the day.  That is bad for the image of Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that there are now some factories in the Gweedore Gaeltacht but unfortunately they employ mostly female labour and we have only a limited supply of female labour there.  These factories are now trying to recruit from the small labour pool in the locality persons who already <Col N="1264" /> have permanent employment in existing factories.  I would be glad if the Minister would request Gaeltarra Éireann to try to establish an industry that would employ male labour, as distinct from female labour.  I wonder if we are over-concentrating on the type of garment being produced in the Gaeltacht factories and are we giving the purchaser of the finished garments value for money.  I am only afraid that our good name has been taken from us by foreign articles foisted on the market in the name of Gaeltarra Éireann and in the name of Irish Cottage Industries.  Some effort should be made to secure the trademark of Irish garments and not have them competing with inferior foreign articles on the world market.  Very often we pick up imported goods and find printed on them in the Irish language &ldquo;Déanta sa tSeapain&rdquo;.  I do not know what advantage this is either to Irish industry or to the Irish language.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate deals merely with Gaeltarra Éireann and has nothing to do with the Gaeltacht except in so far as Gaeltarra Éireann gives employment in the Gaeltacht.  I should like to see only Irish speakers being employed by Gaeltarra Éireann in Irish-speaking areas where these factories are located.  At the moment we have made a start in my own part of the country with the seaweed factory at Meenmore in the Rosses.  The factory is too small; it is working for 24 hours of the day and only six men are employed in it.  I am referring now to indoor employment and not to outdoor employment.  I would like to see the factory extended and many more being employed in it.  In private I have mentioned to the Minister the very depressed areas, Fintown, Glenfinn and Edinfagh in County Donegal. Surely something can be done by Gaeltarra Éireann for these depressed areas which have no industry of any description?  I have asked the Minister to see if perhaps Bord na Móna, at his behest, might move in and do something there.  Alternatively, the Forestry Section of his own Department may be able to assist the Irish speakers in that locality.</P>
    <P>I am merely speaking for the Donegal Gaeltacht and I know nothing <Col N="1265" /> about the Gaeltacht areas in the west or south, or very little, although I did know something about them at one time.  In Donegal there is a very good factory at Crolly which manufactured the now famous Crolly dolls.  I understand that these dolls are no longer manufactured there, that the finishing touches are merely put to the dolls at Crolly and that some factory in the west does the main work of assembling the dolls.  It would be much better if the whole product could be completed in one factory and it would save a considerable amount of transport.  I did appeal to the Minister, and I must say I received a patient hearing from him, about a small project at Meena Cross, Dungloe.  We had a small factory set up there by local initiative in which seven girls are employed and I explained to the Minister why that factory must now close down.  If the Minister used his good offices with Gaeltarra Éireann it might be possible for Gaeltarra Éireann to take it over and endeavour to retain the seven ladies in permanent employment. Voluntary subscriptions initiated the project and I hope the factory will not now shut down through lack of capital.  I do not think any of the subscribers to the original capital&mdash;of whom I am one&mdash;are over-worried about repayment.  Certainly I would not like to see these girls thrown out of employment.  Gaeltarra Éireann with the extra £80,000 which we are voting them might be able to do something to retain these ladies in employment.</P>
    <P>We always welcome moneys for expenditure in the Gaeltacht.  Sometimes we are inclined to criticise Gaeltarra Éireann, rightly or wrongly.  I think Gaeltarra Éireann renders a social service to the people of the Gaeltacht and if at times they lose money, so long as they do not lose it in competition with private enterprise, they should not be over-criticised.</P>

      <P>Níl ach cúpla focal le rá agam ar an Meastachán Forlíontach seo.  I have listened to Deputy O'Donnell telling of his problems in Donegal.  We also have problems in the west.  Under this Vote I think we are more or less tied down to discussing Gaeltarra Éireann.  There is mention of 700 new jobs for the Gaeltacht.  That <Col N="1266" /> represents a good beginning.  Could we have this figure broken down as to how many of the mohair group will be drawing big money leaving very little for others?  I should like to get down to this.  I have seen Gaeltarra Éireann do very good work.  Crolly dolls were mentioned by a previous speaker.  This doll is an excellent job.  Any little girl becoming the owner of one would be proud to have it.</P>

      <P>No.  Tá siad déanta sa Ghaillimh.  There are backroom industries in Dublin&mdash;I have mentioned this here before&mdash;claiming to make the famous Aran pullover and the crios or belt.  The Aran people should be protected by some form of official label. It is not enough to have an official label; we must let the public know that anything else is spurious and should not be purchased as coming from Aran.  Backroom and underground factories in Dublin have been cashing in on the Aran name.</P>
      <P>I regret that there is no mention of the proposed transfer of Gaeltarra Éireann to Furbo.  Has that proposal gone into the limbo of forgotten things?  Perhaps the Minister, when replying, would let us know what the position is.  When does he envisage the first work will be done there, whether in laying foundations, or in some other way?  Will this be the same as the proposed transfer of the Department of Lands to Castlebar and the Department of Education to Athlone?  I know that something has been done but I am not satisfied with that.</P>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister what is the position about employment in Gaeltarra Éireann?  Is the administrative staff top-heavy?  At Inishmaan where there was an establishment, I see it is now derelict and there is nothing left for the youth. Something should be done to help youth, not merely to help them to get the fare to go to Boston but to encourage them to stay on these islands.  The islands have more people in Boston than they have at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To a great extent the purpose of the Supplementary Estimate is to help in preserving our native language.  Unless <Col N="1267" /> we preserve the native speakers we can scarcely hope to preserve the language. People who acquire the language, as the Minister did, are not the people who keep it alive.  They use it when it suits them perhaps but the people of Aran imbibed the language with their milk.  It is their heritage.  To preserve the language we must preserve the native speakers.  There is only one way to do that&mdash;give them a livelihood. I do not want to be taken as criticising the Department but this is something we feel should be done.</P>

      <P>An chéad rud ba mhaith liom a rá ná nach bhfuil dabht ar bith ann ach go bhfuil dul chun cinn an-mhaith déanta ó thaobh obair a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Tá athrú an-mhór ar fad déanta le trí nó ceathair de bhlianta anuas agus tá sé sin le feiceáil i ngach aon chearn sa Ghaeltacht.  Is é sin an rud a thug dóchas agus atá ag tabhairt dóchais do mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Tuigeann siad go bhfuil suim an-mhór ag an Rialtas sa Ghaeltacht agus sa Ghaeilge agus tá sé sin le feiceáil sna monarchana nua atá curtha ar bun agus sa mhéid airgid atá á chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht.  Fiú sa Mheastachán seo tá tuilleadh airgid á chur ar fáil do Ghaeltarra Éireann le tionscail a chur ag obair sa Ghaeltacht agus le cuidiú le muintir na Gaeltachta a choinneáil sa bhaile.</P>
      <P>Labhair an Teachta Ó Domhnaill faoi na monarchana nua a cuireadh ar bun i nGaoth Dobhair agus dúirt sé gur cailíní is mó a bheidh ag obair ansin agus gur mhaith leis go dtabharfadh Gaeltarra Éireann aghaidh ar obair a chur ar fáil do na fir.  Ba mhaith liom é seo a rá i dtreo nach dtiocfaidh míthuiscint ar bith as sin: níl an méid a dúirt an Teachta ceart chor ar bith.  Nuair a bheidh na monarchana seo faoi lánseol i nGaoth Dobhair beidh ceathrar fear ag obair do gach aon bhean a bheidh ionta.  Ba mhaith liom anois go bhfaigheadh an méid sin poiblíocht mar tá sé antábhachtach go dtuigfidh muintir Ghaoth Dobhair gur fir is mó a bheidh ar obair sna monarchana nua seo atá curtha ar bun againn ann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Luaigh an Teachta fosta ceist Chill Charthaigh agus an Cheist Dála a <Col N="1268" /> chuir sé síos dom an tseachtain seo caite.  Is é an rud a tharla ansin gur tugadh seachtain bhreise laetheanta saoire&mdash;trí sheachtain ar fad&mdash;do na hoibrithe sa mhonarcha sin don chéad uair riamh i mbliana agus cionn is gur fearr leis na daoine a bhíonn ar obair sa mhonarcha sin laetheanta saoire a fháil ag an am den bhliain is táirgeacht agus, ar an ábhar sin, is airgead dóibh, chuaigh lucht bainistíochta Ghaeltarra Éireann sa mhonarcha sin i gcomhairle leis na hoibrithe agus dúirt siad leo go dtiocfadh leo dhá sheachtain saoire a ghlacadh dá mba mhian leo ag an am sin.  Ach, do réir dealraimh, ní raibh na hoibrithe sásta leis sin agus fágadh an scéal mar sin ina dhiaidh sin. Dúradh fosta, nuair a bhí a fhios ag an lucht bainistíochta thuas ansin go raibh an Teachta le Ceist a chur síos sa Dáil mar gheall air sin, gur cuireadh na daoine ag obair ní amháin sa ló ach san oíche fosta.  Níl sé sin i gceart ach an oiread, mar i gcuid den mhonarcha sin bhí obair ar siúl i rith an lae agus i rith na hoíche le tamall. Ach obair de shaghas eile a bhí i gceist anseo.  Tá socrú déanta anois, sílim, a bhfuil gach aon duine sásta leis.</P>
    <P>Luadh an marc trádála, bréidín Dhún na nGall agus mar sin de.  Tá deacracht ag baint leis seo: chuamar isteach ann cheana féin nuair a chuir Teachta éigin Ceist síos á rá gur cheannaigh sé éadach i Sasana a rinneadh san Iodáil, sílim, agus &ldquo;Bréidín Donegal&rdquo; scríofa air.  Fuaireamar amach gur rí-dheacair marc trádála a chlárú a bhfuil ainm áite ar leith ann, go háirithe, cuirim i gcás, nuair a chiallaíonn focal mar &ldquo;Donegal&rdquo; saghas áirithe bréidín ar fúd an domhain&mdash;fiú amháin i gcás daoine nach bhfuil eolas ar bith acu faoi Dhún na nGall anseo in Éirinn.</P>
    <P>Chuir an Teachta Ó Domhnaill agus an Teachta Ó Cúgáin ceist cé hiad na daoine a gheobhaidh obair sna monarchana nua seo.  Bhuel, níl dabht ar bith ann ach gurb iad muintir na Gaeltachta atá agus a bheidh ag obair iontu.  Bíonn orainn bainisteoirí a fháil taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht uaireanta&mdash;daoine a mbíonn an scil acu nó daoine a mbíonn céird na bainistíochta foghlamtha acu&mdash;ach go geinearálta na daoine a fhaigheann obair sna monarchana sin is daoine <Col N="1269" /> de mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus ní daoine ón taobh amuigh iad.  Ach mar is gnách leis an Teachta Ó Cúgáin, is maith leis rud a tharraingt anuas a gheobhaidh na ceannlínte, mar a déarfá, agus is é an rud is mó a bhíonn ar siúl aige anois ná trácht ar na daoine leis na cótaí mohair.  Níl a fhios agam cé hiad sin ach, de réir dealraimh, tá aithne ag an Teachta Ó Cúgáin orthu.  Is é an port amháin a bhíodh ag an Teachta Ó Cúgáin anseo i gcónaí ná caint ar na daoine ag dul síos chuig na báid agus muintir na Gaeltachta ag imeacht amach as an tír ar fad.  Ach tá deireadh ag teacht leis sin mar tá fhios aige, faoi láthair, cionn is go bhfuil dul chun cinn chomh maith sin déanta againn sa Ghaeltacht go bhfuil daoine as an Gaeltacht i nGlascú, i mBirmingham agus in áiteanna eile ag scríobh abhaile chuig a muintir ag cur ceisteanna orthu i dtaobh na monarchana nua seo agus á fhiafraí díobh an mbeadh seans acu poist a fháil iontu ionas go dtiocfadh siad abhaile.  Sin é an bealach a bhfuil na daoine sin ag teacht anois agus, nuair atá an cluiche a bhí aige caillte ag an Teachta Ó Cúgáin, caithfidh sé teacht ar cheannlínte nua.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé ag an tús, tá an dul chun cinn sin á dhéanamh ag Gaeltarra Éireann.  Tá siad ag cur obair ar fáil do dhaoine sa Ghaeltacht agus táimse bródúil as an méid oibre atá déanta acu le blianta beaga anuas.  Tá a fhios agam go leanfar ar aghaidh leis an obair seo níos gaiste fiú amháin ná mar a táimid ag dul le tamall.</P>
    <P>Maidir le hArdoifig Ghaeltarra sna Forbacha, tá an dúshraith istigh agus na ballaí á dtógáil agus ní eol dom cúis ar bith nach mbeadh an foirgneamh réidh don fhoireann i mbliana. Arís, ba mhaith liom Gaeltarra Éireann a mholadh as ucht na fostaíochta a chuireann siad ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus, mar a dúirt mé, is é an aidhm atá againn ná go mbeidh muintir na Gaeltachta ábalta obair a fháil ina gceantair féin agus nach mbeidh orthu dul thar lear leis an obair sin a fháil.  Sin é an chuma atá ag teacht ar an scéal anois.</P>

I am sorry that I did not deliver the notes to Deputies at an earlier stage.  I am afraid this was frank misjudgment on my part.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This is due to the fact that Deputies expressed the feeling that they did not have sufficient information on the last occasion of an Estimate. I was glad that Deputies from all sides of the House did pay tribute to the amount of information made available upon which a discussion could take place on such a large number of State companies and on the other activities of my Department, most of which involve highly technical matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1271" /> I move:</P>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31st March, 1969, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Transport and Power including certain Services administered by that office, and for payment of sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this token Estimate is to enable the Dáil to discuss the 1968-69 Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>The principal increases in 1968-69 are in the provisions for Salaries, Wages and Allowances, £45,000&mdash; subhead A; Grants for Harbours, £58,000&mdash;subhead E; Grant-in-Aid for Tourism under the Tourist Traffic Acts, £792,000&mdash;subheads F.1, F.2, and F.3; Acquisition of Land, <i>et cetera</i> at Airports, £64,000&mdash;subhead G.1; Constructional Works at Airports, £450,000 &mdash;subhead G.2; Grant-in-Aid and Housing Subsidies and Grants for Shannon Free Airport Development Co. Ltd., £212,000&mdash;subheads K.1, K.2, K.3 and K4; Rural Electrification, £95,500 &mdash;subhead O&mdash;and a new provision for Investment Grants for Ships, £440,000 &mdash;subhead T. Small increases in other subheads amount to £96,540 bringing the total increases to £2,253,040.</P>
    <P>The increase in the provision for salaries, wages and allowances is due to authorised salary increases, normal incremental progression, provision for new posts and overtime.  The new posts arise principally in the Meteorological and Aviation Operations Services and in the provision for airports construction and maintenance due to increased activity in these fields.  There is, however, a partly offsetting reduction in the staff of the Aviation and Marine Communications Service following the introduction last year of automatic communication equipment.  I will be dealing with the various other increases in the Supplementary Estimate separately.</P>
    <P>The decreases in 1968-69 are in the provisions for Córas Iompair Éireann Redundancy Compensation, £21,000 <Col N="1272" /> (subhead D.2); Technical Assistance, £8,500 (Subhead N) and Rents on Lands etc. at Airports, £34,500 (Subhead S) bringing the total decreases to £64,000.  To this amount must be added the increase of £108,050 in Appropriations in Aid which is equivalent to a decrease in the net grant and brings the total decrease to £172,050.</P>
    <P>The increase in Appropriations in Aid is due mainly to increased estimated receipts from landing fees at Shannon Airport, £90,000.</P>
    <P>On the basis of actual increases and decreases as stated above, namely £2,253,040 increase and £172,050 decrease, the net increase compared with the 1967-68 provision is £2,080,990.</P>
    <P>CIE's net deficit for the year ended 31st March, 1968 amounted to £2.48 million which was £480,000 more than the Board's annual subvention of £2 million.</P>
    <P>Total operating receipts for 1967-68 at £27.396 million showed an increase of £2.273 million on the receipts for the previous year.  Approximately £700,000 of this increase, however, can be identified as revenue which was lost in the previous year as a result of industrial unrest.</P>
    <P>The operating expenditure for the year amounted to £28.512 million, an increase of £2.2 million on the previous year.  Reduced working hours and other improvements in conditions of service, as well as increased social insurance, accounted for £1.43 million of this increase.  The devaluation of sterling and the Suez closure resulted in an increase of £80,000 in the cost of fuel and other materials.</P>
    <P>I should explain that of the total net deficit of £2.48 million financial charges amounted to £1.363 million. This represents an increase of £154,000 on financial charges in 1966-67, reflecting the increase in Exchequer advances made to the Board in respect of capital expenditure under section 4 of the Transport Act, 1964.  The total amount of capital advances made to CIE by the Exchequer up to 31st March, 1968 was £5.409 million and the balance of the £6 million, which is the limit on such advances under the 1964 Act, has since been advanced to the Board.  A sum of £6 million was <Col N="1273" /> the amount which it was estimated CIE would require by way of capital advances during the five years ending 31st March, 1969 and legislation will be necessary later this year to extend this limit.</P>
    <P>In order to meet rising costs, CIE increased fares and rates from 1st January, 1968.  Because of the Board's financial position, an increase from an earlier date would have been justified but was deferred in an effort to keep down prices as much as possible. However, because of the subsequent impact of the 11th round and other improvements in conditions of service, the Board's financial position deteriorated and a further increase in fares and rates, from 2nd December, 1968 and 1st January, 1969, respectively, became essential.  I have already explained to the House, in reply to Parliamentary Questions, the reasons why these increases had to be introduced. Briefly the position is that, since the January 1968 increases, labour costs in CIE had risen by over £3 million a year.  Other costs, including materials costs, fuel costs and financial charges had risen by £1.255 million a year, making a total increase of £4.3 million in a full year.  The impact of rising costs has been offset by CIE to a substantial extent by increased business and greater productivity. Over the five years ending 31st March, 1969, new business totalling £6.5 million has been gained, an average annual increase of 6¼ per cent; this excludes additional revenue secured under the Department of Education free transport scheme for school children.  Greater productivity has also been achieved.  The labour force has remained unchanged during recent years although business has been expanded, the working week reduced and extra annual leave granted; this represents in all an increase in productivity of 13 per cent.</P>
    <P>As in previous years the Board's losses in 1967-68 are attributable almost entirely to the railways on which the operating loss was £2.185 million, an increase of £327,000 on the loss in 1966-67.  In addition to general increases in costs referred to earlier, rail depreciation costs were also greater than in the previous year reflecting <Col N="1274" /> higher replacement costs and a full year's provision for 12 new diesel locomotives. There was an improvement of 9.4 per cent in rail freight tonnage which was contributed by increased carryings of petrol and oil, fertilisers, cement and beet, partly offset by a fall in mill stuffs, sugar and grain tonnage. There was a fall of 4.6 per cent in the number of passengers carried by rail caused principally by a decline in the number of visitors from the United Kingdom, resulting from the travel restrictions necessitated by the outbreak of foot and mouth disease there.  Week-end rail passenger traffic continued to increase.</P>
    <P>In order to maximise rail passenger traffic, CIE offer a wide range of reduced fares.  Special reductions are available on scheduled rail services for groups of eight adults or more (two children being equivalent to one adult) and for families of not less than the equivalent of 2½ adults.  Day excursions at single fare operated on selected days each week and are popular for shopping expeditions.  There are reduced fares for two-day and week-end return journeys and during the off-season from October to May, special week-end bargain return tickets, at single fare and valid for return up to Monday, are offered about every second week-end. On Sundays there are cheap excursion return fares at less than single rate and during the Winter season these fares are still further reduced.  Various season tickets at reduced rates are available for railway passengers travelling daily to and from work; there are special season ticket rates for children under 16 years and for students under 21 years.  Holiday travel by CIE services is encouraged by the issue of Rambler tickets which allow unlimited travel for 15 days on scheduled rail services for £9 standard class or on rail and bus scheduled services for £11 standard class; reduced Rambler rates are available for parties of at least six adults and for families.</P>
    <P>Recent improvements in passenger train services include the provision of a new fast service between Limerick and Dublin and the reduction of journey times on many services.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suburban rail services, CIE are fully conscious of the <Col N="1275" /> need to ensure that these services are utilised as effectively as possible both as an economic asset and with a view to making the maximum contribution to the relief of road congestion in Dublin city.  Season tickets including monthly and weekly tickets are provided at attractive fares.  Suburban stations have been improved and modernised and, following a series of market research studies, additional services have been provided to reflect the demands of the public, including cross-city services linking suburban stations on the Northern line with stations on the South-Eastern line.  The station at Howth Junction is being rebuilt and a new station is being provided at Kilbarrack to cater for the new residential development in the area.  The feasibility of extending railway commuter services to Clondalkin, Ballyfermot, Cabra, Glasnevin and Drumcondra is being studied by an independent market research company commissioned by CIE and the potential for commuter services on the main railway line for Naas, Newbridge and Kildare is also being examined.  CIE are also undertaking an intensive marketing drive to attract more commuters to rail services, including an advertising campaign and door-to-door distribution of timetables and information to every householder within convenient reach of the suburban rail services.</P>

      <P>An important development in rail freight operations is the recent introduction of a fast liner freight service for container loads between Dublin and Cork and Dublin and Limerick.  The purpose is to attract to the railways as much as possible of long haul freight now being carried on Irish roads.  Attractions offered customers by the new service include faster inter-city movement of freight, better rates than those offered by road transport, same day delivery in Dublin of containerised freight from Cork and Limerick and same day shipping for export traffic.  The Board's ultimate plan is to provide a national network of liner freight trains and terminals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operating profit on the Dublin City passenger road services in 1967-68 amounted to £264,000, an <Col N="1277" /> increase of £64,000 on the result for 1966-67 which, however, was affected by losses incurred as a result of strikes by the board's employees in 1966.  The operating profit on the provincial road passenger services increased from £224,000 in 1966-67 to £487,000 in 1967-68, largely as a result of a substantial improvement in business.</P>
    <P>The Dublin city passenger road services have to contend with serious traffic congestion.  A complex system of communication is in operation to try to combat the problem&mdash;involving a central control in radio contact with patrol cars, inspectors located in the central city area and injection points for extra buses throughout the city.</P>
    <P>1967-68 was again another record year for CIE coach tours with revenue going up to £394,000 as compared with £284,000 in the previous year.  The marketing of off-season tours in North America contributed to the increase and the expansion of business from there was, of course, greatly facilitated by the establishment of a new sales office in New York.  A further sales office was opened in Los Angeles in September.  About 75 per cent of CIE's coach tour business comes from North America and it is confidently hoped that the opening of these new offices in New York and Los Angeles will improve selling and marketing on the North American Continent and provide for a substantial increase in this business in future years.</P>
    <P>Revenue from extended tours increased considerably during 1967-68. The demand for the 21-day tours of Ireland and Great Britain, which were introduced in 1967, has continued to be highly satisfactory with numbers participating in the tours rising from 1,490 in 1967 to 1,900 in the 1968 season.</P>
    <P>Coach tourist traffic has continued to grow at an encouraging rate and there is every indication that this important sector of tourism will continue to expand.  As far as foreign tour operators are concerned, in 1968 such operators offered approximately 35,000 passenger seats in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There was also an increase in the operating profit on CIE's road freight services, the profit for 1967-68 being <Col N="1278" /> £222,000 compared with £187,000 in 1966-67.  The total tonnage handled was, however, about 4.5 per cent lower than in 1966-67 mainly because of a decrease in the amount of haulage for county councils and reduced carryings of agricultural limestone and sundry traffic.</P>
    <P>CIE have been active since 1960 in the development of container services between this country and Britain under the trading name &ldquo;Irish Ferryways&rdquo;. The first such service was established by the Board in 1960 in co-operation with British Road Ferry Services and co-operation continues with that concern's successor &ldquo;Ferry Trailers Ltd.&rdquo; Irish Ferryways participate with the B and I in the unit load service between New Ross and Newport, Wales &mdash;the B and I providing the ships and Irish Ferryways the containers.</P>
    <P>The operating profit on the hotels and catering service was £181,000, an increase of £25,000 on the previous year.  The operating loss in the maintenance of the canals and operation of vessels was £86,000, a reduction of £12,000 on the 1966-67 figure.</P>
    <P>Capital expenditure by CIE in 1967-68 amounted to £3.8 million.  New road passenger vehicles introduced during the year included 130 Atlantean double deck buses, 16 tour coaches and 81 school vehicles.  The equipment of rail and road freight services for the increasing trend towards unit load traffic continued and heavy gantry cranes were erected at a number of centres to facilitate the use of containers. As part of a bridge renewal programme, a new railway viaduct was provided at Malahide.  This bridge, which is the largest pre-cast concrete bridge in Ireland, was designed, manufactured and erected by CIE personnel. A large computer installation was brought into operation which will provide more economic and more effective data processing.  Other works included the renovation of stations and the improvement of car and passenger handling facilities at Rosslare Harbour.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Transport Act, 1964, set the amount of the annual grant payable to CIE, with the aid of which the board are required to breakeven, at £2 million.  The amount of the <Col N="1279" /> grant may be varied at five yearly intervals commencing in the year 196970. The deficits incurred during the first two years of the initial five year period, 1964-65 and 1965-66, were contained within the limits of the annual grant with a small surplus to spare.  In 1966-67, however, a net deficit of £2.398 million was incurred and the surplus remaining from the first two years was not sufficient to offset the excess of deficit over grant in that year. The position worsened with the deficit of £2.48 million in 1967-68 and, despite the recent increase in fares and rates, it is expected that the deficit in the current financial year will also exceed the amount of the annual grant. Because of the board's difficult financial position the Minister for Finance agreed to a deferment of payment by the board in 1967-68 of interest amounting to £309,364 on Exchequer capital advances and he has agreed to do the same for 1968-69.</P>
    <P>The two main factors responsible for the increase in CIE's losses are (i) the upward moving costs of increases in pay and improved conditions of service and (ii) the losses incurred as a result of industrial disputes.  Increases in labour costs bear very heavily on an organisation such as CIE where such costs amount to about 65 per cent of operating expenditure.  It should, however, be noted that were it not for the effect of strikes within CIE since 1964, which cost the board an estimated £677,000, the break-even target could have been achieved for the four years ended 31st March, 1968.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated CIE are continually striving to lessen the impact of rising costs and have achieved considerable success in increasing productivity and attracting new business. I have asked the board to maintain their efforts in this respect so that the amount of the annual subvention may be kept within reasonable limits.</P>
    <P>With the growth in volume of goods transported by road, changes in methods of distribution, establishment of new industries in rural areas and improvement in the motor vehicle, the pattern of freight transport throughout the country has been constantly <Col N="1280" /> changing.  The evolutionary changes have been recognised in various concessions extended to licensed hauliers down through the years and this process continues.  Following a review of road freight transport policy carried out in my Department in 1968, I removed the restriction on amalgamation of licences by transfer with a view to encouraging the emergence of large sized and more efficiently operarted units, allowed increases of up to 25 per cent in the lorry weights of vehicles which may be operated under licence and, in the case of all eligible licensees, agreed to extend the range of commodities they were authorised to carry to include merchandise of all classes.</P>
    <P>I also established an inter-departmental study group to examine in greater depth the desirability or otherwise of further long-term measures to liberalise road transport for reward. The examination will be completed as speedily as possible but owing to the complex issues involved some time must necessarily elapse before the Study Group will be in a position to furnish its final report to me.  I am at present studying an interim report on livestock haulage from the group and I hope to be able to make an early statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, Ireland is a member of the European Conference of Ministers for Transport.  The Conference was established in 1953 but this country did not become a member until 1962.  The membership of the Conference which has its headquarters in Paris consists of the Ministers for Transport of the following States: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom and Yugoslavia. The United States and Canada are associate members.</P>
    <P>The main purposes of the Conference are to secure the rational development of European transport and to co-ordinate the activities of international organisations working in this sphere.  Problems dealt with by the Conference in recent years include the financial situation of the railways, road safety, the co-ordination of road traffic <Col N="1281" /> regulations, investment in transport, container traffic and preliminary studies aimed at the development of a general transport policy.</P>
    <P>The Conference honoured me by electing me as Chairman of its Council of Ministers for the year 1968.  The Council of Ministers meets twice a year, once in Paris and once in the country of the Chairman of the Conference. Accordingly the 27th Session of the Council was held in Dublin in June, 1968, and I am glad to say that the many delegates who attended from the various member countries were very favourably impressed by the efficient manner in which the arrangements for the meeting were organised.</P>
    <P>Through our membership and in other ways we are able to keep in close touch with a common transport policy by the EEC countries so that we may be ready to adapt ourselves when necessary for membership of the community.</P>
    <P>During 1967 Ireland adhered to an International Convention known as the TIR Convention.  This Convention provided for the issuing of special carnets for exemption from Customs examination en route, of goods carried in road vehicles or in trailers or in containers throughout the international journey on one set of wheels.  The Association of Irish Transport Operators and other interests which have been established under the name of Lastas Éireann Teoranta acts as issuing and guaranteeing association for the purposes of the Convention in this country.  My Department is the Authority responsible for the issuing of certificates of approval in respect of the vehicles constructed to TIR requirements. A number of certificates have already been issued in respect of containers.</P>
    <P>The reciprocal arrangement whereby licensed hauliers in the State contiguous to the border and licensed hauliers in Northern Ireland may engage in cross-border haulage for reward, has been continued.  The arrangement will be subject to further review early this year and I am keeping the matter under close scrutiny with a view to ensuring that the traffic does not adversely affect our interests.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1282" /> Óstlanna Iompair Éireann Teo. operate a chain of seven top-grade Great Southern Hotels situated at Killarney, Kenmare, Parknasilla, Galway, Mulrany, Sligo and Bundoran. In addition the Company opened a medium priced motor inn at Killarney in 1968 and will have their second motor inn in operation at Rosslare for the coming tourist season.  In 1967-68 the operating profit earned by OIE was £160,417 as compared with £133,700 for the previous year.  This increase was attributable in the main to a rise of 8.7 per cent in the number of bed nights sold and was achieved despite the unsettled international situation and the foot and mouth epidemic in Britain.</P>
    <P>The British and Irish Steampacket Company made a total loss, after all charges, of £398,403 in the year ended 31st December 1967 as compared with a net profit of £86,019 in the previous year.  The company were very badly affected in 1967 by the Livestock Dock Strike and by the foot and mouth epidemic, those two items alone costing the company £230,000.  The balance of the loss was mainly due to exceptional development costs which totalled £130,372.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated on other occasions, the whole basis and method of cross-channel shipping is changing rapidly, the old conventional type passenger and cargo carrying ships giving way to more specialised types of vessels and handling methods.  Conventional cargo ships are rapidly being replaced by unit load vessels and the conventional passenger vessels by passenger/car ferries.  The B and I company are well to the fore in effecting these changes.  In the past few years the company have been changing over rapidly from conventional to unit load carrying.  For passenger/vehicle transport, they introduced a new car ferry vessel on the Dublin/Liverpool route in May last.  This year they will introduce a second vessel on that route and a car ferry vessel on the Cork/Swansea route.  One of these vessels is being built at Cork Dockyard.</P>
    <P>The company recently announced their long-term proposals in regard to freight services, namely, the operation of a fully automated unit load system <Col N="1283" /> via the Dublin-Liverpool route and a freight service on the Cork-Swansea ferry.  These proposals involved the termination as from 1st January, 1969, of the Cork-Liverpool twice-weekly unit load service and its replacement by a liner train on a daily basis between Cork and Dublin for the carriage of containers for onward shipment to Liverpool.  The company are satisfied that this would give shippers a better and cheaper service.</P>
    <P>Considerable public concern was expressed, however, about the effect of this proposal on the port of Cork and on employment there.  In these circumstances, the company, at my request, agreed to defer the implementation of this part of their proposals so that I could examine the matter fully in the light of the representations made by those concerned.  The company have agreed to continue the existing service until May, 1969.  In the interim period, full discussions and consultations in regard to the company's operations in Cork will take place.</P>
    <P>Because of the effective closure of Fishguard to livestock services arising from the withdrawal by British Railways of the supply of cattle wagons to that port and also because of the underutilisation of the Cork-Birkenhead service by the cattle shippers, who have been chartering ships to meet their needs, the company's livestock services have been confined to the Dublin-Birkenhead route for some time past. The company are converting one of their existing general freight vessels for livestock carrying and this vessel, together with the two existing livestock vessels, will provide a guaranteed weekly capacity of 6,000 head of cattle.</P>
    <P>This re-orientation of the company's operations involves very heavy capital investment but the board are confident that the profit which will be generated when the new assets are fully operational will be sufficient both to service the capital involved and to show a reasonable return on the State investment in the company.  Apart from their importance in the company's own affairs the developments now taking place are significant in the context of the national economy in that the new car ferry services will be of increasing <Col N="1284" /> benefit to tourism while the unit load services will benefit our external trade by reducing transport costs and providing more efficient services.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Limited made a small profit of £20,345, after all charges, in the year ended 31st March, 1968, as compared with a net loss of £67,471 in the previous year.  The increase was due to an improvement in freight rates, greater efficiency in operation and administration and the elimination of certain uneconomic vessels.</P>
    <P>During the year the company continued the recasting of their operations in order to achieve greater efficiency. Particularly noteworthy is that the company succeeded in cutting their administration costs by £60,000 in contrast to the general rising trend in recent years.  The transatlantic liner services which the company had operated at a heavy loss were discontinued and were replaced by a service operated jointly with Manchester Liners.</P>
    <P>The company also made arrangements during the year for the operation, in partnership with a British and French company, of a car ferry service between Rosslare and Le Havre.  The service commenced in May, 1968, and has proved very successful, so much so that an increase in services in 1969 has been announced.</P>
    <P>The company also took delivery of a new 38,000-ton dead weight bulk carrier, the &ldquo;Irish Elm&rdquo;, which is being operated on a profitable long-term charter.  The company also have on order two 29,000-ton dead weight bulk carriers for which long-term charters have been negotiated.  The vessels, one of which is being built at Verolme Cork Dockyard, are due for delivery in September, 1969 and early in 1970.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of the policy of disposing of the older and less economic ships, two vessels&mdash;the &ldquo;Irish Maple&rdquo;, a dry cargo vessel of 11,671 tons dead weight and the &ldquo;Irish Larch&rdquo;, a dry cargo vessel of 11,677 tons dead weight&mdash;were sold recently.  Two smaller dry cargo vessels&mdash;the &ldquo;Irish Rose&rdquo; of 1,971 tons dead weight and the &ldquo;Irish Fir&rdquo; of 1,941 tons dead weight&mdash;have also been sold.</P>
    <P>The preliminary indications are that <Col N="1285" /> the company's operations in the year 1968-69 will yield an appreciable profit.</P>
    <P>The Shipping Investment Grants Bill, 1968, which provides for the payment of investment grants at a rate up to 25 per cent to Irish ship owners for the purchase of new ships and the conversion of existing ships, is at present before the House.  Accordingly, I do not propose to elaborate on the scheme at present beyond saying that it should provide a considerable incentive to Irish ship owners to modernise their fleets, and also benefit the Irish shipbuilding industry.</P>
    <P>With effect from 4th October, 1968, Ireland has implemented the International Load Line Convention, 1966, which replaces an earlier Convention of 1930.  The load line, more commonly known as the Plimsoll line, is a marking on the sides of a ship to show the maximum depth to which the ship can safely be submerged.  The Convention permits of the carriage of larger cargoes by vessels which apply the higher safety standards made possible by modern techniques, and makes provision for the first time for the very large sizes of vessels, especially tankers, now coming into use.  The Convention, at the same time, in the interests of safety and in the light of statistical experience, has reduced the permissible submerged depth for smaller vessels.</P>
    <P>The question of oil pollution continues to engage the attention of my Department.  Ireland already subscribes to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954-1962, the aim of which is to prohibit, or to allow only within specified mid-ocean zones, the discharge from tankers and oil burning vessels of oil or oil-contaminated water.</P>
    <P>However, the &ldquo;Torrey Canyon&rdquo; disaster of March, 1967, has focussed world-wide attention on the fact that, even if the Convention were fully observed, the escape of crude oil from a tanker involved in a casualty or collision would still constitute probably the greatest source of oil pollution.  This risk is magnified by the ever increasing size of tankers used.</P>
    <P>By reason of the large volume of <Col N="1286" /> tanker traffic passing close to our shores, oil pollution is an ever present danger for us.  The off-shore oil traffic is the greatest threat of pollution and the new traffic to Bantry represents in this context only a slight additional risk, particularly of a small-scale handling spillage, against which, however, every precaution must be taken. From the inception of the Bantry project my Department have, therefore, given particular attention to the precautions to be taken against pollution. Among the measures adopted are improved lighting facilities in the approaches to the bay, a buoyed approach channel to the terminal, centralised automatic control of the pipelines at the terminal and the pumping system on the ship, provision of a boom and oil recovery barge at the terminal to retrieve any escaped oil, and the provision of detergentspraying equipment at the terminal and on board the four service tugs and three launches in the bay.  Our only previous experience of crude oil handling on a large scale has been at the Whitegate Oil Refinery, which has handled over 16 million tons of crude oil in the last ten years without any serious case of oil pollution.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, but there has been a considerable amount of oil spilled on to the beaches on the Meath coast during the last couple of weeks and it appears it is not possible to do anything with it.  I do not know how it can be cleared for the summer.  It is an awful mess and obviously has come off ships.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  As a result of world-wide reaction to the &ldquo;Torrey <Col N="1287" /> Canyon&rdquo; accident, the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation (IMCO) have undertaken urgent studies of all aspects of the problem including legal, operational and financial aspects.  Ireland, as an active member of IMCO, is participating fully in these activities.</P>
      <P>In addition, an inter-departmental working group set up by me is studying particularly the most effective and least harmful method of dealing with escaped oil at sea and on the coast, and the speediest and most efficient organisation of resources to combat pollution.  The group will no doubt be greatly assisted in their work by the various scientific and governmental organisations in many countries which are also studying the problem.</P>
      <P>There is a provision of £212,000 in respect of grants for harbours.  Of this amount £100,000 has been allocated to Waterford, where a major improvement scheme, comprising the reconstruction of the north wharf to provide additional deep sea berthage and facilities for the port's rapidly expanding container traffic, is planned.  These works are estimated to cost £430,000, and a grant subject to a maximum of £260,000 which represents 60 per cent of the cost, has been made available. The balance of the provision is for improvement works at Ballina, Drogheda, New Ross and the completion of a new jetty at Foynes, which is now in operation for the export of ore concentrates. Provision has also been made for an increased grant, from £15,000 to £44,000, to Sligo Harbour Commissioners, for the acquisition of dredging equipment.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say that with the publication of a report commissioned by the cross-Channel shipping companies some progress has been made towards the goal of improving port productivity and better conditions for dockers at Dublin port.  I do hope that progress will continue to be made and that the objectives will be attained in the near future in the cross-Channel section of the port.  I also look forward to progress being made towards securing the decasualisation of dock labour and increased productivity in the deep sea section.</P>

      <Col N="1288" /> Aer Lingus incurred an operating loss of £140,479 on cross-Channel and European operations in the year ended 31st March, 1968 compared with a profit of £315,885 in the previous year. Revenue increased by 3 per cent to £11,315,606 while expenditure increased by 7 per cent to £11,456,085. In the same period Aer Lingus carried 1,159,400 passengers, a decrease of 5 per cent on the previous year.  Freight carried by the company during the year amounted to 24,760 metric tons, an increase of 6 per cent.  These figures again reflect the changing character of traffic with the advent of car ferry services, foot and mouth disease precautions and to some extent the British recession.  A growth by 6 per cent to 130,000 in passenger traffic between Ireland and the Continent offset to a great extent the decreases on the British services.  Aer Lingus maintained their services on all routes during 1968 and on 29th May inaugurated a non-stop service between Dublin and Madrid.</P>
    <P>For the winter 1968-69 Aer Lingus, in co-operation with the Irish hotel industry, car hire firms and other tourism interests, arranged a wide variety of inclusive tours to attract visitors to Ireland.  The tours which are available through travel agents in North America, Britain and the Continent are expected to attract over 10,000 visitors from these countries who are estimated to spend £500,000 in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Tours for visitors from Britain are marketed under the title of &ldquo;Value Holidays&rdquo; and provide a range of 31 different types.  The programme, which includes self-drive car holidays, golfing holidays, fishing holidays and racing week-ends is expected to attract 5,000 British visitors.  A similar programme of winter holidays for British visitors had been planned for the winter of 1967-68 but had to be abandoned due to the foot and mouth outbreak.  Aer Lingus now have sales offices in 14 European cities and winter and offseason selling has become an urgent priority for the company's sales force. It is expected that sales promotion should attract 1,000 continental visitors to Ireland in the 1968-69 winter season.</P>
    <P>The Aer Lingus North American winter tour programme was first intro <Col N="1289" /> duced in 1966 and in that year 800 visitors were attracted to Ireland.  In 1967-68 the figure exceeded 2,500.  In the winter of 1968-69 it is hoped to attract 4,500 from the U.S. and Canada.  Tours for North American visitors are (a) auto vacations round Ireland which include a self-drive car, hotel accommodation, tickets to the theatre in Dublin and medieval banquet at Bunratty Castle and (b) 15-day conducted tour of Irish beauty spots, sight-seeing tour of Dublin and an evening at a cabaret in a Dublin hotel. In support of their programme Aer Lingus are spending £125,000 on a press and radio campaign in North America.</P>
    <P>Our transatlantic airline continues to operate satisfactorily.  In 1967-68 Aerlínte made an operating profit of £1,336,140, compared with a profit of £790,000 in 1966-67.  This is the highest profit yet made by the company and reflects their very satisfactory progress on the North American routes.  During the year ended 31st March, 1968, Aerlínte's passenger traffic rose by 21 per cent to 213,442 while freight increased by almost 9 per cent to 4,545 metric tons.  Once again, the airline had the highest load factor of all operators on the North Atlantic route due to the company's intensive promotional activity mainly in North America.  The Aerlínte service between Shannon and Chicago via Montreal inaugurated in May, 1966, has developed strongly and as from 1st June, 1969, Aerlínte propose to provide a direct service to Chicago daily except on Sundays when it will operate to Chicago via Montreal.</P>
    <P>The present fleet of Aer Lingus consists of 14 Viscounts and four BAC One Eleven jet airliners, while Aerlínte operate with four Boeing 320's and two Boeing 720's.  The fleet proposals of the air companies involve the operation by Aer Lingus of a mixed jet fleet of Boeing 737's and BAC One Eleven aircraft and the purchase by Aerlínte of Jumbo Jets.  Standardisation of equipment to a maximum degree is evidently sound policy.</P>
    <P>During the year ended 31st March, 1968, the air companies secured new office premises at 5th Avenue, New York, and opened a new booking office in Regent Street, London.  They also <Col N="1290" /> acquired an office in Poland Street, London.  The companies' premises at Nos. 40 and 41 Upper O'Connell Street have been leased for the construction of a hotel in which the company will have a new passenger booking office.</P>
    <P>The combined financial results of Aer Lingus and Aerlínte for 1967-68 showed an operating profit of £1,195,661, an increase of £89,736 over the previous year.  Revenue increased by 11 per cent to £24,038,131 while expenditure rose by 11.5 per cent to £22,842,470.</P>
    <P>The joint total revenue of the two air companies in 1967-68&mdash;£24 million, made up of £11.3 million earned by Aer Lingus and £12.7 by Aerlínte&mdash; will, it is currently anticipated, increase to £30 million for 1968-9, an increase of 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>The capital programme of the two companies over the next five years involves capital expenditure of an unprecedented magnitude, due to the rapid technological changes taking place in the world air transport industry.  The emergence of the giant Boeing 747's (Jumbo Jets) together with the changeover to jet aircraft by Aer Lingus' competitors on the short-haul routes and the resulting fleet requirements of the air companies have implications for their capital structure which may require legislation in the near future.</P>
    <P>The profitability of an air company, assuming good management and established productivity growth techniques, varies in different periods according to the relative impact of the following factors: accelerating demand; competition from surface transport, e.g., car ferry operations; surges of charter traffic at cheap rates where revenue earning potential may be low in initial stages; competition with other airlines under bi-lateral agreements; devaluation costs; initial impact of loan repayments on aircraft coming into new operation and on computer reservations systems and offices; wage costs exceeding rates at which fares can be increased; world and area economic recessions and booms.  The pattern of the air companies' increases can be related to these factors.  The overall progress of the companies is evident.</P>
    <P>Since the passage of the Air Companies <Col N="1291" /> Act, 1966, Aer Rianta's functions have been confined almost exclusively to the management of Dublin Airport on my behalf.  Early last year I announced that the company would be given responsibility for the management of Shannon and Cork airports on the same basis as the company manage Dublin Airport at present as my agent.  Arrangements are being made for the transfer which I expect will become fully effective by 1st April, 1969.  It is intended in the light of the experience gained by the new management to enact legislation in due course to establish a statutory body as an airports authority with responsibility for the three State airports.  It is unlikely that this legislation will be enacted before the summer of 1970.  As I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions in the course of the year, the interest of the staffs at Shannon and Cork airports involved in the change in management will be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Free Airport Development Company's finances are provided from the Exchequer by way of (i) grant-in-aid to meet running expenses and grants to industries, (ii) housing subsidy and grants, (iii) share capital for the construction of factories and (iv) repayable advances for the provision of housing and community services.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited (Amendment) Act, 1968, which became law on 11th June, 1968, increased the limits on (a) the total amount which the Minister for Finance may subscribe in taking up shares in the Company to £8 million, (b) the aggregate of grant-in-aid to £6 million and (c) the total amount of repayable advances to £7 million.</P>
    <P>The allocation of grant-in-aid provides an amount to meet running expenses (subhead K.1) and an amount in respect of grants to industries (subhead K.2).  The grant-in-aid towards running expenses is arrived at after taking account of receipts from the company's revenue earning activities&mdash; mostly rents from factories and houses. The provision for 1968-69 is £300,000 or £100,000 more than for 1967-68. The increased allocation includes provision <Col N="1292" /> for promotional expenses related to the achievement of the growth in tourist numbers and industrial employment projected for 1968-69.  The grant-in-aid in respect of grants to industries amounts to £400,000 or £100,000 more than for 1967-68.  This reflects the increasing rate of industrial development at Shannon.  Up to 31st March, 1968 the total amount paid to the company by way of grant-in-aid for running expenses and grants to industries was £2,855,500.</P>
    <P>Grants are also payable for housing subsidies (subhead K.3) and housing grants (subhead K.4).  The amount of subsidy payable for each dwelling is the difference between the economic rent and the rent actually charged.  The total amount paid by way of subsidy to 31st March, 1968 was £178,100 and the provision for 1968-69 is £57,000. The housing grants payable to the company are equivalent to those available to private persons and public utility societies under the Housing Acts.  The total amount paid to 31st March, 1968, was £104,340 and the provision for 1968-69 is £35,000.</P>
    <P>The allocation for 1968-69 of share capital for factory and warehouse construction and repayable advances for houses and community services is £1,850,000.  This is an increase of £750,000 on the allocation for 1967-68. The amount of share capital and repayable advances paid to the company up to 31st March, 1968, was £8,101,000.</P>
    <P>The company have been making steady progress in attracting new industries to Shannon.  At 31st March, 1968 there were 25 manufacturing and five warehousing concerns in operation at the Airport.  From 1st January, 1968, to the end of February, 1969, nine manufacturing concerns and businesses had contracted to commence operations.  Of these, three are Irishowned or part-owned.  In addition 12 commercial and service concerns were operating on 31st March, 1968, with a proposal for a further concern under consideration.  The commercial activities include data processing and consultancy and trading business.</P>
    <P>A total of 60 factories and ten warehouses were occupied at 31st March, <Col N="1293" /> 1968.  Twelve more factories and two warehouses were under construction and a further 31 sites have been reserved by existing firms with a view to expansion of their activities.  The total area of completed factories, warehouses and offices at 31st March, 1968 was 1,057,000 sq. ft.</P>
    <P>In the calendar year, 1967, exports from the industrial estate amounted to £32.6 million and imports were valued at £22.5 million leaving a net balance of £10.1 million.  This balance gives an idea of the volume of work being carried out at the industrial estate and its contribution to the country's balance of payments.  Of the total national exports of manufactured goods in 1967, 29 per cent came from Shannon.  In relation to total national trade in 1967, Shannon accounted for 10 per cent of total exports and 5 five per cent of total imports.</P>
    <P>Air freight generated by the industrial estate in the year 1967-68 was 3,631 metric tons, an increase of 65 per cent over the previous year.  It accounted for over half the total terminal air freight at Shannon.</P>
    <P>The company promote tourism through Shannon in conjunction with other promoting bodies including Bord Fáilte, the air companies and CIE. This promotion is reflected in the growth of terminal passenger traffic at Shannon.  Terminal traffic in the year ended March, 1968, exceeded 320,000, the highest figure in the airport's history.  The tours, banquets and other tourist activities promoted by the company catered for over 100,000 in 1967.  Tourist income in County Clare is, in fact, well over £1 million.</P>
    <P>Following the success of their tourism promotion to date, the development company are now promoting development in the new field of providing traditional style cottages for letting in counties Clare and Limerick. It is expected that there will be a strong demand for this type of accommodation from North America, Britain and the Continent.  It is planned to have the accommodation available from the beginning of the 1969 tourist season.</P>
    <P>At 31st March, 1968, 3,942 people (2,238 males and 1,704 females) were <Col N="1294" /> employed in the industrial estate.  The number at the end of January, 1969, was 4,150.  The total employment in the whole Shannon complex at 31st March, 1968, was over 6,000 people and their total annual income has been conservatively estimated as being in the region of £4 million.  The number of people then resident in the Shannon community was 2,128.  A total of 433 houses and 137 flats had been constructed by the company for rent or sale and almost all of these were occupied or allocated.  A further 140 houses were under construction and planning was in progress on an additional 170 houses.</P>
    <P>In addition to the company-built houses, 28 had been constructed by private builders on developed sites provided by the company and 14 such houses were in course of construction. Arrangements have been completed with a speculative builder who proposes to build further houses for sale. The Clare County Council also plans to construct houses in the new town. However, the bulk of the housing requirements at Shannon will have to be provided by the company for a number of years to come.  In addition to housing developments, certain community services have been provided by the community, the company or by other authorities.  These now include two churches, a comprehensive school, a community hall, two primary schools, shops and recreational and library facilities.</P>
    <P>As I indicated when presenting the recent amending legislation to the House, the company are satisfied that the minimum viable community which must be aimed at in Shannon's particular geographic environment is one of not less than 6,000 people and planning is geared to attaining this objective early in the 1970's.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that it has been decided to expand the company's functions to enable them to function as an organ of industrial development in the Clare, Limerick and North Tipperary region.  In this respect and in respect of industrial and related matters at the Shannon Industrial Estate, the company will report to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. <Col N="1295" /> The company will continue to report to me on their tourism and aviation activities.</P>
    <P>In retrospect I look with pleasure and pride at the success of the industrial estate.  The success of this promotional venture is due to many factors.  In my view the pre- and postcare service for industrialists so well administered by the chairman, board and staff, are pre-eminent and of greater importance than the customs free area and the Government aids which are comparable with those available elsewhere.  The success of Shannon Industrial Estate, as the House knows, has led to the now increasing emphasis on industrial growth centres.</P>
    <P>In 1967 Dublin Airport showed decreases in both passenger and freight traffic compared to 1966.  The passenger traffic at 1,526,900 represented a decrease of one per cent but freight traffic at 30,273 metric tons was down by 11 per cent.  The reductions were due to the economic situation in Britain, the restriction on travel caused by the foot and mouth epidemic, diversion of traffic to the surface car ferry services and the withdrawal of the air car ferry service.  The position showed an improvement in 1968 with an increase of three per cent in passenger traffic and 12 per cent in freight traffic.</P>
    <P>As well as Aer Lingus, regular services are operated to and from the airport by eight foreign operators&mdash; British European Airways, BKS Air Transport Ltd., British Midland Airways Ltd., Cambrian Airways, British United (CI.) Airways, Autair International Airways, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and Iberia Airlines.</P>
    <P>Horse ferry services continue to be operated at the airport.</P>
    <P>Dublin Airport has been bursting at the seams for some years past.  Down the years traffic has out-grown the most optimistic concepts of the original designers.  Past traffic growth and future projections leave no alternative to a large scale development programme over the next five years or so.  In 1967, Aer Rianta, who are charged with the management of the airport, commissioned <Col N="1296" /> a firm of US consultants to advise on the planning of a new passenger terminal.  A scheme, based on their report, has been prepared.  The consultants were favourably impressed by the layout they found at the airport and had no difficulty in formulating a scheme for a new terminal which would dovetail with the existing complex and give a highly functional airport not only on completion of the new terminal but during the intermediate stages while the terminal and related services were being developed.</P>
    <P>The scheme proposes that the terminal should be centred on the existing Pier No. 2 which is the pier more remote from the existing terminal building.  A further pier would be provided on the south side of the new terminal.  The eventual complex would consist of the central terminal with three piers stemming from it.  Pavilions would be provided at the ends of the three piers around which aircraft would be closely parked in a &ldquo;nose-in&rdquo; manner.  The existing terminal building would be used for the technical and other services which do not require to be housed in the central passenger handling area. Detailed planning of the new terminal and of the manner in which it will be phased over the coming years is well advanced.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed over the next five years to provide an new east-west runway as well as additional apron and taxiway facilities.  Provision is also being made in planning for the provision in due course of a second east-west runway parallel to the first to take care of future traffic growth.  This second runway may not be required for possibly ten or 15 years but there is no doubt that it will be required ultimately. Substantial works at present in progress include the provision of a new cargo terminal which is nearing completion, a new catering building and approach road.</P>
    <P>The capital expenditure on Dublin Airport up to 31st March, 1968 amounted to about £5,659,000.  For the year ended 31st March, 1968, total revenue at the airport was £995,000 and expenditure was £793,000, the operating surplus therefore being £202,000.  When allowance is made <Col N="1297" /> for depreciation and interest on capital expenditure amounting to about £484,000, the overall deficit on the airport in 1967-68 was about £282,000. If, however, the airport accounts are relieved of air navigation charges, in keeping with procedures in other countries, the overall deficit becomes a surplus of about £24,000.</P>
    <P>The total number of passengers at Shannon Airport in 1967 increased by 19 per cent to 558,000; terminal traffic increased by 21 per cent.  Terminal traffic has been increasing steadily for some years and the drop in transit traffic was halted in 1967 when it too increased by 14 per cent to 144,000.  Total freight traffic at the airport amounted to 18,400 metric tons, an increase of 4 per cent over the 1966 total.  Terminal freight increased by 23 per cent to 8,500 metric tons.  The growth rate was maintained in 1968 when the total number of passengers increased by 29 per cent to 719,000; terminal traffic increased by 12 per cent to 462,600.  Total freight increased by 61 per cent to 29,700 metric tons while terminal freight increased by 30 per cent to 11,000 metric tons.</P>
    <P>In addition to Aerlínte, scheduled transatlantic services are operated to Shannon by Pan-American Airways, Trans-World Airlines, Air Canada, KLM (Royal Dutch Airlines), Air France and Seaboard World Airlines. In 1969 turn round flights will continue to be operated by Trans-World Airlines and Pan-American Airways as in previous years.</P>
    <P>The Aer Lingus services between Shannon and Belfast, London and Manchester continue to operate; British European Airways also operate on the Shannon-London route as in previous years.  A new service between Shannon and Dusseldorf was inaugurated in May, 1968.  The Shannon-Paris service has been discontinued as an alternative service at a higher frequency is being provided by Air France.</P>
    <P>The turnover of the Shannon Airport Sales and Catering Service for the year up to 31st January, 1968, was a record £2.36 million, an increase of £0.56 million on the previous year.  The total net profit for the year was £105,000 as compared with £62,000 in the previous year, when the first impact of the <Col N="1298" /> American Government restrictions on duty-free imports imposed in October, 1965, was experienced for a full year.</P>
    <P>The growth in traffic and the advent of the giant B747 aircraft will require fairly elaborate and costly works at Shannon.  The greatest need is extended passenger handling accommodation. Existing accommodation for customs clearance, check-in and catering needs is already fully taxed.  The additional accommodation required will be provided by the extension of the existing terminal complex to the west.  The extension will be in the form of a new arrivals and departure building of sufficient size to accommodate 1,500 arriving passengers and the same number of departing passengers at the one time.  A pier building parallel to the front of the extension will also be constructed.  This should take care of our needs in this area for a considerable number of years to come.  There will be provision for a further extension when traffic growth requires it. The arrival and departure areas of the existing building will be used to provide extended check-in and other facilities.  It is also proposed to provide a new catering block in which all airport and flight catering will be concentrated. Planning is at an advanced stage and work started in January of this year.  Considerable additional apron space will also be required. Other major works at present under consideration include the provision of additional taxiways, the extension and strengthening of a second runway suitable for use by future aircraft and the extension of the main runway.</P>
    <P>The total capital expenditure on Shannon Airport up to 31st March, 1968, amounted to about £6,405,000. For the year ended 31st March, 1968, total revenue at the airport was £1,344,000 and expenditure was £1,047,000, the operating surplus, therefore, being £297,000.  When allowance is made for depreciation and interest on capital expenditure, amounting to about £564,000, the overall deficit on the airport in 1967-68 was about £267,000.  If, however, the airport accounts are relieved of navigation charges, the overall deficit becomes a surplus of about £139,000.</P>
    <P>The conditions affecting traffic at <Col N="1299" /> Dublin Airport also affected Cork with the result that the pace of activity there slowed down.  Passenger traffic went up by 5 per cent to 167,700 but freight dropped 64 per cent to 760 metric tons.  In 1968 passenger traffic declined by 3 per cent to 163,000 while freight traffic also declined by 3 per cent to 740 metric tons.  Regular services are operated to Cork by Aer Lingus and Cambrian Airways.</P>
    <P>The total capital expenditure on Cork Airport up to 31st March, 1968, amounted to about £1,568,000.  For the year ended 31st March, 1968, total revenue at the airport was £118,000 and expenditure was £213,000, the operating deficit, therefore, being £95,000.  When allowance is made for depreciation and interest on capital expenditure amounting to about £137,000, the overall deficit on the airport in 1967-68 was about £232,000. If, however, the airport's accounts are relieved of air navigation charges, the overall deficit is reduced to about £128,000.</P>
    <P>There have been very few complaints of noise disturbance at the airports. All practical measures consistent with safe operation are taken to minimise this nuisance.  For instance at Dublin there are no scheduled flights by jet aircraft between approximately 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. and special noise abatement procedures are used where applicable.  Arrangements have also been made with the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards to measure noise levels at Dublin Airport and from these to obtain typical noise contours.  This information will be necessary for any further abatement procedures that may be devised.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the problem of sonic boom which may arise with the introduction in the near future of large passenger aircraft flying at supersonic speeds.  Legislation is in the course of preparation to restrict such flying over Irish territory.  It is proposed to introduce the legislation at the point where reports show that the boom would be obnoxious and inimical to the tranquillity of the Irish countryside. It will, of course, be difficult to enforce the restrictions provided for by law without full international co-operation. <Col N="1300" /> Accordingly, I have had the matter raised at international level.  I am glad to say that the International Civil Aviation Organisation at its assembly in Buenos Aires in September, 1968, accepted the resolution put forward jointly by Ireland and some other European countries in this matter. Briefly the resolution provides for action to achieve international agreement on common procedures for measurement and control to ensure that no unacceptable situations are created for the public.</P>
    <P>The provision for tourism takes the form of four grants-in-aid to Bord Fáilte Éireann under subheads F.1, F.2, F.3 and F.4.</P>
    <P>I am proposing that the provision under subhead F.1 for 1968-69 should be £3,100,000.  This grant-in-aid provides for the financing of all the activities of Bord Fáilte, except the specific grant schemes for the development of major tourist resorts and the development of holiday accommodation. Out of this main subhead, the board meet the cost of all their marketing activities including printed publicity, advertising, the operation of overseas offices and various promotional activities.  The subhead also covers the general expenses involved in the administration and operation of the board, including a wide range of activities such as improvements at minor resorts, the carrying out of various access and amenity works at national monuments and places of special interest, the provision of road amenities and signposting, the payment of interest grants on loans raised for accommodation and resort development, the promotion of angling, game shooting etc., and assistance for festivals and for special sporting and cultural attractions.  The provision under this subhead shows an increase of £542,000 over the total amount voted for 1967-68 (having taken account of a Supplementary Estimate voted in March, 1968) and this should enable Bord Fáilte to continue and intensify their programme for the development of the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>The moneys in subhead F.2 are used to finance the scheme for the development of major tourist resorts. <Col N="1301" /> As Deputies will be aware, the scheme is carried out in co-operation with the local authorities and local development interests, who must contribute at least 20 per cent of the cost of the development works.  The provision this year is £400,000 which, taking into account the reallocation of funds after the Supplementary Estimate taken in March, 1968, represents an increase of £150,000 on the amount issued under this subhead last year.  Under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1966, there is an overall limit of £3.25 million on the sums that can be expended on this scheme.  The allocation of £400,000 this year will bring total State expenditure up to 31st March, 1969, to nearly £1.9 million and this will have been accompanied by a further expenditure of about £650,000 by local authorities and local development bodies.</P>

The Transport Act, 1944, terminated the exemption in respect of a number of areas, including the area within a ten mile radius of the principal post office in Tralee, and made provision for the grant of merchandise licences to persons who had previously performed haulage for reward in those areas, to enable them to continue in their business.  The licences referred to by the Deputy were issued under the provision mentioned and authorise the holders to operate in the area in which they had lawfully operated in the prelicensing period.

      <P>I am aware that imported dried onion powder is used as a flavouring ingredient in potato crisps. The material is not liable to customs duty on importation.  The possibility of manufacturing onion powder in the country has been under consideration by one of the food processing firms but certain technical and commercial difficulties have been encountered.  I am, of course, in favour of encouraging the home manufacture of such powder if it can be shown to be a practicable proposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Dairy Disposal Company creamery referred to pays approximately the same price per lb. butterfat as the local co-operative creameries in its immediate neighbourhood.  The particular co-operative creamery which I think the Deputy has in mind is in a position to pay a somewhat higher price because <Col N="1306" /> of advantages of large-scale and diversified trading.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is an indefensible situation to have a semi-State body paying 5d a gallon less for milk than a co-operative creamery beside it?  Is the Minister aware that last May the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries met a deputation of farmers from the Knocklong area during the Easter byelection and assured them that he would take action, and that they would hear from him within a month? They have not since heard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree this is a very wide and complex question: the fact that some co-operatives by a process of amalgamation or otherwise are able to pay higher prices than other creameries, not necessarily the Dairy Disposal Company creameries alone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This particular Dairy Disposal Company creamery is paying a price which is in line with the other creameries in its immediate neighbourhood, but there is a problem I know &mdash;and the Deputy knows about it, too&mdash;that, because of the way the creamery industry is organised, some co-operative societies are able to pay some of their suppliers more than other co-operatives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Knocklong group is a perfect case&mdash;the Dairy Disposal Company group at Knocklong consists of eight creameries&mdash;for rationalisation and amalgamation, why do the Department not set an example to the rest of the co-operatives by starting to rationalise the situation at Knocklong?</P>

      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 25 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>The Mountjoy Aftercare Committee is one of a number of non-statutory bodies interested in the welfare of prisoners.  The Guild of St. Philip of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Protestant Prisoners' Aid Society are other bodies attached to Mountjoy Prison which look after the welfare of prisoners and their families and they are given annual State grants totalling £1,275 for this purpose.  There is also a statutory body, the visiting committee, which has wider functions in this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1316" /> The Mountjoy Aftercare Committee was established by the Minister for Justice in 1965 primarily for the purpose of finding employment for discharged prisoners.  The members held 11 meetings and found employment for six prisoners.  They have not been active since February, 1967.</P>
    <P>The committee made a number of recommendations in relation to prison administration, some of which were implemented, some of which were considered to be impracticable and some, again, which required detailed examination in consultation with other Government Departments.</P>
    <P>The rehabilitation of prisoners has been a matter in which I and my predecessors have taken a particular interest. In recent years a number of schemes directed towards that end have been introduced; for instance, a temporary release system was made possible by the enactment of legislation in 1960; a corrective training unit and hostel for prisoners on daily release to employment was set up in Mountjoy; prison welfare officers were appointed; a psychiatric unit was established in Mountjoy as well as a school for prisoners with low standards of education. Within the last year my Department has embarked on a new experiment in the field of rehabilitation when setting up in Shanganagh, County Dublin, a semi-open institution for selected offenders under 21.</P>
    <P>I am at present awaiting the report of an officer of my Department who was allocated last January to investigate and report on the present probation and prisoner after-care service with a view to its improvement.</P>
    <P>I have a warm appreciation of the good work done by the voluntary members of these committees and I hope, in the near future, to bring about a resumption of the after-care committee's activities.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister whether those who investigated this matter have enquired into the question of the provision of better workshops in St. Patrick's Institute where young persons are being instructed in manual crafts, in view of the fact that <Col N="1317" /> the existing workshops fall far below the standard that would be approved by the inspectors of the Department of Industry and Commerce?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice how many young people have been placed under the junior liaison officer scheme as a result of offences involving drugs; and what special qualifications or training these officers have for dealing with such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is none, so far.</P>
      <P>Juvenile liaison officers are members of the Garda Síochána.  They have not, and do not claim to have any special qualifications in relation to drug addiction. The treatment of drug addiction is a matter for qualified medical practitioners and the Garda Síochána could not undertake to make such treatment available for an addict just because he happens to come into conflict with the law.  They would, if the occasion arose, advise a young offender who otherwise qualified for admission to the juvenile liaison scheme as to how he could seek medical treatment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice how many cases involving drugs have been heard in the Dublin courts for the six months period ended 28th February, 1969; how many people were involved; and what medical or specialised advice was available to justices on the treatment of people convicted of drug taking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of cases in which proceedings were brought was 25 and the number of persons involved was 31.  I would point out, however, that an offence involving drugs does not necessarily mean that the offender is himself a drug addict or that he has used drugs.  It may be an offence of <Col N="1318" /> stealing drugs or peddling them and roughly half the cases mentioned were of this kind.</P>
      <P>Even if the accused person does require treatment for drug addiction this is not a function of the courts and, if drug addiction were adduced as an extenuating factor in a criminal case, the onus of satisfying the court on that point is primarily on the defendant.  If, however, the court decides, on its own initiative, that it requires a medical report to enable it to discharge its functions in the administration of justice, it may adjourn the case for a medical report, and this has happened on some occasions.</P>

      <P>I have, on a number of occasions, carefully, and indeed sympathetically, considered the matter referred to by the Deputy.  What is involved is a proposal to set aside by legislation contracts that were lawfully entered into and completed between private parties.  These contracts arose out of or in connection with court proceedings and I have no reason to think that they are other than legally binding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1319" /> In my considered opinion&mdash;as I stated in this House on 7th November, 1968 (Dáil Debates, Volume 236, No. 14, columns 2342 and 2343)&mdash;legislation to set aside such contracts could raise Constitutional difficulties.</P>
    <P>I do not propose in the legislation now being prepared to depart from the Landlord and Tenant Commission's recommendation concerning the contracts in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Functions can be transferred from one Department to another under section 6 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1939.  That section provides that the Government may, by order, transfer the administration and business of any particular public service or of any branch or part of it from one Department to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1320" /> I think it is fair to say that the public in general are already aware of each Department's main area of responsibilities, but it would be impossible to ensure that they knew about each Department's exact responsibilities, particularly in regard to questions that might rarely arise.  Naturally, if a service is transferred from one Department to another, the relevant order is published and an announcement about the change is made.</P>

      <P>In the past fortnight I have had a very full roundtable discussion on that matter with the officials of CIE who are concerned with the organisation of the school <Col N="1332" /> transport system.  We are trying to iron out certain anomalies.  We are costing the suggestion made by Deputy Harte and are preparing an overall costing also to iron out some of the anomalies in the present system.  I should like to assure the Deputy that this is a very costly matter, to put it mildly.  We are paying out substantial money in the current year, in the region of £2 million, for the present transport system.  Any enlargement of that in the present climate would be unrealistic. We are costing it to see precisely where we are.  Any enlargement such as suggested by the Deputy would be unrealistic in present circumstances, however desirable it might be.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 50 together. The College of Art has not reopened because of the continued refusal of the students to agree to attend classes.  I was prepared to set up a council for the college comprised of the director, five outside persons concerned with art teaching, three representatives of the teachers and three representatives of students.  I gave an assurance that any reasonable recommendation that the council might put forward would be implemented as soon as might be practicable. I also agreed to have student/ teacher committees equally composed of students and teachers associated with each of the schools in the college. When they speak of an executive committee the students ignore the fact that under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, I am responsible to this House for the affairs of the college and also that the secretary of my Department is accountable to the Public Accounts Committee for the moneys expended in the running of the college. I cannot divest myself of my responsibility pending the introduction of legislation which I propose to introduce establishing an autonomous board to govern the college.  I feel that in all the circumstances the proposals I have put forward are very reasonable.</P>

I am now preparing legislation designed to divest myself of this control but this cannot be done overnight.  Legislation must take its due course through both Houses of the Oireachtas before it becomes law.  In the meantime we propose to set up an advisory council manned in such a way, as I said earlier, to give students equal representation with teachers. This council would be directly responsible to me in the interim period pending the legislation which will divest me and the Department of Education of the control of the College of Art.  I might say that I am meeting the students again at 4 o'clock to try to get this very elementary message home to them.</P>

This is not, however, a matter which could be considered in relation to any one group of persons superannuated from public funds without reference to other groups of retired State servants.</P>

      <P>A claim for disability benefit under the Social Welfare Acts was received from the person named by the Deputy in November, 1968.  As he is not entitled to benefit on his insurance record in this country, because no insurance contributions were paid in respect of him during 1967, the governing contribution year, when he was employed in England, the British authorities were requested, on receipt of his claim, to transfer, in accordance with a reciprocal agreement, the necessary British contributions paid in respect of him for the year in question.  However, despite repeated reminders they have not yet been received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that the British authorities have so far been unable to identify his record due to wrong particulars, including <Col N="1342" /> a wrong date of birth, having been given by the person concerned, and to the fact that in response to their inquiries to enable them to establish his record he has given vague and inadequate particulars of his employers in Britain.</P>

      <P>The evidence available to me is that adequate supplies of land drainage pipes can be procured from Irish manufacturers.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that there is at least six weeks delay in the supply of those tiles.  Would the Minister make inquiries to check whether that is true or not?  My information also is that the cost of transport in relation to them is so enormous that further consideration might be given to giving a temporary licence to allow the importation of such land tiles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The information available here is that the production of pipes in this country amounts to 25 million a year against a home market <Col N="1347" /> usage of 14 million a year and any delays which occur are due to haphazard ordering, that consultations have been going on between the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries with a view to trying to get a more ordered approach to supplies by the principal firms concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate the interest the Minister has taken but my information is that there is at least six weeks delay in the supply of those tiles. The information comes from the committee of agriculture who are very much alive to the difficulties involved. They also bring out the point that the cost of transport from the nearest manufacturing firm in the Republic increases the cost of those tiles beyond recognition.  I understand there could be a reciprocal agreement whereby people on the eastern seaboard might be able to export to Northern Ireland if Donegal were allowed get those pipes from Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if it is his intention to amend the regulation which in effect operates against the agricultural community by departing from the usual basis of assessment of farmers' eligibility for health reliefs, viz.  valuation of land, and in this case making land and buildings the basis, thus depriving hundreds of farmers of any benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The rateable valuation on which farmers' eligibility to hospital and specialist services and certain other services has been assessed <Col N="1349" /> has included both land and buildings since the definition of the middle income group was first made in 1953. Since 1st April, 1966, farmers with valuations of land and buildings up to £60 have been eligible for these services and it is estimated that about 87 per cent of them are now eligible.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the operation of this existing provision has unreasonably excluded farmers from the services, but an opportunity to discuss the formula will arise on the Health Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have found from my experience with the health authorities that this particular section of the Bill has interfered very seriously with farmers getting their just rights.  It does not occur in any other social service where a farmer's income is generally assessed on his valuation but in this case it is assessed on land and buildings. I suggest it should be the same thing with the lawyers and the professional gentlemen who will find no one at all qualifies.  I am putting that fairly. In my opinion it is a matter which the Minister should guarantee he will remedy when he brings in his new Health Bill.  Otherwise we will have to propose amendments to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the backlog of persons in County Sligo who are awaiting dental treatment from the health authority is the shortage of dental staff.  The health authority has an approved complement of two wholetime dental posts, one of which has been vacant for a considerable time.  Notwithstanding the improved conditions of service for public dental officers, approved by me since January, 1968, efforts to fill the vacant post in County Sligo, on a temporary or permanent basis, have not been successful so far.

      <P>As there is only a small number of orthodontists in practice in this country, most health authorities, including the Sligo County Council, must rely on the Dublin Dental Hospital to carry out specialist orthodontic work for children referred under the school dental service.  I am aware that the overall waiting list for the Dental Hospital is considerable but I understand that the hospital reviews, from time to time, the cases on the waiting list, having regard to the urgency of their need for treatment.</P>

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31st March, 1969, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Transport and Power including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>When progress was reported I was dealing with the amount provided for under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1966, for resort development. The amount was £3.25 million.  I <Col N="1371" /> had pointed out that the total State expenditure up to 31st March, 1969, was £1.9 million and that this will be accompanied by a further expenditure of £650,000 by local authorities and local development bodies.  This expenditure was incurred under the first resort development programme. Counting expenditure by the State and by local authorities and local development bodies the complete programme will cost nearly £4.5 million.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte are already planning a second resort development programme. That proposed programme will concentrate on the development of tourist areas with focal points rather than on specific resorts.  The idea is that within each area development works will be carried out on facilities designed in particular to suit the needs of mobile visitors, e.g., access roads to shores, forest parks, national monuments.  At the focal points in the selected areas action will be taken to provide facilities for indoor recreation and entertainment to supplement national and traditional attractions.</P>
      <P>Under subhead F.3 I am proposing a provision of £800,000, which is an increase of £100,000 on the amount provided in 1967-68.  This grant-in-aid provides funds to enable Bord Fáilte to give grants for the development of holiday accommodation.  The expenditure of this sum would bring total expenditure on holiday accommodation grants above the £3 million statutory limit laid down in 1966 and accordingly the limit was raised to £5.5 million by the Tourist Traffic Act, 1968.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase of £100,000 under this subhead is attributable to the increased incentives for the development of holiday accommodation which I authorised Bord Fáilte to provide last year.  The increased incentives have generated a substantial increase in investment in additional hotel accommodation. In 1967 there was a net increase of almost 1,300 bedrooms in registered accommodation.  During 1968, 38 new hotels having 737 bedrooms came into operation.  By the 1969 season a further ten hotels having 533 bedrooms are expected to be ready.  The total capital investment <Col N="1372" /> involved in the 48 hotels is £4 million.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte have complete discretion within certain specified maxima in administering the grant schemes so as to influence the type and location of new accommodation according to criteria based on tourist requirements. It is Bord Fáilte's policy to encourage developers to provide a range of holiday accommodation to cater for visitors of all income brackets.</P>
    <P>The amount which I am proposing to provide under subhead F.4 is £100,000 which is the same as was provided in 1967/68 when this grant-in-aid was introduced.  The purpose of this provision is to enable Bord Fáilte to give grants to assist the development of houses for holiday letting and the provision of supplementary holiday accommodation in private houses including farmhouses, in the western counties. Grants up to 66? per cent of the approved cost subject to a maximum of £500 are provided from this grant-in-aid.</P>
    <P>The total amount which it is proposed to provide for tourism under the four Subheads I have mentioned is £4,400,000, an increase of £792,000 on the amount provided last year.  I am satisfied that the increased expenditure is justified by the growth of tourist earnings over the past six or seven years and the prospects for further expansion in the future.</P>
    <P>Earnings from tourism in 1967 amounted to £84.3 million which represented an increase of £6.6 million or 8.5 per cent on the 1966 receipts.  Since 1960 when receipts amounted to £44.2 million tourist income has increased on average by 5.5 per cent a year at constant 1960 money values.</P>
    <P>The Central Statistics Office has not yet compiled the official estimate of earnings from tourism in 1968.  According to an unofficial estimate prepared by Bord Fáilte these earnings amounted to £92.5 million in 1968 which represents an increase of £8.2 million or about 10 per cent on the 1967 figure. If the Bord Fáilte estimate is confirmed by the official estimate the 1968 income figure will be very encouraging as our tourist industry encountered a number of obstacles last year.  These were the foot-and-mouth restrictions on travel <Col N="1373" /> from Britain, the restrictions on travel abroad by French residents and the threat of restrictions on travel abroad by the U.S. authorities.</P>
    <P>Tourism represents our largest single export and accounts for more than onesixth of our total overseas earnings.  It plays a more important part in our national balance of payments than in the case of all other European countries with the exception of Spain and Austria.</P>
    <P>Apart from its value as an earner of foreign currency, tourism is an important generator of economic activity within the country and in export terms is a most efficient method of selling Irish goods and services.  This is of particular importance to a country with a surplus of agricultural products such as milk, butter, meat and eggs.  Tourist traffic is generally attracted to less developed areas and thus helps to reverse the general trend in the flow of economic activity to large centres of population. Moreover, the diffusion of benefits throughout the country results in the greater spread of investment in tourist plant and facilities and encourages local authorities to extend their services in areas and to an extent that might not otherwise be justified.</P>
    <P>Important changes are taking place in the concepts of Irish tourism.  One trend which is already most evident is the increase in the number of motoring tourists resulting from the growth of car ownership and the development of modern car ferry vessels.  It is expected that the mobile tourist will form a growing part of total traffic and will create new demands on accommodation, services and facilities.  The increased mobility of tourists is helping to make the whole of Ireland a single tourist area.  Particular attention is being given by Bord Fáilte to the accommodation needs of motoring visitors.  The board are encouraging investors to provide motor inns or hotels offering medium range prices with the particular needs of motoring tourists in mind.</P>
    <P>Traffic on car ferry services continues to expand.  An idea of the tremendous growth which is taking place can be obtained from the fact that <Col N="1374" /> this traffic has doubled in the last two years.  In 1968 92,000 cars were brought into the State on ferry services.  This represented an increase of 36 per cent on the 1967 figure.  Two additional car ferry services were introduced in 1968. These were the Dublin-Liverpool service operated by the British and Irish Steampacket Co. Ltd., and the Rosslare-Le Havre service operated by Normandy Ferries in which Irish Shipping Limited, is a partner.  This year capacity will be increased on the existing Dublin-Liverpool, Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead, Rosslare-Fishguard and Rosslare-Le Havre service. Next May the B and I will introduce a drive-on-drive-off ferry service between Cork and Swansea.  This will give Cork its first service of this type and help to develop still further the tourist potential of the South and South West.  Bord Fáilte estimate that car ferry traffic will continue to grow and they estimate that by 1972 the number of cars entering through our car ferry ports will amount to 170,000. In addition an estimated 100,000 crosschannel cars entering through Northern Ireland are expected to cross the Border.  On the basis of an average of three persons per car, the number of motoring visitors should reach a figure of 800,000 by 1972.</P>
    <P>Another development is that tourists will tend to be younger, more affluent and better educated.  They will want to participate rather than observe and this will increase the demand for active recreationary holidays.  Parallel with these trends is the progressive development of inclusive charge holidays already playing an important part in attracting additional tourist traffic to Ireland.</P>
    <P>A major obstacle to the growth of tourism is the shortness of the tourist season.  This characteristic has serious adverse effects because it means that much of the employment given is seasonal and this reacts on the attractiveness of employment in the industry. It means also that costly tourist plant such as hotels, transport equipment and facilities and resort installations are under-utilised with adverse effects on the attractiveness of investment and <Col N="1375" /> on prices which must be charged when in use.</P>
    <P>Efforts to extend the season have included the promotion of angling and shooting, the encouragement of festivals and special events, the development of conference business, special early and late season price incentives and the replacement of the Whit Monday holiday by the fixed June Holiday which takes place on the first Monday in June.  The season in most areas is now much longer than it was five years ago but seasonality still remains a serious problem.</P>
    <P>The further extension of the season, leading ultimately to year-round tourism, will be a major objective for the next few years and Bord Fáilte have already embarked on a marketing programme with this in view.  A significant extension of the season would have far reaching economic benefits for all tourist enterprises and would provide increased year-round employment not only for hotel and guesthouse staffs but for all those concerned with the servicing of such establishments.</P>
    <P>The eight regional tourism organisations are now firmly established and are providing tourist information and room reservation services through 100 offices throughout the country.  It is intended that the organisations should extend their activities by providing encouragement and support to enterprises offering recreation, entertainment and other services for visitors at local level. The additional responsibilities of the regional organisations will entail considerably increased expenditure and efforts are being made to ensure that this expenditure will be financed by contributions from the business community. For enterprises which benefit directly or indirectly from tourist income, support for the regional organisations represents a sound investment.</P>
    <P>In relation to north-south co-operation in tourism matters Bord Fáilte continued their discussions with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and the British Travel Association.  The tripartite meetings have led to co-operation and joint effort in such fields as publicity, sales campaigns, research, <Col N="1376" /> statistics, sponsored tours by visiting travel agents and journalists.  The three bodies have between them produced two brochures for the purpose of the joint promotion of Ireland and Britain in the United States and Canada.</P>
    <P>While the position of our tourist industry is encouraging and the indications are that the industry will continue to grow I must issue a warning that tourism does not grow of its own volition. Ireland is not the only country in which tourism is flourishing and other nations are deeply aware of the great economic advantages of the industry. International competition for tourist business is growing.  My advice to travel agents, hoteliers, transport undertakings and all persons and bodies connected with the tourist trade is to adopt a &ldquo;go and get it&rdquo; approach rather than &ldquo;sit and wait&rdquo; for business.</P>
    <P>The continuing increase in the demand for electricity was accelerated in 1967-68, total output at 4,246 million units, being over 10 per cent greater than 1966-67, which had shown an increase of less than 9 per cent over the preceding year.  This, of course, reflects growing economic activity in the country and higher living standards generally.  In fact, industrial demand showed the highest rate of increase, 13.7 per cent as compared with 10.6 per cent the previous year.  The overall peak demand was 917 megawatts compared with 886 megawatts in 1966-67.</P>
    <P>The ESB's long-term programme of generating plant construction is related to an average annual increase in demand of 9 per cent but the programme is, of course, kept under constant review in the light of the trend of demand.  The board's generating capacity at 31st March, 1968, was 1,230 MW.  Since then 30 MW of old plant at the Pigeon House has been retired and 60 MW of new plant has been added at Great Island.  The Board's construction programme for the period up to 1974-75 provides for the addition of another 788 MW of new capacity.  The programme includes 480 MW conventional thermal capacity, and two 14 MW gas turbine generating units which will be in commission in Pigeon House &ldquo;B&rdquo; by <Col N="1377" /> 1972.  These units will contribute to the security of the supply and will be available to meet peak loads.  The pumped storage scheme at Lough Nahanagan, County Wicklow, to which I referred when introducing last year's estimates, is scheduled for completion by 1974-75.  By that time, allowing for the retirement of a further 60 MW of old plant at the Pigeon House, total installed capacity will be 1,988 MW. Work on the north-south inter-connection, which will make a substantial contribution to plant economy, is proceeding and the scheduled commissioning date is 1971.</P>
    <P>The amount to be voted this year for repayment of the subsidy advanced from the Central Fund for rural electrification is £801,000.</P>
    <P>During 1967-68 a total of 8,075 new rural consumers were connected compared with 4,742 in the preceding year. At 31st March, 1968 about 87 per cent or 334,000 rural homes were connected.</P>
    <P>Because of the high cost of connection the ESB had to quote very high special service charges to some rural householders seeking connection.  The Government&mdash;concerned that, within practical limits, electricity is available to the maximum number at reasonable charges&mdash;reviewed the situation last year and arranged that the higher special service charges would be reduced. The reductions benefit all those who, on the basis of previous charges, were liable for special service charges of more than 50 per cent of the normal charges benefit.</P>
    <P>There may be some householders, however, in areas isolated from the board's network who will consider even the reduced charges still too high.  For those people I have increased the subsidy for the installation of bottled gas to £35.  The former subsidy of £10 was intended to provide only a basic installation; the higher subsidy will pay for a more complete installation.  It is available to all whose special service charges for electricity under the revised terms would still be more than the normal charges.</P>
    <P>The Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1968 authorised the increase to £50 million of the former limit of <Col N="1378" /> £42 million on the expenditure which the board may incur on extending electricity to rural areas.  The increase of the limit to £50 million was to enable the board to complete the rural electrification post-development scheme, and, also, to go back over the areas already covered by the post-development scheme, so that all householders would have an opportunity of taking supply at the improved terms.  It was expected that this would take until 1973.  The improved terms have, however, proved very popular and many more householders than had been expected are now taking supply.</P>
    <P>The ESB are doing their utmost to cope with the increased demand.  They have increased their budget for rural electrification and have also increased their rate of connection but, even so, the progress of the scheme, in terms of areas completed, is now behind schedule.  The scheme will be completed in most of the board's districts by 1973 but there will be some districts where completion of the scheme will take longer.  The £50 million limit to which I referred earlier will also be inadequate and the question of amending legislation will arise in the next few years.</P>
    <P>The total fixed capital invested by the board at 31st March, 1968, was in the region of £190 million of which £41 million was in rural electrification. The ESB's spring stock issue in 1968, for £7 million 7¼ per cent at 98, was again very successful.</P>
    <P>There were a number of strikes in the ESB during the year but as labour relations are a matter for the Minister for Labour, discussion would not be appropriate.  I should mention, though, that the interim report of the committee on industrial relations in the board, which the Minister for Labour set up, is being carefully examined.</P>
    <P>Weather conditions during the 1967/68 season, although a considerable improvement on recent years, were still unfavourable for Bord na Móna operations.  While target production figures were not achieved, total production was nevertheless higher than in any previous year.  Milled peat production, at about 2,500,000 tons, was 500,000 tons up on the previous year <Col N="1379" /> but about 11 per cent below the target. Sod turf production, 870,000 tons, was up about 120,000 tons on the previous year but was still about 2 per cent below target.  Briquette production was almost 250,000 tons, a slight increase on last year, but 21 per cent short of target.  Moss peat production, at over 470,000 tons, although an increase of nearly 40,000 tons on 1966/67, was 12 per cent below target.  Production of briquettes and moss peat was adversely affected by labour stoppages during the year.  The overall level of sales was also affected by the labour stoppages&mdash;loss of sales is estimated by the board at about 12 per cent in the case of sod turf and 15 per cent in the case of briquettes.</P>
    <P>In the year 1967-68, Bord na Móna had a loss of £821,744.  The accumulated losses of the board at 31st March, 1968, amounted to just over £4.8 million, the general reserve of £120,000 having being transferred to the profit and loss account in reduction of the accumulated deficit.  Two changes in accounting practice had the effect of reducing the year's deficit by over £½ million&mdash;if treated in the manner hitherto adopted, the 1967-68 losses would be almost £1.4 million and the accumulated deficit nearly £5.4 million.</P>
    <P>As a result of accumulating losses Bord na Móna have been unable, since the 1st April, 1967, to meet their obligations for interest on and repayment of State advanced capital.  The total amount outstanding at 1st October, 1968, was about £3½ million. In the case of loan capital raised by the board from sources other than the State, the board have, of course, continued to meet their obligations in full.</P>
    <P>In view of the heavy and continuing losses suffered by the board during most of the last decade, I thought it very necessary to have a new and searching look at the overall operations of the board, and I arranged for the appointment of a firm of consultants to examine the turf production programme both from the engineering and financial standpoints, and to assess the likely results of future operations.  While Bord na Móna have <Col N="1380" /> themselves employed consultants on various occasions to examine and report on different facets of their operations, the new investigation will be concerned with the totality of the board's operations.  When the results of this investigation are available it should be possible to decide on the most appropriate financial structure of the board for future years and so ensure the continuation of the board's activities on a sound basis and preserve employment and other benefits in areas which otherwise provide very few opportunities.</P>
    <P>However, some immediate financial relief for Bord na Móna in their present financial difficulties was essential and, to this end, the Turf Development Act, 1968, was enacted by the Oireachtas just before the summer recess.  The Act empowers the Minister for Finance by order, to waive, in whole or in part, payments of interest due for four years from 1st April, 1967, and to defer, in whole or in part, repayments of capital due during the same period.  The Minister for Finance is to take a decision on the extent of the relief in respect of each year after examination of the board's financial position and consultation with me.  As a result of an examination of the board's financial position it was decided to waive interest, amounting to £2½ million approximately, due by Bord na Móna to the Minister for Finance in respect of the years 1967/68 and 1968/69 and to defer to 31st March, 1969 repayments of capital&mdash;amounting to over £900,000&mdash;in respect of the years 1967/ 68 and 1968/69.</P>
    <P>The necessary Order entitled Bord na Móna (Waiver of Interest and Deferment of Repayment of Advances) Order, 1968, has been made by the Minister for Finance.  The financial relief envisaged by the Act is designed to give Bord na Móna some breathing space during the period while the consultants are carrying out their investigations and their report is being examined.</P>
    <P>On a brighter note, the weather conditions during the 1969 harvesting season were the most favourable experienced in the present decade, <Col N="1381" /> especially for milled peat production. Sod peat production exceeded the target of 892,000 tons by 15,000 tons. Milled peat and &ldquo;Fóidín&rdquo; turf production together yielded 3.65 million tons compared with a target of 2.8 million tons.  Fóidín production alone amounted to 294,000 tons.  The Fóidín system&mdash;a new method of milled peat production which I described in my speech on last year's estimates&mdash;is still on a development basis.</P>
    <P>Coal consumption in 1967 in terms of net imports plus home production was about 1.4 million tons.  This was about 100,000 tons less than in 1966. The lower consumption may have been due to less severe weather, but there is, of course, a general trend away from solid fuel.  The consumption of anthracite was about 155,000 tons, of which about 65,000 tons had to be met by imports.  The ESB, with an intake of 44,000 tons, continued to absorb the bulk of the production of semibituminous coal in the Arigna Coalfield during 1967.</P>
    <P>The fact that this country is very much dependent on imported fuel makes it important from the point of view of the national economy to ensure that it is used efficiently, particularly in industry.  For some years past my Department have been operating a scheme under which grants of 50 per cent are payable towards the cost of engaging consultants to survey industrial boiler plants with a view to improving their performance.  At the end of 1968 grants amounting to £24,000 had been approved for 107 surveys.  I am satisfied that these surveys are producing worthwhile results and I am most anxious to have an increase in the number of firms participating in the scheme.</P>
    <P>Consumption of energy in this country continues to increase.  In terms of coal equivalent, primary energy consumption in 1967 was about 7½ million tons.  While native energy sources (coal, peat and hydro power) are exploited as far as possible, they cover a steadily diminishing proportion of our total energy requirements leading to an increasing dependence on imported fuels.  This trend was <Col N="1382" /> again evident in 1967 when imports of oil accounted for 51 per cent of our total energy requirements.</P>
    <P>The time has not yet come when a nuclear electricity generating plant would be economical in our circumstances. Our increasing dependence on imported oil for electricity generation, however, makes it desirable that we should consider nuclear plant as soon as possible.  The ESB are fully alert to this situation and are having a number of their engineers trained abroad in the skills required for the planning and operation of nuclear power plants.</P>
    <P>I hope to introduce a Bill shortly which will empower me to set up a board which will keep itself informed and be a source of advice on the implications for this country of developments generally in the nuclear field.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that, where there is a Department such as Transport and Power covering such a wide field, the Minister need not have taken upon himself the onerous task of reading a speech of 50 pages in length. This is not to criticise the Minister in any way, but in the circumstances we could have had, perhaps, a more voluminous circulation of notes on the activities of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intended to deal with something which I regard as of such paramount importance and which brings such discredit upon the Government that it should be dealt with first.  I propose to prove&mdash;and I use the word &ldquo;prove&rdquo; deliberately&mdash;that the likelihood is that the Government will lose in harbour and tonnage dues at Whiddy Island £1 million a year by not creating a port authority.  I must go into some detail to acquaint the House with what exactly the position is.  Six tankers of 312,000 tons each have been delivering crude oil to Whiddy Island.  It will be seen from a magazine which is circulated by the principal oil companies of the world that there will not be very heavy employment at Whiddy, but we must ensure that whatever employment is there for Irish nationals will be safeguarded. Let no one from the Government Benches say that anybody on this side of the House is rocking the boat. I wish to quote&mdash;and I shall give the <Col N="1383" /> exact reference because this is an important publication&mdash;from the <i>Petrol Times</i> of November 22nd.  This is a magazine printed in London and New York.  It has operated since 1899 and is the official news bulletin of the Oil Industry International.  At page 1716 of this magazine Mr. P. B. Binsted, world-wide co-ordinator, transportation, Gulf Oil Corporation, said at the Europoort 1968 Congress in Amsterdam on November 13th:</P>
    <P>Bantry Bay is one of the only two places in the world at present able to take fully laden 312,000 d.w. ton tankers.  The other is Kuwait, where a completely new off-shore loading facility had to be added to the existing tanker berthing arrangements of the Kuwait Oil Co.  This port expansion project in Kuwait was an extremely vital link of the whole Bantry transhipment operation, although it should be noted that KOC was in need of enlarged port facilities in any case.</P>
    <P>The new loading facility at the Middle East end consisted of a seaisland terminal located nearly ten miles from the Kuwait coast.  Crude oil is pumped from shore to tanker through a 48 in. diameter submarine pipeline&mdash;the largest-diameter ocean submarine line in the world.  The main feature of the off-shore terminal is a central island formed by a jackup barge which was constructed by the Hellenic Shipyards Co. in Greece.</P>
    <P>The House will understand that, in order to accommodate these tankers in two places, it was necessary to create an artificial island ten miles out to sea at Kuwait and from thence to pump the oil out in what is described as the largest-diameter submarine oil pipeline in the world&mdash;a 48-inch pipeline. Imagination boggles, to use the words of P. G. Wodehouse, at the expense involved.  Nobody knows how many millions were spent.  But let us consider how many millions have been spent by the Gulf Oil Co. and others on this project.  I will quote again from page 1715 of the same magazine:</P>
    <P>Gulf claims the transportion cost via Bantry Bay is only half that in 50,000 tonners by Suez both ways.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1384" /> A very real advantage, therefore, has been gained by the Gulf Oil Company.</P>
    <P>I shall deal now with the employment angle.  I want to emphasise that this side of the House is delighted with the development at Whiddy and rejoices in the fact that there will be employment there permanently when construction is finished.  According to the <i>Petroleum Times</i>, page 1715:</P>
    <P>After the construction phase is over, the terminal provides employment for, at the most, 150 indigenous people.  (One can count 48 permanent staff on the terminal, 24 on the tug-boats and 14 on stand-by.)</P>
    <P>Moreover, Gulf raised the capital without giving any opportunity for Irish participation.  There is therefore no return on local investment. In particular, there is no harbour authority and Gulf is not paying any port dues.  (The relevance of such dues was seen at Antwerp when the question of a pipeline from Rotterdam was under discussion.)  In the face of local resentment over the absence of a harbour authority, Gulf concedes its willingness to accept if the government should decide to have one set up.</P>
    <P>In other words, there is a complete concession here and, if the Government decides to set up a harbour authority, that harbour authority can collect port and tonnage dues.  Let us consider the revenue that could be collected if a harbour authority were set up at Whiddy on a full-scale operation by Gulf Oil.  Six tankers are being constructed.  Two have already been delivered.  Each can make six trips per year.  They can enter any other port in the world only two-thirds laden.  I propose to deal with the counterpart port in Britain, Milford Haven, at a later stage.  Other oil companies had to put money into Milford Haven but they still pay port dues.  The Minister was good enough to write to me after I tabled a Parliamentary Question giving me the gross tonnage of 149,608 tons and the net registered tonnage of 128,257 tons.  I understand tonnage dues are charged on the net tonnage. That means that we have a ship of 128,257 net registered tons arriving six times a year.  Now there will be <Col N="1385" /> six ships altogether, so we multiply that figure by six.  I accept the Minister's statement that where goods are imported here and re-exported without processing we do not charge port and tonnage dues, so I am merely taking the port and tonnage dues on the way in.  Taking a figure of 1/6d per ton, which is the lowest figure I could get in the reply the Minister gave me on 21st November, the revenue on the six ships six times per year would amount to £346,509.  On the crude oil itself, again taking the lowest figure given in the Minister's reply, the revenue would be £702,000.  That means that, if these six tankers run to Whiddy all of their time&mdash;they are constructed so to do and can enter any other port in the world only two-thirds laden which, when one travels 11,000 miles, represents a loss of delivery of 100,000 tons of crude oil per tanker, which is most unlikely to happen&mdash;the revenue, at the figures quoted by the Minister to me, if a port authority were set up at Whiddy, would be £1,048,509.  To quote the Minister&mdash;not in any derogatory fashion&mdash;no one could call that nugatory.</P>

      <P>I believe that is what it does mean.  I must now refer the House to what has been done in other places.  I quote from another technical magazine, <i>The Engineer</i>, of 24th January, 1969.  At page 125, referring to the dredging project at Milford Haven, the following appears:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, which is already Britain's principal port for oil tankers of up to 175,000 tons, is being developed to permit its regular use by 250,000 ton tankers, and even larger vessels when the tides are favourable. Total cost of the scheme is about £12 million which is to be shared equally between the Milford Haven Conservancy Board, and three international oil companies (B.P., Esso Petroleum and Texaco).  These companies possess extensive facilities at Milford Haven, and also have on order or under construction <Col N="1386" /> a substantial number of vessels in the 220,000 to 255,000 ton deadweight category.</P>
    <P>Ministry of Transport approval of the scheme was announced by Milford Haven Conservancy Board on 10 January at the same time as the letting of a contract for approximately £5 million for dredging work which is to begin shortly and is to be completed by the end of 1970.  Fully-laden tankers with a draught of 63 ft. (19.2 m), representing a deadweight tonnage of the order of 255,000 to 275,000 tons, will then be able to enter and berth on every tide throughout the year.</P>
    <P>We, without going ten miles out to sea, were able to provide here for vessels with a draught of 90 feet.  It had at the lowest stage of the lowest tide 100 feet of deep water.  We are throwing away £1 million worth of harbour dues. These are the facts of the case and I intend to develop the position a little bit further.</P>
    <P>We have had pollution.  It is axiomatic that if you have large oil installations you will have some degree of pollution.  No means of dispersing oil in sea water has yet been found which is not, at the same time, absolutely fatal to marine life.  I can quote from the same magazine here, and I quote from page 1723 of the <i>Petroleum Times:</i></P>
    <P>A sufficient supply of detergent will be maintained at the terminal to attack at least ten spillages, each averaging 100 barrels of oil.  The detergent employed is BP1002, which has been used with great effect at Kuwait and Milford Haven.</P>
    <P>I do not want to weary anyone with the rest of the details in relation to their plans on pollution, but pollution there will be, and pollution there has been, and I quote now from the <i>Irish Times</i> of Saturday, March 1st:</P>
    <P>Gulf Oil Terminals (Ireland) Ltd. was fined £250 at Bantry Court yesterday for discharging oil into the sea at the installation at Whiddy Island on Christmas Day.</P>
    <P>The company was charged by the Minister for Transport and Power <Col N="1387" /> under the Oil Pollution of Sea Act, 1956.</P>
    <P>A similar summons in respect of the following day was marked proved.</P>
    <P>It was stated for the company that the cost of a clean up of the oil and compensation to those who had suffered damage as a result came to £30,000.</P>
    <P>I am looking at a map of Bantry Bay and right opposite Whiddy Island is the word &ldquo;Glengarriff&rdquo;.  When you finish saying Killarney in Ireland, you start saying Glengarriff.  I know you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs.  We have no objection to the installation being there, but we want to make something quite clear.  You cannot get away without pollution, and you cannot disperse oil in sea water except by using detergents which destroy marine life.  I now draw the attention of the House to other words: Berehaven, Bere Island, Dunbeg, Bantry.  These are places we know and we may as well take it that we have broken the eggs and made the omelette, and that any fishing in Bantry Bay this day five years is out, that marine life will be entirely destroyed.</P>
    <P>A marine biologist was sent down to make a report from Trinity College, Dublin.  I seem to have mislaid the report of what she said.  It is quoted in the <i>Irish Times</i> and I am sure that anyone who is sufficiently interested will find it without much trouble.  She said there was no question but that all marine life in and around Whiddy Island and up Bantry Bay would be destroyed if detergents were used to disperse sea water which had become polluted with oil.</P>
    <P>My plea to the Government is quite simple.  If I have shown that the three other major oil companies are subscribing £6 million to a £12 million development in the port of Milford Haven, to get roughly two-thirds the facilities that we had to give, should we not create a port authority and collect the dues?  When the Gulf Oil Company themselves, as reported in the bestknown international magazine relating to their interests, say they have no <Col N="1388" /> objection to the creation of a port authority I think the case stands proved.  I do not want to go into any more detail on it.  If it is proved, then it is up to the Government to take their decision and create a port authority and collect the dues, even more so because of the fact that this whole scheme was heralded in here by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>It was the Taoiseach himself who went to the launching of <i>Universe Ireland</i> and blessed, if you like, the whole project with his name and his standing.  I am not criticising him.  I am not saying there is anything wrong in that.  The propriety of his going anywhere in his position at the invitation of a commercial firm has been questioned by some of my colleagues&mdash;for more than lunch or something like that. I am not criticising him on that point at all.  We may as well face the fact, as the people in the <i>Petroleum Times</i> said in their article that it resulted in &ldquo;the greatest public relations junket Ireland has seen since President Kennedy's visit&rdquo;.  There has not been a word about it since.  The Minister talked about oil pollution today but, in relation to the tonnages passing through, in relation to the development, and what we were getting out of it, there was not one word in a speech of 50 pages.</P>
    <P>I want to say seriously to the House that this Government have been negligent in carrying out their duty. The Minister and the Taoiseach have been involved, and there is a duty upon them now to correct their error, create a port authority in Bantry Bay, and collect the port dues that this country is so well entitled to, when the Gulf Oil Company have said themselves that by this development they have halved the cost of transportation via Suez.  No one can say that I have been demanding, or vicious, or hypercritical in presenting this case.  I regard the case as strong enough to stand up to anyone's examination and to show for itself that the Government have been gravely negligent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  The tonnage handled in the various harbours all over the country, now that we are on harbours, seems to be following the trend of the past number of years. There are ports like Galway, Cork and Drogheda moving up.  There was a big drop down some years ago when they lost one particular traffic.  Other ports are unfortunately moving down.  Dublin is moving up at the same time.  The increase of two million tons in our trading is something we welcome because a lot of it is raw material for industry going out again in a processed form.  But we feel that more could possibly be done in relation to the smaller harbours and to their advantage because, as road transport becomes daily more efficient, you could very easily find a harbour becoming uneconomic when, if something had been done about it, and it had been dealt with quite early on, then it would not be uneconomic.</P>
      <P>The rural electrification scheme is proceeding and I am very glad to see the Minister has increased the subsidy for gas for those who cannot have electricity from £10 to £35.  That is fair, because £10 bought nothing but a cylinder and perhaps a small cooker, whereas £35 will produce some lights around the house as well.</P>
      <P>The north-south ESB inter-connection is something we all welcome.  If we can get profit or a decrease in costs by co-operating industrially with the North of Ireland, perhaps better things might come as well from other alliances with them.  I was a bit bemused by the Minister's statement that for the cutting of turf the &ldquo;weather conditions during the 1967-68 season, although a considerable improvement on recent years, were still unfavourable for Bord na Móna operations&rdquo;.  That just could not be.  I am not criticising turf cutting or Bord na Móna.</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  I thought it was 1968-69.  I knew there was something wrong.  I hope that 1968-69 will produce a much better result.  I would appeal to the Minister, then, on tourism to think about the small resorts.  As I understand the situation, the eastern regional tourism organisation, which is the one I have to deal with, is awaiting, among all the other tourist organisations, reports from the various areas as to where they should develop, and that sort of thing, and, as far as I know, all the money was gathered in 1969 and we are now ready to move again on projects.</P>
      <P>I would appeal for places such as are in my constituency&mdash;places like Carlingford, Omeath, Clogherhead &mdash; and, then, if I leave my constituency, places like Bettystown, Laytown and the smaller places because these places are now fitting in very well with the Bord Fáilte programme and the system of guesthouses whereby we have got our little caravan or we have our tourist office and nobody needs any longer to advertise in newspapers to get bed and breakfast during the summer period at least, when the phone rings and bed and breakfast is booked in. This tends to orientate our effort more towards the small resorts.  It is particularly important that they should be looked after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember myself Blackrock, County Louth, literally dying on its feet.  We succeeded in doing one thing, that is, in providing an olympic-sized swimming pool there with the aid of a 50 per cent grant from the Department of Local Government.  The difference is quite extraordinary.  There are eight or nine, between hotels and boarding-houses, catering for people coming from Scotland and from Cavan and Monaghan for a fortnight's holidays there.  They had stopped coming.  How-ever, when the swimming pool came along and there was the attraction of swimming lessons for the children, and so on, the families started to come again.  A development of that kind can be a great help.  We in Louth County sum towards loan charges on a car park at Omeath which is just on the border and it is traditional at weekends Council included this year a nominal <Col N="1391" /> for thousands of trippers to come there from Northern Ireland.  It is one of the places where there is literally no car park.  Last year, we tried to do something about it by widening the grass verges along the road at a cost of somewhere between £500 and £1,000. We did not do a very good job.  They parked both sides of the road in lines so that only one car could get through. With the good offices of the Garda, we succeeded in coping with the crush. However, it defeated its own object, to some extent.  If that small resort could get its car park, I could see the same sort of thing happening in a rather more minor way as happened in Blackrock, County Louth, when it got the swimming pool.  We must have these amenities; we must encourage the tourists; they all have cars now and this is a thing we must do.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly, I find that the Minister's speech did not give us a declaration of policy on anything.  It gave us an extraordinary ream of facts and figures.  We are sorry to see that the CIE loss is still there.  The Minister gives reasons, including strikes, for that.  As far as I can see, the position would be that we are going to have a loss on CIE.  If we want to provide a service and if that service does not pay, then we have only one choice before us&mdash;either to scrap the service and let the people do without it or to give it to the people at a cost greater than the remuneration coming therefrom. The people will have to be reasonable about this and realise that there will be a loss on CIE if we are going to give these services which are uneconomic. But, if there is going to be a loss on CIE, it is all-important that the Minister can convince this House that CIE is an efficient concern.  Over the past five to ten years, I have seen many changes there.  We have seen area managers for transport appointed and internal changes made.  I think CIE is moving towards becoming a very efficient organisation.  There will always be the situation that, if you have this bus that does not pay and you leave it on, then you may perhaps create some feeling in your staff that the place has not got to pay just as the private enterprise place might have to pay.  But, by <Col N="1392" /> and large, the changes in organisation in CIE have brought about a good result.</P>
    <P>I feel, similarly, that in rural electrification it is one of these things: you cannot run a pole up one side of a mountain and down the other side of it just to bring electricity to one cottage house.  In many cases, it would be more economic to build the man a nice new house where you did not have to run the line.  You will always have these individual cases.</P>
    <P>I have no criticism to offer from this side of the House on this Supplementary Estimate except to remark on the neglect of the Government in not exacting its proper port and tonnage dues at Whiddy Island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <P>My only regret is that the reams of information which the Minister made available to us today were not made available to us a month ago.  I am quite sure he could have let us have it.  While being grateful to him for the trouble to which his Department have gone to give us the exact information now, I am sure he will appreciate that we had extreme difficulty in listening to him reading 50 pages.  He had extreme difficulty in reading them, I am sure, because nothing can be more monotonous.  We also had 49 pages which were not used today but which were simply supplied this morning.  The information in those documents is invaluable.  For record purposes alone, they give information which I am sure will be used as ammunition for the Minister or his successor for many years in this House. For record and comparison purposes, they are invaluable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the fact that we are now discussing a Supplementary Estimate which will expire on Tuesday next, I feel it should have been possible to allow us to have the information some time during the year in which it was current.  Therefore, it is a pity that we should have to try to assimilate the information which we have now got and to use it in such a short time.  I have 23 minutes left and I doubt if I can cover one-tenth of the matters to which I should like to refer. <Col N="1393" /> I do not propose to go along the line travelled by Deputy Donegan about Whiddy Island except to say that his disclosure was most interesting.  If it is correct&mdash;I assume his information is correct, anyway&mdash;then we do appear to be allowing a firm to get away with quite a substantial amount of money which could and should be used here.  As one who lives near enough to a port to know how necessary money is in order to try to make the port a success at all, I feel it is a pity that something has not been done about it.  Indeed, this appears to be a case where, while we may object to monopolies, we have the monopoly.</P>
    <P>According to Deputy Donegan, we are the only port that can take the vessels loaded with the crude oil to the fullest extent and therefore it would be an awful pity if we did not use the powers we have to collect not an exorbitant cost from them but what is considered to be fair, what is being paid elsewhere and what, apparently, the company have no objection to paying here.  Further than that I do not propose to go.</P>
    <P>As we are on the subject of ports, I am wondering what exactly is happening about port development here.  I am aware that quite a big development has taken place in Galway and I know why.  The mining industry is developing on a big scale in the south and in the west.  The export of crude ore has in fact made the trade for Galway port which has enabled the port authority and the Department to spend a very substantial sum of money there.  I hope that the development, when it is done &mdash;I understand that the present mines can run for another 20 years&mdash;a very well-established port will be there.</P>
    <P>I am more interested in regard to Drogheda Port.  Deputy Donegan is a member of Drogheda Corporation and is therefore more immediately in touch with the facts than I am.  I am interested in this because I live near it and I am interested in the employment it gives and in the success of the town of Drogheda.  There appears to be a plan which was to be put into operation over ten years ago and a substantial loan and grant was given by the Department of Transport and Power <Col N="1394" /> and by some local authorities to have the work carried out.  This is being carried out in a piecemeal way.  At present a major uprising is imminent there because the system being adopted does not appear to be doing very much as far as the ordinary onlooker can see except deprive the mussel fishermen of Mornington of their livelihood.  There have been scare headlines in some of the national newspapers about this.  I do not know where the Department of Transport and Power come in.  They may say it has nothing to do with them and that this is a matter for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>The scheme may be worthwhile in making the Port of Drogheda easier to use and a better port for catering for vessels.  A fishmeal factory is to be started there in June and extra water and jetties will be needed for the ships bringing the fish to the factory and indeed for servicing the cement factory and the other industries there.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it was never envisaged by the local people that when this was being done they would lose a very substantial income from a traditional way of life.  I have a map in my possession which is dated 21st June, 1871, and which gives the people in the area the right to fish on the River Boyne.  It is not good enough to say that this is progress, that we must prepare for bigger ships and therefore we can wipe out anybody who stands in our way.  The plain fact is that the families of those people have been living there for generations.  One thing I admire about them is they never look for anything for nothing; they never look for social welfare benefit or anything else.  They live by fishing and they are about to be deprived of their livelihood.  Indeed, some have been already deprived of it by the action of the Drogheda Harbour Commissioners using money made available to them by the Department of Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>Before the matter goes any further, or is made worse, I suggest the Department should have a thorough investigation carried out.  A suggestion has been made by the Commissioners that if these people are entitled to compensation they will get it; but what compensation <Col N="1395" /> can be given to 40 families each consisting of perhaps six, seven or eight people?  Whether the members of the family are men or women they have all been employed in the industry.  At certain periods, they have told me, the income to each house from the mussel fishing alone&mdash;and this is something the income tax section of the Department of Finance would not be too well aware of&mdash;amounts not just to pounds but over £100 a week.  That is a very substantial sum of money which they receive when they have an order for the fish and can get them away.  The fish are top class.  There was a certain defect in them but that has been overcome. The Minister would not agree that it is right to say &ldquo;We are going to widen the river and deepen it.  This must be done.  Even though your family and your forebears have been fishing there since 1871, you must go off and get a job elsewhere.&rdquo; I do not think that the State is so hard-hearted as to say that that should be done.</P>
    <P>While they have, on my advice, employed legal advice about this matter, and it appears that a court case can ensue, I feel that the Department of Transport and Power, in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, could do something about having the matter settled and reaching some agreement.  The Drogheda Harbour Commissioners say that all they are doing is sending a dredger down the river to take the top off the sandbanks which have appeared but I know that the dredger is lifting a grab of sand and material, along with a lot of mussel, and then dumping it. We all know what happens if you dump shellfish in a fast-flowing river&mdash; they just go out of the river.  The river is to be widened to 300 feet and the minimum depth is to be eight feet.  It was suggested that the mussels could be resown after the berths had been made along the new wharves for the boats.  When I asked what depth the water was going to be there I was told that it would be 40 feet.  The mussel fishermen take the mussels out with rakes which are 15 feet to 20 feet long but it would require a skin-diver to get them out of 40 feet of water.</P>
    <P>The whole approach seems to be:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1396" />&ldquo;We know there is something wrong and we know that these people are likely to lose their livelihood.&rdquo;  Therefore, the time to have the matter dealt with is now and not after the High Court or the Supreme Court has had a ten-day hearing with substantial costs involved.  I am asking the Minister at this stage to do what he can.  If he does not, I can assure him that while the people are anxious for industrial development there they are not prepared to agree that somebody should ride roughshod over them and do away with their traditional way of living.</P>
    <P>As far as tourism is concerned, the Minister and I have had many disagreements on the way tourism is dealt with here.  I can never understand why figures are produced in regard to the numbers who come here and the Minister says that they are the actual figures.  My opinion is that this is just a spot check which may result in accurate information.  I know that if I travel abroad tourist people may ask me how much money I have with me, how much I intend to spend and how much I intend to bring back, or something like that.  We know that if somebody is asked how much he has with him and he has £10 he will probably say that he has £100 or £150.  The information cannot be accurate and should not be described as being accurate.  I know that tourism is very, very important and that a great deal of money must be coming in, but a lot of people referred to as being tourists are simply and solely Irish people coming here for a holiday.  On a previous occasion the Minister said that this was not so and that they were segregated from the real tourists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I will have to differ with the Minister about this.  From the check which I saw being carried out I could not see how it would be possible to distinguish the genuine tourist who comes here on holiday and has not been here before from the person who lived here a year ago or 20 years ago and comes back on holiday.  Perhaps it does not matter a lot as long as they spend money and enjoy themselves.  That is the important <Col N="1397" /> thing.  The whole question of tourism is approached in a way in which it appears that figures are put down and people are expected to believe that they are absolutely accurate.  They may be accurate or they may not be.</P>
      <P>I am engaged to a certain extent in the tourist business as I am a director of a regional tourist board.  One thing I do not like is that the regional boards, while they get a job and do it&mdash;or attempt to do it&mdash;are purely voluntary and the members do not get travelling expenses.  Some of the public representatives did not stay on them very long when they discovered that they were not getting travelling expenses.  Instead, they put on some of their more gullible colleagues.  If one takes an interest in these things it does not matter.  One thing I do not like. A foreign firm was employed for the purpose of asking people to invest in tourism.  They went around from firm to firm and asked them to contribute certain sums.  Subsequently, it was found that the firm collecting this money, apart from ensuring that they were paid themselves, appeared not to be greatly interested in the amount of money that found its way to the tourist boards here and the scheme was dropped under that heading. Instead, an Irish officer was appointed to do the job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>He was in many cases insulted, told that he was begging for money, a position into which nobody should be put.  People making a great deal of money out of the tourist industry were not prepared to subscribe a shilling while their neighbours, making a little, were prepared to put some money into it.  When that situation arises the whole scheme must collapse, as it did.  I suggest that the Tourist Board, while it gives quite a substantial subvention to the regional tourist organisations, should give more. There should be some budget and when that budget is prepared the money should be given out.  I think there is no other way.  The Minister may not agree.  I know how difficult it is to raise money and that when <Col N="1398" /> taxation is imposed we complain, but it is far preferable to impose taxation to raise the money rather than have the people who are prepared to help, paying and those who are not prepared to help, just sitting back, saying: &ldquo;We shall get our share of the harvest in any case.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In my own area we have established a development association which is doing good work, allied to the Tidy Towns groups throughout the country. I travel a good deal, about 1,000 miles per week&mdash;perhaps more than most Deputies&mdash;and I find a tremendous change in the appearance of the countryside in the past few years.  The greatest praise must go to those engaged in the Tidy Towns and Local Tidy Gardens and Flowerbeds competitions. The Minister's Department, however, should attempt to have some of the money being expended transferred to areas where it could do some good.  I have noticed over the years that it is quite common to find very large sums of money being spent in places such as Salthill&mdash;which has been transformed&mdash;Arklow and such places. While I do not disagree with making money available to places that have something to offer, it is unfair to other places that would have quite a good deal to offer if they had money to develop.  It is here, I think, that the Minister is not doing the job in exactly the way I think it should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a member of a development company and we have attempted to improve the area in which we live, the villages of Laytown and Bettystown, very considerably.  Further down is the village of Mornington and we have a lovely seacoast stretching for seven miles along the whole county.  We are unable to provide money enough even for public conveniences for the thousands who come there in the summer.  They do not come every day; it depends very much on the weather; but as many as 40,000 or 50,000 have come and until recently we had no water for them.  There are no shelters in Mornington and no public conveniences. Laytown and Bettystown are a little better served.  This is not enough.  Recently Meath County Council purchased a seizable field beside the <Col N="1399" /> village for development but it requires a bridge across the river before it can be fully developed.  We are the nearest village to Drogheda and within 30 miles of Dublin.  Inland lies the whole of Counties Meath and Westmeath and their nearest seaside place is here.  Yet, when we ask for assistance we are offered shillings and pennies as against the £40,000, £50,000 or £60,000 given to what are known as major resorts.  Would the Minister consider that areas where such large numbers of people are being accommodated should be entitled to some encouragement, to some money which would allow them to develop?</P>
    <P>I refer very briefly to Bord na Móna. The Minister commented here on this and I am glad he took the advice given on this side of the House a few years ago suggesting that it was unfair to ask Bord na Móna to continue repaying the principal and interest on funds, while other semi-State companies were not asked to do the same thing.  It was also pointed out that the ESB had been subsidised in a sort of hidden way because Bord na Móna was supplying fuel for their generating stations at less than the cost of production of the fuel. I am glad that the Minister has dealt with this by giving a remission for the repayment of the principal and I think he has allowed them to drop paying the interest on their loans for a period. Literally thousands are employed&mdash;in the peak period, over 9,000&mdash;by Bord na Móna.  All the year round about 5,000 or 5,500 are employed and this is in portions of the country where there would not be other employments.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to a strike and I think that in most of his comments regarding CIE, the ESB and so on, he says industrial unrest caused this or that.  If we are talking about industrial unrest&mdash;and we must admit it occurred &mdash;surely the time has come when there should be a more realistic approach by management to claims for increased wages or improved conditions?  It is not good enough for any State or semi-State employer, when a wage demand is received, to offer the very minimum and then move up by halfpennies and pennies, as happened in a recent case <Col N="1400" /> where five offers were made before, eventually, the dispute was settled.  The people dealing with these matters should have a realistic approach and should say: &ldquo;It appears to be reasonable to offer so much,&rdquo; instead of saying to somebody seeking 9d. an hour: &ldquo;We will give you 2d&rdquo; and hope that by horse-trading methods they will get away with 3d or 6d.  Why not offer the amount first and try to make an agreement?</P>
    <P>While losses are referred to here both in CIE and Bord na Móna, I think the Minister must admit that if, because of the failure of management to make a realistic attempt to settle a dispute at an early stage, work is stopped over a long period all the loss involved cannot be blamed on the workers and must also be blamed on those who were so unrealistic as to allow the dispute to drag on even though they knew they were losing more per week than would pay the increases for half the year to those concerned.</P>
    <P>This is an attitude with which the Minister must concern himself.  It is very easy to condemn workers saying that they were seeking this, that or the other thing and that, as a result, they caused a dispute resulting in a big loss. If the Minister looks into these things he will find that in many cases the big loss was caused by the unrealistic approach of the officials of semi-State bodies.  I am sure the Minister is aware that an investigation set up by the Minister for Labour was carried out in the case of the dispute to which he refers in Bord na Móna.  There was a very full investigation and a report was made which has never seen the light of day.  Was there any reason for that? Could it be, as it is suggested, that something like what I have said just now did, in fact, occur and that the blame could not be entirely laid on the workers and would, in fact, be laid on the management for not doing something they should have done and for doing something they should not have done?  In this case the dispute was sparked off by a notice put up after the unions and management had agreed that the notice should not go up and should not be implemented.  One of the juniors in the board ordered the notice to be put up which caused the original <Col N="1401" /> dispute.  I am sorry.  The time of the House has run out and my time also.</P>
