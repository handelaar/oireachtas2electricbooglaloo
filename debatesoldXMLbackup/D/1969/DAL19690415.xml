    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The offer I made of a debate over two weeks ago was not acceptable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach not aware the offer his Whips made was that he was to make a statement but that the Opposition was not to be given the chance to reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true. That is the offer that was made.  That is the offer that was made to us and we rejected it.  We said the nation was in such a serious state that we were even prepared to come back on two days the following week to have it debated and discussed and the Taoiseach's Party would not agree to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy deny there was an offer that the matter be debated on the Thursday and Friday <Col N="1405" /> of the week the Dáil concluded and that would have given an opportunity to Opposition Deputies to speak?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an offer made, and the Deputy well knows it, which involved an opportunity for Deputies on the Opposition side to speak as well, as on an adjournment debate.  It was not acceptable in the circumstances to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that the Taoiseach has been misinformed if he was told that that offer was made.  If that had been done there would not have been time to complete the business which had to be completed before the Easter recess.  The Taoiseach should be aware of that and that that was the reason why it was not debated.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach further aware that we made the offer we would discuss it on the following Monday and Tuesday?  We were told by the Government Whips that they were going to a Government and a Cabinet meeting and that we could get word after that.  Things did not turn out as they should at the Cabinet meeting.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a point of order.  The country is watching us and I think rightly watching us.  Parliament proceeds on the basis that we all recognise the Taoiseach is a busy man and he delegates to his Chief Whip discussions for the arrangement of our business.  We all sympathise with our friend and colleague, Deputy Carty, in his temporary indisposition.  I think the Minister for Social Welfare has undertaken his obligations.  It is unreasonable to expect that the Minister for Social Welfare, while he has undertaken Deputy Carty's duties in Deputy Carty's regrettable and unavoidable absence, should be present so that matters of this kind can be clarified. It is certainly distressing that there should appear to be a conflict between what I believe the Taoiseach is telling us in perfectly good faith now and what I understand the temporary Chief Whip, the Minister for Social Welfare, communicated to Deputies Tully and L'Estrange just before the Adjournment. It is important, I submit, that some arrangement should be made to carry home to the public mind that we are doing the public business like adults in this House.</P>

    <P>NOTE.&mdash;Suburban areas were not enumerated separately at Censuses of Population prior to that of 1951.  For the year 1926, the percentage relates to Dublin County Borough, as then defined, together with the Urban Districts of Howth, Pembroke, Rathmines and Rathgar.  For the years 1936 and 1946, the percentages relate to the area of Dublin County Borough as then defined together with the Urban District of Howth (Pembroke, Rathmines and Rathgar having been taken into the County Borough).  For 1956 and 1966 the percentages relate to the area of Dublin County Borough and Suburbs as defined at the respective censuses.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary)</i> and <b>Mr. Coughlan</b> asked the Taoiseach if he can give (a) the estimated cost to the parents of the Republic of maintaining the present number of students attending universities in the State, per annum; and (b) the annual loss of potential earnings by the students while pursuing university courses.</P>

      <P>There are no data available from which reliable estimates could be made of the total cost of maintaining students at universities and of the loss of potential earnings by the students.  The only relevant information available relates to the fees paid in respect of university education.  In 1966-67, the latest year for which figures are available, fees received by the National University, the University Colleges at Dublin, Cork and Galway and Trinity College, Dublin, amounted to £1.4 million.  About 12,800 students or more than 80 per cent of all full-time students, were from homes in the Twenty-six Counties, so that about £1.1 million was paid by parents resident in the State.</P>

      <P>A new series of consumer price index numbers was recently inaugurated by the Central Statistics Office.  The new series replaces the series complied from August, 1953 to November, 1968. The base of the new series is mid-November, 1968=100 and the index for mid-February was issued on 3rd April.</P>
      <P>The items included and the weighting basis of the new series are derived from the expenditure pattern revealed by the 1965-66 Household Budget Inquiry which covered towns and villages in the State.  A full description of the new index will be given in the March, 1969 issue of the Irish Statistical Bulletin.  I propose, with your permission, Sir, to circulate, in the Official Report a statement showing the items included in the new index.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach the total imports from Germany for the year ended 31st March, 1969; the total exports from Ireland to Germany for the same period; and what action is being taken to rectify the imbalance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1420" />
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Particulars of trade with the Federal Republic of Germany in the twelve months ended the 31st March, 1969, are not yet available. During the calendar year 1968, imports amounted to £35.9 million and exports totalled £8.1 million.</P>
      <P>The principal adverse effect on the value of Irish exports to the Federal Republic of Germany in the past few years has been the sharp reduction in German imports of Irish cattle and beef because of the effects of the European Economic Community import levies.  The restoration of our trade in cattle and beef with Germany has been the subject of repeated representations to the German authorities and to the EEC Commission.</P>
      <P>In the case of countries with which we have an adverse trade balance the aim is to seek to improve the position by encouraging the expansion of exports.</P>
      <P>Trade promotion, as well as the promotion of other foreign earnings, is a priority function of our Embassy in Bonn and the Consulate-General in Hamburg is engaged practically wholetime in economic work, especially trade promotion.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is, no doubt, aware that the Government, through Córas Tráchtála, have made a wide range of grants, incentives and services available to exporters and these, of course, apply to exports to Germany; and that, as was recently announced, a programme of new incentives and services aimed at stimulating and assisting a more rapid expansion of exports to markets other than Britain has been introduced by Córas Tráchtála.  Under the new programme Córas Tráchtála have increased the staff and are expanding the activities of their office in Frankfurt which has particular responsibility for the promotion of Irish exports to Germany.</P>
      <P>While, in the ultimate analysis, it is on the efforts of exporters that our prospects depend, I hope that the additional incentives which the Government are making available will encourage Irish manufacturers to increase their efforts to expand their exports to such countries as Germany.</P>

      <P>We cannot overlook the fact that we have a £27 million adverse trade balance with Germany at a time when men and women are losing work at home due to the fact that we are importing industrial goods that could be produced at home.

It is only in the last few months that efforts to increase the capacity of An Córas Tráchtála in Germany have been made and it is too early yet to write off these efforts as a failure.  On the contrary, the position will improve from now on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Recommendation suggests that the Committee of Ministers should invite member Governments to arrange that prosecution for crimes against humanity shall not be prevented by the <Col N="1423" /> application of statutory limitations, and should instruct a Committee of Experts to draw up a European Convention on this subject.  As there is no such statutory limitation in Ireland in respect of prosecution for criminal offences of this kind, no action is necessary in our case in respect of the first proposal.</P>
      <P>So far as the second proposal is concerned, I do not believe any useful purpose would be served by drawing up a European Convention on this subject.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 15, 16 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>There were two printings of the first edition of <i>Facts about Ireland.</i> The first printing in 1963 totalled 53,201 copies at a cost of £9,312.  Of that number 31,722 copies were sold abroad or were distributed through our Missions.  In addition, 9,100 copies were sold to State-sponsored bodies but I have no information as to the number of copies which they distributed abroad.  The net cost of the copies sent abroad by the Department was £2,924.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The corresponding figures for the <Col N="1425" /> second printing in 1965 were 48,362 copies printed at a cost of £7,620 and 36,800 copies sold or distributed abroad at a net cost of £5,483.  In addition, 3,100 copies were sold to State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>A second edition, incorporating new material and up-to-date statistics, running to 30,000 copies was published recently at a cost of £8,400.  It is now on sale in Ireland and arrangements are being made for its sale and distribution abroad.</P>
    <P>General information handbooks on the same pattern as <i>Facts about Ireland</i> with the emphasis on facts and statistics, are issued by many countries.  The booklet is very useful to our Missions when dealing with a wide variety of enquiries from journalists, businessmen, students and prospective visitors to Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Facts about Ireland</i> is not, nor is it intended to be, a history of Ireland. Out of the 110 pages there are only a few devoted to a very brief sketch of Irish history from ancient to modern times.  The booklet is mainly devoted to explaining the constitutional organisation of the State and to describing the social, economic and cultural life in Ireland today.  For those whose interest may be aroused by reading the booklet, in contains a list of 150 books on ancient and modern Irish history, literature, art and economics.  It includes at least 15 histories and biographies dealing with the history of the years 1916 to 1923 and the leaders of the period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the printing of this partial document is to be deplored on many grounds and that many people are gravely concerned that the present Government are not prepared to forget the past?  Is the Minister for External Affairs further aware that, while he claims it is not an historical document, all about the growth of the present Government, Fianna Fáil, when they were established, <i>et cetera,</i> is included in this document but there is nothing about men like Michael Collins, Arthur Griffith, W.T. Cosgrave or the first Government of this State and the men who built up this State from 1922 to <Col N="1426" /> 1932?  The only difference between this edition and the original one is that the photograph of the Minister wearing green pants is not included.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy forgets that this is not the first booklet published in this country by the Government. In 1950 there was a booklet which set out to do pretty well the same thing as has been done better in the modern version.  On page 10 of that booklet&mdash;<i>Ireland: An Introduction</i>&mdash;published in 1950 the only reference to Michael Collins is the following:</P>
      <P>Under the authority of Dáil Éireann and supported by the people the Volunteers, now the Irish Republican Army, carried on an armed guerrilla struggle led by Michael Collins and Cathal Brugha against the British.</P>
      <P>In that booklet there was no bibliography setting out the histories where people could read a biographical sketch or life of Michael Collins.  In <i>Facts about Ireland</i> there are at least 15 books listed which deal with the period from 1916 onwards.</P>

The Minister will agree also that both as regards Parties in the House and people outside the House there is no question nowadays of giving offence by recording facts in relation either to the period immediately after the formation of this State or to the period which preceded that when the man whose memory will live forever in this country, General Michael Collins, played a heroic part in achieving the independence of this country.

It then refers to the fact that in 1926 a person whom we are not supposed to mention here nowadays and who had opposed the Treaty founded Fianna Fáil.  The next reference in this is to the 1932 Election when Fianna Fáil came into office. Surely it is a fact that there was a Government there from the time of the Treaty until 1932?

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the enactment in March, 1966, of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, which gave me the necessary powers to embark on brucellosis eradication, full scale measures&mdash;that is, blood testing followed by slaughter of reactors&mdash;were started in County Donegal in May, 1966, and in Counties Cavan, Leitrim, Monaghan and Sligo in December, 1966.  After two rounds of testing County Donegal was declared brucellosis free in June, 1968, and animals from clear herds in this area have now full brucellosis-free status.  A third round of testing is at present in operation in the other four counties and we hope that it will be possible to declare them brucellosis-free later this year on the completion of this round.</P>
      <P>An extension to the brucellosis blood testing laboratory is at present being built.  When this is completed during the summer it will be possible to take on a further group of counties.</P>
      <P>Preliminary measures have also been taken in areas not scheduled for early eradication.  The calfhood vaccination scheme was introduced in 11 counties including the main dairying counties in June, 1965, and by November, 1967, when it was suspended because of the foot and mouth emergency, nearly 600,000 calves had been vaccinated with Strain 19 against the disease.  This scheme has now been replaced by the heifer vaccination scheme, which came into operation last month in approximately the same area.  In this scheme the recently developed 45/20 killed vaccine is being used.</P>
      <P>In addition, the brucellosis (certified) herds scheme has been available throughout the country to herdowners who might wish to clear their herds in advance of the general measures.</P>

That could be corrected if the Minister would promptly declare it to be a brucellosis-testing area and extend the scheme to that area where the cattle population is not unduly high and the incidence of brucellosis may be expected to be very low.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of cutting down.  The Government recently decided to increase the subsidy on dead meat exported from this country by 2d per lb approximately.  If this is taken in the context of Britain giving an increase of 15s per cwt. liveweight in support of the deficiency payment it does not follow that, because they increased the support by 15s per cwt. liveweight, we have reduced something. We have, in fact, increased the deadweight support by 2d per lb. on meat going out to the British market and, because of that increase of 2d per lb, there is no disadvantage in the intake into our factories here.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not proposed to alter the existing contribution scale applicable to the Local Improvements Scheme which for the lower valuations shows substantial reductions on the scale applicable&mdash;to Rural Improvement Schemes&mdash;prior to June, 1967, and which in fact requires no contribution where the average valuation is under £5.</P>

      <P>I can speak only for my own county.  Many people are failing to accept the terms of these schemes because the local contribution is much too high.

      <P>The duties of traffic wardens are mainly related to the prevention of parking offences.  Where they find a continuing disregard of the parking regulations they issue notices of &ldquo;fines-on-the-spot&rdquo;.

    <Title>Agricultural Credit Bill, 1969: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to increase the authorised share capital and borrowing limits of the Agricultural Credit Corporation. The Agricultural Credit Act, 1965, authorised share capital of £6 million for the Corporation and fixed at £20 million the borrowing powers of the Corporation.  It was expected at the time that these new limits would be adequate to cover the Corporation's requirements for capital to finance its activities for a period of three years. The share capital has now been fully subscribed by the State and total borrowing by the Corporation amounts to approximately £15 million.  The Bill proposes to increase the authorised share capital limit to £10 million (section 2) and to extend the borrowing limit to £25 million (section 3).  It is expected that the proposed new limits will suffice for at least five years ahead.  As the Bill authorises an increase in the Corporation's borrowing powers it is desirable to increase to a corresponding extent the authority of the Minister for Finance to guarantee the Corporation's borrowings.  This is the purpose of section 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also has a number of other provisions which are intended to facilitate the Agricultural Credit Corporation in its day-to-day administration. As the volume of its business grows the Corporation is finding it increasingly difficult to have the annual accounts prepared, audited and furnished to the Minister for Finance for presentation to the Houses of the Oireachtas within 90 days after the end of the accounting year as required by present legislation.  It is proposed in section 5 to follow modern practice generally in this respect in relation to State-sponsored bodies by removing the specific time limit of 90 days.  The Corporation will still be obliged to <Col N="1461" /> have the accounts ready as early as possible.</P>
    <P>Under present legislation requests to a county registrar by the commercial banks and the ACC for information from the register of chattel mortgages must be made under seal.  This procedure has at times proved to be a source of delay for the Corporation and it is proposed in section 6 of the Bill that in future requisitions to a county registrar may be made under the hand of a solicitor or law agent of the Corporation or bank.  The county registrar will, of course, continue to be the only person with direct access to the register of chattel mortgages.  I understand that the commercial banks do not register chattel mortgages to any extent.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is a consequential provision to empower the ACC to make the necessary alterations in its Memorandum and Articles of Association arising out of the changes being made in the Bill.  Normally the ACC may not alter its Memorandum or Articles of Association without the approval of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>During its financial year 1967-68 the ACC issued a total of 6,080 loans, including hire purchase advances, to the extent of £4.5 million and approximately 4,000 of those were for amounts of less than £500.  The total amount of loans at present outstanding exceeds £20 million.  Lending by the Corporation in its current financial year, which ends on 30th April next, will total more than £5 million and it is estimated that the volume of business will rise in the years immediately ahead.</P>
    <P>While overall lending by the ACC has fallen off since 1965, due to the general suspension in the autumn of that year of loans for land purchase and the funding of bank debts because of the shortage of capital, there has been a steady increase in loans for directly productive purposes.  The number of unsecured loans issued by the Corporation to farmers is rising rapidly and the maximum amount of loan which may be issued under the Corporation's scheme of unsecured loans is now £750.  The Budgeted Loan Scheme, which has been in operation since the beginning of 1968, enables <Col N="1462" /> farmers to finance their seasonal needs as they arise by means of a book of dated cheques issued by the Corporation; no security is required for loans of up to £1,000 under this scheme.  The Corporation now operates a comprehensive range of loan facilities designed to meet the productive needs of agriculture. Business with farming co-operative societies is growing steadily, and outstanding loans to these societies at present well exceed £1½ million.  Over 80 per cent of all loan applications received by the Corporation are approved, and the repayments record of borrowers is excellent.  Because of the continuing shortage of capital it will be necessary to continue the present restrictions on loans for land purchase and debt funding.  Any significant relaxation of these restrictions would give rise to considerable extra expenditure which would have to be financed from Exchequer funds thus adding to the difficulties of financing the public capital programme.  However, the Corporation continues to make loans available for the purchase of land to enlarge uneconomic holdings.</P>
    <P>An important development in the ACC's activities has been the setting up of area officers in provincial centres. These officers provide a closer link between the ACC and the farmer and they help by their advice to ensure that credit is used to best advantage by the borrower.  As the Corporation's business grows, further extensions to the area officer system are envisaged.</P>
    <P>In recent years the ACC has raised a considerable amount of capital from the public through the issue of farm credit bonds, introduced in 1962, and the operation of a deposits scheme which was introduced in 1965 and which is at present the Corporation's main source of non-Exchequer borrowings. Both bonds and deposits are guaranteed by the State.  The total of outstanding bonds and deposits at present amounts to approximately £6½ million.  The Corporation's efforts to finance as much as possible of its lending operations from non-Exchequer sources were hampered considerably during the past year by the general increase in interest rates which resulted in stronger competition from other <Col N="1463" /> borrowing institutions for the public's savings.  In order to maintain its competitive position the Corporation revised its borrowing rates in January and again in April of this year.</P>
    <P>The interest rates on deposits now range up to 7¼ per cent subject to six months notice of withdrawal and the interest rate applicable to the latest series of bonds is 6 per cent with a tax-free capital bonus of 2 per cent where the bonds are held for five years.  To offset the extra cost of paying higher borrowing rates the Corporation has found it necessary to increase its lending rates and hire purchase charges. The Corporation now charges interest at the rate of 8½per cent on new loans which compares with the present bank overdraft rate of 9 per cent.  However, as a concession to the small farmer, the Corporation has maintained an interest rate of only 6½ per cent on all loans made under its scheme of unsecured loans where the borrower's aggregate indebtedness to the Corporation, including the new loan, does not exceed, £400.  Loans in this category constitute approximately one-third of all loans issued by the Corporation to individual farmers and the concession should, therefore, be of significant benefit to the small farmer.  The Corporation's hire purchase charges are kept at as low a level as possible in the interest of the farming community.</P>
    <P>The primary objective of the ACC is to ensure that the development of Irish agriculture is not impeded by lack of capital.  In pursuit of this objective the Corporation aims to be the most convenient and the cheapest possible source of credit for the farmer consistent with its operation as a commercial organisation.  It now offers a wide range of loans for farming purposes on favourable terms as to interest and repayment and, in so far as it can, it seeks to ensure that the money borrowed by the farmer is put to the best possible use.  The Bill which I now present to the House is intended to enable the good work being carried out by the ACC to be continued and expanded. I confidently recommend the Bill for the approval of the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>With the general <Col N="1464" /> principle of making further moneys available for the development of agriculture through the Agricultural Credit Corporation there is no quarrel on any side of the House but I am somewhat intrigued by some of the ways in which it is proposed to deal with this and also by some of the remarks of the Minister.  I am not quite clear why the arrangement for an increase in capital and the arrangement for an increase in the amount that can be borrowed are dealt with at the same time.  Presumably, it is intended that the share capital will be subscribed only by the Exchequer but in that respect I think it is desirable that the Minister for Finance should be quite categoric and specific.  Is there any intention, with the increase in share capital, that there should be an attempt at getting subscriptions from private sources?  Certainly, that is something that should be stated by the Minister in introducing the Bill and something that preferably should be included in the actual Bill.</P>
      <P>The borrowing limit that is being extended is for the purpose of enabling the Corporation to get funds elsewhere and to provide for these funds, as is suggested by the Minister, by varying the rate of interest offered from time to time.  It appears now that all over the world we appear to be facing a prolonged period of high interest rates and that it will be necessary to pay more for the servicing of capital than was the case some years ago.  I can remember the Minister's Party suggesting from time to time that it was possible to raise capital without any advertence to world-wide conditions.  The Minister has been in the Department of Finance sufficiently long to realise how non-sensical were the expressions or rather perhaps, how much they were made by the members of his Party with their tongues in their cheeks.  Obviously, no one country can swim against the stream in that respect although there are certain ways in which one can modify or change from time to time the general stream, divert capital, and interest rates also, for periods to cover different circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it seems reasonably clear that the moneys that have been obtained by the Agricultural Credit <Col N="1465" /> Corporation have been obtained out of the general pool of savings and as far as I can see there has been no real evidence that these savings entrusted to the Corporation have been taken from the pool of what I might describe as dead moneys.  They seem merely to have resulted in a switch from one lending operation to another. The time has arrived quickly when there must be a re-assessment of saving incentives and a new designing of them to bring additional savings into the general pool.  Perhaps, as the Minister is extending the period for the introduction of his Budget to, I think, one of the latest ever dates, he will use the interval profitably for the country by applying his mind to the necessity for new saving incentives.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation would be one of the bodies to benefit from the addition of new savings incentives.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that it is necessary to extend beyond three months the period for preparation of the accounts of the Corporation.  Any efficient company, even of the size of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, can certainly produce its accounts within three months and the dilution of their duty by the euphemistic phrase &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; is not something that is to be encouraged. The Corporation should be looking ahead, if not looking to the present, to the installation of appropriate computerised accounting which would mean that this matter could be dealt with without delay.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill deals with chattel mortgages.  I have some doubt as to whether the drafting of the section is adequate to provide what the Minister has in mind.  A seal is something that is recognised statutorily under the Companies Act, 1963.  The solicitor or law agent of the recognised lender is not a person so statutorily recognised.  The county registrar has placed on him a specific statutory duty not to make the register available, except in certain specific instances and, as the section is drawn, it will mean that the county registrar who does not require a notification of the appointment of the solicitor or law agent to be statutorily recognised will be running into the danger of an action being <Col N="1466" /> taken against him for improper disclosure. The section should have been drafted in an entirely different way on that account.</P>
    <P>The drafting of the second subsection of section 7 is one of the anachronisms we meet in modern drafting, that subsections so-and-so shall apply, and then if we look back to the subsections that are to apply we find that those subsections say that something else is not to apply.  Surely, it would have been possible to arrive at a simpler method of drafting than to say in one section that another is to apply when that other section says that earlier sections of the Act are not to apply?  Those are matters that we can raise on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned incidentally the restriction that there is on the Corporation in present circumstances at the request of the Government.  It would be highly desirable, as we on this side of the House have frequently indicated, that where specific directions are given by a Minister to a State-spon-sored body such as the Agricultural Credit Corporation, those specific directions should be tabled for the information of the House and the general public.  My understanding of the position is that the Agricultural Credit Corporation have received a direction from the Government that they are not to employ any funds or make any loans available for the purchase of lands by any borrower no matter what the circumstances may be except for the purpose of bringing an uneconomic holding up to an economic size.</P>
    <P>If my understanding is correct it is very harsh in the circumstances of a farmer who wishes to settle out a son and to provide for the settlement of that son by borrowing on his own farm for the purpose of enabling the son to purchase another holding.  There was, unquestionably, at one stage competition among borrowers, who artificially forced prices up, perhaps, in the belief that most of them would be financed by the Agricultural Credit Corporation and that there would be clearance from the Corporation for the financing; but the number of cases in which there would be a specific ability for a farmer to settle out a son would not be the same thing at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1467" /> Candidly, I do not object to a productive limitation but the absolute buying restriction that there is at present is something that should not be there in its present form.  If my information is correct, this restriction should be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The Minister also has indicated that there is a restriction on the extension of existing loans.  While one can understand that in general circumstances, there are other matters to be recollected: first, the fact that all savings are coming out of one general pool of savings and, secondly, that it is very often a necessary prerequisite for a farmer getting the greatest production out of his land that he should know where he stands in relation to his accommodation.  We all know that in many instances this is not feasible. There should be some restriction rather than prohibition of this lending.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister, when he is replying, to make it clear as to whether there is any other case or any other class of case in respect of which a specific direction or a general direction has been given by the Government to the corporation.  In so far as I know, and, again, I speak subject to correction, neither the Minister nor the corporation ever stated publicly that such a direction has been given though, of course, people have been told when they applied that they could not be accommodated.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to indicate also exactly what cohesion there is between Government policy of the day and the corporation in regard to the purposes of loans.  We all accept, of course, that there has been an advice, if you like, from the Government to the corporation to the effect that loans should be for productive purposes. That is not what I had in mind.  How much of the loans made by the corporation has been in respect of agriculture? This is something which should be very carefully considered as apart from the financial angle.  However, I am quite sure that Deputy Clinton will deal more competently with these matters than I can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to get money from the Agricultural Credit Corporation is was necessary at one time to prove that the money was not needed.  In other words, if one could prove that one did not need money there was a chance of obtaining some from the corporation.  Otherwise, the corporation would just say they were sorry but that the money could not be made available.  That situation seems to have changed drastically during the year and at the present time the Agricultural Credit Corporation seem to be doing an excellent job.  We, on this side of the House, would give our full approval to the proposals in the Minister's Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there are a couple of points which I should like to mention <Col N="1469" /> briefly.  I agree that it was right to restrict the use of the money when it was becoming a little scarce.  The idea of buying land for the purpose of bringing a farm up to an economic level is good.  It was also a good idea to abolish the system which allowed the corporation to advance money to farmers for the purpose of buying expensive cars as was a practice some years ago.  It was too bad to find that one farmer who wanted money to improve his farm could not get it while his neighbour who was doing quite well on his farm was able to buy one or two cars with the help of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  If people wish to buy cars under a hire-purchase system there are means of doing so other than through the corporation.  It might be suggested that these loans were advanced in the interest of improving agriculture by having the necessary vehicles on the farm but I do not think that was a good idea.  However, the statement issued through the Government Information Bureau changed that system.</P>
    <P>The increase in the rates of interest has encouraged people to invest money in the corporation.  I know of one person who subscribed what to him was a substantial amount of money but who subsequently required the money quickly.  The Corporation were rather tough when they told him that he could not have it until the statutory period expired.  It can be argued that such a clause was necessary as otherwise everybody would invest for six months and if they then did not need the money they would get the maximum amount of interest.  I still think that there could be some type of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Flexibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Flexibility&rdquo; is the word I have been trying to find&mdash; which would allow this thing to be done.  There is one case in which the Agricultural Credit Corporation do not lend money of any sizeable amount and that is the case of the really small man who is starting a fruit farm.  It is quite a common thing in my constituency at the present time for a person with a very small amount of land who cannot get credit to go into the fruit and vegetable <Col N="1470" /> business.  I am sure the housewives who find it so difficult to get vegetables at the present time would encourage this.  It is regrettable that the Agricultural Credit Corporation do not make small amounts of money available for this type of enterprise.  Many of the people concerned work during their spare time at this type of production and, if they make a success of it, go into it full time.  I know a number of them who have succeeded in doing that. It should be possible for the Agricultural Credit Corporation to make some money available to this type of person.</P>
      <P>One thing I should like to say about the offices in Harcourt Street is that it should be possible to have better parking facilities there.  If two or three cars are there at the same time the owners will find when they come out that those wardens whom we were talking about earlier have put stickers on the cars and, instead of getting credit, they find they have to pay £1 for parking their cars.  The parking facilities there are not good and there should be some effort made to get off-street parking or to have the offices where parking space is available.</P>
      <P>If loans are given to those who are really prepared to use them for good purposes, then there cannot be enough money found for them.  The Minister will probably get down to this in some of the documents issued around Budget time but if he could dig something up before this Bill has passed through all Stages I would like to know how much of the loans is recovered.  What risks are there of bad debts?  What percentage losses are there?  Are the losses substantial? Could we have any figures on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Sweetman that there should not be a longer period than 90 days for preparation of the accounts of the corporation?  At the present time it is often very difficult to get accounts audited, particularly at the period shortly after the end of the financial year.  It is very difficult to get auditors who are in a position to deal with accounts in a short time but a company like the Agricultural Credit Corporation should be able to have the accounts prepared within 90 days.  Most of the accounts could be prepared for <Col N="1471" /> some months before that and it is only the last balancing of the accounts which would be required.  The Minister should reconsider this question of extending the period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us would be prepared to support any measure designed to make more money available to the Agricultural Credit Corporation. I have recently read through the Report and Accounts of the Agricultural Credit Corporation and it is obvious that the business is expanding and that the capital available to the corporation is now insufficient to meet the requirements of the present time.  It is well recognised that agriculture is deplorably under-capitalised in this country and that if we are to secure the full potential of the industry within a reasonable period a large-scale investment programme will have to be undertaken soon.  All over Europe at the present time this type of programme is being carried out and this is not confined to the six EEC countries.  It is not only Mr. Mansholt who sees the great need for structural reform in agriculture. This is a matter of serious concern in every country in Europe and measures are being taken to provide capital on a large scale to ensure that viable holdings would be established. For some considerable time the money provided by way of State aid in this country has been used more as social assistance than as a means of setting up viable holdings.</P>
      <P>The demand that is obvious now for increased capital on the part of farmers can be viewed in a number of ways.  It can be taken as an indication&mdash;and I am sure it is an indication&mdash;of the enormously increased cost of production. When we refer to increased costs of production in agriculture we are not merely talking about the ordinary imports of seeds, fertilisers, lime and so on.  What I have in mind is the enormous sums of money required today to stock even a medium-sized farm with cattle and sheep.  I am also thinking of the very considerable sums of money that are locked up not only in livestock but in feeding stuffs before the market day arrives.  Those costs have increased enormously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a couple of glaring faults to <Col N="1472" /> find with this Bill.  One fault is that it does not seem to provide sufficient capital for the immense job which should be done for agriculture and which requires to be done urgently.  I believe that before very long we will be back into this House with further legislation to enable the corporation to get more capital.  Another defect I find in the Bill is that there is no indication that the Government are going to provide any additional capital from the Exchequer.  The Government are now enabling the corporation to borrow more money.  I know the corporation have been providing money for agriculture and they have done a very good job as far as this goes.  I personally believe that the Agricultural Credit Corporation, within the limits of the finance available to them, have been doing an excellent job in recent years.</P>
    <P>All of us have the experience that when a reasonable proposal is brought to the Agricultural Credit Corporation it is carefully examined and carefully assessed and if the proposal seems worthwhile the necessary finance, as far as possible, is met by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I have a slight criticism to make and that is that when a proposal is made to them they do not think big enough.  I mentioned a case here before where somebody went in with a proposal to build a piggery with 200 fatteners and the advice given was that the project was much too big.  This is in conflict with the present day thinking in agricultural development.  There should be fostered a closer link between the Department of Agriculture, their policy and thinking, and the Agricultural Credit Corporation. I know there is a link between the Department of Finance and the corporation in so far as credit is concerned but there should certainly be a closer link between the Department and the corporation and money should be made available freely for directly productive purposes.</P>
    <P>There have been many excellent schemes introduced and carried out by the Agricultural Credit Corporation. I am thinking of the fertiliser credit scheme and the loan scheme for livestock which enables farmers to carry cattle over the winter, feeding them on <Col N="1473" /> silage, so as to avoid selling them at the wrong time.  This is a wonderful facility.  This is the ideal type of operation that the corporation should engage in.  I spoke about the need for more money for the Agricultural Credit Corporation and referred to at least some of the increased costs of production.  I did not speak at all about the increase in the cost of machinery and equipment and in the maintenance of fencing, gates and other things of that kind, or of increased labour costs in agriculture today.  One always refrains from referring to increased labour costs because of the very low wages paid to farm workers.</P>

      <P>It enables them to extend their borrowing for investment in agriculture and it is relevant to refer to the various needs of agriculture for this type of investment and to the way the corporation operate.  That is really what I propose to do.  It is wellknown also that investment in farming gives a very low return and that it is imperative that money should be available for agricultural investment at the lowest possible rates of interest.  Otherwise it will not be possible to achieve the full potential of the industry, in which case farmers will not be able to meet their commitments and pay off interest on loans as required.  People outside of agriculture have no idea at all of the low return there is for investment in agriculture.  They have no idea of what land means and what investment in agriculture means.  Such people have no idea of the very low return which people on the land get from their investment.  I hope the Agricultural Credit Corporation will always have sufficient money available to help the people on the land and that there will always be enough people on the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The financial return on agriculture is very low and people should recognise this fact and appreciate why it is necessary that money should be provided as cheaply as possible for farmers.  Another factor which we should bear in mind, and which I have mentioned already, is the need for structural reform.</P>
      <P>This is a job the Agricultural Credit Corporation must be involved in because if we are to keep the maximum number of people on the land&mdash;and I think this is the wish of most people in this country&mdash;and provide them with an acceptable standard of living, we must have a considerable increase, mainly in farmyard enterprises, and farmyard enterprises today are a costly business.  This is the ideal kind of job where the Agricultural Credit Corporation can come in and assist.  A much closer link will have to be forged between the ACC, the advisory services and the Agricultural Institute if we are to ensure the success of their endeavour and investment.  The corporation must work as a team with other services to ensure that when money is made available it will give a reasonable return for the investment made.</P>
      <P>Reference was made earlier to the fact that there had been restrictions on money for debt funding and for land purchase.  I do not wholly agree with my colleague, Deputy Sweetman, in relation to making money freely available for land purchase.  I do not think he advocated that: the point he made was that there were cases where it was obvious money should be provided for a farmer's son who was able to demonstrate he was in a position to make the best use of his land.  That type of purchase should be accommodated, but we should be looking for opportunities to enlarge uneconomic holdings, and money should be made freely available, and should be known to be freely available, by the ACC for this type of purchase.  The aim should be viable holdings by whichever means possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The short-term loans for fertilisers and lime and that type of thing have been a tremendous success.  We should <Col N="1475" /> continue to expand also the short-term unsecured loans for the purchase of livestock and the retention of livestock over the winter months.  This is extremely worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Hire purchase is another operation engaged in by the ACC.  This is an immense advantage to farmers who were forced into high interest rate hire purchase schemes in the past.  People are inclined to get into machinery too easily and too readily without counting the cost and without appreciating the fact that this machinery is lying up for a very considerable portion of the year.  It is a great relief to people who have to buy machinery under hire purchase that they can now be accommodated by the ACC at a much lower rate of interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that well.  That is a situation that has existed for a considerable time.  On the whole, within the limits of the capital available to the ACC they have been doing an excellent job.  My personal belief is that there is an enormous job to be done and a large-scale capital investment programme must be undertaken. This is being done all over Europe and it is the principal concern in the agricultural sector on the Continent. This is a job for a team, and the Agricultural Credit Corporation will have to be a very important part of that team.  Now that they have expanded their business and appointed agents in various parts of the country they have gained an immense amount of experience in recent years and have set about farm expansion operations in a businesslike way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like on this occasion not only to pay tribute to the ACC as a whole but to the man who is now retiring, or who has retired, Mr. Pearse, who has given a very valuable service to the corporation during the years since their foundation.  There is nothing more I wish to add except to say I am supporting the Bill because it is making it possible for the ACC to get more finance.  This Bill does not mean that the State is putting more money into <Col N="1476" /> the ACC: it simply means that we are enabling the corporation to borrow more money&mdash;money which is badly needed for agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> My remarks on this Bill will be very brief.  In 1966, I found it necessary to complain bitterly regarding the action of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, due admittedly to circumstances over which they had no control, in cancelling loans to the tune of nearly £¾ million. In that way they put borrowers in a very embarrassing position.  I am satisfied that it was not the fault of the Agricultural Credit Corporation that they were forced to take this rather drastic action and avail of technicalities to cancel these loans.  I am satisfied they were acting at that time under Government direction.  I subscribe to the remarks that have been made to the effect that the attitude of the corporation towards borrowing has improved very considerably.  It is now considerably easier to obtain money for worthwhile projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the borrowing done in County Cavan is to finance the purchase of small farms to bring existing small farms up to an economic standard. That is a policy I support very strongly.  In counties with small farms it is essential that the size of the farms be increased if they are to become economic units.  In this respect there has been quite an improvement.  I would be inclined to agree with Deputy Clinton that to lend money indiscriminately for the purchase of farms by people who do not own land would lead to an artificial increase in the market value of farms but I think the point that Deputy Sweetman was making is worthy of very careful consideration. State bodies and Departments of State sometimes make mistakes by adopting a broad blanket policy and allowing of no exceptions to it.  There must be exceptions and I say that the Minister and the Board of Directors of the Agricultural Credit Corporation should review this policy.  Where a farmer has two or three sons and where the second and third sons are prepared to enter agriculture as a profession and to stay on the land they should get every encouragement.  In such a case, as Deputy Sweetman suggests, a substantial <Col N="1477" /> portion of the capital required to purchase a viable holding for a second or third son should be made available.  I would not say the entire capital should be made available but a substantial portion of it should be made available.  When a man proposes to purchase a viable unit and if he is otherwise acceptable to the corporation it is good business to lend that sort of person money and it is wrong of the corporation to adopt a hard and fast policy because if you have a hard and fast policy and are not prepared to be flexible you are bound to make decisions that are unreasonable.</P>
    <P>I can see a considerable improvement in the part of the country that I have experience of in so far as the Agricultural Credit Corporation is concerned and part of that improvement is due to the establishment of district offices.  I welcome the establishment of a district office in Cavan town.  I agree that it tends to bring the corporation into closer touch with the farmers and to expedite dealings.  Cases can be investigated on the spot.  The borrowers can come in and consult the Agricultural Credit Corporation officer in the first instance and get a lot of the work done through him.  Admittedly, much of this work was done in the past by solicitors for little or no charge&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i>&mdash;&mdash;but it is less formal when a person can go in and get his forms to fill up and give the information himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From a legal point of view there is another suggestion I have to make.  The corporation have a policy whereby they grant a loan subject to a first charge on the fee simple interest in the existing holding and the holding that is being purchased.  Of course, if that sort of direction is given to the law agent for the corporation he will naturally insist that he gets first charge and, secondly, that it is first charge on the fee simple interest in the land strictly speaking. In rural Ireland there are many cases which would require this rule to be more flexibly operated.  In many places there are titles which are technically defective and which a bank law agent <Col N="1478" /> would not pass and indeed which a counsel for the High Court would not accept but which, nevertheless, are reasonably good titles.  You could have a case where the only outstanding interest might be a person who has been a patient in a mental institution for many years.  It is a moral certainty that the unfortunate person will remain there for the rest of his days and that no claim will be made either by him or by the mental institution on his behalf but yet it is impossible for the corporation to get a first charge on the fee simple of that holding, that is the existing holding&mdash;I am not speaking about the holding that is being bought but the holding which it is desired to bring up to an economic standard.  I would suggest that even if an Act of Parliament or a section of an Act is necessary to enable the corporation to accept such a title it should be done.  With the local knowledge that the local officer of the corporation would have he should be in a position to say that the corporation are not taking any serious risk and they should be prepared to make the loan on that security.</P>
    <P>When things are satisfactory one likes to give credit where credit is due. In County Cavan the demands on the corporation are not in the higher realms of finance but in so far as demands are being made they are being reasonably met.  The only two suggestions I have to make are that substantial loans should be given to set up the second or third son in agriculture and that there should be this improvement to get over the difficulty of technically defective title.</P>

      <P>Reference has been made by previous speakers to the situation in 1965 when, for the first time, the Government&mdash;I agree with the Minister's recollection&mdash;publicly instructed the Agricultural Credit Corporation to discontinue loans for the purchase of land and for the defraying of bank debts.  I am fully aware of the thinking at the time in relation to bank debts because there was a credit squeeze situation and bank managers all over the country, where they thought a farmer when purchasing land would get a loan from the Agricultural <Col N="1479" /> Credit Corporation, were pushing him on to the then Agricultural Credit Corporation and so keeping their total overdraft within their branch to the level which would please the directors of their bank.  I am similarly aware that in the buying of land there was this question of competition between people who had got a promise of a loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation and people who had got a promise of a loan from a bank.  However, I think that on balance it was a mistake to remove completely the right to give loans for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick has adverted to the situation where the second and third sons wished to enter agriculture and the only way to get them on to a viable holding was to buy more land. Surely this was one of the objects of the Agricultural Credit Corporation that was set up by the late Paddy Hogan?  The time has now arrived, even though we might be in this period of high interest rates mentioned by Deputy Sweetman, when we should go back on the mistake we made in 1965.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the clearest recollection of everything that happened in 1965, because it was one of the occasions when I felt I had got something done in this House.  That was the occasion when the Agricultural Credit Corporation was heading the following financial year for the lending of about £7 million and when the removal of the loans to buy land and loans to defray bank debts brought that figure down something of the order of £5.3 million.  However, when we were issued with the Budget tables, the amount to be provided from the Exchequer, having taken into account the repayments of loans that would come into the coffers of the Agricultural Credit Corporation left, as far as I remember, a deficit of £1.7 million.  At the time I had a Parliamentary Question down to the Minister for Finance, the present Taoiseach, and when I raised this Question on the Adjournment the Minister, after a hard struggle in the half hour eventually guaranteed that whatever did not come forward from an improvement in the ACC's finances to make up that £1.7 million during the <Col N="1480" /> year, the Exchequer would provide. However, it must be remembered that it was a big drop from the figure which they had intended to lend during the year, and it was quite correct to say that where loans had been granted the usual proviso in the letter in granting the loan that the loan be taken up within a certain period of months was strictly adhered to.</P>
    <P>I myself had the experience of bringing a Deed from the Registry of Deeds to the ACC on behalf of a constituent, and if the unfortunate man had waited till the following morning he would not have got his loan.  This would have placed him in Queer Street having regard to the credit squeeze situation. The political pressure that was put by the Government on the directors of the ACC reminded one of the action of a welching bookmaker.  There were many unfortunate people who did not get their loans, notwithstanding the fact that every country solicitor knew that for the previous ten or 20 years the letter from him taking up the loan and indicating that the title would be available was always sufficient to enable the loan to proceed even though the period specified in the letter had elapsed.  In fact the practice all over the country was to bring that letter to the commercial banks and to get bridging finance during this period.</P>
    <P>However, there is no point, when discussing this Bill today, in adverting to the sins of the past.  Not one of those sins was a sin of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, which is clearly the best semi-State institution we have. There is no doubt that given the necessary money they can do more for agriculture than the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries or anybody else, because they can follow a practical policy which can be shown by experience to have succeeded in the improvement and expansion of agriculture.</P>
    <P>This is an institution the efficiency of which has been clearly demonstrated. Up to some years ago there was a staff merely in Dublin.  Then there was the appointment of area officers and in some cases the establishment of district offices in which these officers sat and were available.  That was a good step forward.  When one sees one large office in Dublin and that <Col N="1481" /> a number of area officers are sufficient to cover the entire country, one is inclined to compare that with the duplication one sees at the present moment in the commercial banks many of which have now amalgamated with one another and are still running offices in different towns competing one with another, paying these enormous staffs and incurring the enormous expenses necessarily involved and competing in the offering of interest rates for deposits.</P>
    <P>An efficient organisation like the ACC should be encouraged, not to have grandiose offices all over the country but to appoint for the benefit of farmers area officers who know the type of agriculture carried on in the area, who know the type of land a man has, who can judge the viability of the project and who can then report to his directors.  This is an institution for which we should be very thankful. We can allow it expand with confidence and know we shall get for every expansion a return not only for the farmers and for all the people who depend upon the exports of the farming industry but to keep our balance of payments right and to employ people in industry.</P>
    <P>I do not want to disagree with a colleague but I find nothing abhorrent in a change in the chattel mortgage situation.  The issue of loans on chattel mortgage by the Agricultural Credit Corporation seems to me to be an avenue of opportunity.  A man may require accommodation for a certain period for machinery or other things and the issue of a chattel mortgage could be the saving of him; it could make his holding viable and make him an efficient producer.  However, chattels are chattels and the trouble is that chattels can walk off the land.  There is the danger that if a man is, in the old phrase, &ldquo;going bad&rdquo; perhaps when he sells his cattle there are other pressures upon him.  If these ten cattle were the subject of a chattel mortgage he would not repay the moneys derived from the sale of the cattle to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and keep only the profit but would, in fact, use that money for some other purpose.  The funds on chattel mortgage should be freely available to <Col N="1482" /> the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the change whereby the law agent can just get the information, rather than under seal, seems to me to be a good provision.  There are many ways in which chattel mortgages can be and are used.</P>
    <P>My friend and colleague, Deputy Tully, shot down the motor cars.  It is a grand thing to have an argument against something that looks like a mistake at first sight, but the normal farm today could not operate without a motor car.  If the Agricultural Credit Corporation is supplying the liquid finance for the running of a farm, and if needs include a motor car, I see no objection at all to that car being provided at the interest rate charged by the corporation rather than have the unfortunate farmer going to a hire purchase company and paying two-and-a-half times the rate of interest charged by the corporation, the result being that his profits become more deflated.  Everybody knows you cannot exist on a modern farm without a motor car.  The farmer cannot walk out into the street and buy whatever he wants.  Business has to be done.  That is why I do not agree with this global condemnation of the issue of loans for motor cars.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;agri-business&rdquo;, to use an American expression, has benefited most spectacularly from the activities of the Agricultural Credit Corporation. Co-operative societies and others who provide credit for farmers have been facilitated in very large amounts and this has helped the development of agriculture.  This is a field in which the Agricultural Credit Corporation can go on expanding.  The commercial banks are more interested in the short-term overdraft.  The old practice whereby overdraft accommodation was used as permanent liquid capital is fast disappearing. Anyone who has listened to the lectures given in the Irish Management Institute is aware that the commercial banks are tending more and more towards producing counterparts which will provide money longterm for either industry or agriculture, very often trying to get in the process a slice off the business.  In that situation the provision of money for agri-busiter <Col N="1483" /> ness is something the Agricultural Credit Corporation can safely undertake and it could properly extend its activities in that direction.  I am aware that it has extended these activities over the last few years.</P>
    <P>Communal machinery pools have not been availed of to any great extent, because, if the weather is fine, more than one farmer in the pool will want the machinery on the same day.  I and some of my neighbours got together and decided we would have a pool. We wanted a completely efficient system of forage and silage harvesters. We decided what the depreciation would be and we then went to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and borrowed the capital to provide ourselves with the machinery we needed.  We charged ourselves a certain figure per acre, a figure considerably less than the cost of hiring from a contractor, but one we were quite certain would be sufficient to permit us to replace all the machinery after three years and, at the same time, permit of repayments to the Agricultural Credit Corporation. This will mean that over ten years we will have a much more valuable holding in machinery and we will reap considerable benefits simultaneously. I believe our system will work because we have even gone so far as to organise our grass so that one man's grass will be fit today and another man's grass tomorrow.  This is a relatively unexplored avenue and, with a little attention to detail, the Agricultural Credit Corporation could help to a great extent here.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to remove the strictures on loans to buy land where a farmer's son wants to break out on his own.  I also appeal to him to remove the stricture on the giving of a loan to defray a bank debt.  There are people who, because they appear to be progressive and energetic, can go into a bank and raise money without any difficulty.  I know of a case, not in my own neck of the woods, in which a very small bank debt, with a huge security behind it, was recalled.  The father was old and the son had another interest. This is a case in which the Agricultural Credit Corporation could, with the help <Col N="1484" /> of its adviser, go in and set up a project, and give a much larger loan with more than adequate security behind it.  Some years ago the National Bank, the Munster and Leinster Bank and the Bank of Ireland appointed an agricultural adviser, but the scheme is only in its initial stages.  As I say, the commercial banks are more interested in short-term loans.  The refusal to lend money to buy land or to defray bank debts is a mistake and I appeal to the Minister to remove these strictures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally agreed that the provision of adequate credit facilities is vitally essential to the future of Irish agriculture.  For that reason I welcome this Bill in so far as it makes additional capital available for the Agricultural Credit Corporation. As others have said, the Agricultural Credit Corporation is doing a good job.  Nevertheless, I am not satisfied with the facilities available.  The Minister stated that the corporation charges interest at the rate of 8½ per cent on new loans.  In no other country in Western Europe are farmers asked to pay such a high rate of interest.  As Deputy Clinton said, agricultural credit is a necessary prerequisite for an expanding agricultural economy.  In Denmark, loans are made available to farmers at two to three per cent.  As far as I am aware, agricultural credit is dearer in this country than in any other Western European country.  I want the Minister, if possible, to confirm or refute that statement when replying to this debate.</P>
      <P>I honestly believe that, with increasing costs and a declining return, it just is not possible for most farmers to gear their farms to the extent that the amount borrowed from ACC will provide a better return for the farmer and, at the same time, enable repayment of this exorbitant rate of interest.  As far as I am aware, ACC has had a considerable number of cases of difficulty in the matter of repayments.  Only ten days ago, I had to intervene with ACC to prevent them from selling out a farmer in my constituency.  In any such case, I have always found the officials of ACC most kind and most understanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to expand our agriculture <Col N="1485" /> then credit facilities must be made available at a lower rate of interest and ACC must regionalise to a much greater extent.  I welcome the appointment of area officers.  A big snag in the past has been that, from one office in Dublin, the officials there and the board have had to assess the numerous applications from various parts of the country for projects of various kinds.  I believe it was not possible for these officials or for the board to examine and properly assess these various applications. I know of cases where agricultural instructors drew up detailed plans for farmers in support of applications but these applications were turned down by ACC despite the training and expertise of the agricultural instructors.  Furthermore, unless the area officer co-operates with the local agricultural instructor, who, in the final analysis, is the professional adviser in agriculture, and unless there is closer co-operation between ACC and the agricultural advisory services then our agricultural industry cannot make the progress it should make.  Such cooperation between ACC and the agricultural advisory services has hitherto been absent.  Surely the person most competent to assess the credit-worthiness of a project submitted by a farmer is his own local agricultural adviser?</P>
    <P>Since 1965, ACC has not been giving loans for the purchase of land except for the buying of an adjoining holding to make an existing holding more viable.  I appeal for the expansion of these services to enable farmers to purchase farms for their sons.  Take a farmer who has two sons on the land, only one of whom can hope to inherit the family holding.  There should be special facilities to enable that man to buy another farm for the second son.</P>
    <P>There are examples in practically every parish in Ireland of two sons staying on the land and, when the parents get older or die one son succeeds to the farm and the other unfortunate son gets nothing or maybe a few hundred pounds, and, with no training other than in agriculture, he has to take the emigrant ship to seek a living for himself in another country. I am not satisfied that the facilities at present provided are adequate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1486" /> There will have to be a far greater expansion in the whole organisation of ACC.  Now that we have reached the stage of appointing area officers, I believe that regional offices, strategically situated, are the next step, which is vital, and that they should, to a large extent, be autonomous bodies capable of assessing applications for loans from their particular area.  In other words, we must have such offices strategically situated within the dairying regions and within other agricultural regions in our country.  Specialist facilities should be available there.</P>
    <P>Let me give the House an example of how serious the present position is in regard to credit for our agricultural community at present.  There is one commercial concern operating in this country which is providing loans for the purchase of livestock and particularly for dairy stock and that company is charging far higher rates of interest than the bank rate.  It is a fact&mdash;I have definite knowledge of this&mdash;that that company is doing a substantial amount of business, particularly in our dairying areas.  If ACC were providing a proper service, it would not be necessary for our dairy farmers to avail of the facilities of this commercial firm and be compelled to pay such a high rate of interest.</P>
    <P>I feel there is need not merely to provide more capital for ACC but for a critical appraisal of its whole structure and for a greater expansion of these services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to note that there is a general welcome for the Bill and a fairly general approval from all sides of the House of the way in which ACC is doing its business and of the expansion of activities in which it has been engaged in recent years.  May I first deal with the point made by Deputy O'Donnell about the cost of agricultural credit in different countries? One gets a bit tired of hearing these types of phrases, that something in this country is the highest or lowest in Western Europe.  These isolated comparisons are very rarely valid and we have to look at the whole picture. For instance, in taking into account the rate of interest at which the Agricultural Credit Corporation lends a <Col N="1487" /> farmer the money with which to put up an outhouse, for example, you have to take into account that the State gives that farmer a grant of portion of the cost.  The total cost of the operation to the farmer does not attract interest.</P>
      <P>One country in Europe of which I had some experience at one time is Belgium and as far as I remember all their aid to agriculture was exclusively in the form of cheap capital, interestfree loans, loans at low rates of interest and so on.  But that was the only aid agriculture got.  It would therefore be invalid to compare the rates of interest charged in Belgium, in that sort of situation, with the rates of interest charged to farmers here where there are also capital grants made available.</P>
      <P>That is all by the way, but Deputy O'Donnell asked me specifically if agricultural credit here was the dearest in Europe.  I suggest that he has only to go to Great Britain today where he will find that the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation charges 9¼ per cent.  I would implore Deputy O'Donnell not to be using silly sorts of phrases of that type and to discuss the activities of the Agricultural Credit Corporation on a proper, valid basis.  The situation is that the Government and the corporation do endeavour to see that agricultural credit is made available to farmers at the lowest possible rates of interest, taking all the circumstances into account. I do not think that there is any level at which we permit the full economic rate to be charged to farmers and there are a number of special concessionary areas.  That brings me to the point made by Deputy Sweetman about the manner in which we are making capital available to the corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We make capital available to the corporation in two ways, first of all, by taking up share capital in the corporation and secondly by making repayable advances to the corporation.  This mix is a good thing because it gives a certain amount of flexibility in our approach. The share capital is remunerated at a low rate whereas the interest charged on the repayable advances is somewhere near the going rate so that we can ensure that the corporation <Col N="1488" /> gets the capital it requires from the State at a rate of interest which is a mix of two different things.  One is a very low rate of return on the share capital taken up by the State and the more or less economic rate charged on repayable advances.</P>
    <P>The restrictions which were imposed in 1965 were necessary and in fact I remember at that time that they had the agreement of the farmers' organisations. They very sensibly took the view that if capital was scarce&mdash;I suppose capital will always be scarce to some extent&mdash;then it would be better to have it devoted to agricultural and productive purposes rather than have it deflected into less desirable areas like buying land, funding debts, buying motor cars and so on.  There has been a very remarkable change since 1965 in the directions in which the capital lent by the corporation has been going, a far higher percentage of the total amount is now going to productive purposes of one sort or another.  To permit the Agricultural Credit Corporation to advance money for the purchase of land on a broad basis has a number of dangers.  It could mean that the price of farms would be forced up to artificial levels in certain areas. I think that the present restriction is a sensible one.  The corporation will only lend to help farmers to make uneconomic holdings economic by the purchase of additional land.  I would go some of the way with Deputy Donegan in what he said about motor cars.  The corporation were perhaps going too far in 1965 in the amount of money they were advancing for that purpose but I do recognise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the same way for most farmers today the motor car is to a greater or lesser extent an essential requirement and therefore there might be something to be said for reviewing this restriction at a later date.  It would have to be very carefully supervised and policed by the corporation. The restrictions at the moment in the circumstances in which we find ourselves are reasonable and there is continuing expansion all the time in the amount of money being made available for productive purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Clinton spoke about the need for considerable expansion of investment in agriculture.  That is really what this legislation is all about&mdash;to make more resources available to the corporation so that they can lend them to farmers.  The corporation do <Col N="1490" /> envisage that our annual lending will go up by something in the region of half-a-million pounds a year so that there will be a continual expansion year by year of the amount which will be made available.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies mentioned farm structures.  This is a matter, which only indirectly comes within the ambit of the corporation.  It is primarily a matter for the Land Commission but the corporation have been playing a significant part.  Last year they lent about £150,000 to farmers to enable them to enlarge uneconomic holdings. In that way I think they will make a reasonable contribution towards the solution of that particular problem. That was £150,000, approximately, out of a total of £5 million altogether.  A very interesting thing about farm credit is that farmers are creditworthy people and the experience of the corporation in this regard is very satisfactory.  The amount of loss to the corporation could be described as negligible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is that the security is so good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the point to which I was coming.  In recent years as Deputies know, the corporation have been going more and more into the unsecured type of loans, loans to buy stock and so on.  The fact that they have been doing that does not seem to have affected in any way the excellent repayment reputation or performance of the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick discussed the type of security.  I do not want to say a great deal on that because it is very much a matter for the corporation themselves.  We should not attempt to be too specific in our directions to the corporation on something which concerns their day to day administration. I understand however that they are becoming more and more flexible in their approach to this problem of security.  Deputies have generally welcomed the new policy of having area offices.  I think that has been a great <Col N="1491" /> success.  I know it is the intention of the corporation to expand until the whole country is adequately covered by a structure of area offices.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully asked about loans for fruit farming.  Again, that is a matter of detailed day-to-day administration but at present by far the greatest proportion of loans&mdash;something around two-thirds of all the loans made&mdash;are of small amounts, £400 or £500.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a limit, a bottom limit, on the size of farm on which a loan can be made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  I understand the problem the Deputy has in mind is that a man might have only an acre or two and might want to go in for very intensive farming.  As far as I know, there is no prohibition by the corporation on giving that man support by way of a loan, but this is a point I shall mention to the corporation since it has been raised here.</P>
      <P>I do not think there were any other points of particular significance raised by Deputies.  By and large, I think Deputies agree that the corporation, in recent years at any rate, are doing a good job.  We hope they will continue their work in a flexible, sensible way and provide farmers with the capital they need to expand their production and activities.  The Government intend, from year to year, to make available to the corporation whatever money is necessary within the restrictions that have been placed on the corporation's activities.  In other words, subject only to the restrictions placed on the corporation's activities there will be no other restriction and whatever money is needed to meet the types of purposes that are permitted, so to speak, will be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might avail of this opportunity very briefly to dispel any idea which some of our commentators seem to have that there is a credit squeeze in operation in this country at present.  There is no such thing.  It would be very wrong if any general impression got abroad that there is a credit squeeze.  The Central Bank have not yet given their annual advice to the commercial banks as to <Col N="1492" /> the level of bank credit which should prevail during the current year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

      <P>As far as I remember, last year it was in May.  Presumably it will be at the same time this year.  We have a balance of payments problem and it is something on which we must keep a watchful eye but, on the other hand, there are no grounds for undue alarm about it. Subject to that, I would not anticipate that the advice of the Central Bank would necessarily be in any way unduly restrictive.  I do not, for a moment, wish to anticipate what advice the Central Bank will give but from my own knowledge of affairs, I do not anticipate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should amplify that soon.  I went on television to point out dangers and I did not say at any time that there is an economic or financial crisis or even that there need be one.  All I wanted to get across to the public was that if there were unreal expectations of income increases which the economy could not sustain then we would have difficulties and perhaps a major crisis.  But at present there is no economic crisis.  The economy is going ahead.  There is every reason to believe that we should do as well in national growth this year as we did last year unless something happens to upset the situation.  The one thing that could upset the situation would be an excessive increase in money incomes.</P>

      <P>I do not know what exactly is the point the Deputy is trying to establish.  At the beginning of this year the Government issued a statement indicating what the economic probabilities and prospects were and warning that the economy could not take increases in income of the level that some people seemed to be expecting. Subsequent to that we had the development of the maintenance men's strike and the settlement which came as a result of that strike.  We wanted to indicate that there was a danger of excessive increases in money incomes spreading throughout the economy.  The Government and I believed it was our duty and that we had an obligation to point out to everybody concerned what would happen if there were excessive increases in money incomes widespread throughout the economy.  We did that and that is all we did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I propose to relate my remarks immediately to the debate.  If we misinterpreted the Minister's speech and the Government's attitude it certainly would change my attitude towards certain sections of this Bill and it certainly would change my attitude in relation to the statement made by Deputy Sweetman and myself about agreeing to the necessity of the advisability of not making money available to buy land.  I said that I would suggest that that should only be done if a substantial deposit was put down by a man who intended buying a farm if that man had not previously had a farm.  However, in view of what the Minister says, I think that a son of a farmer who wishes to spend his life in agriculture and who cannot obtain a loan from a commercial bank should have money available to him from the Agricultural Credit Corporation if the money is available.  I would say that the same provision should be made with regard to paying off members of a family in <Col N="1496" /> the case of intestacy.  The present position is that the corporation do not make money available for those purposes but in the light of what the Minister has said it should be made available.</P>
      <P>The Minister has accused me of playing politics.  I am not playing politics but the country is entitled to know exactly where we stand.  We are entitled to know whether the Minister was speaking factually when he appeared on television or whether he wishes to retract the advice which he apparently saw fit to give then.  The Minister has invited me to read the speech that he then made but I can only say that when we find the Government announcing their intention to reduce their own salaries and applauding a suggestion that other people do the same, it is not unreasonable to think that an acute economic situation exists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I tell the Deputy quite simply, that since I made my speech on television we have published a Public Capital Programme in which the amount of capital made available under every head for productive purposes has been increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, the Deputy is not playing fair.  He is not being reasonable.  The reason the total amount of capital allocated for agriculture this year is down is because <Col N="1497" /> of the drop in the amount of money available for the eradication of bovine TB but under every productive heading we have expanded the amount of money available to be spent.  That is not indicative of any financial crisis. What I tried to get across in my television broadcast, and since in my talks with everybody concerned, is that the economy is doing well and can continue to do well if there is restraint and moderation exercised in the incomes sphere by all of us.</P>

We were afraid if the expectations that seemed to be held by some sections of the community were sought to be realised we would have difficulties.  I think this is recognised by the trade union movement aswell as the Government.  That is what I am trying to get across.  I never said we had a financial crisis or an economic crisis.  I gave the full facts of the situation. I said we would have a balance of payments of something in the region of £50 million and we were not too happy about it but we were prepared to go along with it because our foreign reserves situation was satisfactory and, provided it did not look like getting any worse, we did not regard £50 million <Col N="1498" /> as something calling for emergency measures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like then, if I may, to refer to what the Minister said and I intend to say it fairly shortly.  I want to ask this question? How can anyone in his senses take this Government seriously?  What the Minister has said here today is perfectly true.  It has been said, could be said and will be said by every Minister for Finance in this State up to this, or likely to be appointed, that any excessive increase in incomes is a source of danger.  Are we to understand that that is what all the pother was about when dramatically the Minister appeared on the television screen and addressed the Irish nation with all the signs of drama created about it?  Apparently it was all just saying the same thing, the same truism and no one was to take it seriously. There was no financial crisis.  We are now told it was just a bad dream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister just cannot understand how anyone could have got the impression that this country was in the middle of a financial or economic crisis.  The Minister's appeal apparently was not taken in the sense the Minister now wants us to take it by his own colleagues because two days later we had a dramatic announcement: &ldquo;Government <Col N="1499" /> Ministers to cut salaries by 15 per cent.&rdquo;  Apparently this was just something that happened and nobody is to take it seriously.  How can anyone take this Government seriously?  They are blowing hot and cold, puffing away, just depending on what the electoral climate might be.  It was expedient three weeks ago to have an apparent financial crisis.  It is expedient now not to have it and we are all supposed to forget what was said and assume the sun has come out from the dark clouds and everything in the garden is wonderful and rosy.</P>
    <P>There will not be a harsh Budget now and the Minister cannot bring it in now in view of what he said today. The people can look forward to the kind of Budget on the 7th May that would be introduced by a Minister for Finance in a country that is doing well. They can expect the removal of many injustices.  They can expect, and are entitled to expect, that the less well off will be amply provided for.  Of course it will be an election Budget because we are going to have an election.  The sooner the better if this is the kind of Government we are going to have in this country, a Government that staggers along from problem to problem and does not know its own mind on two consecutive days.  I find myself at a loss to know what to say.  I can look at what has happened in this country in the last 12 months.  I can get my own feeling as to what progress we are making.  I can look at the constant line of unemployed people.  I can look at the thousands and thousands of homeless people.  I can have regard to the fact that each week and each month thousands of our people are emigrating to find employment elsewhere.  I can make up my own mind as to whether this country is doing well or not.</P>

That is one of the symptoms of a Government that is breaking up, as I believe this Government to be breaking up.  The situation which now exists, I think, can best be solved by an early general election. The sooner it comes the better and after that we can get down to reconstructing the country properly.</P>

      <P>As one of the Deputies who have sat through the debate, I should like to put things in perspective.  Up to a few minutes ago the debate was a serious attempt to keep to the business of the country. There is only one point I wish to ask the Minister about in relation to the Bill.  It is a small point but before I put it I should like to say I am at a loss to understand Deputy T. F. O'Higgins's action in blowing in here and giving us an off-the-cuff political speech.  He did not address himself to the Bill but resorted to the old political stuff.</P>
      <P>People want business done now. People want, as the Minister has in this Bill, a businesslike approach to the country's affairs and I am glad to say that Deputies like Deputy Donegan and Deputy T. O'Donnell addressed themselves to the Bill on a sound, constructive basis.  Then Deputy O'Higgins blew in and resorted to this old-fashioned clap-trap.  If he thinks that will do the country or his Party any good he has another think coming. It is a pity he did not learn more of what is going on in the House before he came in.  We had been conducting the debate in a businesslike way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel myself constrained, with regret, to say this because I am as much out of order in saying it as Deputy O'Higgins was; but it is about time we did the business of the House and the country.  The stuff of Deputy O'Higgins is old-fashioned and belongs to another generation.  It cuts no ice. Every decent person in the country realises the motive behind the clap-trap of Deputy O'Higgins about the <Col N="1501" /> Government breaking up and about what they are doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This Bill is to enable the ruined 15th century church at the national monument, Holycross Abbey, County Tipperary, to be restored for use for ecclesiastical purposes.  The suggestion to restore the church was made to the Government by his Grace the Archbishop of Cashel who offered to bear the cost of restoration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Holycross Abbey was founded about 1181 by the O'Briens, Kings of Thomond, for the Cistercians.  It took its name from a relic of the True Cross which the abbey possessed and which made it a noted place of pilgrimage. The buildings, which contain some 13th century additions, were extensively remodelled about the 15th century. They provide outstanding examples of the distinctively Irish style of Gothic architecture.  Noteworthy features include the ornate Butler tomb and Sedilia, the cloister <Col N="1503" /> erected in the middle of the 15th century and a fresco in the north transept which depicts a hunting scene.</P>
    <P>Certain legal provisions must be made to enable the project to proceed. These are:</P>
    <P>(1)  The Commissioners of Public Works need to be given legal power to restore the national monument: under the National Monuments Acts, the commissioners have power merely to preserve national monuments;</P>
    <P>(2) Doubt requires to be removed as to the power of the commissioners, when granting a lease or licence under section 17 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1954, to require a lessee or licensee to pay the cost of restoration works; and</P>
    <P>(3) It is necessary to remove any prohibition against the use of the church as a place of public worship which may be contained in section 25 (1) of the Irish Church Act, 1869, pursuant to which Holycross Abbey was vested in the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The proposal to restore the ruined church has been discussed with the authorities of the Church of Ireland who have no objections.  The work of restoration will be done under the supervision of the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    <P>I am sure that it will be accepted that a monument restored for appropriate use as a living thing is to be preferred to a ruin.  I accordingly commend this Bill to the House with confidence that it will be favourably received. It is not contentious.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pleasure to see a proposal of this kind brought in by the Minister for Finance.  Certainly it will have our support and complete approval.  Anyone who has seen Holycross Abbey will appreciate the wonderful history that is in the stones and the structure that now remain. Its restoration will be a source of great pleasure to people concerned with the traditions and the history of our country.  This is a Bill which aims <Col N="1504" /> at that very desirable object and it certainly is to be commended.  I would like to think that more of this kind of work will proceed in the years ahead. There are many historical monuments and buildings throughout the land which are, of course, national monuments and preserved as such but many of them would, in fact, lend themselves to worthwhile restoration.  We in this country have a Christian traditional history going back into the early hundreds and much of that traditional history is written in the stones and the structures of ruined churches and monasteries, ruined ecclesiastical settlements. Where restoration is possible it would add to our pride in the history of our people apart altogether from the fact that it would also make it easier for those who come to visit us to appreciate that we are a very old and proud nation with a tremendous history and tradition behind us.</P>
      <P>I certainly welcome this Bill.  The Minister said that it is a non-controversial Bill.  I wish we had more such Bills.</P>

      <P>This is a remarkable Bill in that it is the first, as far as I can remember, which will cost the taxpayers very little money, if any at all.  I suppose the cost of the administration of the Bill is about the only cost that will be involved as the good Archbishop proposes to pay the cost of doing the job.  Naturally we support the Bill.  Even if it did mean that the necessary money had to be found it should be supported.  This is something which the Commissioners of Public Works have been doing.  The only snag is that, as has been stated, they preserve instead of restoring.  I often wonder whether the restoration of some of those buildings might cost very little more than their preservation.</P>
      <P>In a section of the Minister's brief he says:</P>
      <P>It is necessary to remove any prohibition against the use of the church as a place of public worship which may be contained in section 25 (1) of the Irish Church Act, 1869, pursuant to which Holycross Abbey was vested in the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>

      <P>I merely want to follow up one point made by Deputy Tully.  I agree that perhaps there are other buildings that could be similarly considered and the lead that has been given here by the Archbishop is very commendable.  I would go a little further than Deputy Tully.  I think the taxpayer might be prepared to contribute in certain very selective cases and I take Deputy Tully's point about maintenance.  I have in mind another monument not far from Holycross, the famous Rock of Cashel.  I wonder what would it take to restore the roof of that?  You would have to be selective. A few selective ones like that might be of some mundane value apart from the cultural and spiritual value of the restoration.</P>
      <P>I would like to add my voice to the welcome for the Bill.  It is a very commendable one indeed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the arrangements made by Dublin Corporation with the trustees <Col N="1507" /> of the Nelson Pillar following the blowing up of the monument on the 8th March, 1966, and the subsequent removal of the remains of the pillar. Arising from negotiations between the Dublin City Manager and the trustees it was agreed that the trustees would hand over the site of the pillar to the Dublin Corporation in consideration of an agreed amount of compensation and a statutory indemnity against any possible claim arising out of their actions in accepting these arrangements.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides for the payment by the Dublin Corporation of the agreed compensation to the trustees. Section 3 provides for the vesting of the site of the pillar in the Dublin Corporation and enables the corporation to appropriate it for any of their purposes.  It also terminates the trusts of the trustees.  Section 4 contains the indemnity for the trustees to which I have already referred and validates the actions of the trustees in accepting the compensation provided by the Bill and in not restoring the monument.</P>
    <P>It is not intended that any part of the compensation to be paid to the trustees under section 2 of the Bill shall be borne by the Dublin City ratepayers. I have obtained the approval of the Government to the recoupment from the Exchequer of the total amount involved and provision will be made accordingly in my Department's vote for the present year.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> If I might start off in a light strain, I cannot help thinking that the late Admiral Nelson would probably regard the Minister's introduction in our native language as adding insult to the injury caused by the events which took place on 8th March, 1966.  The Bill is introduced to regularise a position which arose out of the demolition of the pillar on 8th March, 1966, and subsequent days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two points of view about the removal of the pillar.  Some people might regard the pillar purely as a symbol of the past, as a monument to the victory of this small country in so far as twenty-six out of the thirty-two <Col N="1508" /> counties are concerned and as a harmless thing that could be left there.  Other people might regard it as a monument of the time in our history when we were oppressed by a foreign power.  I can appreciate the point of view of those people who might look upon it with hatred and as something to be detested.  My own attitude would be to regard it in the first light, as a symbol of victory and as something that had been overcome.</P>
    <P>When I read the Bill here today, at first sight I really found it very difficult to discover the reason for the Bill or to know why it was necessary to introduce it.  I eventually came to the conclusion that the only necessity for the Bill&mdash; and this seems to be supported by the Minister's short introduction &mdash; is that section 4 of the Bill indemnifies the trustees of the monument from any actions which may be taken against them arising out of their sale of the site to Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>That seems to be the only reason for the Bill, because Dublin Corporation could have bought the remains of the pillar from the trustees without this Bill just as they could acquire any other land in or around Dublin which they require for road widening or other purposes.  Section 4 provides an indemnity, as I say, and perhaps section 3 avoids the necessity for a formal conveyance of the fee simple interest in the property to the corporation.  I searched the Bill for some evidence that the Government were paying any money that it was necessary to pay in this connection.  At first sight I thought I was not reading it correctly because it would be only reasonable that the Government should have decided to pay this £21,750 together with the other expenses to the Dublin Corporation. It is as the result of the policy of the people who removed the top of the Pillar and the action of the Government in making the remainder of the structure safe and removing it that this compensation becomes payable.  Therefore, it would not have been unreasonable to save the ratepayers of the city of Dublin from this payment of £21,750.</P>
    <P>I understand there were certain malicious injury claims arising out of <Col N="1509" /> the removal of the top of the monument and I should like the Minister to tell us how they were dealt with: did the corporation pay them as ordinary malicious injury claims?  Furthermore, I understand that considerable damage was done by the State in removing the lower portion of the pillar.  I do not suppose that that damage could properly have been dealt with under the malicious injuries code.  I should like the Minister to tidy up this matter once and for all by telling us, first of all, by what authority the bottom of the pillar was removed and, secondly, who paid for the damage caused by the second effort.  I should also like the Minister just to refresh our minds by telling us the amount involved in the malicious injuries claims and the amount of damage, if any&mdash;and I think there was some&mdash;done in removing the remainder of the pillar.  Neither I nor my Party object to the Bill but, as I said, I should have thought that the Government would have regarded this as a national rather than a local matter and paid the cost involved, thereby relieving the ratepayers of the city of Dublin.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> That should have been made clear in the Bill.  It would have been only reasonable to include a provision to that effect, thereby putting the matter beyond doubt and not making two bites of the cherry.  I am glad the Minister has clarified the position.  I searched the Bill for such a provision and, while I am not glad it is not in the Bill, I am glad I did not misread the <Col N="1510" /> Bill.  Will the Minister tell us why he did not include a provision in the Bill? Had he done so the reason for the Bill would have been quite obvious.  The reason for the Bill would then be three-fold: it would confirm the agreement entered into between Dublin Corporation and the trustees of Nelson Pillar; it would automatically transfer ownership from the trustees to the corporation, giving the necessary indemnity to the trustees against claims for breach of trust; finally, it would indemnify the Corporation of Dublin against the payment of any compensation involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I would go so far as to say that the cost of malicious injuries claims should be borne by the Government. The malicious injury code is, of course, out of date.  It was introduced to try to enforce on ratepayers the liability for maintaining law and order in their particular locality and to punish the residents of that locality for any malicious injury or lawlessness that might occur in the locality, the presumption being that the damage was done by the residents in the locality.  I do not think the Minister would maintain that those who removed the top of the pillar necessarily came from the city of Dublin or that the idea was inspired within the city of Dublin.  It is quite on the cards that they may have come from a part of the country over which this House does not exercise jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>There are all sorts of allegations as to who removed the top of the pillar, who plotted the operation, as to the country from which they came and as to those who brought them here.  I do not believe the people of the city of Dublin should have to pay anything. If there were a war between this country and a neighbouring State compensation for damage done would be paid on a national and not on a local basis.  On the basis of equity and fair play, the only objection I have to the Bill is that I believe the matter should be dealt with on a national basis and the Bill should have included a provision to that effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested there are two schools of thought with regard to the pillar. He himself is of the opinion that the pillar should have been left there.  I am of the opposite view.  I believe it should have been removed years before it was removed.  The method of removal was not one I would commend, but the actual removal left an uninterrupted view of one of the loveliest streets one could wish to see.  It was only when the pillar was removed that people began to appreciate the beauty of O'Connell Street.  It is a good thing CIE have not got buses high enough to block out the view completely; they are doing their best with the buses they have. Someone should take CIE to task for using O'Connell Street as a public bus park.</P>
      <P>The Bill indemnifies those who might be held liable against responsibility for compensation or for replacing the monument with another statue of Nelson.  Those who have little knowledge of explosives compared the damage done on the first occasion with that occasioned when the military authorities removed the bottom of the pillar.  An explosion high in the air does not cause anything like the damage an explosion at ground level causes.  The Army authorities did the job very well indeed.  It is a pity there was a certain amount of damage done.  I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that the State should accept responsibility for the payment of compensation.  The damage caused on the occasion of the first explosion was not very great. There must be a reason why a section was not included providing that Dublin Corporation would not be held liable.</P>

It is not for the purpose of criticism, but merely for my own information that I am asking him if this is the reason it was done in this way.  Certainly, we have no objection whatever to the passage of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I did say in my opening statement that it was not intended that any part of the compensation to be paid to the trustees would be borne by the Dublin city ratepayers; that the Government had approved of recoupment from the Exchequer of the total amount involved and that I am taking account of that in my Estimate for the present year.  The purpose of the Bill is merely to give effect to the agreement reached between the trustees and the corporation and nothing more.  I did not see any point in including something else in the Bill when it can be done in this other way.  The recoupment of the corporation is a completely separate matter.  While it could conceivably have been incorporated in the Bill, I do not think it was necessary. It was better that the Bill should deal with this one simple matter of giving effect to this agreement between the trustees and the corporation.  The only liability the corporation will have will be for the malicious injuries claims arising out of the first explosion, that is, the illegal explosion.</P>
      <P>Claims to the extent of £1,622 have already been paid by the corporation in connection with the illegal explosion: that is in respect of 22 claims totalling £1,622.  The total number of claims received is 36 and the amount of the claims is £18,865.  That does not mean that the actual payments will amount to that sum.  In addition, the Department of Finance have made payments in settlement of 29 claims by firms and individuals arising from damage caused by the second explosion.  That amounts to £2,283.  The Department of Finance have made payments to Dublin Corporation, amounting to £8,038, in recoupment of the cost of services rendered by the corporation in respect of completion of the demolition of the monument.  Some extra expenses, incurred by the Department of Defence, amounted to £139.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1513" /> The total payments, under section 2 of the Bill, to be borne by the Exchequer will be £27,000.  The total cost, to date, has been £39,082 of which all but this £1,622 has been paid by the State.  There are 14 other claims for malicious injuries outstanding in respect of the first explosion against Dublin Corporation but we do not know how much the awards made on foot of these will actually amount to.</P>
    <P>I do not think there was any other point to which I need refer.  That should settle the matter satisfactorily. The Minister for Justice is examining the malicious injuries code generally. Whether or not a revision of that code will be proposed has not yet been decided.  The Minister for Justice is responsible for that matter and is examining the whole position with regard to malicious injuries.  I thank the House for the reception given to the Bill.</P>

      <P>During the course of the Seanad debate on the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1967, I indicated that I proposed to consider the introduction of legislation to control the demolition of habitable houses.  This Bill has been prepared to give effect to that objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the economy is to progress, as it <Col N="1514" /> has done in recent years, expenditure on industrial and commercial buildings is necessary in order to generate the capital resources to finance further development and the construction of the additional houses which, we all know, are needed.  While it may be necessary in carrying out industrial development to demolish some fit houses or to apply them to nonresidential uses it is essential that the demolition or change of use should be controlled by the housing authority.  The object of the Bill is to provide this control.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill outlines its scope in some detail.  Apart from the exceptions referred to in paragraph 1 of the memorandum, the Bill provides that, in most cases, the permission of a local authority will be required for the demolition or change of use of houses.  The local authority can refuse permission or they can give it subject to conditions either requiring the provision of alternative accommodation or the making of contributions towards the cost of providing it.  In determining the application, the authority will be required to have regard to the state of repair of the house and the adequacy of the supply of housing available in their area.  The Bill provides at section 4 for a right of appeal to the Minister by the owner against the decision of the authority.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also strengthen the powers of authorities to deal with cases where an owner may deliberately permit a house to fall into disrepair in order to avoid the consequences of the Bill.  Provision is being made for an appeal by the owner to the circuit court in such cases.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the main provisions of the Bill will remain in operation until 31st December, 1972, unless they are continued in force after that date by an Order made by the Minister under section 13.</P>
    <P>Deputies may ask why planning controls could not be used to secure the purposes of the present Bill.  The main reason is that, under section 26 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, local authorities are restricted, in dealing with an application for planning permission, to <Col N="1515" /> considering the proper planning and development of their area.  These provisions would not enable a local authority to refuse permission for work involving the demolition or change of use of a habitable house simply because there was, in their area, a shortage of accommodation, or to impose the other conditions based purely on housing considerations for which the present Bill provides.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Notwithstanding what the Minister has just said, this Bill is in effect an amendment to the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  We have been endeavouring to establish a proper system of planning and control here for a long time past.  A Bill was enacted in 1934 or in 1935 and another one in 1939.  I do not think either of those Bills ever got off the ground, so to speak.  Then we had the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, which was finally passed on the 7th August, 1963.  That Act set out to do a lot of things in the name of the common good.  It is an Act which runs to over 90 sections and a few Schedules and it definitely did make very elaborate provisions for regulating planning and development and for the change of use of property.  It dealt in detail with those matters.  The Bill got a very full reading in this House and the Fine Gael Party attempted to improve it as best we could.  We objected to the planning systems provided in the Bill but the Bill was passed by the Government despite objections to it by this Party and despite our efforts to improve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time I have complained here about a tendency to implement rather far-reaching Bills by delegating to Ministers powers to make regulations.  I am on record on numerous occasions as having said that, while I agree that regulations in minor matters may be necessary, they should be cut to a minimum and power should be given direct from this House.  I have pointed out that it is no answer to say that regulations must be laid on the Table of the House and must be there for 21 days and if a resolution is passed annulling them within the specified <Col N="1516" /> number of days they cease to have an effect.  I say that that is not an adequate protection.  That Bill left this House with the huge machinery for implementing it by regulations made by the Minister and section 4 set out that certain developments should be exempted developments.</P>
    <P>Now, it is worthwhile considering this section for a moment or two because it starts off saying:</P>
    <P>The following shall be exempted developments for the purposes of this Act:</P>
    <P>and it goes on to outline different developments in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i) and they are all substantial matters.  Paragraph (a) refers to the use of land for agricultural purposes and (b) to development by the council of a county in the county health district.  Paragraph (c) refers to the development by the corporation of a county or other borough in such borough; (d) refers to the development by the council of an urban district in such district.  It means that any development by a local authority is regarded as an exempted development. Paragraph (e) refers to development consisting of the carrying out by the corporation of a county or other borough or the council of a country or an urban district of any works required for a construction of a new road or the maintenance or improvement of a road.  That is perfectly reasonable. The paragraphs go on in that line but then we have subsection (2) which says:</P>
    <P>The Minister may by regulations provide for any class of development being exempted development for the purposes of this Act and such provision may be either without conditions or subject to conditions and either general or confined to a particular area or place.</P>
    <P>Then it goes on to say that:</P>
    <P>Regulations under this subsection may, in particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing paragraph, provide, in the case of structures or other land used for a purpose of any specified class, for the use thereof for any other purpose being exempted development for the purposes of this Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1517" /> Subsection (3) states:</P>
    <P>Reference in this Act to exempted development shall be construed as reference to development which is&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any of the developments specified in subsection (1) of this section, or</P>
    <P>(b)  development which, having regard to any regulations under subsection (2) of this section, is exempted development for the purposes of this Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister did make regulations under that section and one would have thought that regulations under that section would have dealt with trivial matters, matters which the Minister and his advisers had really overlooked bringing before the House or matters which were so trivial and too numerous to write in in black and white.  That is what the ordinary layman would expect because here we have a huge document running into 227 pages, that is over 113 pages in each language. One would have thought that the Minister would have had very little to do by way of regulations and that any regulations would have dealt with trivial matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister did make regulations and if he had not it would not be necessary for us to consider this measure.  The regulations which he made are known as the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, (Exempted Development) Regulations, 1964.  They are very involved but it is set out in these regulations which were published on the very day after the Act came into operation that the classes of development specified in column 1 of Part I of the First Schedule shall be exempted development. There are many classes there and class 7 is worth reading because it is the portion of these regulations which made this amending Bill necessary.  It sets out that any alteration consisting of the plastering or painting of any external part of a building shall be an exempted development.  I understand that was specifically raised in the House at the time and it was said that it would be unreasonable to make it obligatory on a citizen to apply for planning permission to plaster the outside <Col N="1518" /> of his house or paint it.  I agree with that.  I want to read the whole provision without interruption.  This class 7 specifies developments which shall be exempted and in respect of which the citizen will not have to apply for planning permission.  It reads as follows:</P>
    <P>An alteration consisting of the plastering or painting of any external part of any building or the demolition of any building, save where the preservation of such building is the objective of a development plan or, during the period prior to the making of a development plan, is declared by resolution of a planning authority to be an objective which they propose to include in a development plan.</P>
    <P>Here we have tucked into clause 7 six words which make the demolition of a great number of the buildings in this country an exempted development and it meant that in villages and towns and cities you could have gaps, houses pulled down for one reason or another, without any permission from the planning authority.  That is supposed to be done in the name of the common good according to the preamble to the Planning and Development Act of 1963.</P>
    <P>That was nothing less than an obvious absurdity.  Whether it crept into these exempted development regulations of 1964 accidentally or whether it was deliberately put in, I do not know.  The Minister will probably say that there was a saving device here, in that it was not possible under the regulation to demolish a building where the preservation of such building is an objective of a development plan.  We know that these development plans apply only to a certain specified number of buildings and they deal really with buildings with which we are not concerned in this Bill.  They deal with buildings like the Georgian houses, buildings having an artistic or architectural value.  The fact is that while a small farmer in County Cavan, under this measure, could not erect a pair of piers at the end of his lane without applying to the local authority and publishing a notice in the papers or attaching it to his property, a vast number of the houses of Dublin city could <Col N="1519" /> be knocked down for one reason or another.  That was the result of the Act and the regulations.  In my opinion it was the direct result of legislating by regulation, a glaring example of it.</P>
    <P>We know in fact that at a time when capital was scarce and when housing conditions were appalling&mdash;as they still are&mdash;by virtue of this clause 7 many houses were in fact knocked down that should not have been demolished and many costly and expensive office blocks were built in their place unnecessarily, premises which could not be afforded in the then state of the national economy.  It is difficult to know wheher they can yet be afforded having regard to the contradictory statements of the Minister for Finance on television and in this House today. However, that was the position.</P>
    <P>Ministers and their advisers do not like to admit they make mistakes but this glaring mistake was discovered after the 21 days allowed for putting down a motion to annul.  Let us face it &mdash;if we want to say that the opportunity was there to study these regulations within the 21 days during which it was lying on the Table, this is true but these regulations are mass-produced: it would need a special committee to sit on them and study them.  I think I had to point out that on the passing of the Road Traffic Act something like 118 sets of regulations were to be made. They are made and ready for publication at the same time as the Act.  It is certainly mass production.  These exempted regulations run into 43 pages of closely printed material.  But the mistake was discovered and it was found that houses in Dublin were being pulled down wholesale.  The Fine Gael Party then introduced in the Seanad the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1967, to remedy this outrageous provision in the exempted development regulations of 1964.</P>
    <P>I want to be candid about it.  The Bill introduced in the Seanad in 1967 dealt with houses that some people might respect as architecturally worth preserving, and at the same time dealt with habitable dwellings.  Senator Garret FitzGerald and Senator O'Quigley introduced the measure and <Col N="1520" /> made it perfectly clear that they did not regard the drafting of the Bill as the last word and that they were prepared to accept amendments to it but the Minister took the attitude that he was not concerned with what some people might regard as architectural gems and that in so far as habitable buildings were concerned, the Bill introduced by us did not attain its object.  As far back as 5th July, 1967, the Minister opposed this measure in the Seanad and his Party voted it out of the Seanad against the votes of all other Parties there.</P>
    <P>This is the position and it is necessary that the record be right in respect of it.  What the Minister now proposes in this measure was covered in precisely the same way by the measure introduced by Fine Gael in the Seanad in 1967.  If the Minister did not wish to fall in line with the Georgian Society or with these other societies interested in culture, he could have introduced amendments and said that he would not prohibit the wholesale demolition of houses but that he was prepared to accept their proposal to prohibit the demolition of habitable dwellings. However, he did not do that.  He objected to the whole measure and said simply that it would not work.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is, in effect, what we sought in 1967, I agree with it in principle as does this Party.  It is wrong that it should be possible to tear down habitable dwellings and replace them by expensive and luxurious office blocks at a time when the housing conditions in this city and in the rest of the country are appalling and need a crash programme to clear them up&mdash; a crash programme that has not been in evidence in recent years and which is not forecast in the famous Third Programme for Economic Expansion.  Why it took the Minister so long to introduce this Bill following the July, 1967 debate in the Seanad is beyond me.  Of course, the Minister is only a man: he is not superman and having regard to the very full programme which he inflicted on himself last year&mdash;a form of self-torture&mdash;I do not suppose that he had time for trivialities like this but I would remind the Minister that Fine Gael also introduced another measure <Col N="1521" /> dealing with town planning at the beginning of last year before the Minister literally and metaphorically lost himself in the referendum and that was a local government planning and development appeals Bill to revise the system of hearing planning appeals.  That system which we objected to and exposed in this House was very much coupled and interwoven with these exempted development provisions that I am speaking about.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister why he is introducing these two Bills. Although this Bill is called the Housing Bill, the Long Title of it is:</P>
    <P>An Act to make provision to control the demolition or use otherwise than for human habitation of certain houses, to amend Section 66 of the Housing Act, 1966, and to make provision for other matters connected with the matters aforesaid.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the Short Title of the Bill&mdash;Housing Bill, 1968&mdash;the Long Title makes it abundantly clear that this, in effect, is a planning and development Bill and nothing else.  At the same time, there is another Bill on the stocks of the House known as the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1969.  In so far as I know and in so far as I can ascertain that is a Bill to change the present system of planning appeals.  I do not know why we could not have the two at the one time because the Bill which we are discussing now is introduced because the Fine Gael Party introduced the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1967, in the Seanad and the Bill known as the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1969, which is on the Order Paper is introduced because Fine Gael introduced and had a long discussion here on our Planning Appeals Bill of last year.  The Minister should have dealt with these two measures as one measure.</P>
    <P>If there were no Title to this Bill anybody who had experience of the Planning and Development Bill would regard this as an amending Bill.  The provisions for appeal which apparently the Minister is going to change through another Bill which he expects to introduce later on, are to continue in this <Col N="1522" /> Bill.  The Explanatory Memorandum sets out here:</P>
    <P>A person who wishes to demolish or change the use of a habitable house will be required to obtain permission from the housing authority unless the demolition or change of it is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and this is followed by certain conditions. The next paragraph says that an appeal may be made to the Minister by the applicant against the decision of an authority within three weeks from notification of a decision.  It is provided, according to the Explanatory Memorandum with the Bill, that the housing authority who will have one application to the housing authority and an application under the Planning Act to the planning authority should make them to the same person.  Those appeals have one thing in common. The authority, whether it be the housing authority or the planning authority, must give its decision on the application within five weeks beginning on the date of the receipt by them of the application or of such further particulars as they may require.</P>
    <P>I think that is a very worthwhile provision in a very undesirable system. It is undesirable in so far as the appeal end of it is concerned but paragraph 2 of the Explanatory Memorandum dealing with the provisions contained in the Bill which we are discussing today and the similar provisions&mdash;the time may not be exactly the same&mdash; contained in the Planning and Development Act, 1963 acknowledges that it is unreasonable that an applicant for planning permission should be held up indefinitely.  I could not agree more. So long as we have this undesirable system of appeal, there should be a statutory obligation on the Minister or his inspector to give a decision on a planning appeal within a reasonable time.</P>

      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy but in the piece of legislation before the House we are concerned with the demolition of habitable houses and the amendment of the Act in so far as that is concerned.  It is not possible under this Bill to deal with planning generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I respectfully agree but I am drawing the attention of the House to the fact that provision is made in the Bill that if a man is going to knock down a habitable house he must apply to the housing authority to do so and the housing authority must give a decision on that application within five weeks of the receipt of the application or within five weeks of the receipt of any further information which it thinks necessary. Then I am going on to point out that if the citizen is not satisfied with that decision he has a right of appeal to the Minister for Local Government but I am pointing out that the Minister is not statutorily bound by any such provision nor is it sought to bind him in this measure by any such statutory limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pointing out that that is highly undesirable.  I am pointing out that it is undesirable because of my experience of the operation of exactly similar provisions within the Planning and Development Act, 1963, operated by the same Department and in that I say I am entirely in order because I know from my experience that under the Planning and Development Act where we have exactly similar appeal provisions to those which it is sought to write into this Housing Bill where a citizen found it necessary to appeal to the Minister for Local Government against a refusal by the planning authority of his application for planning permission there was delay&mdash;I am not precise in this&mdash;over several months between the lodging of the appeal and the original hearing.  I am specific in this because I have a file not very far away.  The case was heard on 30th June, 1968, and no decision has yet been given unless it was issued since Easter&mdash;I want to be absolutely fair and accurate about this&mdash;because I have not been in touch with my office since Easter.  I am not attributing any ulterior reason for that decision not being given.  Probably it just is not possible to consider the case in the time but I say it is quite unreasonable.  In fact I say it is more than unreasonable in this case because the man involved had committed himself to over £1,000 expenditure.  He is a man in a small way of business.  I want to submit that <Col N="1524" /> if in this measure we are going to have the same system of appeal as we have in the Planning and Development Act we should impose on the Minister, to protect him from himself, a similar time limit to that which applies to the authority of first instance, which in this measure will apparently be the housing authority, and which in the Planning and Development Act is the planning authority, but which in fact is one and the same person in most organisations, the county manager or the county council.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is an unreasonable request.  I want to be as delicate as I can about the case I have been speaking about as I do not want to say anything that might prejudice an innocent person whose only anxiety is to get the decision and get on with his work.  It is quite unreasonable that there should be delays of that type.  If we adopted the suggestion I make here that the appeal tribunal would have to give a decision within a certain time there would not be such delays.</P>
    <P>This Bill will require further consideration in Committee.  I see there is a right of appeal here to the circuit court against certain decisions of the housing authority.  I regard that as a move in the right direction, as being desirable.  That is the sort of provision we sought to put into the Planning and Development Act, 1967, and that is the type of provision which I hope the Minister has in mind in his Planning and Development Bill, 1969, which, I notice, is second last in the queue on the Order Paper.</P>
    <P>We are now discussing the principle of this Bill and, as I have said, I accept the principle.  I am glad the Minister has accepted the clear and well thought out arguments put to him in this respect in the Seanad and I am sorry it took him so long to bring in the Bill.  I suppose he has a legitimate excuse because the Minister, God knows, did more than his share of legislative work last year.  This House, according to my best calculations, devoted about 330 hours to legislation and the Minister for Local Government occupied 119 hours of that time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If he had not devoted so much time to so much tomfoolery last year he could have brought this Bill in earlier.  The pity is that this Bill did not come before us at an earlier date.  I hope it will now get a Second Reading and that we can get on to the Committee Stage when we can do our best to improve it.  I am sure the Minister will have learned from experience that all the suggestions that come from this side are not without something to recommend them.  If he had accepted some of the suggestions from Deputy Treacy and myself last year on his referendum proposals he would have saved himself the embarrassment, and the country the expense, of that exercise. If he had accepted the Bill in the Seanad and if he had accepted our Planning Appeals Bill here, both measures would now be law and would be the instruments by which we could be doing the same thing as this Bill proposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important measure, long overdue.  It is a brief but important Bill because it will provide for the control of demolition of habitable houses.  Those of us who are members of local authorities and are particularly concerned with rehousing our people and with the maintenance of historic beauty in our towns and cities have been appalled by the wanton indiscriminate destruction of so many houses in the hearts of towns and cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The absence of such a measure as this has been responsible for the blitzing of the heart of this city, for the destruction of the centres of towns and cities and the pushing outwards of their populations.  There has been indiscriminate destruction of houses which could have been made habitable if an effort had been made.  Consequently, we have lost much historical and architectural beauty by the operation <Col N="1526" /> of bulldozers.  We have seen swept away in this city buildings of the greatest value, historically speaking.  It is a pity someone was not there to cry halt.  Therefore, I enthusiastically support the Minister in this measure which will control in some way interference with buildings of the kind I have mentioned.  It will act as a challenge to change of user with particular reference to rehousing needs.</P>
    <P>The lack of legislation of this kind has had disastrous consequences and has been primarily responsible for the eyesores to be seen in towns and cities. Buildings were allowed to crumble for want of repair and maintenance and this led to their eventual condemnation. They had been allowed to stand in a ruinous condition for years, the local authorities being unable to do anything about them because of lack of financial accommodation.  There is no doubt that hundreds of these buildings and houses could have been repaired and utilised for rehousing.  Instead, they were condemned indiscriminately and the sites provided a unique opportunity for land speculators to move in by surreptitious means.</P>
    <P>We know the land speculators moved in surreptitiously and eased people out of tenement houses in the heart of cities.  They pressurised them out with the support of the law and arranged a situation through which properties were condemned as dangerous by local authority officials.  The areas were cleared eventually and built thereon were large glasshouses&mdash;skyscrapers&mdash; for business purposes, offices and the like.  It would have been a far better thing if these buildings were retained for the rehousing of the native people of these parts, if the historical beauty of these Georgian buildings and the like were retained, rather than that we would have seen the emergence in this city and in other cities and towns in this country of all these glasshouses, these skyscrapers.  It is to be greatly deplored that so much public money has been allowed to be spent on the erection of such lavish, grandiose buildings at a time when we had not resolved at all the problem of the slums, of the hovels, here and elsewhere throughout the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1527" /> There were certain pieces of legislation which assisted local authorities in repairing houses of the kind covered in this measure.  There was section 19 of a previous Housing Act which was availed of by very many housing authorities; and in instances where the landlord was unable or unwilling to carry out repairs stipulated by the local authority the local authority was empowered to step in and carry out repairs to the house or houses in question. Valuable work was done in this regard in the purely short term, but the work was very largely negatived by reason of the fact that the local authority did not own the property concerned and also by the fact that the local authority was not empowered to continue the maintenance of these houses which they repaired.  So it was that the money expended on the initial repair was very largely wasted because deterioration set in again.  The good work went by default and the houses eventually crumbled away and were condemned.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why we have had demolition within the heart of our communities is the policy of the Department of Local Government down the years in respect of their requirements for new house premises&mdash; the amount of square footage required for the house, the depth required, the stipulation that gardens should be provided front and back.  The difficulty in securing planning permission from the local authority to build houses in street formation was, in particular, responsible for the demolition that has gone on down the years.  It seems to have been a policy of the Minister's Department and of the Minister's predecessors &mdash;I do not blame him particularly in this regard&mdash;that there should be extensive gardens back and front, green belts and the like.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy but this Bill does not enable us to discuss planning generally.  We are confined in this Bill to the question of habitable houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Leas-Cheann <Col N="1528" /> Comhairle's ruling but I am seeking to make the point, and I submit with respect that it must be relevant, that in the conservation of houses of this kind we must be backed up with effective regulations from the Minister's Department to empower local authorities not merely to renovate and repair such houses but to rebuild if necessary in street formation.  I am pointing out the conflict in respect of planning whereby we visualise the erection of houses on virgin land on the outskirts of our towns and cities with little regard for the feasibility of repairing existing buildings in our community centres and assisting local authorities by way of planning approval to have houses built in street formation.</P>
      <P>I am submitting to the Minister that it is very important, if we are to conserve the important centres of our community life, that he gives approval to housing authorities to build without too much regard to depth and to the desirability of amenities such as gardens. If this had been done in the past we would not have so many houses indiscriminately demolished as has happened in several centres throughout the country.  It is also my experience as a member of a housing authority for some considerable time, that engineers and architects, when asked for reports in respect of housing generally, with particular reference to the feasibility of repairing houses at a reasonable cost invariably say that in their opinion the house or houses referred to could not be repaired at reasonable cost.  They seem to opt all the time for the erection of a new structure rather than the repair and maintenance of the old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must respect their views as professional men but I have known their decisions to be confounded on many occasions and the dwellings which they said could not be repaired or renovated at reasonable cost were in fact and are standing up to the stresses of time.  In many instances if their recommendations had been challenged many of the colossal eyesores we have to contend with nowadays would not have been created and the vast working class population of this city would be rehoused very largely within the confines of the Liberties and would not be <Col N="1529" /> pushed out at great inconvenience and expense to an alien area, an alien community in such areas as Ballyfermot, Coolock, Ballymun, and so on.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that it is not opportune at this juncture to develop this important subject of housing.  The housing of our people must be our first responsibility. This measure, short as it is, will do something towards that end.  It will not do the things we would like to see done in respect of a crash programme to solve this problem but it will ensure, I hope, that many of the dwellings of architectural beauty, buildings which have been such a pleasure and a joy to our people, will be preserved.  I said earlier that I have seen bulldozers sweep away houses which contained memories of great men, great literary men, great patriots, places of very great historic interest swept away for the erection of some glasshouse.  It is time someone said stop to public vandalism of that kind.  This Bill does something in that regard and, therefore, I have the honour on behalf of my Party to indicate our full support for it.  That is all I wish to say at this juncture, but I shall have other observations to make on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not the opportunity of being here during the contributions of the Fine Gael Party, but certainly, in common with the Labour Party, we thank the Minister for introducing this Bill.  It is a very important measure from the point of view of the city and county of Dublin.  As a public representative I have seen a number of dwellings which, if they had been maintained, there would be no need to demolish.  The main purpose of this Bill is to secure more effective control over the demolition or change of user of houses, and under it any person who wishes to demolish or change the user of a habitable house will be required to obtain permission from the housing authority.  I intend to be very brief on this Bill.  I should not like to let it go through without saying a few words on it; and, possibly, on Committee Stage I shall have some more to say about it. As a backbencher of the Fianna Fáil Party, I accept this as more of the progressive legislation which at all times <Col N="1530" /> has been forthcoming as a result of the philosophy of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether I am within the scope of the Bill in making this point, but may I say that, in the main, the landlords in the constituency I represent do maintain their houses in good condition; however, there are the exceptions to the rule.  I do not believe in being personal in public life, but it should go on the record of the House that there are a number of landlords who have houses which they are allowing to deteriorate to the misfortune of the families who live in those houses. This is one of the main reasons why I am making a contribution to this debate.</P>
      <P>I know of a house which has been allowed to deteriorate and in which there are ten families.  This Christian gentleman is bleeding the flat dwellers in this so-called house to the extent of £3 10s 0d, or £4 in some instances, per family.  I hope this Bill will do something to bring that type of landlord to his senses.  This is not the type of Christianity we want in this country, where ten families are allowed to dwell in squalor to the benefit of a landlord without a social conscience.  We welcome this Bill as evidence of the progress of the social conscience of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>As a Dublin man I have seen this city deteriorate and some of our more beautiful Georgian dwellings being pulled down for the building of skyscrapers. I hope this Bill will prevent, to some extent, the continuation of a policy for which, by the way, the Department of Local Government are not responsible.  Speculators have come in and knocked down quite beautiful, habitable houses.  I am not suggesting that all office blocks are ugly or that they are not needed, but certainly to my own knowledge a number of office blocks have been built to the detriment of people who were living in habitable houses.  I trust this Bill will do something to curtail that type of anti-social behaviour.</P>
      <P>May I take the opportunity once more of congratulating the Minister for this piece of progressive legislation which has received a welcome from all sides of the House?</P>

      <P>This Bill needs no further commendation from me in the light of what Deputy Andrews and others have said, but there is a long-term aspect of this which I should like to mention to the Minister from my own experience.  I am talking specifically about the centre of Dublin City of which I have some little knowledge. There are two classes of buildings existing.  There are the local government new flats and dwellings built in relatively modern times.  Some of these are let in flats and are in relatively good condition.  The provisions of this Bill are, I think, essentially for the preservation of these, because such dwellings have a good potential life and can be satisfactory for the tenant.</P>
      <P>However, there is another type of building involved here which is of vital importance.  It is the building which has come to the end of its life, the building which has already deteriorated.  Indeed, many of them have been pulled down; they were usually referred to as tenements. Although for the moment, while there is pressure on housing, the application of a Bill of this nature is vital and necessary, there is in the long-term a danger that this might be considered a solution of the problem.  I do not think it is.  In order to avoid controversy, let us take buildings that are already gone: there was a block of houses in Upper Dorset Street, the whole area around Queen Street, which were hardly in a habitable condition.  But if, for instance, those buildings were still there and the conditions of this Bill were to be applied in any practical sense to them, they would not operate to the advantage of the tenants except purely as a temporary measure.  It might have the long-term adverse effect of giving the impression that the problem was solved and not providing for buildings that have to be erected to cope with the housing situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By way of comment, and this is comment only, there are still in certain parts of the centre of the city buildings to which this Bill, if it becomes an Act, will apply and must apply as a short-term or emergency measure, but in the long term, I suggest that another <Col N="1532" /> view must be taken.  I subscribe to the principle that, if these buildings have to come down, then they should be replaced by dwellings for human habitation rather than by office blocks.  I am not to be taken as going against in any way the intention to preserve the area for human habitation but the point is that some of these buildings, although they can be maintained for the moment, would not in the long term be a satisfactory solution to the housing situation.  I know one area in which renovation was tried on a pretty expensive scale.  I had an opportunity of comparing the conditions in some of these reconstructed and renovated houses with the conditions in the new flats.  I think most people will agree that where you have a properly designed flat in the centre of the city&mdash; as a Dubliner I sympathise with those who say: &ldquo;Keep them in the city area&rdquo;&mdash;the conditions in that flat are infinitely superior to the conditions in what I call the experimental section where houses have been renovated. These houses are, in fact, well on the way to becoming tenements.  One must differentiate between the solution of the immediate problem and the long-term social solution.</P>
    <P>There is, too, the problem that in these doubtful areas there are buildings still inhabited, buildings which would properly come within the scope of this Bill; these are areas in which ultimately local authority building should take place.  One Deputy referred to shifting people from their own areas.  How can one develop a site unless one first clears the site?  In Dorset Street there are flats on one side.  I presume the opposite side will be developed in due process of time. When the flats were being constructed those who lived in the houses the flats replaced had to be accommodated elsewhere. One of the things that strikes one about housing is how quickly people react to their improved social circumstances once they get proper housing.  It was fashionable 30 years ago to be cynical about the housing drive and to say that new slums were being created.  That has not been the evolution.  In all these new housing areas one is struck&mdash;there are exceptions of course&mdash;by the way in which <Col N="1533" /> the houses are kept.  I just make this point in passing.</P>
    <P>This Bill is necessary and desirable. One sees empty buildings which will presumably be demolished and replaced with office blocks.  These empty buildings could accommodate a sizeable number of people.  The question is how effective will this measure be.  We are thinking in terms of an effective number of people and speculation about office blocks, and so on, is hardly justified.  The Minister is quite correct in bringing in this legislation and that is why I make these comments in regard to the long-term view of the housing situation.</P>

      <P>I suppose Deputy Fitzpatrick had to say something derogatory about the Bill.  It would not do to be completely in agreement with it.  That may be why he based his speech on the allegation that this was, in fact, an amendment in disguise of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act.  Deputy Fitzpatrick knows, I think, that that is not so.  As I pointed out, the Planning Act could not be effectively used for this purpose. Under that Act it is already possible for planning authorities to decide that a house, a group of houses, or buildings which they deem worthy of preservation must be preserved.  It is only possible to deal with houses from the purely housing aspect under a Housing Bill.  Even if permission for demolition were required under the Planning Act, the mere fact of a house being a habitable house, and there being a shortage of houses in the area, would not be a valid planning consideration.  It is only under the Housing Acts that we can hope effectively to control the demolition of habitable houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out that during the period from 1948 to 1962, when the old planning controls were in operation, there were approximately only 450 applications received by Dublin Corporation for permission to demolish or change the use of habitable houses under the 1948 legislation.  Both Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Treacy tried to make it appear that there was a wholesale knocking down of houses in Dublin <Col N="1534" /> and in other cities and towns throughout the country.  The facts are otherwise.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Why did the Minister introduce the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know of any case in which houses were knocked down in respect of which approval for the development of the site had not already been obtained.  I do not think anybody can show that there has been any indiscriminate knocking down of houses, irrespective of planning approval having been obtained for the development of the site.  It seems to me to be quite clear that, if this matter were to be dealt with as Deputy Fitzpatrick demands it should be dealt with under the Planning Acts, these houses would, in fact, have been knocked down because permission would have been granted if it were only planning considerations that had to be taken into account.  It is only under housing legislation that the demolition of habitable houses can be effectively controlled. Deputy Treacy, as was to be expected, went on with his usual allegation that this &ldquo;blitzing&rdquo; of the heart of the city had been carried out in order to provide lavish, glasshouse skyscrapers and that State and public money was spent on the building of these grandiose skyscrapers.  I do not know of any case in which the State has been involved in the erection of any lavish and grandiose skyscrapers.  In fact, I know of only one building in this city that qualifies for that description of being lavish, grandiose and a skyscraper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it can be described as a skyscraper.  Certainly, it cannot be described as being lavish from the point of view of being obviously a building that could not even remunerate the capital spent on its erection.  I know of only one such building where the percentage of floor space taken up by the service corps is obviously so great that the building itself has not even got the merit of being an economic undertaking.  I have the doubtful pleasure of spending the greater part of my life looking at this example, which is the only example I know of in the city, of waste of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that it is only under housing legislation that we could hope, effectively, to control the demolition of habitable houses.  I have just as much dislike as any Deputy here of the erection of these expensive office blocks.  As the Minister responsible for housing, I hate to see comparatively scarce capital being in my opinion wasted on this type of construction.  There is no point in exaggerating the position.  The estimate of the amount spent in 1968-9 on office blocks is £4 million and, in that year, the amount expended on housing was £57 million.  There is no useful purpose served by Deputies in pretending that the proportion of our capital resources being spent on office blocks is as great as they pretend it is.  That is the estimate for last year.  I am quite certain that, in other years, the proportion would not be significantly different. While I certainly should like to see even that amount also available for housing, there is no reason to believe that, if it was not spent on the purpose for which it was spent, it would in fact have been made available for housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had to wait until Deputy Fitzpatrick was almost concluding to find out his real complaint.  Apparently, his real objection to this being done in the way it is being done&mdash; which is, in fact, the only effective way &mdash;is that it does not secure the preservation of every building that any individual <Col N="1536" /> or society would like to have preserved.  It does not set out to do that.  It sets out to control the demolition of habitable buildings only.  The only realistic way to provide for the preservation of buildings either of historic interest or architectural merit is the way it is done and that is that the planning authority should make a survey of their area and decide what buildings, either individual buildings or groups of buildings, it is both desirable and practical to preserve.</P>
    <P>The idea that any individual should be able to demand that particular buildings or groups of buildings should be preserved at somebody else's expense is just not practical.  The preservation of buildings is not the simple proposition some people like to pretend it is.  Unfortunately, the question of cost is involved.  Buildings which have outlived their usefulness cost money to be preserved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick complains that application for permission to demolish a habitable house must be made to the local authority whereas application for permission to develop the site of the habitable house must be made to the planning authority.  It is obvious that considerations with regard to demolition or otherwise of the house are housing considerations and that it is the housing authority that should consider them.  Equally, it is obvious that it is in the housing departments of local authorities that they should be processed.</P>
    <P>I am in full agreement with those Deputies who have referred to the desire of people, families, who have lived and grown up in the city of Dublin or in the centre of other towns, for that matter, to continue to reside there.  I fully support the efforts of Dublin Corporation to provide as much accommodation as possible in the centre city area.  It must be quite clear to everybody that the housing problem in Dublin city or elsewhere could not completely be solved&mdash;certainly within any kind of a reasonable time&mdash; merely by the provision of centre city flats.  We must depend to a very great degree on the building of houses on new sites.  To get a sufficient area in the city to clear and develop as a flat <Col N="1537" /> site requires, in the first place, the transfer of the population from there to somewhere else.  Apart from that altogether, it is a fact that the average cost of a centre city flat in Dublin is between £5,000 and £6,000 whereas the suburban type of Corporation house, giving roughly the same accommodation, now costs in Dublin from about £2,700 to about £3,000.</P>
    <P>While I agree that the greatest possible number of centre city flats are required in order to enable as many people as possible who want to live in the city to live there, it is obvious that if we are to tackle the housing problem purely on the basis of providing dwellings at the rate of one dwelling for what you could provide two for, it will take much longer to deal with the problem satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>This Bill is being brought in because it is the only effective way in which this problem could be dealt with.  It is <Col N="1538" /> one that is not appropriate to the Planning Acts and as I said I do not know of any case in which houses have been demolished and in respect of which permission for the proposed development had not already been granted.  So it is obvious that if planning considerations only are to apply, the question of the house being a habitable one and there being a housing shortage would not and could not receive the consideration we desire it should receive.  That is why this matter is being dealt with in this manner by a Housing Bill and I would ask the House to pass it.</P>
