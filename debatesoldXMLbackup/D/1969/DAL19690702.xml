      <P>One of the outstanding and colourful personalities of Irish public life Seán Dunne was universally popular, with colleagues and political opponents alike, both inside and outside the House.  It was characteristic of him that, even though in indifferent health, he should have fought the recent election campaign with the customary zeal and enthusiasm which he had displayed in the various elections he had contested since the year 1948.</P>
      <P>An eloquent debater, who could be most trenchant in his criticism, his contributions to our proceedings here were always well-informed and frequently interspersed with the amusing witticism and the humorous aside.  The quality of his energy and of his capacities was shown by his increasing reputation as a playwright, author and journalist.</P>
      <P>Recurring illness in recent years in no way lessened his zest for political life.  Unselfishly, he continued to the end to give to public service all the strength and vigour which he possessed.</P>
      <P>Through his untimely death his party has suffered a severe loss.  His constituents have lost a most dedicated Dáil representative in whose interests he was a devoted and untiring champion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to convey to the late Deputy's widow and mother and to the other members of his family the sincere sympathy of <Col N="16" /> every Member of the House.  Guímid cabhair Dé dóibh ina gcaill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Deputy Brendan Corish be nominated as Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>We, in the Labour Party, fought the recent general election with the express intention of forming a Labour Government and we intend now to fulfil our trust to our supporters by still going it alone and nominating Deputy Brendan Corish to the position of Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We realise fully that our numbers in this House will not make our nominee's candidature successful but we are conscious of the fact that in the recent general election the Labour Party secured the highest vote ever secured by that Party in a general election.  It is, I think, appropriate to point out at this stage that the Labour Party did not lose the election, did not fail to secure the Government of this country in the general election, because of its policy.  There was, unfortunately, a most scurrilous and scandalous campaign waged by both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael during the course of the election and this calculated campaign <Col N="17" /> of scurrility and scandal resulted in the Labour Party's policy being completely distorted.  It will not be our task in this Dáil to either change or shift as has been suggested by some commentators, from the policy contained in &ldquo;the New Republic&rdquo;.  We will pursue the policy adumbrated by us on behalf of our supporters and, indeed, as we believe, on behalf of the people of this nation, as vigorously as we can both inside and outside this House.</P>
    <P>As I stated, it is not our intention to change one iota of our written policy. What we do intend to do is to correct the gross misrepresentation of that policy, scandalously and consciencelessly indulged in for both personal and political ends by members of both the Fianna Fáil and the Fine Gael Parties.  We are fully confident that at the end of this ninteenth Dáil we will have been successful in that mission. We are also confident that the only policy that can cure the many ills besetting the people of this nation is true socialism, the socialism contained in our policy document.  We face this nineteenth Dáil with the full confidence that at the end of its life the correction we are going to undertake will have been effected and, when next a Labour spokesman rises in this assembly to propose the Leader of the Labour Party for the position of Taoiseach, it will not be, as may be commented by some, an isolated political gesture; it will be because the people, realising the content of our policy and appreciating its gross misrepresentation by others, will give the necessary support to ensure the election of a Labour Taoiseach in the twentieth Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion and, in seconding the nomination of Deputy Brendan Corish, I speak first with great pride and, secondly, with great humility in the fact that the members of the Labour Party should have asked me, a new Member of this great Assembly, which good men died to win us, to undertake this task.  Like Deputy Cluskey, I see the nomination of Deputy Corish on this day as a symbolic gesture, a gesture which will be of great importance in the future history of our country.  It is a symbol, first, of the fact that the Labour Party, the <Col N="18" /> oldest Party in our land, is true to its independence, true to the uniqueness and integrity of its policies.  There may seem to be few of us here, but we speak for many.  We speak for the 223,000 Irish men and women who, in the face of gross misrepresentation, gave us their first preferences.  On their behalf, we repeat our dedication to our pledged policies.  This is no alien pledge.  It is the pledge of Pearse, who said:</P>
      <P>I have insisted upon the spiritual fact of nationality.  I have insisted upon the necessity of physical freedom in order to ensure the continued preservation of that spiritual fact in a living people.  I now insist upon the necessity of complete control of the material resources of our nation in order to ensure the completeness of that physical freedom.  The nation has a moral obligation so to exercise its public right as to secure strictly equal rights and opportunities for every man and woman within this nation.</P>
      <P>These are not my words.  Neither are they the words of any communist.  They are the words of Patrick Pearse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nomination of Deputy Corish to the position of Taoiseach on this day is a symbol, too, of something else: it is a symbol of the determination of the Labour Deputies to use Dáil Éireann in the years ahead as the instrument of the people of Ireland. We here now dedicate ourselves to the use of the national Parliament to protect the rights of the ordinary people of this country as, perhaps, they have never been protected and watched over before in this Chamber. I am sorry that that should give rise to laughter.  I was under the impression that on an occasion so solemn as this and, secondly, on the occasion of a maiden speech laughter is, to say the least of it, unusual.  I am sorry I was misinformed.  If there seem to be few of us now to do this task, soon, very soon, there will be more and while we await that day to come we here, though few, are not downhearted.  On the contrary, we are doubly determined. We know that that day must come and, on behalf of our people, and on behalf of those who will join <Col N="19" /> us here, we repeat what Terence MacSwiney wrote years ago on the &ldquo;Principles of Freedom&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>We have not survived the centuries to be conquered now.  We shall endure and the measure of our faith will be the measure of our achievement and of the greatness of our future place.</P>

      <P>(and)</P>
      <P>Pádraig Ó Leathlobhair (Patrick Joseph Lalor).</P>
      <P>It is not necessary, Sir, but it has become the practice to indicate the Departments to which these Ministers have been assigned.  They are as follows:&mdash;-</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Department of Health, Erskine H. Childers.  I also propose to nominate him to be Tánaiste; Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, Neil T. Blaney; Department of Local Government and Department of Social Welfare, Kevin Boland; Department of Justice, Michael Moran; Department of External Affairs, Patrick J. Hillery; Department of Finance, Charles J. Haughey; Department of Transport and Power, Brian J. Lenihan; Department of Labour, Joseph Brennan; Department of Industry and Commerce <Col N="24" /> and Department of the Gaeltacht, George Colley; Department of Lands, Seán Flanagan; Department of Education, Pádraig Faulkner; Department of Defence, James Gibbons; Department of Posts and Telegraphs, Patrick Joseph Lalor.</P>
    <P>I should like to add that it is my intention to set up a new Department which will deal with housing, physical planning and construction.  I believe this is necessary because of the growth in building activity, the increased demand for improved housing, the need to co-ordinate planning and building activities generally and in order to ensure that the maximum advantage will accrue from all our resources&mdash; human, physical and financial &mdash; in this area.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the new Department will, in itself, require careful planning, involving as it does rationalisation of a number of public services. This will commence right away preliminary to the enactment of legislation which I hope will be introduced if not in the current session then early in the next.  I propose to assign the new Department to Deputy Neil Blaney. When this has been done the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government will be lightened and this will give the Minister for Local Government the opportunity to devote more of his time to social welfare, a field in which he has a deep knowledge and wide experience.</P>
    <P>I propose to assign Roinn na Gaeltachta to the Minister for Industry and Commerce because I believe that, by doing this, we will ensure that our efforts to promote suitable industries in the Gaeltacht areas will be fully and effectively co-ordinated with our industrial progress generally.</P>
    <P>The Government will, in due course, appoint Parliamentary Secretaries to be assigned to each of the three Ministers I have mentioned as well as other Parliamentary Secretaries as will be appropriate.</P>
    <P>I should like, Sir, at this stage too to express my regret that Deputy Frank Aiken and Deputy Michael Hilliard will no longer be members of the Government. Frank Aiken has had a long <Col N="25" /> and distinguished career&mdash;as a soldier in the fight for independence, as a member of the Fianna Fáil Party and as a member of successive Fianna Fáil Governments. Michael Hilliard also has had a distinguished career&mdash;in the fight for independence, as a member of our Party and as a Minister.  Both carried out their duties in every sphere of public services with the same zeal and high standard of integrity.  I am glad that my Party and I will continue to have the benefit of their valued advice and their considerable experience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies nominated by the Taoiseach for appointment as members of the Government indicate that it is the same Government with a few changes.  There is, of course, evidence in the changes that there were certain internal difficulties that had to be resolved and the shifting of certain Ministers from one Department to another is indicative of some of these difficulties and the proposed addition of one Department to another being held by two Ministers is an example of the internal problems that have to be surmounted by placing people as strategically as possible from the point of view of keeping all sections satisfied. However, the real conclusion which can be drawn from this set of nominations is that it is the same Government with a few minor changes. There is no indication that the changes proposed will mean any improvement. In fact, it is reasonable to assume that the Deputies assigned to the particular Departments can hardly be worse in the Departments to which they have been now sent than they were in the Departments they are leaving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has not indicated the policy the Government will pursue and the priorities it will adopt, with the exception of the announcement towards the end of his speech that it was proposed to establish a Ministry of Physical Planning and Housing.  Anyone who is familiar with the present grave housing crisis must be convinced that urgent and effective Government action is necessary to solve it.  It is difficult to believe that the Minister whom it is proposed to assign to it will <Col N="26" /> be any more effective in a new Department with a new name than he was when he was previously Minister for Local Government.  It is obvious that the recent incumbents of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries from the Fianna Fáil benches, one after another, fell foul of the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>We had hoped to hear from the Taoiseach this evening the priorities the Government would adopt and what economic, social, educational and other questions were regarded as most urgent and most in need of solution by a Government charged with the responsibility of carrying policy into effect.  We will support any realistic policies which we consider are beneficial to the people or to particular deserving sections of the community. We will oppose vigorously any policies which we consider are not in the public interest or which are framed solely for party political purposes.  There are many grave social, economic and educational problems of an administrative character which affect many sections and groups in the community. The recent election has not removed or simplified any of these problems.  It is well that the Government and the House should realise this.  The recent election has not indicated that the policies which were being pursued in the past by this Government will ease the housing problem, or that the Government's policy will ease the grave situation that exists in respect of rates, health services, social welfare categories or recipients, or in respect of pensioners and retired personnel generally.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are a number of problems that have been magnified and increased as the year has passed.  There is the urgent question of our whole trading relationship, the worsening of our balance of payments and the increase in the adverse trade balance. All these problems now await solution. Some of them have been aggravated by Government policy.  We have no clear indication in respect of any of them as to what the Government propose to do or how they propose to deal with them in order to provide remedies for them. We have advocated what we believe. <Col N="27" /> are desirable and necessary reforms. There is some evidence of the Government's policy in the decision to establish a Ministry of Physical Planning and Housing and to transfer to it some functions which are at present undefined in order to deal with certain particular problems.  In recent years we have expressed concern at the failure of the Government to tackle the housing problem by providing essential services and serviced land.  The Government should divest any member of the Government, irrespective of what Department he is assigned to, of the responsibility for planning decisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Deputies Deputies">
      <NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We introduced a measure designed to transfer to an impartial, independent tribunal the whole question of planning appeals.  Subsequently, the Government brought in a measure which fell with the dissolution of the Dáil.  The terms of that measure have not yet been published.  The title was on the Order Paper.  That was a recognition and an admission of the concern which we had expressed about the anxiety felt throughout the country because of allowing planning decisions to be taken by any individual Minister.  It was felt that this was bad and dangerous and was slowing up decisions.  It was placing a responsibility and a duty on an individual Minister which no individual should have placed on him without adequate safeguards or restrictions.  We still believe that it is right policy to transfer such decisions to an impartial, independent tribunal.</P>
      <P>We have advocated a changed health service which would provided health services based on a comprehensive insurance system designed to provide cover for the needy sections of the community and, at the same time, to avoid the present inequities of the great burden being indiscriminately borne by those who, in many cases, are least able to bear it, and without any distinction as to income capacity or, on the other hand, entitlement to benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to our economic trading position, we believe that the time has come to review the present Free Trade Area Agreement.  We have never suggested, <Col N="28" /> nor do we believe, that we can trade without proper trading arrangements either with Britain or with other countries.  We have advocated&mdash;and we believe it is essential &mdash; that, if the British Government operate the system in which they depart from the terms of the Agreement by imposing penal measures on exports from this country, it is not in the national interest to continue to reduce tariffs each year on the 1st July as has been the practice since the Agreement was negotiated.  We are entitled, under the terms of that Agreement, to take retaliatory action and effective countermeasures when the British operate a policy detrimental to Irish industry, to the welfare of Irish workers and to the employment of Irish workers in industrial concerns.</P>
    <P>We hope that the nomination of Deputy Hillery as Minister for External Affairs will involve his bringing to that Department the decision which he took, but which apparently has so far failed to be followed by any effective action, when he announced the decision, as Minister for Labour, to provide some assistance to Irish emigrants in Britain who were in need.  He advocated in the course of opening a new employment exchange in Cahirciveen, I think, that some assistance should be given.  It appeared to conflict with the policy of the outgoing Minister, Deputy Aiken, whose view was that assistance would be given if emigrants returned but that it was not the policy to pursue it there.  Some nominal figure has been included in the Supply Estimates I think of £10,000 for the current year for the purpose of affording certain assistance to Irish emigrants in difficulties.</P>
    <P>I want to advert to another major problem which exists at present in respect of the sphere of activities of the Department of External Affairs&mdash; the appalling situation, that is obvious to everyone, in Nigeria and Biafra.  We have consistently expressed the view that so far as that complex internal situation is concerned we are not concerned with the political settlement. We are concerned with achieving two objectives.  In so far as our diplomatic or other initiative can be made effective to urge on the principal suppliers of arms, Britain and Russia on the one <Col N="29" /> hand, and France on the other, to cease supplying arms to the combatants in that area, to try to urge the responsible international bodies concerned to arrange for a cease fire.  If that objective and if those aims cannot be realised by effective international action. as a small country concerned with the preservation of peace in any area of the world, and particularly in an area in which we have close ties, particularly in respect of missionaries but also in respect of teachers, administrators and welfare workers, who have distinguished themselves and reflected glory on the country which sent them there, by their service and by their contribution to humanity in many spheres, there is an obligation on us to exert our influence to get international action either through the United Nations or through any other responsible body to use its resources, and if necessary, through other governments concerned, to express our deep concern at the action of the British Government and Russia particularly on the one hand in supplying Nigeria and the French Government on the other hand.  There are, of course, other suppliers and one of the reasons which has been advocated in the past for not taking action in this regard is that because it would not be effective we should do nothing about it.</P>
    <P>The other area in which this country could exert its influence is to get relief supplies through any agency that could get into Nigeria and Biafra, not to confine ourselves to the legalistic, narrow approach that the only authority that will be assisted by our contributions as a nation is the International Red Cross.  This is a situation in which humanity is suffering and suffering gravely.  It is a problem which has touched not merely the hearts and consciences of people here but has evoked response from countries and people more remote than we are or than our missionaries, our administrators, our welfare and other workers such as educationalists are from Nigeria and Biafra.</P>
    <P>It behoves us to exert and to use our influence and it is this sphere that we can support by direct action what we believe is sound international policy and practice to devote a <Col N="30" /> decided percentage of our gross national product in respect of relief of distress and suffering.  We have, of course, sent by sea and by air relief supplies to those areas.  We have made some contribution.</P>
    <P>The crisis which faces that area at present imposes on this Parliament, on this Government and on this country an obligation.  I have no doubt that the people of this country are more than willing to help.  In fact, no national appeal that any of us can remember undertaken by voluntary organisations ever evoked the response which the appeal last year evoked in order to bring relief and help to this area.  I have eschewed always the idea of getting involved in any way in the political or other questions involved in this complex situation.  I know there are many who will propound solutions for this situation.  It is easy to propound solutions from afar, particularly when they cannot be made effective.</P>
    <P>We want to achieve two objectives, to try to limit the supply of arms and, above all, to bring in supplies, by impressing not merely on other Governments and countries concerned, but particularly on the Nigerian authorities the anxiety and concern we feel at the recent decision to prevent Red Cross supplies getting in and by the deplorable decision to shoot down Red Cross relief planes bringing assistance and supplies.</P>
    <P>We have in this Dáil many grave problems to deal with which will tax not merely the ingenuity of the Government but also the resources of the Deputies elected to serve here.  We believe in offering constructive, realistic, purposeful and effective contributions in the nation's interest.  We offer that in the certain knowledge, which should be realised not merely inside but outside this House, that this Party alone is the alternative Government, that this Party alone offers the only realistic alternative that is prepared to do the real work, not seek to evade or avoid our responsibilities either as a Party or as individuals.  However the Government got their majority to implement their policies, we are conscious of their defects and we are aware of their limitations.  We know their inadequacies <Col N="31" /> to deal with the many problems which affect the country.  They have now the responsibility of implementing what they regard as a mandate to adopt and implement the policies they have been talking about.</P>
    <P>It is well to realise that in this election Fianna Fáil, although getting a majority of the seats, had over 100,000 fewer votes for them than were cast against them, that they have an obligation to work for the people and their interests, not to operate policies for Party political purposes for the purpose of acting against particular sections or for other sections, that there is an inescapable obligation, as I said here in the debate some months ago on the trade union legislation, to serve the interests of the Irish people, all the Irish people; that there is an inescapable obligation to serve their interests as a people and not the interests of a particular party or section.</P>
    <P>We propose by our contributions to the debate, our suggestions and proposals for administrative and policy changes so far as possible to advocate and pursue the interests of the nation as a whole and to serve not one section or one group but to serve what we believe are the real needs of the Irish people, economic, social, educational and political.  We aim to make what we regard as a contribution of character, ability, effectiveness and value to Parliament and to the various questions to be discussed here.</P>
    <P>We have not heard, as I believe we should have heard from the Taoiseach and the Government, any indication of the attitude it is proposed to adopt in respect of our international trading position, what action it is proposed now to take in view of the developments and changes in Europe in respect of the application for EEC membership. In addition, there are two major matters that were the subject of discussion in the last Dáil &mdash; what changes it is proposed to make in the very objectionable sections and parts of the Criminal Justice Bill that fell in the last Dáil and what action it is proposed to take in respect of the High Court decision concerning the Livestock Marts Act.  These are questions that arise in addition to questions <Col N="32" /> relating to health and other matters already adverted to.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the university merger.  I notice that Deputy Lenihan has been moved and Deputy Faulkner has been proposed for the Department of Education.  There is no indication from the Taoiseach of whether he had adopted a change in policy.  Some people believed that the policy being pursued by the outgoing Minister was one that indicated that the Government was only prepared to operate the policy as laid down by the Minister at the time.  I think the discussions that occurred not merely in the institutions concerned but throughout the country indicated that was the wrong attitude in respect of education as well as in other respects and that the people want service and not dictation, that they want consultation and co-operation and not arrogance.  If the Government substitutes such an approach in the life of this Parliament they will be assured of a constructive co-operative contribution from Fine Gael.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before the House is to the effect that we approve the nomination by the Taoiseach of the members of his Government.  In our view it does not make much difference who are the members of the Fianna Fáil Government if they continue to pursue the same policy they pursued in the last Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result of this election has been that Fianna Fáil got 75 seats.  This is the outcome but there are other outcomes which I think the Fianna Fáil Party will regret as the years go on. I do not think it would be amiss if I were to talk about the campaign over the last three or four weeks.  First, I want to state the position, attitude and approach of the Labour Party towards the campaign.  I said at the beginning of it that I hoped the campaign would revolve around the policies of the various Parties.  I do not think anybody in Fianna Fáil or on any other side of the House could say that we were not honest with the people in that we framed the policy and put it before the people for decision.  We offered our policies and we did not attempt to hide anything contained in them.  I should <Col N="33" /> like the House to know&mdash;or should I repeat?&mdash;how these policies were formulated.  There was nothing sinister or alien to the traditions or beliefs of the Irish people.  These policies were formed at two representative conferences of the Labour Party by delegates from all over the 32&mdash;let me repeat&mdash; the 32 Counties.  They were unanimously approved and, as I said, put before the people.  We saw in them an attraction for the young people of the country and they were represented by us as policies that were suitable for the future of this country and not merely policies for one general election.</P>

      <P>I submit it is just as relevant as the Fianna Fáil Party policy or lack of policy.  There has been no restriction in this sort of debate in the whole time I have been in Dáil Éireann.  I shall not go into detail in regard to the policy or lack of policy of Fianna Fáil or the policy we produced for the election.  I believe our policy would put an end to the continuing social and financial ills of the country.  We told the people that these national problems needed long-term solutions and could not be resolved by budgetary concessions during an election year or by any piecemeal approach such as was persistently pursued by Fianna Fáil and for that reason we opposed the membership of this particular Government because they have pursued&mdash;and it seems from their campaign throughout the country they are still determined to pursue&mdash;a conservative policy.</P>

    <P>We are here at the beginning of the 19th Dáil and we find the problems that face us now are the self-same problems that faced us at the beginning of the last Dáil, the one before that and the one before that again, and if you like to go back, in many Dála before that.  On the 2nd July, 1969, we are here again and I suppose it would be repetition if I were to list the problems <Col N="34" /> and difficulties and ills that still beset this country.  We still have emigration at the rate of 20,000 a year.  We still have the situation in which since 1957, some 250,000 Irish people were forced to emigrate and in which one million people who were born in Ireland find themselves now resident in Great Britain.  We still have an unenviable record in regard to unemployment compared with other countries in Europe.  Ours is the highest at something like 6½ per cent to 7 per cent.</P>
    <P>We still remain at the bottom of the league as regards our housing record and we have failed to make any improvement in the three or four years of the last Dáil.  I do not know what Deputy Blaney can do to correct this but we all wish him luck in the task he has before him.  We trust he will be much more successful than his predecessor who seemed to be determined by lack of effort to keep us at the bottom of the European league as far as the provision of houses is concerned. I do not think we can be proud of the record in agriculture and the position in which Irish agriculture finds itself where an average of 9,000 persons per year leave the land and where, since 1937, 130,000 members of the rural community were forced to go to the cities and towns of this country or go across to Britain or some other country.</P>
    <P>We are still in the position, as far as agriculture is concerned, whereby farm incomes are only three-quarters of those of the rest of the population.  We are still in the unfortunate position in which our agricultural output is only half that of the European average.  We still have the position in which there is massive depopulation of rural Ireland: the rural community are dying and anybody who was in the country during the recent campaign saw evidence of it.  Communities had moved to such an extent that the Government found it necessary to re-draw county boundaries.</P>
    <P>We cannot be proud, either, of our record as far as industry is concerned because between 1965 and 1969 there was not any net increase in total employment in industry.  Jobs provided in industry were only half those required to give full employment by the 1970s.  As has been said in the <Col N="35" /> country, and frequently in this House, our industrial relations situation is one of the worst in the European league. I do not think we can be proud of this situation unless in any new legislation we get there are revolutionary proposals for improvement.</P>
    <P>We cannot be proud of our health scheme.  We cannot be proud of our social welfare code.  Cardinal Conway spoke recently about the flaunting of affluence.  Let me ask if the disparity in incomes in this country is to continue. We have evidence of its existence in the low rate of allowances paid to social welfare benefit recipients and in the high salaries paid in other directions. Are we to ignore the warnings given in this respect on several occasions?</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil suggested that the Third Programme will solve all our problems. What was noticeable during the recent general election campaign was that there was very little reference, if any, by Fianna Fáil candidates to the Third Programme.  Perhaps this is understandable in that the Fianna Fáil Party did not participate in the policy, if there is a policy in it, of the Third Programme by contrast to the Labour policy which was formulated by the members of our organisation.  As far as our problems are concerned no number of half days to school children will solve them and neither will any political campaign of slander.  These gentlemen behind me were smeared, and we have the evidence to prove it. I can point to dozens of Deputies who engaged in it outside the church gates and when canvassing on doorsteps throughout the country.  They had not the guts to do it in the big towns.</P>

      <P>The beauty about the Fianna Fáil Party is that in private conversation they will tell you they are better socialists than us but they will not do that on public platforms: they prefer to hide under the shelter of the name of Fianna Fáil.  Population, employment and emigration are interdependent. In our policy document we proposed greater State initiative, because month after month we realised that private enterprise has failed to provide the jobs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not know what the Taoiseach meant when he suggested a new Department to cater for housing and physical planning.  We proposed in our policy document a Department for Economic Planning.  If the Taoiseach's suggestion relates to the purely physical, we still advocate a Department of Economic Planning because this is one of the things required in Government, with a Minister to take charge of it, than anything else if we are to solve our economic problems.  We need greater activity on the part of the semi-State bodies; we need the exploitation of our resources by Irish people for Irish people in order that we may get the extra jobs we need so badly.  That is why we say that the emphasis should be on State initiative, because private enterprise has failed to do the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this matter, our policy is misrepresented as one of outright nationalisation. I ask the members of Fianna Fáil who were guilty of this misrepresentation on the election platforms where in our policy document did we <Col N="37" /> state that we wanted to nationalise anything but two industries.  I do not see why anybody in Fianna Fáil, particularly members of the Cabinet who are expected to have read our document, should have so misrepresented it.  It is only by greater State involvement that we can get more jobs, stem emigration and bring about full employment. Deputy Allen, I am sure, had a field day, or a field night, or a field morning, when going around the constituency trying to persuade those who would listen to him that we wanted to take over Irish industry.</P>

What does our policy document state?  What most people want to say throughout the country, but without being able to put a name on it, is that there should be involvement of workers in industry in order that there might be better conditions for themselves, their wives and families. There was not even a remote suggestion in our policy document that these industries were to be taken over by the workers, but it was in that way that our policy was misrepresented.</P>

This was stated specifically.  We want for the farmers involvement in decisions which affect them, their wives and families and there is no question&mdash;I challenge Fianna Fáil to show me a line or paragraph to the contrary &mdash; that we would take over a single acre of farming land. Again the policy of misrepresentation and instilling fear into the Irish people seems to have paid off but, let me warn you, temporarily.</P>

      <P>I had hoped that we could have talked about policies&mdash; about the real policies of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Fine Gael Party, and our own policies.  Unfortunately, that was not so.  I believe a disservice was done to the Irish nation in that the campaign promoted by the Fianna Fáil Party was one of ensuring that policies would not be spoken about at all, would not be thought about by the people, and would not be considered by the people.  On the other hand, the politics of fear was exploited to the full.  In one of the advertisements on which the Taoiseach's picture appeared, and in which he gave a message to the Irish people, our policies were described as dangerous policies, and as policies which were alien to our traditions and our Christian heritage.  I do not think the Taoiseach believes that.  I do not think the members of the Fianna Fáil Party believe that.  It was good tactics during the election and I must confess that in certain areas it paid off, but it was dishonest, and it pushed back Irish politics for decades and decades.  Should we talk about&mdash;or should we leave it to somebody else?  &mdash;the pamphlets which were distributed?</P>

      <P>I should like to make a statement which I hope will go on the record of this House and which, I hope, will be regarded as a reasonable statement.  The Leader of the Labour Party need not whinge about smears or misrepresentation.  I can understand why he does, and I can understand why other Deputies in the Labour Party speak in that way.  The plain fact is that the people of Ireland, the voters of this country, reacted against the Labour Party's refusal to play a realistic role in Irish politics.  That is why there are fewer of them in this Dáil today, and that is why there will be fewer of them in the Twentieth Dáil. Political Parties and political personalities, prima donnas or otherwise, have a responsibile role in Irish politics, and that is, to aim towards the achievement in Government of the rectification and the remedying of the ills they criticise and talk about.  The Irish people have no use for those who carry perpetual chips on their shoulders and have no intention of ever doing anything about them.</P>

      <Col N="42" /> This Party, the Fine Gael Party, as our Leader has made clear, if it is necessary to make it clear, stand now clearly as the alternative to that Party over there and we intend, without any Labour crutch, to ensure that when this Dáil finishes its work, as it will in due course, the next Government of this country will be a Fine Gael Government.</P>

The new Deputy, Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien, who gave vent to the same expression, will learn that that is not so.</P>

We are surprised, as I venture to feel are also many Deputies in the Government Party surprised, that the result of the election has landed them back in office with the majority they have.  There will obviously be a <i>post mortem</i> for all of us and we shall all attach our own reasons to it.  I do not believe it was the result of the Taoiseach kissing the babies of Ireland, or because of the half days and quarter days he gave in different parts of Ireland.  I believe it was something more fundamental. There are a lot of intellectuals in the House now.  They can ponder on it and produce the reason.</P>

The Fine Gael Party is here as the clear alternative Government.  It intends to give constructive opposition in this House.  I saw a statement ssued by the Labour Party the other day saying that they were going to provide aggressive opposition.

      <P>Deputy Tully is not too bad.  But, as far as we are concerned, we shall give constructive and determined Opposition.  Our opposition will be constructive in the sense that we shall seek to ensure that this Government will face up to the problems&mdash;urgent problems as we see them&mdash;some of which have been referred to today.  In relation to housing I hope we shall rapidly achieve a situation where there will be an end to speculation in building land.  We serve notice on the Government that we intend to see that public opinion is informed, ensure that there is real action in relation to housing. On agriculture, it is an appalling thing that the Taoiseach has nominated Deputy Blaney again as Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  I presume that is temporary for, if it were otherwise, <Col N="44" /> it would be a declaration of war again on the part of the Government against the small farmers of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I do not want to say anything about my colleague in South County Dublin. There are plenty of other people who can speak on my behalf, but in relation to housing and rates urgent work requires to be done.  We intend to see that it is done from these benches, availing of such assistance as we get along the road from those who are willing to help.</P>
      <P>We shall be face to face with a new European situation.  I do not want to say anything critical of Deputy Aiken who ceases to be Minister for External Affairs and Tánaiste.  There is a new Minister for External Affairs, and may I express the hope that we shall now distil and process something we have not had since the days of the interParty Government&mdash;a foreign policy. I hope that, as a small country, we shall be able to face in an intelligent, dignified way the problems that arise in relation to Europe and in relation to our role elsewhere throughout the world.</P>
      <P>There are urgent problems in relation to health and social welfare.  I do not know what significance is attached to the removal of Deputy Seán Flanagan from the Department of Health and his appointment to the Department of Lands.  Is this to make sure that the commitment in relation to Castlebar will be honoured and preserved, or does it signify something else?  After many years waiting in the twilight of the Eighteenth Dáil a Health Bill was introduced.  I said from these benches that it was a bit of window dressing, that it was an exercise in deception, that it was never intended to be passed in the Dáil.  I was assailed by Deputy Flanagan, the Minister for Health, for giving voice to these opinions, but of course they were true.  The Health Bill introduced in the last Dáil was never passed by that Dáil and was never intended to be passed.  Now it is gone.  It is buried in the debris of the Eighteenth Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will take its place?  Shall we have another health committee or a commission, while Deputy Erskine <Col N="45" /> Childers presides in an urbane manner saying nothing but saying it at great length?  Will that be the situation while there is in this country&mdash;and I give place to no one in saying this&mdash;urgent need for social reform, for a reform of our health services, for bringing our people and our community at least into line with what has been done in every other Christian country in Western Europe?</P>
    <P>That case was made from these benches years and years ago.  Not only was the case made but the road towards reform was charted.  However, because of politics, because of smallminded people trying to jockey for position, nothing whatsoever was done and the last Dáil collapsed, burying in its fall the mouse that Fianna Fáil had produced after 12 years of inertia, 12 years of doing nothing.  What will happen now?  I really cannot see the Tánaiste, Deputy Erskine Childers, carrying a flag with &ldquo;Excelsior&rdquo; inscribed upon it, climbing up to lead social reform in Ireland.  Can anyone else?  We have now, I think, Deputy &ldquo;Conservative&rdquo; as Minister for Health. I am sure all of us will be told that things are all right as they are if people only keep quiet and do not talk about them.  I want now to serve notice on the Government on our behalf that, in relation to health, we will continue to focus public opinion and do all in our power to ensure that action is taken early in this Dáil and not towards its end in an atmosphere of politics.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish is perfectly right in what he said about unemployment.  The situation is an appalling one.  After 12 years of Fianna Fáil Government we have today a chronic, endemic unemployment problem.  We have up to 60,000 unemployed.  We have 25,000 emigrating every year.  We have fewer people at work every year.  We are building castles in the air, making promises, producing plans, and all the rest of it.  Let us see some progress now towards full employment.  It will be our job to ensure that progress is made.  We will be a constructive Opposition. We will give the Government assistance when they deserve assistance. We will point out the areas in which action is needed.  But we are the <Col N="46" /> Opposition in this House and we are the next Government of Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who has just spoken devoted most of his remarks, which were really supposed to be a comment on the list of nominees the Taoiseach has put before us, to criticism of the Labour Party. Indeed, it was more than ever clear from the Deputy's remarks that Fine Gael is, as it has been for almost 40 years, not an alternative to Fianna Fáil but an auxiliary to it.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael exist in a kind of symbiotic relationship in which Fianna Fáil draws its nourishment from the kind of &ldquo;opposition&rdquo; which has been provided here by Deputy O'Higgins. He has spoken about the spirit of constructive opposition which, he says, animates the Fine Gael benches.  Constructive opposition means apparently attacking the Labour Party and shadow boxing with the Government, much to their profit.  The real subject before us is the list of nominees, the rather depressing little list the Taoiseach has laid before us, and what that list represents.  What it represents essentially is an attempt at selfperpetuating Government; the Government is striving to perpetuate, and has largely succeeded in perpetuating, its own existence by renominating the Members of the Government in a kind of semi-hereditary succession and it has done all this by the misuse of the powers placed in its hands by the electorate and the funds placed in its hands by the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent election was largely won through the use of the taxpayers' money and through conveying to the electorate the impression that the taxpayers' money, coming back&mdash;some of it at any rate&mdash;to the taxpayers, was a gift from Fianna Fáil.  I met with that impression time and again while canvassing in the recent election in Dublin North East: &ldquo;He gave us the children's allowances.&rdquo;  He gave us this and he gave us that, as if these moneys came as gifts from the pockets of the Government Party.  There were gross <Col N="47" /> examples of that in the course of the election.  There was the production of an expensive booklet by the Department of Education during the period of the election, purely for the purposes of the election.  There was a most scandalous example in Galway where an official letter from the Department of the Gaeltacht was circulated under the heading: &ldquo;Ó Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;  This letter, over the signature of the secretary of the Department of the Gaeltacht, promised various benefits to the Gaeltacht.  It is by techniques like this that these gentlemen are here this evening and that is the system we have to expose.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, Deputy Childers, boasted in a recent article that the Fianna Fáil Party had provided the longest existing Government in Western Europe.  He is not quite right in that.  There is another Government in these islands which has been in power even longer and which is even more skilled in the use of these methods.  Perhaps the Government might send a team to learn something in Stormont about the even more effective use of patronage for selfperpetuation.</P>

      <P>Very little.  I have spoken so far about the list as a whole.  I now want to take a specific example of one nominee who, as a Minister, does much to symbolise the whole system.  The nominee I refer to is Deputy Haughey.  I have criticised Deputy Haughey in our constituency.  I challenged him there to debate with me, but he evaded that challenge.  He will find it less easy to evade here.  I criticise in particular Deputy Haughey's nomination for several reasons, which seem to us on these benches to be strong reasons.  I notice that Fine Gael, although they criticised Deputy Haughey during the election, have, in accordance with their canons of constructive, gentlemanly opposition, said nothing about him here today.  He is particularly open to question for several reasons.  He is probably the most able member of the <Col N="48" /> Government.  The competition is not very intense but, in any gathering, he would certainly be an able member and had we a decent social system he would, I think, make a good Minister. In the kind of system we have he does not, I am afraid, make a good Minister. I will give my reasons for that opinion. Deputy Haughey, as we know, personally benefited from a situation&mdash;the free market in building land&mdash;which ought, in the public interest, to be regulated, as has been indicated by the NIEC.  If members of the Government benefit from the fact of its not being regulated, then there is a question as to a conflict of interests, and I question.  Secondly, Deputy Haughey is publicly known to be associated with people who have been seen to violate the law with impunity, with people who have gone ahead with building, without planning permission, over a period of months because they knew they could get away with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say something on the subject of interruptions. Interruptions, subject to your ruling, Sir, can only have the effect of prolonging the period in which I will be on my feet, if that is what these gentlemen desire.  I would ask the Fianna Fáil backbenchers&mdash;through you, Sir&mdash;to have some pity on their unfortunate front bench colleagues, who are sitting there itching to get their hands on their seals of office and whose clutch on these seals will only be delayed by interruptions.  We intend to say what we have to say; we will not be deterred by interruptions; we will wait for the interruptions to cease and then continue our remarks.  The second point about Deputy Haughey was that he had been associated with people who had seemed to violate the law with impunity.  I can detail that charge should he require me to do so.  Thirdly, a very serious charge has been made by a Deputy whom we saw recently in <Col N="49" /> the House but apparently is not here to sustain it that Deputy Haughey as Minister failed to disclose a conflict of interest when introducing a taxation change.  It is true that Deputy Haughey was exonorated on that charge by his colleague the Attorney General, the partner of his political fortune and by a couple of civil servants or a civil servant in a Department for which he is responsible.</P>
      <P>I am trying to measure my words but in most other democratic countries in Western Europe a Minister who had been seen to act in this way would not be renominated.  Therefore, this nomination is open to particular question.</P>
      <P>There has been a change in the Department of External Affairs and we can only wait to see what the change may bring and whether it may bring any change in policy.  From the general context in which these names are brought forward this appears very unlikely. The Department of External Affairs in recent years has departed entirely from any attempt to sustain independence in foreign policy; it has fallen steadily away from that position and, indeed, one of the nominees who is here today jibbed in a debate with me at the use of the word &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo;. He seemed to regard it as a preconceived idea.  One of the things we want to find out is whether, in fact, the Government have abandoned the idea of neutrality.  We shall question the new Minister on that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred, and I agree with his emphasis, to the urgent and agonising question of Biafra.  I have tabled questions on that for reply next week.  We are there faced with a situation in which there is imminent danger of a repetition of last year's famine.  As the <i>London Times</i> has said, the Nigeria-Biafra events are the gravest crime committed by the British Government since the Irish Famine.  We have had nothing to say about this and the Government have been very quiet.  It will be interesting to see if the new Minister has any response to this situation and whether his response will be proportionate to the feeling of the people about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins spoke about constructive Opposition and I said what <Col N="50" /> I think of that idea coming from him. We intend from these benches to supply a flow of critical opposition, genuine Opposition which must often be hard-hitting and we intend to expose what the Fianna Fáil version of free enterprise means and to show the people in this way how and why the Labour Party policy of democratic socialism is the best way forward for the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The team with whom we are presented today are, as other speakers said, a disappointment. They are a disappointment in the fewness of the changes of personnel and a disappointment also in some respects in the failure to change people from Departments in which they have not been notable successes and, indeed, in some cases were notable failures.  It is a pity that the Taoiseach did not take the opportunity which he had after the election campaign, in which he did play a considerable personal part, and from which he emerged in a very strong position in his own Party, to make more drastic changes and remove from the Cabinet some people who have brought discredit on his Party, on Parliament and on the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a difficult kind of debate because one does not wish in one's first utterances in the House, or, indeed, in any utterances in the House to concentrate his remarks on personalities but would prefer to deal with issues. However, it is necessary to make some remarks, as briefly and as painlessly as possible on this question of personalities. First, I should like to ask the Taoiseach a question as he has left something obscure in his opening remarks. He said that Deputy Blaney would remain Minister for Agriculture, an announcement which was greeted with many outward and some inward groans from this side of the House and possibly on the other side also.  The Taoiseach went on to say that he intended to create a new Department, a Department of Housing, Physical Planning and Construction and that Deputy Blaney would be transferred to it.  I wonder if the Taoiseach's admiration for Deputy Blaney's qualities is such that he will carry on both Departments at once or is it intended, as I think it is possible, that he will be quietly removed <Col N="51" /> from the Department of Agriculture and if so what plans has the Taoiseach for Agriculture?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In the other House the people did not mind too much.  We should be told who the new Minister for Agriculture will be or at least given some assurance that there will be one Minister for Agriculture and that Deputy Blaney will not be inflicted on both Departments at once.  I note that Deputy Boland is getting responsibility for the Department of Social Welfare restored to him as well as continuing in whatever is left of the Department of Local Government when the housing element in which he was notably unsuccessful is handed over to Deputy Blaney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about this because his term of office in the Department of Social Welfare was notable for its relative length and for the extraordinary absence of any significant reforms during that period.  The only reform, if you could call it such, and I have some doubts because of the way in which it was dealt with, was the introduction of the occupational injuries scheme.  Apart from that, there was no significant change made in the social welfare code and goodness knows it needs changes. It is distressing then that at a time when more than ever there is need for the initiation of a radical social welfare code that the Minister with the longest record of doing nothing in that area should be put back in it.  I hope that the Minister in his period as Minister for Local Government may have learned something.  The other major mistake which is being made is the retention of Deputy Moran, or Deputy Ó Moráin as he calls himself, in the Department of Justice.  I do not want to dwell on that but for two reasons I consider this appointment an unfortunate one&mdash;first of all, because he is <Col N="52" /> the Minister who endeavoured to keep the Criminal Justice Bill in its original form and had to have his arm twisted pretty hard by his colleagues.  It may be that he is a weak man who allowed civil servants to foist this Bill on him but this would be a reason why he should be removed from the office. Another reason is that during the election campaign he was one of the Ministers most active in the smear campaign directed against my colleagues on the right.</P>

      <P>I said it has been a tradition.  I did not say when the tradition ceased.  Let me mention another Fianna Fáil Minister, the older Mr. Boland, who performed in that office in a very courageous way during a very difficult period.  That tradition has not been maintained in recent years and it is quite wrong that a Minister who has disgraced himself by the kind of remarks he made, by what, one might say legitimately, the filth he spewed out, should be retained in that office.  If he has to be kept in the Government&mdash;and I see no good reason for that&mdash;he should at least be removed from that office so that the country could have the assurance that the administration of justice was in suitable hands.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I have said the things that need to be said, which are painful to say and which one would prefer not to have to say on one's first occasion in the Dáil in regard to some of the appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another change that I wish to comment on and that is the transfer of Deputy Lenihan to the Department of Transport and Power and the appointment of Deputy Faulkner to the Department of Education.  Such a change was necessary because of the <Col N="53" /> situation that had developed in the Department of Education during the period of Deputy Lenihan's tenure of office.  His predecessor introduced a number of changes, some of which were very welcome, some of which were radical, some of which were badly needed. His method of introducing them left many loose ends to be tied up&mdash;I put it in as charitable a way as possible&mdash;and I am afraid the experience of the last couple of years does not suggest that Deputy Lenihan was the best man to tie up these loose ends.  They have become looser and looser until the civil servants and himself are tripping themselves up in them all over the place.  I hope the new Minister will patiently attempt to unravel the problems.  I hope, also, he will have the courage to tackle some of the remaining problems.</P>
    <P>One criticism that I felt should have been made and was not, I think, made sufficiently against Deputy Lenihan's predecessor, the late Deputy O'Malley, was that he tackled a relatively easy nut to crack and one where his opponents were least, perhaps, able to cope with him, that is, the religious orders in secondary education where, certainly, changes were needed and he introduced very good changes in many respects but he did not tackle the much more tricky problem, one that needs to be tackled also, of the primary education system, where there is also a clerical interest, and which there are much stronger grounds for tackling because the primary schools are the schools owned by the community, owned by the parents, and there is, therefore, a much stronger case for intervening in that area than in the secondary schools, which are the private property of the religious orders who own them.  That problem has not been tackled.  I would hope that Deputy Faulkner would have the courage to tackle the problems in that area as well as those which have been dealt with in the area of secondary education.</P>
    <P>I also hope that he will attack the problem of the university merger in a new spirit.  He may know, as others may know, that I have myself in principle favoured a merger of the two colleges in Dublin but such a merger can <Col N="54" /> only be carried out successfully if it commands the support of the people in the colleges, the students and the staff. It is clear that the proposals that have been put forward at the present time are so designed as to have such an adverse effect on one college that they are unacceptable to that college at least as well as, indeed, to many of the staff in the other college.  I hope the new Minister will tackle this problem without preconceived ideas and will try to ensure that, whether or not there is a merger, out of this situation will emerge two colleges, in whatever relationship it may be possible to devise, by agreement with the staffs and students in them, which co-operate closely together and which serve the interests of the Irish people effectively, but this must be done by agreement and I commend to him a different approach from that adopted by his predecessor.</P>
    <P>In the Department of External Affairs we have a new Minister and I think he comes into office at a time when new thought is needed to several problems which face us in the external sphere.  One problem is, of course, our relationship with the European Economic Community.  Owing to the policy, or neglect of policy, in this sphere in recent times, a situation has arisen in which powerful forces in Europe are pressing for the admission of Britain first, before Ireland, perhaps, without Ireland.  I think the counter attack which has been launched more recently and in which some of us in the other Chamber of this Parliament played a part though in another guise, when it was the scene of a meeting of the European Movement several weeks ago, is producing, and I hope will produce some results to ensure that the consequences of the neglect of our European policy, leading to a situation in which Britain is being invited to join without us, with the disastrous consequences that would have, will not, in fact, come to pass.  Certainly, there is a field here for intensive diplomatic activity in Europe.  Anyone who has had occasion to visit any of the European capitals and to talk to people who are in the EEC in Brussels or in other capitals, to talk to people concerned <Col N="55" /> with the foreign policies of these countries, will know of the puzzlement and concern expressed there at the Irish Government's policy.  There is, on the one hand, recognition of the fact that the Irish Government have expressed a desire to join the European Economic Community, a recognition of the sincerity of some of the statements made by that Government but there has been puzzlement that the Department of External Affairs has not pursued these policies in the way in which people expect.  Any of us who have had occasion to make these contacts will be aware of this reaction.  It is very important that this fence should be mended by the new Minister and that we should not have to face the dangerous situation in which our relationships of trade will be disrupted by the kind of solution that has recently been propounded.</P>
    <P>At this point I would turn to say one word to my colleagues, as I keep finding them, on my right, on this issue.  I would ask them not to tackle this problem with preconceived ideas. I would ask them to tackle it with an open mind.  The crucial issue involved here from the point of view of our economy is this: so long as we remain a small country beside a very large country in a relationship of very great dependence as regards trade with it, a relationship which cannot easily be changed in the context of the existing trading situation, so long as that is the position, so long as that country, Britain, adopts policies which, objectively, have the effect of exploiting our economy and exploiting our farmers, and so long as we remain in a relationship with Britain which makes it impossible for us to exercise any control over those policies and which policies are not controlled by anybody else either, we are going to be exploited economically.</P>
    <P>This can only be changed if Britain becomes a member of an organisation which imposes upon its members obligations to treat other members of that organisation with equity and which will make it impossible and illegal for Britain to continue to exploit us.  Only in that way <Col N="56" /> can this country cease to be exploited economically by Britain.  That is the objective fact and the important thing for us is that Britain should become a member of the European Economic Community, that its policy be brought under control and that we, in joining it too, would have the protection of its institutions from the kind of exploitation to which we have been treated for so long.</P>
    <P>I say that&mdash;and I want to make this point clear&mdash;with no animosity to Britain or the British Government.  As far as they are concerned they are pursuing policies in their interest.  That is, indeed, in the world of sovereign states, the kind of policies we must expect people to pursue, the kind of policies which we, I suppose, in a rather ineffective way, have been pursuing ourselves.  I make no criticism of Britain.  The fact is that they do pursue these policies which involve exploiting us in their interest and the only way we can prevent them doing that is to join with them in an organisation in which these policies can no longer be applied to us.  I would ask my colleagues in the Labour Party to consider this point and unless they can propound some alternative way of bringing British policy under control&mdash;and they certainly have not secured much benefit for us through the Labour Government of Britain&mdash; then I think they ought to face the question of membership of the European Economic Community in a mood of objectivity and with a willingness to look at it with realism.</P>
    <P>There is another sphere of international politics where I think we have a role to play and have not played it, that is, the sphere of relationships between east and west of Europe. There have in recent times been a number of proposals for a <i>détente</i> between east and west which have come from countries as far apart as Italy and Finland.  We are in an unusual position here.  We are part of western Europe; we are linked to western Europe by close ties; we belong to western Europe and our attitudes are western European.  At the same time, we are not a member of NATO.  We are, in a sense, the <Col N="57" /> Jugoslavia of western Europe.  We are in a better position than most countries to exercise some constructive influence in international affairs.</P>
    <P>I think it is a matter of concern that our Government have not taken up any of the initiatives that have been made or have done anything at all to contribute to a lessening of tension between east and west which, alone, can contribute to an alleviation of conditions of varying degrees of tyranny under which the peoples of eastern Europe are suffering today.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I should like to mention Biafra, which has been mentioned already but cannot be mentioned too often until the Government are prepared to take up their responsibilities in this matter.  It is now of absolute urgency that action be taken here.  We have reached the stage where the only channel of relief to which our Government contributes is blocked by the aggressive actions of a Nigerian Government.  The only way we can help the starving people of Biafra now is made impossible to us by the actions of a Nigerian government.  In those circumstances, no Christian country, no country with any sense of responsibility, can fail to take some action.  The action I think we should take is to go to the Nigerian Government and say to them, unless they drop this new policy of genocide, a policy of trying to starve the civilian population of Biafra, we shall take up the matter with the United Nations with a view to ensuring that it will act in an effective way with a view to getting relief supplies into Biafra.  I hope the new Minister for External Affairs will be prepared to take a new initiative in this sphere.</P>
    <P>I wish to say one word about the Labour Party.  There seems to be a long dialogue going on between the Labour Party and ourselves as well as between the Labour Party and the Fianna Fáil Party.  The description of the Labour policies by Deputy Corish &mdash;which I accept as substantially accurate even if necessarily incomplete &mdash;was also a remarkably good description of the policies of the Fine Gael Party.  I wondered, when I heard them, what the Labour Party was for.  I shall not take that point any <Col N="58" /> further at the moment.  It is something to come back to again.</P>

While I, too, resent the smear attacks made on the Labour Party by disreputable characters on the other side of the House&mdash;I spoke against it during the election campaign&mdash;I resent the remark made during this debate, and made previously also, that these smears came from this side of the House, too.</P>

      <P>That is not, in fact, the case.  I think we should be careful what we say about this.  While the smear was something objectionable, I do not believe myself it significantly affected the out-turn of the election. When the Labour Party has had time to sit back and think about it in greater tranquility than they have had they will realise that there is a fundamental political fact to be faced in this country as in most countries with parliamentary democracy, namely, that the people want a government.  When a Party says it will not support the formation of a Government except on such terms that its Leader, with one-sixth of the votes in the House, becomes Taoiseach and runs the Government, it is opting out of parliamentary politics.  The Irish people took it literally during the recent general election.</P>

No Party can exist very long in a democratic parliamentary assembly if it opts out of the parliamentary process which is primarily concerned with forming a government that would govern the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" /> In conclusion, I would call on the Taoiseach to take this opportunity to rethink some of the attitudes of Fianna Fáil in some of its policies.  It is an objective fact&mdash;I expect nobody on the Government benches admits this openly I think most people admit it privately &mdash;that, over recent years, public opinion of government has declined.  People believe things about governments and Ministers today which they did not believe ten years ago.</P>

      <P>Oh, Waterloo, yes. People believe things today they did not believe ten years ago.  Now, the question of whether these things are true or not is certainly relevant but it is not my point now.  My point now concerns the way in which the last Government was run and the fact that certain things were dealt with made it possible for people to suggest that things were done which should not be done, and their suggestions could be believed because it was quite possible that such things had happened and nobody could disprove them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it was no smear.  This is a very important point. So long as planning permission is given by a Minister then, no matter how high-principled that Minister may be, people will readily believe that he acted in an improper way.  I think the last Government did itself great damage, did Parliament and the country great damage by not acting quickly once such allegations were made. The important thing was that such allegations, true or false, should not be believed and it required that that power should be taken from a Minister and given to a tribunal so that people could no longer say&mdash;true or false&mdash;that such a thing could happen. I would hazard a guess that nobody with any contact with building and the professional world in that connection <Col N="60" /> in Dublin has any doubt but that the vast majority of the people in the building industry or with anything to do with property of any kind believe they benefit themselves by close association with the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>That belief may be unfounded but it has been fostered by the fact that nothing has been done to dissuade people that it could not be true by changing the system that exists at present.  I appeal to the Taoiseach, himself an honourable man, to ensure that this new Government will get a better reputation as an honourable government than the last one by eliminating those possible reasons for belief that it was a dishonourable government which has done it no credit and this country no credit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The occasion presented to the Taoiseach for choosing a new list of Ministers could have &mdash;though, of course, we realise that the recent list of resigned Ministers was the best possible thing that could have occurred&mdash;presented him with an opportunity of recognising that, in fact, everything was not quite perfect.  It could have presented him with an opportunity of trying to heal the breaches that are very real and very important and very serious for the development of the country.  That opportunity was not taken.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to that failure in the context of one particular appointment which has already been mentioned because it seems to me that, by reappointing Deputy Blaney as Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, the Taoiseach has offered a studied insult to the rural organisations and the rural population of Ireland.  I do not wish to deal with Deputy Blaney in person.  I wish to talk about Fianna Fáil policy in this respect.  One might sum it up by saying that never in the whole history of human endeavour, by so many people and for so long, was so little done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No effort has been made to protect the farmers of Ireland against the extortionate activities of large international companies who have knocked out our market between them on a shared basis.  No effort has been made to protect our farmers and all the small <Col N="61" /> business and other sections in this country against the interest rates which are not dictated by internal events but by events thousands of miles away.  No effort has been made, outside a verbal effort, in itself highly laudable but backed by no significant activity, to enable the farmers to protect themselves against the forces I am talking about.  No effort was made in the whole life of the State to use economists to sort out the whole situation in regard to our cattle trade.  When a tiny olive branch was offered, it was offered in terms of a trivial marketing organisation and, when one looked at the composition of this promotion board, the object of the exercise was immediately apparent.  No effort was made to alter the situation in which the young men and women of Ireland go into our biggest industry totally unprepared from an educational point of view.  No effort was made in 12 years to halt and to reverse the sale of the Irish dairy industry to overseas interests. No effort was made to develop a pig industry which would seriously be able to compete with the Danes on the British market and, again, when one looks at the composition of the Pigs and Bacon Commission, the reason for this is absolutely obvious.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into a greater discussion at this moment of the inadequacies of our agricultural policy as purveyed by Fianna Fáil over the years but I want to come to the central reason, the most important reason of all, for finding myself obliged to enter a protest against this appointment, and that is the issue of democracy which means much more than the question of appointing people or electing people to this Dáil.</P>
    <P>The real issue between the old, the new Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the farmers is the issue of democracy.  It is the issue of whether people involved in an industry have the right to participate to the greatest possible extent in the running of that industry.  That issue exists in every creative and constructive activity of the people of this country. The unsolved problem of democracy exists in agriculture, it also exists in the Civil Service, in industry, and <Col N="62" /> in every aspect of our public life. It is a particularly important problem at this time in the circumstances of the victory of the Fianna Fáil Party in this election.  In some ways it was a hollow victory.  It was a victory with a diminished vote.  It was a victory with every trick pulled.  Above all, it seems to me hollow&mdash;and I found an echo to my thought in what Deputy Garret FitzGerald just said&mdash;because it was a victory which involved the loss of the most important asset that ever an individual, a Party, a government or a nation possessed&mdash;the loss of honour.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the reason why we must rise on this occasion when a list of Ministers has been presented is that the victory of Fianna Fáil in these circumstances puts the nation in a profound danger because it is interpreted and will be interpreted by the people as a victory for Taca; it will be interpreted by the people as a victory for what one might call politics by fisticuffs.  It seems to validate the use of Ministerial office to further personal commercial interest.</P>

      <P>It seems like a victory for the principle of purchasing votes by the use of children's allowances carefully dated and things like that. It seems like a green light for every careerist in the next four years or so to climb on the bandwagon and it seems like a victory for the policy of developing Ireland, if development one can call it, by the principle of selling it to other people.  This is why, with the big majority that Fianna Fáil have now got, we find ourselves in what seems to me a serious national danger because the forces that will come to the fore over the period of the present Dáil, which presumably will go pretty near the full distance, will be more cynical, more authoritarian, more corrupt and more anti-national than has been the case up to now.  This seems to me a serious national circumstance and a justification for the questioning of the list of Ministers which the Taoiseach has put before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question which most people are now asking is: What went <Col N="63" /> wrong on the 18th June?  What happened that the people's desire for change was frustrated?  What happened that the overwhelming wish of our people for a change of policy and personnel in Government was defeated? The answer is the answer which defeated our people for centuries in their efforts to defeat the occupying enemy and the blame lies on a small minority of our people who, in this year as in years gone by, were so contemptible, so servile, so cowardly, so beholden to those in power that, hating them as the majority of our people hated them, they voted them back because they lacked the courage to face the change and the challenge of the time.  To use a popular phrase, they preferred the devil they knew to what might or what might not be the devil they did not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been taken to task by inference here because I stated that the reason why the people were afraid was because they feared the intentions of the Labour Party.  If the Labour Party did not make themselves clear the fault lies with them, that is to say, if they feel that they were confused or that the people were confused as to what they intended.  The truth of the matter remains that the people wanted a change without upheaval: they wanted a change without revolution. They wanted to keep what was worthkeeping in our society.  They wanted to maintain what was worth maintaining.  They wanted to keep what they had and they did not feel that they could keep that with some of the crazy utterances which were made by the new revolutionaries, who could not understand the difference between what was worthwhile in our society and what should be thrown out.  This is where we in Fine Gael differ strongly from the other two Parties in the House. This happened because of the cowardice of a small minority of people.  Many of them were Fianna Fáil people who were sick of Fianna Fáil and wanted to vote for somebody else.  Some of them were supporters of the Fine Gael Party but in their contemptible fear of the Labour Party voted for Fianna Fáil, preferring them to revolution and the loss which they <Col N="64" /> thought they would sustain if the fantastic forecasts of the Labour Party were by some miracle to come into being in 1969.  Many of the people who voted for the Fianna Fáil Party were former supporters of the Labour Party who shared the same fears.</P>
    <P>So it is that, once again, the Labour Party have shown themselves to be what they have been down the years, unwillingly, I know, but nevertheless, on the analysis of the election results, they have shown themselves to be what clearly they are in this country&mdash;the friends of the Fianna Fáil Party, the political force which keeps the Fianna Fáil Party in power because they indicate that they are not prepared to play any part in the government of this country unless they play a dominant part, unless they play an exclusive part, and they say this from a point in their political strength which shows to our people that their wishful thinking can never be made come true.</P>
    <P>So it is that we in this country share the disgrace of Europe by having in power a one-Party Government that is hated by the majority of our people because our people have shamed themselves once again by not using the democratic process to put into effect policies in which they believe.  We sought the support of the people and of the people's representatives in this Parliamentary Assembly for policies in which we believed.  Those were policies of substantial social progress and reform and those who said, as they said in the Labour Party, that they would not support our reforms can now accept the blame that attaches to them because the old age pensioners will not get £5 a week, children's allowances will not be increased by two-thirds, health services will not be reformed and the ratepayers will still be asked in the future, as they have been in the past, to pay 50 per cent of the cost of health services.</P>
    <P>The purpose of a general election is not only to elect personnel to office but to indicate through the ballot box support for policies.  We are convinced that the present Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanation of the Labour Party's costings of its various policies is that the party cannot even count to 20 and beyond.</P>
      <P>It would appear that the Taoiseach has interpreted the election results as support for a health policy which will still charge 50 per cent of the cost of health services against ratepayers. Those ratepayers who have whinged for years against the high rates and who have now voted for Fianna Fáil should now remember what they have done and not come whinging on the shoulders of Fine Gael when the next rates bill has to be paid.  This small minority of contemptible people have left the majority of our people to suffer under the wholly unjust health code which Fianna Fáil believe to be the right code.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has clearly accepted that there has been a vote of approval for the continuation of the present system of financing the health services and has put into power the man of no change, the man who supports the <i>status quo.</i> The Taoiseach has appointed Deputy Erskine &ldquo;Conservative&rdquo; Childers as Minister for Health.  He is the man, above all others, who will resist any change or any improvement in relation to the means of administering or financing the health services.</P>
      <P>We in the Fine Gael Party went before the people with a policy which would have achieved a just society in our time.  Our policy was above all else a policy of social reform.  We received no criticism of our policies from the people.  We are convinced the people still want our policies.  They were misled into voting for a party in which they did not believe.  They must now pay the price and it will be hard to have sympathy with those who have foisted the party of no change on the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="66" /> We have further evidence of the manner in which the Taoiseach has interpreted the wishes of the people as being in support of Fianna Fáil policy in that he has appointed once again to the Department of Social Welfare a man whose very reign in that Department was associated with no improvement, no change and no reform.  The new Minister is a man who clearly was unhappy and disinterested in social welfare when he was in the Department previously.  He is being given the position now so that he can be eased out, without any obvious loss of face, of the Department of Local Government and still be left with a Department. The Department of Local Government is to be mutilated and altered in its importance and scope.  To compensate the Minister for Local Government for his loss in prestige he is to be given two titles although both of them are to be of little importance and he is not to do anything in either of them.</P>
    <P>There are eight changes in the Cabinet. These eight changes are in relation to the Departments which did not draw the most criticism.  There are four Ministers which have not yet been changed.  Three of them are certainly the three which drew the greatest volume of criticism because the men who held them and the policies they perpetrated were associated with the word &ldquo;arrogance&rdquo;.  We had arrogance in the Departments of Agriculture and Fisheries, Local Government and Justice. These three Departments are still to be under the jurisdiction of the three most arrogant men in the Fianna Fáil Government &mdash; Deputy Blaney, Deputy Boland and Deputy Moran.</P>
    <P>It does not seem that we can keep faith with our supporters and also with the majority of the Irish people including the contemptible minority who gave in to that arrogance and voted into office those whom they detest.  We must keep faith with our people, with those who voted for us, with those who still believe in us.  We must oppose this assembly of Ministers who have been given portfolios.</P>
    <P>We are facing a very serious credit squeeze.  The Government anticipated this squeeze when they decided to hold the general election on the 18th June. The credit squeeze was anticipated but <Col N="67" /> was not announced until the campaign was well under way.  It was hoped to time it so that the Fine Gael Party might draw attention to the fact that the Central Bank had spoken and that we were due for a serious credit squeeze.  It was done to support the Fianna Fáil advertisements which already had been drafted suggesting a hair shirt policy if Fine Gael got back to power.  It will be interesting to see how long Deputy Haughey&mdash;&mdash;</P>

No matter what is said in course of this discussion the same old bunch of Ministers will be approved later on when the vote is taken.  My main reason for joining in this discussion is to tabulate some records for the benefit of Members who do not seem to be conversant with facts.  We had an election on 18th June, 1969.  My first duty here is to congratulate the Government on being returned with 75 seats.  The result indicates that they are the greatest manipulators <Col N="68" /> of all times.  They must be congratulated on that score.  The Irish people were asked to vote on the 18th June and according to the <i>Irish Times</i> of 21st June&mdash;I assume this paper gave a factual account of election returns&mdash; 602,227 people voted for Fianna Fáil and 715,773 people did not vote for Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have something to say about Deputy Boland because he is the member of the Government whom I detest most.  He is incapable and arrogant.  The figure of 113,546 was the majority against the Government. Here you have that formidable percentage not voting for Fianna Fáil candidates but despite this Fianna Fáil managed to get 75 out of 144 seats possibly because of the work done by Deputy Boland who did not do so well in the running despite the fact that he was the man who so magnificently butchered and gerrymandered the constituencies in order to bring about this result.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party were foremost in the national fight to retain proportional representation.  We still are firm believers in that system.  There are no more firm believers than we are.  Mind you, it has not been very kind to us. We missed out a number of seats, mostly here and there as anyone who peruses the election results can see for himself.  There was some question that the Labour Party should feel disappointed, should have a kind of down and out feeling as a result of this election. We lost three seats.  I am not counting the late Ceann Comhairle's seat.  We lost Tom Kyne in Waterford.</P>

      <P>We would have had another seat in the Minister's constituency if the candidate got 84 votes more than he did.  You could go around constituency <Col N="69" /> after constituency and you would find that if you examined the total popular vote from Malin Head in Donegal to Clear Head in south-west Cork you would get the true national picture as a result of this election. This national picture indicates that the Labour Party did not lose popular support.  A total of 223,282 people gave their first preference votes to Labour candidates all over the country on the 18th June.  If that figure is contrasted with the 1965 figure it will be found that we increased our support by 30,511 first preference votes.  The 1965 figure was 192,771.  That is how the Labour Party fared in the election despite the assertions that if people voted for Labour parish priests would be tortured and they would be thrown into dungeons.  That is the kind of stuff Deputy Crowley and his agents were talking about in south-west Cork. So far as that part of West Cork I have the privilege of representing here is concerned, and I am sure the same could be said about the rest of it, that smear campaign did not take one single vote from me.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, in case some Members are not in possession of the information already, despite all the assertions made, we increased our first preference votes by 30,511 and we got a grand total of almost 50 per cent of the vote given to Fine Gael.  The Fine Gael vote in the election was 450,013, which is just double our first preference votes but proportional representation did not favour us.  We were not lucky on the 18th June in getting seats in proportion to our first preference votes.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael with just twice our first preference votes got 50 seats.  If they got seats on the same ratio as we did Fine Gael would have 36½ seats.  I have not calculated how many Fianna Fáil would have got but it would be far less than 75.  I hope everyone is clear on the national picture of this election so far as popular votes are concerned.  I think everyone is clear so far as seats in this Parliament are concerned. I am not giving those figures as an excuse for the disappointment we undoubtedly suffered by virtue of not getting more seats for the increased votes we got.</P>

      <P>I think, with due respect, Sir, that a discussion on the election which set off this motion, which gave a result of 75 Fianna Fáil Members, 50 Fine Gael, 18 Labour and one Independent is appropriate when we are discussing the personnel of the Government.  The results of the election, to my way of thinking at any rate, have a direct bearing on the outcome. I will conclude on that aspect of the matter in a very short time.  I do not want to give a one-sided picture of what happened.  In the election Labour gained 30,511 votes, Fine Gael 22,844 and Fianna Fáil 4,758.  That is a factual appraisal of the election, in so far as popular support is concerned, from one end of the country to the other.</P>

      <P>Three Parties in the election sought support for their election as a Government.  Each made that claim.  I accept the fact that the Irish people did not believe that we, as a Party, would get sufficient support to be returned as a Government and I also accept that they had the same belief in regard to Fine Gael.  Hence, Fianna Fáil with this minority vote and with the gerrymandering of constituencies, got 54.6 per cent of the seats for a 45.4 per cent vote.

      <P>I believe some of the statements made in this discussion were outrageous.  I have no hesitation in referring to the statements of Deputy O'Higgins.  He accused the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Corish, of being responsible for ensuring that Fianna Fáil would be the Government of the Nineteenth Dáil but, having listened attentively to the statements made by Deputy O'Higgins, I assert that he is laying the foundationstone for a Fianna Fáil Government in the Twentieth Dáil, whoever will live to see it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that Deputy Boland should applaud that statement and that those on the Fianna Fáil benches should applaud it because all they have to do is sit back while the Opposition is divided and they will be in their Mercedes, enjoying big salaries and doing very well indeed, with very little difficulty.  That is no small reason why they should applaud statements such as that made by Deputy O'Higgins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dislike the opposition of the Opposition here.  I do not like this type of approach.  I believe Opposition <Col N="73" /> parties should be more co-operative and that there should be some common ground for agreement and certain policies which could be put forward in this House on which the people could pass judgment.  I agree the people did not accept independence of attitude by Labour or Fine Gael.  Let me say, whoever likes it, that I have never been opposed, while I have been here, to the concept of groups of parties joining together if necessary to oust a Government that should be ousted when there is no alternative.  That is a personal viewpoint.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not discussing alternative Government but the formation of a Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>With due respect, I am conversant with the Motion under discussion.  Deputy O'Higgins went forward in this election and on almost every telegraph pole his notice read: &ldquo;Fine Gael will win.&rdquo;  Wherever you looked you found that notice.  He was quite entitled to have it there just as we were entitled to make the claims we made in the election.  But the people have passed judgment and it is no use Deputy O'Higgins blaming Deputy Corish.  There were clear-cut differences between the policies.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party went on their own. The line of thought was: &ldquo;We will go it alone.&rdquo;  Fine Gael had their trial and while they got&mdash;by a fluke, if you like&mdash;three additional seats so far as Fine Gael and Labour are concerned we nearly maintained the <i>status quo</i> of 47 and 21, as anyone perusing the figures would find.</P>
      <P>I see no reason to justify the remarks of Deputy O'Higgins.  I speak as one with great respect for Deputy O'Higgins and as an individual who supported him in the Presidential Election.  I disagree with his viewpoint and that of the Fine Gael Party that the very big vote he accumulated in that election was solely a Fine Gael vote.  So far as the constituency of Cork South West is concerned, where Deputy O'Higgins picked up a majority, that majority was brought about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>All these results have a bearing on the matter.  We are speaking about the future and what the Government propose for us for the next four years.  I am just recording some facts and I think I am quite justified in doing so and in referring to statements made by previous speakers.  It has always been the accepted procedure of this House that when Ministers or Deputies comment on matters under discussion speakers following have the right to make their own comments. But, in order to meet the wishes of he Ceann Comhairle, I shall not elaborate much more on the recent question I posed other than to say that I disagree entirely with the statements of Deputy O'Higgins in blaming the Labour Party for the fact that Fine Gael did not win their overall majority.  I think that is a nonsensical allegation.  Instead of this division existing between Opposition Parties here I had hoped that in the Nineteenth Dáil the opposite would be the case.  I would support that view because I think that as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, they are in office too long.  I would move you out of it at the earliest possible opportunity, if I had the power to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are the Government and I can see no point in Fine Gael accusing Labour about letting them be the Government, or failing to keep them out of Government by giving them a soft run.  I will finish with the hope that Labour and Fine Gael have learned lessons from this general election. The main lesson, which to my mind would be obvious to a student attending first class in a primary school, is that, so long as we have division here, in the foreseeable future we will have Fianna Fáil Government.  And because I do not accept the assertion of Deputy O'Higgins, which was a repetition of what he has been saying throughout the country, that in the next general election there will be a landslide for Fine Gael, that they will win 25 or 26 seats and that they will go it alone, because I am not possessed of such a vivid imagination that I can look forward four years&mdash;I do not know which ball he consulted to give him that information&mdash;we <Col N="75" /> have been led up to the position of having those boys over there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As long as I have had the privilege of being here I have always given credit where credit was due.  I believe that is essential if we are to be honest and fair, as we should be in our approach to public matters.  Earlier, in the course of interjections, I expressed my dislike for the Minister for Local Government.  I am sorry to see him back in his post.  That is not personal.  The Minister's manner is outrageous and a man possessed of the temper of the Minister for Local Government is not fit for Ministerial office.  Only two months ago I, as chairman of the Cork West County Council, led a deputation which travelled to Dublin at some expense to discuss matters of importance.  In the course of that meeting the Minister stampeded out of it through the door like a mad bull.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not befit a Minister for Local Government.  We came from Cork to discuss with him problems relating to the provision of water and sewerage in the district. This behaviour did not befit his office.  It was scandalous and outrageous and I find fault with him on that score.  It is not any harm to publicise that fact.  I want to know from the Taoiseach is that to be the rule for the Nineteenth Dáil.  Does the Taoiseach approve of the arrogance of Deputy Boland when a deputation awaited him from the premier local authority in Ireland?  At the moment I hold the position of chairman of Cork County Council and by virtue of that position I can visualise having to wait on the Minister for Local Government to discuss schemes submitted by Cork County Council for approval and for finances.  Am I, as chairman of Cork County Council and as a TD for Cork South-West, to wait for that violent temper just because I happen to be opposed to him politically?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> That is one of the main reasons why I oppose Deputy Boland.  I believe there is an obligation on a Minister, just as on TDs when leading deputations with grievances, whether justified or otherwise, to show civility and courtesy.  I must say that, by and large, the Minister was an exception.  I did not meet that type of arrogance when I waited on other Ministers of Fianna Fáil Governments, from Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Haughey.  They have been the very opposite.  If I had occasion to meet the big man himself I do not think that type of arrogance would be forthcoming.  Therefore, I say to the Taoiseach that public representatives, whichever rank they hold, particularly Members of the House, are entitled to respectful hearings when they come to a Minister's office.  I have never troubled the Minister on personal matters but when I attend, as chairman of Cork County Council and as a TD, I will not take the arrogance that the Minister attempted to give me two months ago as Minister for Local Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting these matters before the Taoiseach because they are completely justified.  If they were not I would be the last to make any assertions reflecting in any way on any member of the Government or, indeed, on any Member of the House, under the privileges we hold as Members. I have never abused the privilege of this House in order to reflect on anybody's character or personality unfairly and seldom if ever have I made public comments as I am making this evening, which are personal in so far as Deputy Boland is concerned.  I see no way out of it.  Even if I saw a way out of it I would not dream of availing of it because I regard myself as a person who will discuss problems and who will listen to the Minister's difficulties, if he has difficulties, or to a statement of his difficulties in the matter of granting what may be asked for, but I will not take any more arrongance from him.  That is that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been saddled for the next <Col N="77" /> five years, if that is the appropriate term, with this Government again, not through support they enjoy in the country but by a procedure which I think has been outlined adequately already.  Deputy Corish in his statement spoke about the people leaving the land.  It is quite true.  The figures are in or around 9,000.  If the new Minister for Lands, Deputy Flanagan, were here, I would ask him is there to be a reversal of the policy laid down by the previous Minister which would increase the employment content in the Forestry Division by five per cent? Instead of being increased it has been reduced by 20 per cent.  The acreage has been reduced from 25,000 to 20,000 per year.  I have had representations quite recently from married men with families in South-West Cork who were forestry workers for years.  The latest man who came to me had a wife and four children, he had eight and a half years continuous employment with the Department of Lands as a forestry worker.  He has been told that on 1st August his employment will cease and that, in the meantime, he should look for alternative work.  That is only one case, but it is typical of what is happening all over the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to bring home to the Taoiseach the desirability of restoring the employment content in the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands. I am sure the Taoiseach will realise it is very difficult for men who are notified that their employment with the Department of Lands is about to cease to understand this when they go back to the papers of late May and the first half of June and read his statements about the society we are living in, how we are prospering and the affluence we have all around us. It is very hard for them to understand such statements when they have a document before them telling them that their employment is coming to an end, that they should find alternative work.</P>

      <P>During the course of his remarks Deputy Corish referred to the need for more State aid to develop industries in the western counties.  I agree entirely with his viewpoint, which is clearly set out in our policy. It is difficult to get industrialists to establish industries in the western and southern parts of the country without State help and State advice.  I would favour a situation in which the State would take the initiative in setting up industries to try to hold the rural population, even though such industries, in their early years, would require an injection from public funds.</P>

      <P>I have referred to the motion.  I am quite entitled to say what a Minister should or should not do during his term of office.  The motion before the House is that Deputy So-and-So and Deputy So-and-So be appointed Minister for Health and Minister for Social Welfare.  Now, Sir, you remind me by your interjection, with due respect to you, that I was overlooking <Col N="79" /> some matters.  The new Tánaiste was not a satisfactory Minister in the past, and it would be unreasonable to assume that he will change his attitude in the future.  I am glad that he is about to grace us with his presence.</P>
      <P>We all know that when he was in charge of the Department of Transport and Power and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs he was most evasive in his replies in this House. He was known throughout the House as the Minister without any functions because his usual reply to many questions in the past was that he had no function in the matter.  He is being given charge of the health services and I want to record this view so far as the health services and the Minister in charge of them are concerned.  The Bill which died by virtue of the dissolution of the Dáil contained most objectionable clauses.  It was clearly set out that members of local authorities would have little or no say in the health services when that Act came to be implemented.</P>

I am quite entitled to make the assertions I have made.  Were it not for the great respect I have for you, Sir, I would be charging you with discrimination.  I will say this and conclude so that you will not have to make unnecessary interjections again.  We have no really new faces in this Cabinet.  Two Ministers have moved out.  What can we talk about?  We have been talking about these people since they took office 13 years ago.  We have two new Ministers but they are not new, so to speak, in the full sense of the word.  Deputy Gibbons and Deputy Lalor have been junior Ministers and we are, to some extent, conversant with their work.  So are we conversant with the work of the other Ministers and we will have, as you <Col N="80" /> seem to think should be the case today, an opportunity of addressing ourselves to their individual Estimates when they come before the House later on.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that with all the new Members returned in this election the Taoiseach has not seen fit to inject any new blood into this Cabinet. I do not know whether this is due to the fact that he is reluctant to dismiss any of the outgoing Ministers&mdash;other than those who left, voluntarily I am sure&mdash;or whether he is doubtful of the capacities of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I conclude my remarks here by expressing acceptance of the verdict of the people in giving Fianna Fáil, in most exceptional circumstances, a majority in this House.  I believe that as the Government they are entitled to the respect of the people.  I am satisfied Deputy Lynch is a good Leader for the party.  I shall not for a moment reflect on the personal integrity of the Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch.  I am satisfied he means to do the best job he can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am dissatisfied, of course, that Fianna Fáil are back, but let me say to the Taoiseach and to the other Ministers who will be appointed here that they have my goodwill and, I have no <Col N="81" /> doubt, the goodwill of my colleagues in the Labour Party to do a good job for this country.  Let no one say that it is our hope or our wish that they will get into difficulties this year, next year or the following year, that we would expect, as a result of such difficulties, to increase our popular support. As the elected Government of this country they will have the maximum co-operation of the Labour Party if they formulate policies which we believe are beneficial to the Irish people. We hope that the months and the years ahead will be bright ones for our people.  Our main objective is to uplift and advance our people in any way we possibly can.  They will have our support in trying to keep our people at home in rural Ireland, to provide productive employment for them, to create jobs in our industrial areas and to make Ireland a better and a brighter place for all our people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to keep in order on this debate but, as many contributions have taken into account the election which has just passed, I should like also to make my views known upon it.  Fianna Fáil have gone through many elections with slogans like &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On&rdquo;, &ldquo;Wives put your Husbands to Work&rdquo;, &ldquo;Let's get Cracking&rdquo;, and then we had the &ldquo;Let's Back Jack&rdquo; election.  I sincerely believe that this election, as it progressed, developed into an &ldquo;I'm all right, Jack&rdquo; election, because, as far as I could see, the people were seeking an alternative to Fianna Fáil; I admit our Party did not succeed in convincing the people we could get an overall majority.  In the previous Dáil Fine Gael had 47 seats and the Government had 75, five seats being won in by-elections.  It was hard for us to convince the people that it required only a six per cent swing to change the Government, and that is why we did not get many more seats.</P>
      <P>Another factor came in at that stage.  I mean no offence to the Labour Party sitting on my right and I ask them to construe my remarks in the light in which they are meant, that is, in relation to the smear campaign.  The suggestion was made, and I do not think it was true, that there was extreme, radical socialist thought in the Labour Party.  Be that as it may, we can discuss how it came about. There was a chance statement which was denied afterwards but which led people to take this view.  There was a remark about Cuba which was contradicted afterwards; it may have been a light and airy remark, but whatever the nature of the remark it did make people think there was extreme left wing socialism there and people then started to look for an alternative.  Their desire was not to put Fianna Fáil in Government but to have a Government. In the weeks before the election the press that supports the Government kept harping on the question of stalemate and every punter who writes for that press produced articles saying that the likely position in the Nineteenth Dáil was stalemate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of Ireland then decided they wanted a Government.  We did not convince them of what was true, <Col N="85" /> that if there was a six per cent swing we would have an overall majority. There was the disparity in the number of seats, 47 against 75.  There was a chance remark made at a Labour Party Conference, which again, I freely admit, was not Labour policy, that nationalisation of the sources of production in the country was to be the aim of the Labour Party.  I know, because I bought the Labour Party's policy myself for 5/- in their own election rooms in Drogheda.  I read it and I must say that was not part of their policy.  Let us be fair about it.  Let us be fair to everyone if we are having a post mortem and if we are going to sit down and work for the people for another five years.</P>
    <P>What the people were seeking was a Government.  Above all, they did not want a stalemate.  They did not want a situation in which they would have nobody to govern them.  The leader of the Labour Party in that famous speech in Tullamore in 1965 said that Labour were not going to coalesce with anyone and were not going to align.  That was reiterated during the recent general election and I want to remind the House now that about five years ago the then Deputy Seán Lemass, who was Taoiseach, described us as a worn-out party and said that the correct logical opposition to Fianna Fáil was the Labour Party.  Why did he say that? I suggest, as one in politics now for 15 years, though possibly not as skilled in oratory as some who have arrived here recently, that the reason he said that was that he knew the Labour Party would be 30 years a-coming and the real threat to Fianna Fáil lay on the Fine Gael benches.  That was the position in the recent election.  We needed six per cent and if we could have convinced the people that six per cent would have brought about a change we would have won the election.  Whether or not there were mistaken statements by the Labour Party, the idea was sold and bought&mdash; I deliberately use these words&mdash;by the people that there was, in fact, a radical, socialist arm in the Labour Party.  I have been in politics for 15 years and, during those years, I have said things for which I was sorry afterwards.  On the other hand, pretty well everything <Col N="86" /> that could have been said about me in those years was said about me.</P>
    <P>The factor was there and it was something that hit us extremely hard. People were not just having Jack back; what they were trying to do was to get a Government.  People who were not satisfied with the policies of Fianna Fáil and with the progress in the various Departments of State have told me that they voted Fianna Fáil in the election and the reason why they voted Fianna Fáil was a negative one; they were activated by the two unhappy coincidences, by the fact that we could not sell something that it was extremely difficult to sell and because something else became a factor in the election.</P>
    <P>Over the next five years the position will be that we will have a Cabinet from a Party which has failed in many aspects.  It would not be proper for me to go into detail but I should like to refer the House to the dissatisfaction in the field of planning and planning permission.  The remedy for the ills that exist was provided by Fine Gael months before the election.  We introduced a Bill providing for the setting up of a tribunal whose function it would be to decide planning appeals. Had that been done, then everybody would have felt that right was done.  I am not saying that right has not been done up to this, but it is most essential in public life not only that right should be done but that it should be seen to be done.  If one wants to bring the people with one on the road towards expansion, the provision of more employment, and so on, the only way in which to do it is by making the people believe in one.  We provided the opportunity and that opportunity was arrogantly disdained by Fianna Fáil.  I think I remember the Taoiseach becoming a little annoyed when I mentioned this matter on an earlier occasion. I want now to draw attention to a very important facet of Parliamentary democracy.  The Taoiseach is responsible for every action of his every Minister. He accepts that responsibility.  If Deputy Boland breaks through a cordon of gardaí and gives some onlooker a thump&mdash;for all we know, the onlooker may deserve it; I do not know whether he did or not on the particular <Col N="87" /> occasion&mdash;that is exactly the same thing as if the Taoiseach did it himself and the Taoiseach must realise that one of his failures in the past five years was&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That I did not do it myself on occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  As a parliamentarian, the Taoiseach will agree with me that, if a Minister of State&mdash; let it be Deputy Blaney or somebody else&mdash;does something improper, in the tenets of parliamentary democracy it is as if the Taoiseach committed the impropriety himself.  That is one of the major tenets of parliamentary democracy.</P>
      <P>We are striving here to get a choice of doctor for the people.  Years ago I attended the making-up party over in Iveagh House at which Deputy Seán MacEntee, Minister for Health, made up his row with the doctors.  We all sipped champagne and said we would have a choice of doctor inside two weeks.  I sat for five years on the Select Committee on Health.  So did a number of others.  We wore out the seats of our pants, but nothing happened. Fianna Fáil have failed dismally over the last 12 years to provide that desirable choice for every individual who cannot pay for his or her own health requirements.  Despite that failure they got through the election, entirely for the two major reasons I have stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A modern approach to social welfare has been completely ignored.  There is no policy of graded contributions and benefits.  There is no attempt made to follow the system adopted in European countries.  No effort is made to patch up the worn-out fabric of our social services.  In an election year 10/- is given to the old age pensioners. A sop to Cerberus.  We are sitting here tonight looking at a conservative, stodgy set of Ministers, the majority of whom have been guilty of not doing their job.  But they have got away with it, for the very good reasons I have given.  I want to warn the new members in both Fine Gael and Labour that success does not depend on the way you put across your information. <Col N="88" /> It is only hard work which will bring a bigger and a better representation. It is not always the cheer-leading and the flag-waving that will do it.  During the recent election campaign mistakes were made on all sides.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>And Jack is back. The best of luck to him.  That is as far as it goes.  We have seen Ministers for Education moved.  We are to have another new Minister for Education now.  This is because of the failure of the university merger.  That has been an abject failure.  In fact, the Minister of the day, running away from the very people he should have been able to control, emerged through the toilet window of our premier university. That was another failure, but the Government got away with it for the reasons I have already given.</P>
      <P>In agriculture the noise of battle rolled.  Apparently it is still rolling. In Industry and Commerce there have been some advances, but there have also been spectacular failures, failures which should not have occurred.  What must happen during the life of this Dáil is that the people must be made to realise what we have to offer them in the detailed policies we adumbrated and then, by the time the next election comes, we will be in a position to meet the people with our policies sold to them and we will beat Fianna Fáil and, when we do that, we will do a good job for Ireland.  These people have failed to put these things across and by the unlucky and unhappy situation that developed, because of certain policies of the two Opposition Parties as they moved towards the election, they have been sent back by default.  They are very lucky to get back by default.  I suggest they would be a better Government now if they realised that and made an effort to work for the people, something they have not done in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say something on the policy that this country needs.  During the election campaign I went with two candidates, I will not say from what party, for a cup of coffee.  One candidate, a nice young man with little political experience, asked me what <Col N="89" /> was the speech I had made about harnessing all our sources of energy and power, public and private enterprise, the banking institutions and all the different workers and so on, and he said that private enterprise had failed and that it would have to be thrown out, that we would have to have a complete new society and new foundations. I told him to go into the town of Dundalk, in which we were then sitting, and to look at the number of small shopkeepers who were self-employed, the number with large shops and at the number of industrial workers&mdash;at this stage we were in an industrial area&mdash;and that he would find, and I meant this in no disparaging way, that we have a hotch-potch society.  There is no vast colonial wealth here such as you find in the south of England, no vast number of industrial workers who can produce the immediate and natural situation of a large Labour Party.  We are a party of small capitalists, large capitalists, workers, farmers, small and large, and so on, divided into those sections almost equally.  If you go through the statistics you will find that this is true. In that situation we want a Government that will harness every source of good and we have not got that from Fianna Fáil.  If we get that we will experience expansion.  Any moving to the right or to the left in this country is utterly ridiculous.  There just is not room to move.  Handsome is as handsome does as far as the Government are concerned and the Government that got back by default could do a good job for five years if they realised that and made an effort.  The next time we will make the effort for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>That contribution was certainly an improvement on the extraordinary type of hysteria shown by Deputy O'Higgins and by Deputy Ryan whose offensive references to the electorate who elected him and to the rest of us, quite astonished me.  To blame the Labour Party because we did not do on this occasion what we did on two other occasions, to our own great detriment, is an oversimplification of the whole process of forming governments.  It is important that we should know why we had the result which we did have and it is <Col N="90" /> probably important to Fine Gael to know why they did as they did but it is much more important in regard to the question of the Cabinet that the Taoiseach should try to assess in realistic terms the reasons for his own success, the success of his Party and of their election.  I am quite sure they would surprise him very much.</P>
      <P>It is not too serious if those of us in Opposition come to the wrong conclusions or make the wrong assessments but it is terribly important if the Taoiseach does the same thing.  We have tended to oversimplify the reasons for successes and for failures.  During my years in politics I have always been fascinated to see how prepared we are and how ready we are to come in here and lecture the people, farmers, industrialists, doctors, bankers, university people and the rest on the essence of the correct solution to their particular problems at any time and to say that we know in detail how it is possible for them to run their affairs well, yet we ourselves know so little about the whole process of motivation in politics, the process of forming public opinion, the reason why a decision is made by the public and subsequently changed.  One tends to project one's own particular prejudices into the situation and then arrive at a solution which happens to satisfy us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no single reason why Fianna Fáil won and we did not.  There are obviously such factors as the resources of the organisation known as Taca and the very considerable influence of the smear campaign, which is a very rare thing, and there is the fact that Fianna Fáil have a magnificent political machine which is kept in action from one election to another; there is, too, the factor of patronage to which Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien referred. It is there.  Legitimate, illegitimate, honest, dishonest, it is there and it is a very important factor in the determination of the kind of government or the attitude of people at the time of electing a new government.  There are also the very conscious decisions made by the Government to pack the various means of communication whether it is the control of university bodies, or other organisations, television or radio, and there is, too, the <Col N="91" /> necessity for a very powerful press, which Fianna Fáil certainly have. There are many factors involved in this process of the return to power or the loss of power that it is oversimplification to blame any single one of us.</P>
    <P>I wish that we could assess in very much more scientific terms this business of determining attitudes on the part of the public.  We as working politicians fail very much in not having a much better understanding of the working of Parliamentary democracy. We also have the position where many of us in the Labour movement are frequently blamed for being naïve or ingenuous when we go looking for power.  One has this dilemma of looking for power or looking for power simply in order to change society.  That is the very important difference between our approach and that of other parties in the recent election.</P>
    <P>It appears to be legitimate in a political democracy to do that if you want to, but where one simply looks for power it is a simple matter and you can pull out all the stops in relation to promises, undertakings, guarantees, the revolution, and the fight for freedom and all are used and interused in order to achieve a particular objective.  If one is anxious to change society, then it is not so simple because to change the attitude of mind of the mass of people in any community is obviously very formidable indeed.  Any person who tries to strap his watch on the right wrist instead of on the left, or tries to take one road into town instead of another knows how difficult it is to change oneself.  To change a society is much more formidable. If you could do it in a dictatorship or in a vacuum it obviously would be much easier than to do it with an articulate, live and very powerful opposition.  We tried to do something in that situation and, of course, found that we met the natural resistance of the community to change and that was reinforced by the misrepresentations of our policies on various occasions&mdash; misunderstanding, misrepresentations, whatever you like.  The general effect was the result as we see it now.  I am only concerned with this from the <Col N="92" /> point of view of the Taoiseach and his choice of Ministers because he may also have his pet theories.  I regret to say that he appears to feel that there is no need for serious change in regard to the individual personnel of a number of Ministeries.  That is a very serious failure on his part.  This failure of correct assessment of the win by the Fianna Fáil Party will turn out to be a very serious failure on his part. Many reasons have been given.  Some of them are true to some extent but I think that he himself has a very serious responsibility indeed to recall that most of the Ministers to whom he is entrusting new Ministries or reinstating in their old Ministries are Ministers who failed in a very signal way in their administration of their various Government Departments.</P>
    <P>It seems that memories fail very quickly, very easily, but is it impossible for people to put themselves back into the feeling of Ireland at the time, say, of the maintenance strike when, really, we were on the edge of a general strike, a general breakdown of the whole economy here?  I would remind the proposed Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, of his own attitude at that time.  Deputy Haughey I would criticise on grounds different from those on which he has been criticised up to the present time.  I concur with those who say that he is an extremely able man, extremely articulate and well able to look after himself in any situation, but I think we have to concern ourselves with the attitudes he has in relation to policy decisions which he has taken over the years in the Department of Finance and also the collective decisions taken by the key Ministries, Agriculture and Industry and Commerce in particular.  It is the failure of those three key Ministries which the Taoiseach, in my view, ought to carefully examine.</P>
    <P>On this question of taking power to change society one has to examine whether you are satisfied with the society in which you find yourself at the present time.  If you are reasonably satisfied, then I think you have a perfect right to continue in the way you have continued in the past.  If you think it is permissible to have 60,000 <Col N="93" /> or 70,000 unemployed, if you think it is permissible to have 20,000 emigrants, if you think it is permissible to have substandard social services, health services, youngsters not being able to get into a university or higher education, for whatever reason, people who have to live in dreadful home conditions, if you accept all that as permissible, then there is no reason in the world why you should go to all the great trouble and all the great mental torment that is involved in trying to go out and tell people that what they accept, what they believe in, what they hold to be sacrosanct and untouchable is something which must be changed if they wish to change society.  That seems to me at any rate to be the basic conflict between those of us in the Labour movement and those in the two other great parties.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is, of course, the key Minister and, therefore, Deputy Haughey's appointment is the most important appointment of all.  We believe that all the Deputies here would like to see precisely the same thing as we would like.  We do not believe that we have a monopoly of social conscience in the Labour movement. We believe that we would all like to have youngsters going to universities because they belong there intellectually or that the health services should be the same standard for everyone and that there would be no unemployment. But it is not good enough to want these things.  Up to the present both of the major parties have wanted these things but have not achieved them and they must face that fact: they have not achieved them.  That is not a hostile statement by me as someone opposed to the parties.  I am not opposed to the parties but opposed to their policies, policies which have failed and which have demonstrably failed.  I do not think you can seriously deny that.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it comes to the basic question and the question Deputy Haughey must face&mdash;the creation of wealth, the method for the creation of wealth and the distribution of wealth. That, to me, must be the key debate in the next five or ten years in Leinster House&mdash;the creation of wealth and the method of distribution of wealth, industrial <Col N="94" /> policy in relation to Industry and Commerce and Agriculture and then the fiscal policy in relation to the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Surely it must be quite clear after half a century that, even if we did accept these proposals which I have put forward from time to time as obvious ones in regard to fiscal policy, things like excess profits tax, capital levy, capital gains tax, corporation profits tax, serious death duties and things like that, it is quite possible that you still would not be able to provide the wealth you require in order to create the sort of society you want to create.  It is possible that there is not the wealth there.  It would negative my case against private enterprise capital if it were not there.  Private enterprise capital is simply concerned to make a lot of money for a few people and it does that extremely well. It is not concerned to make money for the child in Cahirciveen, Skibbereen or Donegal who wants to go to a university or who needs a health service.  It is a question of whether you are seriously concerned about the mass of the people or whether you are concerned for the protection of the interests of a minority of people in that community by a private enterprise capital society.</P>
    <P>We were particularly anathematised for our defence of the idea of nationalisation of public ownership.  I believe that the Taoiseach must ask his Ministers to inquire into this with less heat and less prejudice than they have done in the past.  One of the most astonishing things, which surprised me during the election, is that if one considers that there is an emergency within our community, as I think there is an emergency with unemployment, education, health, housing, all these problems to be dealt with, and they have not been dealt with in the last 12 years, then, surely, you must consider the two priorities, the interests of the majority of the people on the one hand and the interests of the wealthy minority on the other hand. On which side do we belong?  We should belong on the side of the mass interests of the people rather than on the side of the minority interests of <Col N="95" /> the wealthy few.  I would say that in Fianna Fáil's early days, and this is why they held support for so long, they were a radical, liberal party and won mass trade union support because of the things they did at that time.  There was an attempt to distribute income by way of social services in an equitable way.  Long since they have left that role.  At one time they did win because they had that interest at the time.  It seems to me now we are facing precisely the same dilemma again&mdash; the priority of interests, the priority of rights, the right of private property against the rights of the sick, the aged, the disabled, the homeless, the illiterate child, the emigrant, the unemployed. These are the equations the new Ministers must consider and come to some conclusion on how they are to relate them to the needs of the community here in our society.</P>
    <P>Take the question of public ownership. I have considerable admiration for certain aspects of the work of Deputy Seán Lemass when he was a Minister here.  When he was faced with an emergency he definitely turned to this smear word &ldquo;nationalisation,&rdquo; to public ownership, to solve his problem during the emergency years during which he nationalised everything.  I am astonished that the Fianna Fáil Party should turn to the Labour movement and attempt to traduce us because we talked about it because there is more nationalisation, more public ownership, to the credit of the Fianna Fáil Party than there is to any other party in Ireland.  At the same time, Fianna Fáil used a misrepresentation of this magnificent idea of public ownership in order to brand us as Communists when Fianna Fáil knew quite well that we were not Communists.</P>
    <P>In regard to this whole concept of public ownership, it seems to me remarkable that the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;Deputy Colley, in particular, seems to want to take on the Republican robe, and so on&mdash;should be so happy that our industry is now controlled from Scandinavian countries, Japan&mdash;Weston and the distributors there&mdash;Germany, Holland, France&mdash;<Col N="96" /> Potez&mdash;and so on, and the chains of national banks &mdash; American and British. How, then, can you condemn&mdash;these smear tactics&mdash;as alien the idea of socialism?  Who owns Ireland today&mdash; the Germans, Japanese, British, Americans, Scandinavians, French&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We are accused of being concerned with alien influences.  Is it not very much better that people like that are in control of our industry than Weston, Potez, Verolme, Basta, and so on?

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about them and I am also trying to convert them and the Taoiseach himself, too, at the same time because I think it is badly needed.  The Taoiseach will have a chance of replying to this debate and he can then controvert anything he <Col N="97" /> may wish to controvert.  This sort of repugnance to public ownership brings to mind the fact that Fianna Fáil's record&mdash;admittedly State capitalist&mdash;is a very good one.  To say that you prefer your community run in this way&mdash; because it is native, and so on&mdash;is humbug and you know it.  Not only that, but the whole process by which you try to create wealth has been shown to be defective and has not created the wealth.  Whether it concerned health, education, social welfare, unemployment, disabled persons, and so on, whenever I would ask a question here I would be told that the Deputy is being unrealistic, that the money is not there.  That is my case&mdash;that the money is never there for the mass of the people.  It is about time the Government understood that fact. That is the position which is there as a result of Fianna Fáil's preoccupation with the preservation of the sacrosanct ideal of private enterprise no matter what it costs in suffering and misery to all the people of the country, all the emigration, unemployment and all these other factors.</P>
      <P>The other development to which I referred earlier on, in regard to the proposed Minister for Finance, is the situation around the time of the maintenance strike.  A minute ago, Deputy Haughey said something about a surplus of £80 million.  Remember, he said that at the same time as he went on television&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Please be accurate. I spoke about £80 million extra credit this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and he went on television, a little before the election, and issued a solemn warning to the workers that, because of the deteriorating situation taking place in our economy, he did not want the maintenance settlement to be related throughout the whole of industry, and so on.  The position at that time was indeed one of great stress in the community &mdash; industrial stress.  The proposed Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, is a particularly talented accountant.  He had access to certain figures at that time.  He came to certain conclusions at that time.  These conclusions were <Col N="98" /> that the prospects were dire for the community.</P>
      <P>He went on television and gave his warnings to the workers.  That must be taken with other factors at that time &mdash;the proposal in relation to trade union legislation: something on the lines of the ESB locking up the workers type of legislation because they were allegedly essential workers.  It must also be taken together with other factors&mdash;for example, the discontent which existed in the community at that time.  There was a protest on the part of the homeless people, the people who, in our ideal society&mdash;a society in respect of which Fianna Fáil have been in office at least 12 consecutive years&mdash;must exist in the type of Griffith Barracks scheme under which men and women are separated from each other, from their children, and so on.  There were other problems in relation to students in universities.  There was the College of Art row on the part of the students and there was the call for changes in relation to University College. All of these were matters for which various Ministers, at different times, have had responsibility but have done nothing about.</P>
      <P>The important thing was that all this unrest stemmed predominantly from the failure of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce to control effectively prices and private profits.  People saw all around them the wealth about which Cardinal Conway was talking the other day.  They saw extravagant spending going on in the community which said it could not afford to pay its workers properly because there was a need for restriction of credit or a need for wage restrictions of some kind or another.  The fact that there was high unemployment; the fact that there was still emigration; the fact that these defective conditions existed in relation to housing, particularly in the Dublin area where they are particularly bad; the fact that we did not get the health legislation we were promised up to 20 years ago&mdash;all of these facts, taken together with the homily by the Minister for Finance about the need for wage restraint, led to considerable industrial unrest and considerable social unrest within the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="99" /> The response to that social unrest within the community, and this to me is the most serious possible development of all and the one with which I am most concerned, was the response of the Minister for Justice in regard to the Criminal Justice Bill.  This to me is the most sinister appointment of all by the Taoiseach.  It is a most illintentioned appointment.  It is an appointment which reiterates on the part of the Government that they believe that the correct solution to the social unrest or the social evils of which we have talked so frequently&mdash; unemployment, emigration, defective housing and home conditions, old people dying of hunger and so on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am particularly interested, of course, in the appointment of Deputy Childers as Minister for Health.  He is, of course, the most conservative Deputy who ever came into this House.  Over the years the Fianna Fáil Government have promised us health legislation, a free no-means test health service.  We were promised that nearly 20 years ago.  I never thought I would see the day when I would regret the fact that of all people Deputy Seán MacEntee is not Minister for Health.  Of course, as is history, the original free no-means test health service was his and that is about 20 years ago.  We are still waiting for a free health service on the lines of that proposed at that time.  I will be very surprised if Deputy Childers, Minister for Health, who has this magnificent capacity for lecturing us at every possible opportunity on the evils of socialism and the evils of public ownership and the evils of public enterprise is able to relate that hostility to any of these public activities, to running these various public enterprise-type Departments.</P>
      <P>I found on the canvass that of all issues there was none more important than the question of the health services. The doctors' fees have now become nearly the least important of the factors involved in the bad health service we have at present.  The most important consideration is the extent of the chemist charges.  I hope, and I shall certainly do everything I can on this side of the House, to try to get the Minister for Health to go back to the 1947 Health Act and to re-introduce the free no-means test proposals in that Act.  I believe that the appointment of the Minister for Health is a bad appointment.  I am quite certain that he has little or no interest in the welfare of the ordinary people or whether they get well or do not get well or what kind of service they have, whether it is good, bad, or indifferent.</P>

      <P>In our remarks this evening we have taken issue on several policy points which we see little evidence of being changed by the appointments to the new Cabinet.  I suppose we are conscious, in opposing some of the new appointments and in discussing the policy points of the previous Government, which presumably, by virtue of the present appointments, will be continued in this Dáil, of disturbing the carnival atmosphere here this afternoon and which has extended into tonight.  There has been a carnival atmosphere here today and it is important to re-establish right at the beginning of this Nineteenth Dáil the relavance of this Dáil to the problems we have in the country because there is a serious danger that the whole idea of Parliament might become increasingly irrelevant and be seen by the majority of our people to be irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who are aware of the real problems in the countryside must attempt to make our contributions in debates on Bills in this Dáil more relevant to the real problems which we see in the country.  In fighting this election we did not produce policies out of the blue.  We produced policies that drew criticism.  Our policies drew criticism <Col N="103" /> from both Government speakers and from the chief Opposition party.  We would have been very naïve indeed if we were under the illusion that our policies would find a ready electoral ear in all parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The Government which we are discussing here is the result of a dilemma at the heart of Irish politics.  The dilemma is that no party has sufficient strength to represent the real interests of the majority of our people as against the minority with the financial controlling interest.  This Government is the result of that dilemma.</P>
    <P>We were not under any illusions in fighting our campaign of independent policy that this would be courting any easy popularity.  Speakers opposite made the point about the jilted bride, Fine Gael.  It was stated that because of the Labour Party Fine Gael are not being led to the altar of coalition at the start of this Nineteenth Dáil.  We saw little evidence among the other parties of the existence of policies in their documents that would seem to answer the real problems of the electorate. We were entitled to push for an independent policy and for independent representation in this House and for an independent Government mandate when we saw no evidence on any side of these policies being pursued by other parties.  Surely we were entitled also to reject the traditional concept of coalition?  This party had served in a coalition before, when we saw a party which murdered the few remaining survivors of the &ldquo;Just Society&rdquo;. There is evidence to suggest we were correct in regard to the necessity of policies which would make for a fundamental improvement in the living conditions of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>There is notable unanimity on essential questions between the Government party and the chief Opposition party.  It is not of the Labour Party's making that we find ourselves in this portion of our country over which this Dáil has jurisdiction with only 17 Members standing for the socialist policy.  Let us lay the blame elsewhere for some of the problems of Irish society which gave us 75 conservative party Members in Government and 50 <Col N="104" /> conservative Members in permanent opposition.</P>

      <P>I hope the Deputy will amplify his statement rather than give us a reiteration of the remarks about Cuba.  We were right in rejecting the traditional concept of coalition.  In fidelity to our policies we could only go on an independent ticket.  It is correct to say that we have suffered a setback in the number of seats we secured in this House but that does not invalidate the importance and necessity of our policies and our ideas which we put to the country during the election campaign.  Deputy Corish has remarked that, if our policy measures were regarded as radical, surely the failures which successive Governments had met in policy areas and their lack of success in providing sufficient employment and in meeting any of the problems which now face this new Government are ample condemnation of the policies they have pursued.</P>
      <P>The various Ministerial appointments show little evidence that the Taoiseach, even accepting the limitation of the policies he fought with in this campaign, feels any sense of urgency in shuffling the Ministerial appointments. There is little evidence that the Taoiseach understands the necessity of a public relations uplift for the kind of Cabinet he wishes to present to the electorate.  It might be regarded as pointless to refer to the different appointments. It is important to illustrate the drift that marks this Government, even with a majority of 75.  The drift shows no awareness of the real problems facing the people.  Some kind of euphoria brought Deputies in here today for a carnival outing.  They expected some remarkable change had occurred in this country.</P>

    <P>Deputy Moran has been confirmed in his position.  He has been protecting jealously every noxious provision of the Criminal Justice Bill throughout most of last year.  He has grudgingly conceded certain amendments but the heart of that Bill remains intact and Deputy Moran remains unrepentant. Seemingly, Fianna Fáil also are unrepentant <Col N="105" /> about the particularly noxious provisions of that Bill.  This extraordinary interpretation of the election must give us all added fears for the future of this Cabinet.  There has been a feeling that this Cabinet considered that real strength and decisiveness in Government consisted in flouting the opinions of organised bodies in this country.  It would be a very superficial and wrong view for this Government to think that the way to permanent electoral success in this country lies along such a path.  It might be thought that for the future the path to election victory would be laid by flouting the opinions of the farmers and the organised opinions of trade unions.  The Fianna Fáil Party might feel this showed decisiveness and the right to rule as a majority Party.  It would be very regrettable, even with their majority and even with the limitations of their policies, that they should take such an interpretation from their election victory.  The Criminal Justice Bill has been condemned, not by a sinister element of this country, but by a large section of organised opinion ranging from the GAA to the Gaelic League.  It seems extraordinary that the Taoiseach should confirm Deputy Moran in this position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers has been elevated to the position of Tánaiste.  He will now look after the Department of Health.  It has been remarked that Deputy Childers is a conservative. Deputy Childers is in the company of other conservatives and yet this would seem to point out that the term &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; is reserved for him alone. Perhaps special honour is reserved for Deputy Childers.  I agree with that special honour for him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There were many men of all shades of political opinion in this country who would ensure that there would be political freedom in this country apart from Deputy Childers' father.  Deputy Childers is in a unique position in that he has expressed viewpoints on many matters, <Col N="106" /> both economic and social, over the past few years.  He has been courageous in saying what the Government really thought on particular questions and for giving the views of the Cabinet on contentious issues.  I consider his role in the Gulf Oil fiasco to be an illustration of the kind of conservative that Deputy Childers is.  As I recall it, a Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party who is no longer a Member of this House took issue with the kind of subservience that marked all our dealings with the Gulf Oil in the way they managed to get their plant installed at Bantry Bay without handing over a penny to the Irish people.  Deputy Childers, as he knows himself, opposed the representations of local bodies in that county who demanded that some kind of authority should be set up which would give the Irish community the right to take some levy, some cash, from Gulf Oil who were well able to afford it.  But Deputy Childers opposed all such moves and opposed all the representations made that Gulf Oil would pay something to the local community for the facilities they were given at Bantry Bay.</P>
      <P>I also recall Deputy Childers' remarks on the Posts and Telegraphs Estimate in the closing stages of the last Dáil when he spoke about Telefís Éireann.  I remember on that occasion he spoke of the necessity of ensuring that certain ideas and opinions were not voiced on Telefís Éireann.  Quite rightly, even some Members of the Fianna Fáil Party, Members of the Fine Gael Party and ourselves spoke at length on the alarming tendencies displayed in the Minister's speech at that time when in fact he more or less suggested more governmental interference, more authoritative interference was necessary to at least ensure that what he referred to as majority conservative opinion would be relayed over Telefís Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the appointment of Deputy Faulkner to Education is an exciting one.  Education at different levels is in turmoil.  I have never seen Deputy Faulkner in a turmoil.  He does not strike me as a man who is aware of the problems in education.  He does not seem to me to be equipped for that job.  I cannot see the exciting vistas <Col N="107" /> opened up by the Ministry of the late Donogh O'Malley continued by Deputy Faulkner in education.  The message I take from this appointment is that the educational venture of Fianna Fáil is now ended.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley, my colleague in Dublin North Central, is still in Industry and Commerce.  Deputy Colley has been known to depart to the United States at times of public importance and to return with greater haste at the end of such moments.  I recall he departed to the United States just before the last election and he returned with four factories in his back-pocket.  My colleague, Deputy Spring, tells me that the opening of one of those factories was announced six months before in Killarney, County Kerry.  I have not checked about the other three factories he returned with, whether they were announced at different periods during the last year in different parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley set out at the start of the last Dáil, whether or not he shifted his tactics during the course of it, to restore Fianna Fáil to its pristine Republican principles.  I can only conclude that in the course of that Dáil he gave that task up as a bad job because Deputy Colley stands condemned with the rest of the members of the outgoing Cabinet with the kind of drift which has marked the policies of this Government over the last four years and presumably will be accentuated and intensified over the next four years.</P>
    <P>We have seen a greater inflow of foreign capital.  We made it clear during the course of the election campaign we had no objection to foreign companies coming in but we felt if foreign capital was to come in greater surveillance would need to be made of the kind of companies setting up plants here, about their prospects and their future foreign markets, that we could ill afford a repetition of examples like Potez and that in fact much of the foreign interest setting up business in this country paid low wages and are not in fact contributing to the economic expansion of this country.  Deputy Colley stands condemned with other <Col N="108" /> members of the outgoing Cabinet for their enthusiasm for the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  Let me say, as a member of the party in January, 1966, which alone in this House voted against that Agreement, we have been vindicated in our experience of that Agreement over the past few years.</P>
    <P>We are taking a further ten per cent tariff cut this month.  The members of this Government during the recent election campaign showed little sign of any reservations about the outcome of that Agreement.  Yet this Agreement, which outlines the overall economy, which is the framework within which this Government operates, in which it strives to improve our economy, is prepared to hand over to very strong industrial interests in Britain much of our native enterprise. Already we see the signs of it in the large-scale expansion in the retail trade of foreign-based supermarkets. We can go over many other areas of equal importance The food processing industry and many other vital areas of industrial activity are increasingly falling into the hands of outside interests, yet this Agreement gave the green light to this large-scale sellout. It must obviously militate against the idea of large-scale expansion of industrial activity at home or indeed any possibility of capturing export markets in areas other than Britain.</P>

      <P>I do not know the difficulties of the Tory Party in Britain but I know that ideas differ about exactly who are the Tories in Britain. We are not in any doubt about who the Tories are here.  We have been accused today of whinging.  Looking back with hindsight on this election campaign a great disservice was done to the growing maturity of the Irish electorate and to the advent of any mature democracy in this country because it attempted to repeat the 1943 campaign of the Fianna Fáil Party and to re-introduce the policies of the late Senator Joe McCarthy, whose policies are now reviled in the United States <Col N="109" /> for his attempt to delay the advent of any mature democracy in the United States.  You attempted to portray us&mdash; give it any four-letter name you can think of but the upshot will still be the same&mdash;as having policies which were revolutionary and communistic when in fact our policy documents were quite specific in the areas to be brought under community control and in their commitment to democratic socialism.</P>
      <P>In the long run this method of conducting a campaign rubs off on all democratic political parties.  I can only say this.  If the unfortunate day ever arises in which we have a large scale Communist Government in this country it will be too late for people to cry &ldquo;wolf&rdquo;.  You have called democratic socialists the wrong name and used it for smear party tactics too often when you knew the contrary to be the case.  It certainly has paid off on this occasion but victory has been bought at a very high price.  I would say you have injected a sectarianism on this side of the Border which you attack on the other side of the Border.  You know you have not increased the status of this Parliament by attempting to portray us as other than we are as shown in our policy documents.</P>

      <P>I shall not go into that now but a sufficient number of your people opposite said it.  We have a new Minister for External Affairs and Deputy Hillery has departed from the Labour front.  I do not know if this is his confession that the job of instruction which this party took on here by which we instructed Deputy Hillery step by step on the problems of industrial relations and by which we made him eat his words and his Bills in fact, was justified.  We made him eat the ESB (Special Provisions) Bill in which case he admitted his error months afterwards.  As far as he is concerned the job of instruction has now taken a logical course and he has taken refuge in the Department of External Affairs.  He leaves behind him Deputy Brennan, a man not known for any adventurous disposition, a man whose reputation for the love of a quiet life <Col N="110" /> is well known.  He leaves Social Welfare in much the same way as it was when he took up the post and he now takes over the Department of Labour.  As far as we know he takes over a Bill concerning industrial relations from the last Government which is opposed by many trade unions.  I do not know if we can draw any conclusions about what he will do in the course of this Dáil or whether, from what we know of him, his new appointment represents a downgrading of the Government's intentions in this area or whether it means even greater resolution in pursuing the more objectionable features of that Bill.</P>

      <P>In any case, Deputy Hillery goes to External Affairs and he has been given good advice this afternoon by all Deputies in this party on the necessity of having a more independent policy in this area, of seeing to it that our policy of neutrality is adhered to and of seeing to something to which we have referred before, the necessity of tackling new trade areas more energetically than his predecessor did in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout this Dáil we shall do our utmost to see that the ideas we first put forward in this election campaign, the new Republic policies, are applied to the different Bills as they come up, so that the people will see that these policies&mdash;if any failing can be attributed to us in this election it is that we have attempted to do too much in too short a time&mdash;we put forward <Col N="111" /> are valid, that they apply to the Irish situation and apply to, and should be heard in this Parliament.  Contrary to opinions expressed during the election we are content to await the mandate of people to put us into power to carry through our policy ideas.  I do not for a moment have any lack of confidence nor do I think our policy of independence has been invalidated as a result of the election.  Politics is about more than personnel in Government.  It is because of our fidelity to policies which we saw to be necessary in our situation that we ran an independent campaign. Until we see evidence in Fine Gael or any other party of similar fidelity to similar policies we cannot talk of coalition in any meaningful context.  I cannot see any validity in the idea of coalition until such a day comes about. It seems to me that if we attempted for the first time to give the Irish electorate an idea of what politics should be about, that it should be about the issues of economic reconstruction, housing, providing full employment, about the issue of independence in foreign policy.  If this was our attempt in the election campaign and if the result has not brought full success it does not in any sense invalidate the importance and the necessity of repeating this attempt wherever possible throughout this Dáil.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brian Lenihan ends up in Transport and Power.  I do not know what plans he has in this truncated Ministry &mdash; atomic energy, perhaps. There is no doubt that he leaves his previous Department, Education, to some extent, in a kind of chaos.  We had strikes by teachers before he left; we had manifestations among the student body and, over all, we had the picture of a man who was retreating&mdash;other people have retreated&mdash; from the first intentions of the late Deputy O'Malley in education.</P>
    <P>The problems facing this Government are pretty formidable.  Even if they have won a 75 majority they face some incorrigible problems over the next two years.  They face the overall problem of working out the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.  They face the worsening in the balance of payments position and the old, incorrigible problem <Col N="112" /> of failure to provide an annual increase in the number of new jobs to take up the young people leaving school and seeking jobs and the young people leaving agriculture.</P>
    <P>It seems that our job in this Dáil must be to amplify the policy statements we made in the election, to underline the importance of an independent policy for our party, to be constructive in our opposition and also to make this Parliament relevant.  That relevance consists, as far as I can see, in ensuring that our opposition mirrors the frustration felt by so many at their lot at present and mirrors the genuine grievance many people feel.  We must burst the idea that this is a carnival day for any section of the people.  In fact, this day for us inaugurates the first stage of the election campaign of the next general election.  It may seem a long way away but in political terms it is near at hand.  The ideals that Fianna Fáil have apparently stifled in this election are not, in fact, stifled; Fianna Fáil have not, in fact, conquered and the validity of these ideals will be proved in the years ahead by opposition both in this House and outside it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the sort of debate in which I find it very hard to take part.  It is of necessity a debate and a discussion on personalities and during my time in public life I have always tried to avoid personalities but I feel a responsibility on this occasion to make a few comments and register my protest at certain appointments that are being made.</P>
      <P>We have had an unusually prolonged discussion on this motion.  That is not a normal feature of the procedure on the occasion of the formation of a Government.  I think it arises from the disappointment we all feel on this side of the House at the Taoiseach's failure in his first act of responsibility&mdash; the responsibility to form the best possible Cabinet from the material sent back to him by the electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach is an intelligent man and he must know that certain Ministers he has reappointed today were most unpopular and completely unacceptable to the majority of the people.  I believe that on June 18th <Col N="113" /> when the people gave the Taoiseach a majority they expected him to display courage and I think the quality that has been most evident in his appointments today is cowardice.  He must have known that the people objected to two or three Ministers&mdash;that the people did not want them, perhaps in any Department and certainly that they were unacceptable to them in the Departments in which they had served prior to the election.</P>
    <P>I am concerned particularly with the re-appointment of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Blaney.  Everybody knows that his period in office will be remembered as a time when relations between the farmers and the Government had never been worse.  We had the unique position that for most of the time during his term of office organised farmers and the Minister were not on speaking terms; organised farmers could not have discussions with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  That type of Minister should not be reappointed to that Department and I suggest the Taoiseach has a grave responsibility to use the power and authority the people have given him to ensure that such a man would not be allowed to continue in charge of agriculture.</P>
    <P>We have a situation now in which the most important industry in the country will be run by a man who has proved himself to be unacceptable, a man who has been marking time for God knows how long until the Taoiseach can set up another Department to which that man can be transferred. As I have said, the Taoiseach should feel an obligation to be courageous here.  This has arisen because the Taoiseach was aware that the Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries and Local Government represented a bloc in his party, a certain bloc of influence, and the Taoiseach did not want to disturb or upset it; he wanted to maintain harmony in the party above all things. I suggest that this is putting the party before the country and I am disappointed the Taoiseach did not use this occasion to ensure, instead, that harmony and some sort of decent relations are restored between the Minister <Col N="114" /> for Agriculture and Fisheries and the farming industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know that the industry has stagnated in the past eight years.  We know that farmers were encouraged in certain lines of production and that as soon as there was increased production in these lines the prices went down and so did the profits.  That applies particularly to milk, but we are not allowed to discuss details of policy in any Department. I refer to these matters in passing. Now we are told that the Minister who, to say the least of it, has shown himself to be the most unsuitable Minister in charge of agriculture, will go to the new Department of Housing and Physical Planning.  I submit to the Taoiseach and to the House that this Minister has a hopeless record in housing.</P>

      <P>Practically no houses were built between 1957 and 1964. We have a backlog of housing needs and there is not a hope of catching up on it.  However, bad as is his record in house building, it does not hold a candle to that of the man who is going back into the Department of Local Government.  There is no doubt that the Government intend to slow down house building.  During the period when we had a severe credit squeeze, this was the Minister who was in charge of the Department of Local Government, responsible for housing. He is the man who came in here every day at Question Time and insisted that the Government have tons of money. He told us: &ldquo;Go and build houses; we have tons of money for all sorts of amenities.  Why are the people not building swimming pools; we are giving 50 per cent grants?&rdquo; But the grants never came.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department in which there is the greatest need for a push forward is that of Local Government and I fear greatly because we are retaining in it this man with this hopeless record. The Minister for Local Government is being kept in his old place.  If the Taoiseach <Col N="115" /> were to listen to public opinion, surely the Minister for Local Government should not be left there.  The people have rejected him.  They have howled against him in their expressions in the newspapers and on every occasion when they had an opportunity. Nobody wants him but he is left there. His re-appointment looks to me like a reward for the job of gerrymandering. Let us face it, he did the job fairly effectively though he did not succeed in every area.  In the course of pushing that legislation through he said he would fix me.  The peculiar thing is that he nearly fixed himself.  He went nearer to fixing himself than to fixing me.  It is peculiar how things work out.</P>
    <P>Also, it is wrong to leave in the Department of Justice the man who has been responsible for the Criminal Justice Bill, a measure that has been so criticised, that is so unacceptable to the people and, above all, to which it has been so hard to get the Minister to accept improvements.  This is the opportunity for the Taoiseach to use the powers he has been given by the people.  He has not used them and he has to answer to the House and to the people for his failure.  He could easily arrive at the conclusion that he was quite entitled to appoint the same old people because he went to the people with the Government, with the Ministers in charge of the various Departments, and the people sent him back with a majority.</P>
    <P>The reasons have been gone into in considerable detail by the various Deputies who have spoken and I do not intend to prolong the discussion by giving a lengthy version of what was responsible.  One thing clearly emerges.  It is that the people wanted a Government with a sufficient majority to govern and for that reason we have had for some time a surplus party. Various parties have been described as surplus parties.  Labour have shown themselves to be the surplus party.  I have always been friendly with Members of the Labour Party, but on this occasion they have shown themselves to be the surplus party. Any party which is the smallest party in the House who decide that, come <Col N="116" /> what may, they will not join the other group to form a Government are not acting responsibly.  When they went to the people they had less than half the number of the Fine Gael Party.  They have come back now with only onethird of our numbers which proves that we need the strength of both parties if we are going to be effective. We now have the situation that the people have sent back to office a Government they do not want.</P>

They asked: &ldquo;What interpretation do you put on this silence?&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;The interpretation I put on this silence is that they will go back and vote for Fianna Fáil even though they are ashamed of what they are doing.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I believe they were ashamed of what they were doing. I should not like the Taoiseach to come in here imagining that the people now believe that the only party in this country fit to govern the Irish people are Fianna Fáil, because if he carries on with that attitude the people will very soon give him his answer.  I say he is on his last trial and Fianna Fáil are on their last trial.  Lessons have been learned in the course of the election. I suppose we will have a stable Government for some time and, I hope, a good Government.  As someone else said, we on this side of the House will give all the co-operation possible on measures we feel the Government are bringing in and trying to implement for the good of the Irish people.  We will oppose in the strongest possible way any measure which we feel is objectionable to us and to the country.  That is a responsibility we have and a responsibility we intend carrying out. <Col N="117" /> Before I sit down there is something else I intended to deal with.  There were discussions throughout the election and here today about a smear campaign being carried out.  I do not want to take part in any smear campaign. I have never done it and I do not intend to do it here.  I want to tell the House what happened.  This is something I should like to say publicly. The sale of Deputy Keating's farm was discussed and it was said that he was a speculator, that he made money out of this in a certain way and that he should not have made it. I am in a position to say that this is untrue and I have an obligation to say it.</P>
      <P>Long before Deputy Keating came into politics I was a member of a county council.  I met him in Dublin by accident.  I knew him and he discussed the sale of his farm with me. He also discussed the price he was getting for it.  Quite frankly, I told him&mdash;and I do not mind saying this&mdash; that the price did not seem to be enormous in view of the prices that were being paid.  He said: &ldquo;That is quite true.  I could get more if I were prepared to sell to a speculator but I will not do it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It is quite obvious that there has been agreement at least on this point so far as the two Opposition parties are concerned, that it has been decided to keep this debate going for some considerable time, and that there has been a planned campaign here to ensure by constant repetition of vicious personal attacks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The sack does not worry me, boy.  It does not worry me in the least.  I am not here for the sake of office.  Let no one think I am.  It has been alleged that we got here by various underhand means: by means of a smear campaign, by means of gerrymandering which I am credited with having carried out, and that it is because of those tactics that this proposition to appoint me and certain other members of the Fianna Fáil Party as Ministers has come before the House.</P>
      <P>Let me deal with this question of the smear.  What was the smear?  It was dealing with a published policy of the two Opposition parties.  Apparently we are not supposed to talk about policies. Apparently we are supposed to talk about the individual transactions of Ministers and members of parties. Apparently it is agreed by the two Opposition parties that to attack a man in his personal character is not a smear but to deal with a published policy is supposed to be a smear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We dealt with the policy which the Labour Party, or some of them, adopted, which was forced on Deputy Tully and forced on Deputy Corish by the gentlemen in the backbenches <Col N="119" />&mdash;I am sorry, in the second bench&mdash; who succeeded in their takeover bid of the Labour Party outside this House, and who are now in a position, behind Deputy Tully's back and behind Deputy Corish's back, to make the same takeover bid here.

      <P>The Minister is replying to charges that have been made at the instigation of Deputy Corish and Deputy Cosgrave by those persons, and I maintain that since there is this deliberate decision by the two Opposition parties to carry this debate over until tomorrow, I am entitled to reply to this viciousness of Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien and the other Deputies who indulge in the same thing here.</P>
      <P>As I have said, there was no such thing as a personal attack on an individual of either of the Opposition parties by any member of Fianna Fáil, but when Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien tried to win his campaign by the tactics of deliberate character assassination, then I felt it was just a matter of the merest justice to show that in both the Opposition parties there were also individuals who believed in maximising their profit from the sale of land and that in so far as the socialist speculator, Deputy Keating, was concerned, his land was obviously a speculation.  Deputy Keating tries to maintain that he refused a higher offer.  That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The higher offer was not an offer; it was an offer conditional on something else happening, and it was unserviced land at the time.  The offer-was not a real offer.  Secondly, at the time Deputy Keating had been in negotiation with the Dublin city manager for several months, and the offer came about because Deputy Keating answered an advertisement that was in the paper looking for development land. He tried to get a higher price; he could not get it, and eventually concluded his dealings with the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not say there was anything wrong with that.  What I do say is wrong is for his comrade to pretend <Col N="122" /> that when somebody else gets a good price for his land, not by going through the process of public auction, there is something wrong, but there is nothing wrong with a socialist doing it and nothing wrong, apparently, with the Leader of one of the Opposition parties doing the same thing, disposing of his property in two separate lots by public auction and making sure he gets the maximum price.  Why would he not do it?  The people showed their contempt for the filthy tactics of the Labour Party, the filthy tactics of the Fine Gael Party, by placing Deputy Haughey at the head of the poll and indicating quite clearly that they realised that anybody who had property to sell, who found that it had to be sold, would ensure that he would get a reasonable price for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>They showed a fair amount of contempt for Deputy Boland too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall deal with that question, too.  Anyone who will look back at the campaign and on the reports of speeches will see that in so far as there was any smear it was conducted by Fine Gael and Labour, and that Fianna Fáil merely dealt with the published policy or some parts of the public policy of the Labour Party.  I do not know whether Deputy Corish accepts it or not.  I know it was forced on him but it was certainly published as their policy; and surely we were entitled to deal with that?  It was Fianna Fáil that had to deal with this continuous tactic of personal smear, as was attempted here today by Deputy FitzGerald.  Deputy FitzGerald claimed here today that he had succeeded during the last term of office in creating a disbelief among the public in the integrity of the Government, an admission that not only during the election campaign but throughout the whole period of the last Dáil, the tactics of the Opposition were to try to undermine the integrity of the Government. Then they come in whinging and whining about a smear campaign which dealt solely with the published policy of the Opposition parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with the allegation that the Fianna Fáil record on housing, <Col N="123" /> both while I was a Minister in charge of Local Government myself and when my colleague, Deputy Blaney, was in charge, was a bad record.  This more than anything else shows the absolute contempt with which both of the Opposition Parties treat the intelligence of the public.  There is no other aspect of Government activity of which we have more reason to be proud as housing and on which we have less reason to fear comparison with the performance of the Opposition parties when they had the opportunity.  The Opposition parties promised the people a crash housing programme, and of course the people made sure that they would not get another crash housing programme because the people had previous experience of a crash housing programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Which reminds me that the Opposition parties finished up without having the price of a bag of cement.  The people know what a crash housing programme is and they accepted the Fianna Fáil contention that to solve the housing problem you must arrange, first of all, for continuity of the programme and that it would be madness to dissipate all our resources in one year.  They knew from experience that that was the type of approach you could expect from parties such as the Opposition parties because that is what they did before.  They dissipated the prosperity generated by the Fianna Fáil Government.  They dissipated the plans provided by the Fianna Fáil Government.  They dissipated the sites provided by the Fianna Fáil Government and then the housing programme crashed and the Coalition crashed with it.  The economy of the country crashed around their ears and the people had to put in Fianna Fáil.  It is that the people remember and they do not want another crash housing programme. They want instead the continuity of housing effort that has been a feature of Fianna Fáil Government.  They want the gradual building up to a high level of building like that which has taken place since the crash under the Coalition Government.  The one thing the <Col N="124" /> people wanted to avoid so far as housing is concerned was another crash housing programme and they succeeded in avoiding it in the only way possible, namely, by returning the Fianna Fáil Government to office.</P>
      <P>So far as we are concerned, we have had a record number of houses built in each of the last three years&mdash;12,000 in 1967-68, 13,000 in 1968-69 and, this year, provision has been made, including the inconvenient detail of further financial provision for a further expansion in the level of house building in this year.  There was one year since the housing programme got going after the collapse, not only of the economy but of the building industry itself, in which there was a smaller number of houses completed than in the previous year.  If there is one thing more than anything else that showed the superior competence of the Fianna Fáil Government to deal with both the country's economy and the provision of houses it was that particular year because that was the year following the year in which we had the credit restrictions, and so on, in 1965-66; there was a slight falling off in the number of houses completed in the year after that.</P>
      <P>This is what shows the fundamental difference between the Fianna Fáil Government and the alternative Government. We succeeded in dealing with exactly the same type of adverse economic trend that brought about the downfall of the Coalition Government because we were united and we were able to make up our minds.  There was a slight falling-off in the level of building activity followed by a quick resumption. There was only one slight hiatus.  The people know that the provision of houses depends on a number of factors.  They know it is a longterm process.  They know the limiting factors are the physical and financial capacity of the people themselves. Housing output, like everything else, must be related to the level of production in the country.  The people have clearly opted for a continuance of a sound housing policy.  They have opted for what they concede to be the solution of the housing problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in dealing with the housing situation here in Dublin.  There was a particular attack made by the last speaker on my predecessor in Local Government and on his record in regard to housing in the expectation, of course, that there would be no refutation.  The fact is that Deputy Blaney, as Minister for Local Government, saw that the best possible efforts of Dublin Corporation were not going to make any significant impact within a reasonable time on the solution of the housing problem in this city and, for the first time, in order really to get to grips with the problem, the State itself, on the initiative of Deputy Blaney, entered into the business of providing local authority houses and started a completely new idea of the building of houses by the National Building Agency, the Ballymun scheme, where over 3,000 dwellings were provided within the target period set and, despite all the difficulties encountered.  It is due to Deputy Blaney's activities in the Department of Local Government that the parties opposite now see disappearing the housing inadequacy on which they have battened in the past. They know that under this Fianna Fáil Government the housing problem, in so far as a housing problem ever can be solved in an expanding economy and in a city growing at the rate at which this city it growing at the moment, will be solved.</P>
      <P>As far as I can judge, the greater part of this spurious debate has been taken up with personal attacks on me. I want now to place on record the fact that I am proud to be the recipient of this attention from the opposition parties.  I am proud of the fact that I inspire such hatred in Fine Gael.  So long as that continues I know that I am all right.  I know the reason for it and I am just about as proud of it as I can be of anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told that we had been an arrogant Government and that I and <Col N="126" /> the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries are arrogant Ministers.  But it was not Fianna Fáil that had this arrogant slogan on every telegraph pole in the country; we did not tell the people we were going to win.  We treat the people in a different way.  I would not give the Opposition this advice only I know they are inherently incapable of taking it.  We have learned by long experience, since 1932, that the people are intelligent and that they expect to be treated with respect.  That is why, in the recent election, we did not go out telling the people Fianna Fáil were going to win.  We rendered an account of our stewardship and we asked the people for their continued mandate. We have got that mandate at every election since 1932, including 1948 and 1954.  If there were arrogance in the Fianna Fáil Government surely it would have manifested itself during the election campaign?  The arrogant slogan was &ldquo;Fine Gael will win&rdquo;.  Now we are told&mdash;it is admitted, apparently, that they did not win, though I find it hard to believe them&mdash;that, if they did not win the last time out, they will win the next time.  Let us hope they will continue to have that same approach the next time because they will not win. You do not win elections.  We did not win the election.  The people decided on the basis of our record and achievements and, on the basis of the obvious insincerity of the Opposition's approach and the obvious impracticability of their promises, they wanted Fianna Fáil to continue.</P>

I do not know whether he is still the Leader of the main Opposition party or whether the meeting to depose him has taken place or not, but it was the Leader of the Opposition party who offered to drive the Taoiseach to the Park in order to give Fine Gael the opportunity to govern us.  I do not know whether Deputy Cosgrave considers himself to have lost his licence on 18th June but I heard no offer to drive the Taoiseach to the Park today. <Col N="127" /> Perhaps he no longer considers himself eligible to drive anybody anywhere. We are all wondering when the meeting, parallel to the meeting that kicked out Deputy Dillon a few years ago, is going to take place.</P>
      <P>It was not the Fianna Fáil Party which went around trying to break up other parties' meetings.  The organised attempt to break up meetings came from the Opposition parties.  These undemocratic elements attacked our meetings. The organised attempt to deprive the people of free speech did not succeed. We have been dealing with that kind of thing all through our existence.

Just a brief reference now to the question of gerrymandering.  Our system of election is proportional representation with multiple constituencies and if PR gives the result that it gives why blame us?  You got the opportunity of doing away with it and if you say I gerrymandered the constituencies you got the opportunity of having a commission to deal with the constituencies but you would not have it. It is typical of the contempt Fine Gael and Labour have for the people.  They assume that it is possible for a party machine to gather detailed information on how the people voted in the past and how they will vote in the future and base the revision of constituencies on that.  It is assumed apparently that this pattern of voting is never going to change.  That has not been our experience. We have no reason to believe that is so.  The revision of constituencies was carried out in a way that complied with the rules of the system of election that we have and which made the constituencies as rational as they could possibly be.</P>

I remember those three divisions very well because if Deputy Clinton mentioned them once he mentioned them a dozen times.  He was whinging and whining about what he alleged was the Machiavellian operation by me in putting Ballymakily, Gollierstown and Coolscudden into North County Dublin for the sole purpose of depriving Deputy Clinton of the support of his loyal neighbours in these three district electoral divisions. I took this criticism very much to heart.

Since I have shown in so far as the last speaker's allegation of gerrymandering is concerned that it is not true, I think that this motion by the Taoiseach in so far as it concerns myself should be passed.  There were other Deputies who made similar allegations with regard to gerrymandering and I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that it was not only Deputy Clinton who I obliged by bringing in a special amendment in order to facilitate him.  I also obliged the Leader of his party.  Deputy Cosgrave came to me in my office and asked me could I please put part of Foxrock back into his constituency and I did it.  I brought in a special amendment to do that as well but I will say this for Deputy Cosgrave that he did not rush away and abandon the people in Foxrock like Deputy Clinton did. He at least stuck with them but Deputy Clinton, as I said, abandoned his loyal friends.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make three particular points with regard to the new Government which has been nominated by the Taoiseach.  The first point refers to Local Government.  I should like to refer to the crash housing programme brought in in the Agricultural College grounds half of which are in North County Dublin and half in the city of Dublin and, in particular, would like to mention one point here; from out of these towers named after one of our greatest patriots, Eamonn Ceannt, there has been a 33 per cent migration over the past 10 months and that migration figure from this tower compares unfavourably with the migration from the tinkers' camp at Landen Park in Ballyfermot where for 10 months there <Col N="134" /> has been only a 25 per cent migration of itinerant families.</P>
      <P>The point I am making here is that the accommodation provided for these people is a very substandard type of accommodation, that either the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Agriculture during his term as Minister for Local Government was responsible for this housing project and that neither of these Ministers nor the Agricultural College would expect any farmer, large or small, to house livestock in these dwellings which have been erected and which have been described as part of the magnificent housing programme Fianna Fáil claim they have carried out over the past number of years.</P>
      <P>Let me refer to one other thing before I come on to Health: Deputy Childers as the new Minister for Health will never need to introduce an Abortion Bill in this country because the simple fact of the matter is that any young pregnant woman in this town can go out to Pádraig Pearse Tower or to James Connolly Tower or to Eamonn Ceannt Tower in Ballymun when the lifts are not working and climb the 30 flights of stairs to her flat, thereby effecting a most realistic abortion.  I have experienced numerous cases of this.  Therefore, let Deputy Childers rest assured that he will never have to introduce legislation such as an Abortion Act.</P>
      <P>To come back now to a subject mentioned earlier in relation to the appointments the Taoiseach has made &mdash;gerrymandering&mdash;this seems to have been denied by the man responsible for it.  We have here, in the town of Ballymun, three towers named after our greatest patriots, James Connolly, Eamonn Ceannt and Pádraig Pearse, each tower within a radius of 100 yards, and yet each of these towers is in a separate electoral constituency. Furthermore, Deputy Boland, the then Minister for Local Government, was so mean as to divide the Michael Collins barracks into two separate constituencies. This was a new low.  I leave the matter there and move on now to the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sincerely hope that, during his term of office, Deputy Childers will <Col N="135" /> see fit to improve the services available to the lower income group in this country.  It is particularly unfair that dispensaries in Dublin should be authorised to prescribe hair shampoo, sun tan lotion and toothpaste at present and that this should be paid for by the private houseowner through his rates: this is what is happening in many of the Dublin dispensaries.  When Deputy Childers takes office as Minister for Health I would appeal to him to take the health charges off the rates as soon as possible before many of our houseowners &mdash; ratepayers &mdash; are driven to poverty due to the exorbitant bills they have to face at present.</P>
    <P>The social services have been neglected for a long time.  A previous speaker mentioned the starvation which could possibly exist among old age pensioners who have no other form of income.  It is a realistic fact that many of those people, because of brain degeneration due to vitamin deficiency, end up in mental hospitals where the maintenance cost is heavy whereas a paltry £5 a week would be sufficient to keep them happy in their own homes. I hope, also, that the Minister for Health will institute some clinics for the unfortunate section of our community who become addicted to drugs of one form or another.</P>
    <P>The last point I should like to make concerns the appointment of Deputy Hillery as Minister for External Affairs. I think this is one of the most successful appointments the Taoiseach has made.  The Taoiseach has appointed a medical doctor in charge of this Department. The problem facing the Department of External Affairs at the moment is the horrible situation that exists in relation to the Nigerian-Biafra conflict.  I am quite sure Deputy Hillery will treat this conflict in a humanitarian way.  Within the past 48 hours, the managing-director of the Joint Biafran Appeal, Mr. John O'Loughlin Kennedy, sent a telegram to the Chief Whip of each of the Parliamentary parties requesting that we have an all-party action on the Biafran affair.</P>
    <P>To give an example of how urgent this might possibly be, let me point out that the death rate in Biafra&mdash;<Col N="136" /> which is mainly amongst children and which I saw myself when I was there for a very short time&mdash;has risen to approximately 60,000 people per day. This is a greater number of people than exists in the largest constituency in this country.  We all know how hard it is to get around to canvass these people: one can imagine how hard it would be to get around to burying 60,000 people per day.  It is coming on now to 11 p.m. and, since the Taoiseach formed this Government, there have been almost 15,000 deaths of young children in Biafra.  In fact, in the past five seconds, over 200 people have died.  The Irish people have contributed over £300,000 towards famine relief in Biafra&mdash;quite a large sum of money, we admit: we all created a lot of trouble over a much smaller sum during the general election campaign.  The Irish people have put their money where their mouth is.  They have sent voluntary workers and, at present, they have a team of medical doctors standing by to go into Biafra at the call of the Biafran people.  It is with this in mind that I request the Taoiseach to expedite action to the United Nations because there is no doubt that genocide is the present policy of the Nigerian Government towards the Biafran people.  I would also suggest to the Taoiseach that he might give some consideration to the establishment of a refugee camp here in Ireland along the lines of those set up for the Hungarians and for German refugees after the last world war.  We should make it clear that we condemn the supply of arms by the British Government and by the Russians to the Nigerian Government and that we also condemn the French company who are sending arms to the Biafrans.</P>

      <P>I notice that the Ceann Comhairle is looking with surprise at me and at the clock.  I quite appreciate that the Chair expected that the Taoiseach would get in when Deputy Byrne had finished speaking.  That was the tentative arrangement.  However, something happened here a few minutes ago and, while it is not something that never happened before, it is rather unusual and, as personal references were made to myself and other members of the Labour Party by a Deputy <Col N="137" /> who is waiting to be confirmed as a Minister, I want to make a few brief remarks.</P>

      <P>At the present time, the only Minister here is the Taoiseach. His appointment has been confirmed by the President.  He came back with a list of his Ministers and gave it to the House.  There is an unwritten law that, when the Taoiseach gives the list to the House, the members of the Opposition are entitled to comment on the proposed appointments and, after discussion, the Taoiseach has the right to reply.  This has been accepted by everybody except Deputy Boland who unfortunately has left the House before I can address my few remarks to him. Not alone should he have known that, but the Taoiseach went to the trouble of writing a note to him which, in effect, said: &ldquo;Shut up and sit down&rdquo;. I am sure he was quite polite about it and it was much nicer than that.</P>

He got the Taoiseach's note, he twisted it up in his hand and he banged it on the ground to show what he thought of the Taoiseach, the Ceann Comhairle and this House.  This is the sort of treatment which Deputy Boland has been handing out to people outside this House and inside this House and he thinks he will get away with it again.  He certainly will not and no threat of physical violence, which he has not been unknown to try to use inside the House as well as outside it, will deter me or any member of this party from expressing our views about Deputy Boland's conduct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He came along with this cock and bull story about reading the Labour Party's documents and that he interpreted them and that he or his party only used what was in them against us. Of course, he knows, and unfortunately, I regret to say that the Taoiseach, for whom I have a high regard, also must <Col N="138" /> have known that the statements made by the Fianna Fáil people from the very top down to the very bottom about Labour Party policy were untrue. Sir, I want to make this comment &mdash; would the Taoiseach say that I am a communist?</P>

      <P>No, but members of your party did.  Members of your party did say that I was a communist, that the man who ran with me in County Meath was a communist.  They went around the parochial houses, they went around the convents, they went around the private houses in the county, they banged on the doors and they advised the people that if we were elected a communist party would take over and the result would be that the same situation would arise as obtained in the countries in which their daughters and sons were carrying on as missionaries. For goodness' sake, did anybody ever hear such nonsense in their lives?  Then Fianna Fáil come in here and say, in the person of Deputy Boland, that there was no smear campaign.  What does he call that?  What does the Taoiseach call it?  I can prove this.  If the Taoiseach wants proof I will prove it is true.  I will prove that it was done and it is regrettable that at the start of a new Dáil we should have this sort of thing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boland, with all due respect to you, Sir, attempted to turn this House tonight into a bear-garden because he got a few claps from the gallery for it.  He kept repeating what he thought was a funny line.  He repeated it six times.  He got clapped every time and he was allowed to continue. I am not faulting you, Sir, because with someone like Deputy Boland here, there is very little you can do and there is very little the House can do, unless the Taoiseach stands up and names him as he would a member of Fine Gael or a member of the Labour Party if he attempted the same antics.</P>

      <P>I want to make it very clear that we fought a campaign on a policy, that that policy was published, was presented to both members of the Church and State.  The Taoiseach, as well as members of his party, examined it. Members of the Church examined it and there was nothing in it (a) about nationalisation of land or anything like that and (b) there were no communist ideas in it.  There was nothing alien, as the Taoiseach said, to our Christian principles or Christian ideals.  Yet, people went around the country, people who are in high positions, and barefacedly made statements to the effect that we were communists, that our policy was communistic, and that the country would be ruined if the people of the country voted for us. That is what gave Fianna Fáil the return they got and nothing else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say something else about this.  As far as the Taoiseach himself is concerned I have a respect for him but I do think that he could have been a little bit more careful about the items which were published under his name, for instance, the implied threat that if Fianna Fáil did not get <Col N="141" /> back into power people would lose their increases in children's allowances, their increases in old age pensions, their increases in widows' pensions. It was there in black and white &mdash;if you want to keep these, vote Fianna Fáil.  This is the sort of thing which was stuffed down the throats of ordinary, decent people in the country.  I am not saying that everybody in Fianna Fáil did it.  Some of the people in Fianna Fáil are great friends of mine but I do think that this thing of having a separate morality as far as politics are concerned must stop.  When I look at some of the people who are calling myself and my colleagues in the Labour Party communists and when I look back on the records of some of the people who were talking it makes me laugh.  It was not the Labour Party who attacked the Church from the front benches of this House; it was not the Labour Party who called priests names in this House not six months ago, yet these are the people who will come along and successfully brand us as communists.</P>
    <P>I do not want to interfere with your time or your ruling with regard to the constituency but there is no doubt that if Kevin Boland nearly lost his seat in it he should have got a crown from Fianna Fáil because he presented them with an awful lot of seats which they got and which they otherwise would not get.  Fair play to him, he was able to do it and the majority of this House backed him to do it but it is a little bit ridiculous to suggest that we could have had a commission to draw the lines and we did not want it, that we would have had a commission if we agreed to do away with proportional representation and we were not having that one.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House but I want to point out that it does not matter a whole lot to us who is Minister for this or who is Minister for that.  There are quite a number of very intelligent people in the Fianna Fáil front bench.  I will give them that credit.  Some of the cleverest men I have met are front bench members of Fianna Fáil.  It is not that is wrong with them.  It is their general <Col N="142" /> attitude to the whole thing that is wrong.  Fianna Fáil people live in a closed little circle.  They are people who always had more than they ever needed.  They live within that circle and they cannot appreciate the fact that somebody with £3 5s a week who has to pay rent, rates,pay for light, coal and food out of that can be hungry at the end of the week.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that since the Government have been appointed whether we agree with it or disagree with it this House will confirm the appointment and the very least they can do is make an attempt to see what is wrong with the country because there is a lot wrong with the country.  Their majority in this House proves nothing.  It proves that they got the votes which put them in here.  As Deputy Michael Pat Murphy said they did not get the majority of the votes.  I suggest that they look not into their own hearts but into the homes of the people who are really in need and then they will realise that everything is not well in the country.</P>
    <P>I want to make one brief reference to Deputy T.F. O'Higgins's comment about whether or not the Labour Party attend in this House.  Sir, I claim to have the best attendance of any Deputy in this House.</P>

      <P>I have been in this House when there was only one member of the Fine Gael front bench, usually Deputy Clinton or Deputy T. J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i>, present.  We know about people in glass-houses who should not throw stones; before we start throwing stones we should make sure we are not in glass-houses.  With reference to the horny hands, I would not like to go around the Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil benches to check on the callouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People have been elected to this House to do a job.  We propose to do that job.  We will support anything the Government introduces which we consider to be for the good of the people of this country.  We will oppose anything we do not agree with, not merely for the purpose of opposing but we will ensure that no shady deals will be pulled by anybody nor will we be <Col N="143" /> intimidated by Deputy Kevin Boland in bad humour.  I would ask the Ceann Comhairle, as Deputy Boland is not here tonight unfortunately, to ensure that he hears at least that part of my comment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been an unduly drawn-out debate on this motion which is a motion for the approval of the members of the Government as nominated by me. Before my Party came into the House today I advised them to be temperate and moderate in what they had to say.</P>
      <P>I was reminded of a story I heard one time from a Kerry playwright whose group had achieved some success in a particular sphere.  He advised them that when their jug was full they should &ldquo;walk aisy.&rdquo;  I advised my Party to &ldquo;walk aisy&rdquo; this afternoon and they did so up to a point.  I should like to remind the Deputies opposite that catastrophes can happen to those whose jugs are empty as well as to those whose jugs are full.  We listened to a barrage of abuse here for most of the afternoon.  We listened to a catalogue of allegations of failure against the members of the Government.  It was said one failed in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, another in Industry and Commerce, another in Social Welfare, another in External Affairs.  We were said to have failed in the Department of Finance.  I was just wondering on what basis the country decided to put us back in office. I should like to suggest to the Opposition parties that they failed and not us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to another little story.  Not long ago a man was playing a match.  He got a knock on the head towards the end of the game.  His team were beaten.  He woke up in hospital a fortnight later, having suffered from severe concussion.  He wanted to get back immediately on the field and finish the game.  The nurse had difficulty in telling him that the match was over and that his team were well beaten. The parties over there are suffering from the same sort of shock.  The match is over and well won.  He was told also that when the match was over his own team started fighting <Col N="144" /> each other and blaming each other. Today Labour may blame Fine Gael and Fine Gael may blame Labour, but you can all blame Fianna Fáil.  We won the election and the people voted for us and their votes entitled us to win.</P>
    <P>I should like to advise the new Deputies here today.  Some people came in here telling us what to do and what the people of the country wanted, and how they wanted the country to be governed.  One speaker from this side of the House hit back at them and they were shaking their heads in persumed sadness.  All afternoon we listened to charges of corruption from new Deputies.  We listened to charges of mismanagement of public funds and to other charges of arrogance.  I decided our jug was not all that full that we could not hit back.</P>
    <P>I was given to understand I should speak after Deputy Clinton had concluded. A Fine Gael Deputy got up so a Deputy from this side of the House was entitled to get up and he defended himself and one of his colleagues who was accused of the same kind of allegations made during all the campaign&mdash; the smear.  I do not like to refer to a new Deputy but Deputy Keating referred to the reappointment of Deputy Neil Blaney as Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and spoke of it as an insult to rural Ireland.  It was not the Fianna Fáil Party who insulted rural Ireland.  It was the Labour Party who told them that they were not sophisticated enough, or, in other words, they were too stupid to understand the Labour Party's policies.  Rural Ireland helped give us our majority in the House.  People in rural Ireland have for the past two years experienced the greatest upsurge ever in their incomes. The farming community have enjoyed a degree of prosperity which they never enjoyed before.  Deputy Blaney was in charge of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries during those two years.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald referred to us as disreputable characters and then he raised a succession of points of order because Deputy Boland defended himself. Deputy FitzGerald is new in this House.  I should like to advise all the new Deputies that it is the Government's function to get the business of <Col N="145" /> the House through.  For that reason we normally restrain our Deputies in debate, but our Deputies are not going to be restrained by any direction from me in the face of charges such as Deputy FitzGerald and others have made this afternoon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Deputies objected to the individual Ministers whom I had nominated for appointment. They objected on the grounds that they were arrogant and that they had failed in their administration.  I assure the Deputies opposite that if any one of the Ministers on this side of the House fail I acknowledge that as a failure of the Government.  There will nor be any scapegoat in this Government. If any one Minister failed then it was a failure of the Government, but we did not fail.  The people believed we did not fail.  They knew we did not fail and that is why we are back here on these benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me turn now to the so-called smear campaign.  I repeat what Deputy Boland said.  We attacked the extreme socialist policies of the Labour Party because we believed their policy was contrary to the traditions of the Irish people and inimical to their aspirations. We will continue to attack it.  We attacked the Labour policy successfully during this general election.  If one can call that &ldquo;smear&rdquo; then we are guilty of it.  We did not attack individuals. We attacked published policy.  The Labour Party should not suggest that they did not have time to get their policies across to the people. Their policy was promulgated at the annual meeting over one and a half years ago.  They filled in on it at the last annual conference held at the latter end of last year.  This is now June and the Labour Party had one year to get their preliminary policy across and six months to deal with the detailed policy.  That policy has been rejected, not because it was misunderstood by the people but because they did not want it.  Deputies talk about &ldquo;smear&rdquo; when everything they possibly could dig up was thrown at us. Arrogance has been dealt with.  I wonder where the arrogance came <Col N="146" /> from?  Land deals have been mentioned. The Criminal Justice Bill has been mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference was made to milk prices.  The parties opposite had everything in their favour.  They suggested that, because of some failure of these Opposition parties to get together to suggest to the people they had a chance of an alternative Government, we succeeded.  We succeeded because we are a progressive Government.  As Deputy Dr. Noël Browne said, we have more progressive legislation to our credit than any other party in this country.  We have more progressive legislation to our credit than any other Government, socialist or otherwise, in Western Europe.  We did not attack Fine Gael policies to any extent.  Even though Deputy Cosgrave seemed to suggest that their policies were still alive Fine Gael policies have been rejected eight times in the last four and a half years.  The &ldquo;Just Society&rdquo; policy was rejected at the last general election, in at least six by-elections and now again at this general election.  We did not consider attacking that policy presented much of a problem.</P>
      <P>I want to talk about the new Department. I am not going to speak very long because I want to finish the business so that we can get about the job of having the Ministers sanctioned.  I decided many months ago that, if Fianna Fáil got back, a new Department was to be set up.  I recognise that, with all the resources at our command, financial, physical and human, we could still dissipate those resources unless they were properly co-ordinated under some one umbrella.  Having been returned to power, I decided I would do this and, in order to do so, certain adjustments had to be made in the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say this.  Deputy Kevin Boland said earlier he was not interested in office.  He came to me and said if I did not want him on the front bench he was quite happy to go to the back benches.  But I told Deputy Kevin Boland that I had this idea and that I wanted this co-ordination and rationalisation of our building construction <Col N="147" /> potential.  I knew it was going to be a difficult job.  I knew it would take some planning.  I also wanted to ensure our social legislation would be as advanced as our resources could possibly make it.  I made up my mind that Deputy Kevin Boland was the man to take charge of Social Welfare and that Deputy Neil Blaney was the man to take charge of Planning and Construction. That is the reason why this new Department is being set up and that is the reason why Deputy Kevin Boland was asked by me to take over the Department of Social Welfare.  That is not to suggest by any means that the Deputy who was in it, Deputy Joe Brennan, was inadequate for the job because under his aegis, more strides were made in social welfare than under any Minister ever in this State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was suggested we won this election by default.  Let me repeat again.  We fought the election on the basis of our record of progress particularly over the last ten years.  We fought it on the basis of our published programme and let nobody say, Deputy FitzGerald or anyone else, that this was a programme provided for us by civil servants.  This Government was appointed not as puppets for civil servants and certainly not as puppets for any members of the Opposition. This programme was formulated as a result of deliberate policy by each and every one of the Ministers of the past Government in the sphere of responsibility over which he had clear control.  This policy was published and adumbrated by me in broad outline in my Ard-Fheis speech long before the Third Programme was published.  It was on the Third Programme, a realistic programme of social and economic expansion, that we fought this election.  We told the people what that programme contained and we pursued our policies vigorously before the populace as we are going to pursue <Col N="148" /> them vigorously in this House notwithstanding any attempt to delay our progress by the people opposite.</P>
      <P>Let me say one final thing.  Earlier today Deputy Dr. Browne spoke about their being small in numbers but they could beat us in many respects.  I knew what he was referring to, this so-called superior intellectual capacity.  There are two attributions I just cannot stand.  The first is an intellectual and the second is a worker.  I regard everybody who is doing a job in this country a worker whether he works with his head, his hands or anything else.</P>

      <P>Whether a person is an intellectual or not often means that one has not had the advantage of going to a university or, having gone to a university, has not had the means or facility of taking a secondary degree.  The intellectual capacity on this side of the House is as good as on any side of the House.  The people have proved that by returning Fianna Fáil Governments in successive elections since 1932.  I do not want to go into the details.  It is very difficult, winding up a debate that has been as protracted as this one, without referring to some points made earlier on.</P>
      <P>When this Government have been approved each and every one of them, every member of the Government, will be on his toes to ensure that every aspect of Fianna Fáil policy is carried out effectively and expeditiously.  We are going to pursue and follow a programme that will ensure that when the next election comes the posters about &ldquo;Fine Gael Will Win&rdquo; will be very scarce, very sparse.  We are going to ensure by the progress we will make under our policy that Fianna Fáil will be back again in five years time.</P>
