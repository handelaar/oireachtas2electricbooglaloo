    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 41b:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (3) to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() For the purposes of the foregoing subsection &lsquo;arrangements for providing services therein&rsquo; shall be construed as referring to questions of time, place or eligibility, and not to the manner in which services are provided.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The section as it stands says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  A health board may, with the <Col N="2011" /> consent of the Minister, provide and maintain any hospital, sanatorium, home, laboratory, clinic, health centre or similar premises required for the provision of services under the Health Acts, 1947 to 1969.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Minister may give to a health board such direction as he thinks fit in relation to the provision or maintenance of any premises provided and maintained under subsection (1) and in relation to the arrangements for providing services therein, and the health board shall comply with any such direction.</P>
    <P>It is important that it should be made clear to everybody that this does not refer to certain things, such as the manner in which the services are provided. This amendment is put in to make sure that the arrangements for providing the services shall refer to the question of time, place or eligibility but not to the manner in which the services are provided.  The Minister may say this is not likely to happen but it would be too bad if he could say to a section of the people that they could get a certain type of treatment and as the section stands he could say this. I should be glad if the Minister would comment on this matter.  If he tells me he is prepared to alter the section to cover my point I am prepared to meet him on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This seems to be related to amendment 21a to section 16 and I have already dealt with it. This amendment would have the effect of preventing the Minister for Health from issuing directions on the manner in which services are to be provided in hospitals: it does not-relate to the manner in which the medical profession would carry out their duties or to the treatment they would give. Arrangements for providing services must cover more than questions of time, place and eligibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, the Minister must have some part, some power in relation to the methods used by hospitals for purchasing drugs and equipment and the general administration of hospitals &mdash;organisation of catering and so forth. He must be able to make use of what <Col N="2012" /> knowledge he has in the Department to see that these things are done before he can begin to promote modern methods in the best and most economical way.  Obviously the Minister, who is ultimately responsible for the country's health services, must have some ultimate power to give directions in these matters.</P>
    <P>It is fantastic to think that I would use this section so that I could direct doctors how to treat patients.  I copper-fastened that in my comments on section 16, and the Deputy can be assured that this power would never be construed in that way.  If the Minister for Health started to dictate to the medical profession, there would be such a flaming row&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>History has proved to us that Ministers for Health in certain countries had rights written in many years ago to instruct doctors and surgeons how they should treat certain patients.  When they were accused of overstepping their duties, these Ministers for Health were able to point to innocent looking Acts and say: &ldquo;There is the power&rdquo;.  I would be the last person to accuse the present Minister of anything like that, but we are here not making law for the present Minister for Health but for this land and it is law which will last for a long time.</P>
      <P>For instance, the Minister has told us it will be 15 to 20 years before some sections of this Bill become operative.  We can, therefore, assume that we are making law for 20 years or maybe longer.  I fear that there is too much authority being given to the Minister by this section and I appeal to him to have another look at it.  If, after further examination, he decides that nothing like this would be done, I am satisfied.  If he is not so satisfied I ask him to have the necessary alteration to the section made before the Bill becomes law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly prepared to ask the officers of my Department to get in touch with the legal draftsman before the Bill comes to its Report Stage to see if there is anything in the Bill which would enable me to dictate the manner of treatment.</P>

    <Col N="2013" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 37 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section could be a useful one but it could also be one of the most dangerous in the Bill.  It entitles the Minister for Health to give directions to any health board as to the manner in which services are to be provided and as to the number of hospitals, sanatoria, homes, laboratories, clinics, health centres and similar premises to be operated by a health board. Under this section, the Minister for Health may, if he thinks fit, order the closing of a hospital.  He may order the closing of a number of hospitals irrespective of objections voiced by local doctors, by local nurses, by the community and by public representatives.</P>
      <P>It is, therefore, a section which must be examined very carefully, and the view in Fine Gael is that this section is too wide, too dangerous, too extravagant in the use of power which it gives to the Minister for Health.  We fear that full consideration will not be given by the Minister for Health to the interests of the patients and the personnel who operate the hospitals.  We appreciate that this is based on recommendations in the report and outline of the future hospital system, referred to as the FitzGerald Report.  Although that report has a number of sound basic arguments, it would be dangerous to overlook the desirability of giving full consideration to maintaining the excellence of the Irish hospital structure which has given it a personality, a humanity and warmth and a community interest and close relationship between patients, doctors and the community, that could not be found in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the international recommendations in relation to hospitals have arisen because of problems which exist in other countries and which to date have not developed here, although I appreciate there is a danger some of them may.  I have particularly in mind the problems which arise because of inadequate numbers of nurses and <Col N="2014" /> medical specialists.  But the very problems which we are endeavouring to provide for in this section could possibly be accentuated by the methods which we are proposing to overcome or to prevent them.</P>
    <P>If there is to be a substantial closure of local hospitals throughout rural Ireland, which in some cases are staffed by married nurses, we could easily arrive at a situation in which we would have large regional hospitals, large general hospitals, without having nurses available to those hospitals because of the distances which qualified nurses would have to travel to reach such hospitals.</P>
    <P>This is something, therefore, which we must approach with considerable caution.  In the giving of directions to health boards as to the hospitals which they must maintain or must close, there are no guidelines set out in the Bill, there are no signposts indicating the directions the Minister has in mind; and there is no obligation on the Minister to consider many of the problems which have been referred to in the course of the debate on this Bill.  There is not even an obligation on him to consult with health boards before he gives directions.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably say that it would be unreal to think he would not consult with health boards.  The practical probability is that the Minister would have such consultations, but there is no obligation on him to attach weight to any views which he may receive.  Therefore, we must pay particular regard to the problems which will probably arise in some parts of rural Ireland where immense distances will have to be travelled on inadequate roads to bring patients to the hospitals if the suggestions in the FitzGerald Report are to be accepted <i>in toto.</i></P>
    <P>People in such counties as Donegal and Kerry, for instance, have some substantial distances to travel and yet the proposals which have been made would appear to indicate neither of those areas are to have general hospitals of their own.  If a very modern, satisfactory, well-equipped ambulance service were guaranteed, then one could accept with more equanimity <Col N="2015" /> some of the recommendations proposed in the FitzGerald Report but we must insist that a condition precedent to the closing of any hospital would be the immediate availability of the very best ambulance equipment.</P>
    <P>County Donegal, for instance, has a very unfortunate history in relation to ambulance services.  The local authority's ambulance service was quite inadequate and because of this inadequacy it fell to the community by voluntary effort to provide a modern ambulance service.  This has been used on innumerable occasions because of the non-availability of a local ambulance service or because of the delays which have arisen in providing an ambulance service.  This is unsatisfactory and I think Donegal has proved its point.  By voluntary effort an ambulance service was made available which the public authority had failed to provide. That was in a different hospital structure to that which is now proposed.  Donegal is to lose one, if not two, of its hospitals and the public authority have not yet accepted the necessity for a substantial improvement in the ambulance service.  It is only by the establishment of a national ambulance service, with the very best modern equipment and fully staffed, that we can face any possibility of the restructuring of our hospital services.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister's remarks on the earlier amendment.  I certainly interpreted subsection (2) which provides for arrangements for services as referring to catering, laundry and services of that kind rather than the application of medical skills, but I can see that the worries expressed by Deputies O'Connell and Tully could be justified if this were to be interpreted as applying to medical skills.  There is a case to be made in urban areas for reorganisation of the services dealing with catering, laundry and so on, and we must welcome the streamlining of laundry services in the Dublin region.  There is no justification for maintaining a separate laundry for each of the 57 hospitals in the Dublin area and our only regret about what has occurred is that it took the Department such a long time to come to the <Col N="2016" /> right decision and to take action to implement it.  As a result of that, we had the ludicrous position of the Dublin Health Authority itself centralising its laundry services and undergoing a considerable amount of expense in order to bring about this centralisation. We now find that, having completed this particular restructuring, the Dublin Health Authority has received notice that it must close down this new central laundry and amalgamate it with a central laundry to be operated for both the local authority and voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>If there is to be a centralising of health services, if the Department have any useful suggestions to make about the restructuring of the catering, laundry and ancillary services, then they must give their indications well in advance and prevent a recurrence of what happened in the Dublin region. What happened there was that the health authority for a long time wanted to get ahead with the centralising of the laundry services.  It was prevented by the Department from doing that and the Department only gave their approval after a long waiting period, but a short time afterwards the whole idea was upset by having this new central laundry.  However, this is all so much spilt milk and there is no use in crying about it but it is useful to point out now that this should not happen again.</P>
    <P>We urge the Minister to give special attention to the provision of adequate living accommodation for nurses and to bear this in mind when he is considering the rearrangement of hospital and other services.  Our nurses deserve a great deal more than they have yet received from our community and one of the greatest shames of our entire health services is the utterly inadequate living accommodation provided for them.  Accommodation for nurses should be regarded as equally important as accommodation for anybody else.  If you have not got a happy, contented and healthy nursing profession you are not going to have the best skills available for patients, and this matter must receive urgent attention in order to remedy the many defects which already exist.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2017" /> This section, as drafted, is dangerous. Even with the best will in the world it is going to cause difficulty. It is going to lead to conflict and serious rivalry which will not be assisted by the lack of guidelines in the section itself.  One can say where you have not got guidelines you have not got restrictions and, therefore, the section can be used with greater discretion according as circumstances may change.  That is very well but, at the same time, we think it would be better to set out some principles which should guide the Minister in making his decision, and if in the course of time it were found necessary to modify those in the light of further medical developments and social requirements it would be open to the Minister to seek the approval of the House for any modifications that might be considered necessary.  As it is now, we are writing a blank cheque for the Minister to close hospitals and clinics all over the place.  While we appreciate he is not likely to do that without providing accommodation elsewhere, it is going to cause real trouble.</P>
    <P>At the same time as the Minister is seeking this power we have not yet received from him or from the Government any indication of where he is going to get the extra money to build the extra accommodation to replace that which is going to be closed.  The proposals in the FitzGerald Report, which are regarded as urgent, would require something in the region of £40 to £50 million for new hospital buildings in the next five years.  This is something which has to be met and it is imperative that it be considered no less important than the provision of accommodation for university education.  There is little use in having proposals such as those contained in the FitzGerald Report if we leave them suspended in the sky.  It is vital that the Government accept and set out certain priorities and we believe one of those priorities should be the restructuring of hospital services and providing the necessary money. As the money must be provided, as the work must be done, as the principles in the FitzGerald Report are acceptable, we must not overlook the <Col N="2018" /> importance of maintaining adequate hospital services for all sections of the community, readily available to all.</P>
    <P>One of the essentials must be the provision of an acute surgery unit in every county.  We can understand why regional and general hospitals must be based upon a limited number of urban areas.  That might be desirable or, indeed, necessary in order to have them adequately staffed and equipped within our budget but we believe it is equally necessary to maintain an acute surgical unit in each county because if you do not, many of the less complicated cases which are now adequately and expeditiously attended to in local hospitals will become serious or, perhaps, fatal cases because of the distances to be traversed.</P>
    <P>The Minister's argument on this is that available evidence suggests that more people die or become chronically ill because of inadequate attention in local hospitals than would die or become chronically ill because of the long distances they would have to traverse to go to general or regional hospitals farther removed from their homes.  But it will be of little consolation to the dying person or his next-of-kin to know that statistically he is insignificant and that statistically the argument was in favour of his dying and other people living.  An effort must be made to maintain acute surgical facilities close to the people so that the appendix can be dealt with as efficiently in the future as in the past.  The acceptance of that requirement does not over-rule the suggestion that we must also concentrate our efforts on building up modern, well-equipped regional and general hospitals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, I could shorten the debate on this section. Section 37 was drafted before the FitzGerald Report was published and before there was a great deal of discussion on it.  First, you cannot close a hospital or institution without providing beds elsewhere for the patients concerned and the idea that a Minister for Health would order the closing of a hospital without providing beds or facilities elsewhere is impossible to <Col N="2019" /> conceive.  Secondly, we are, of course, helping health authorities to improve the ambulance service through the ambulance committees, through provision of acceptable standards for new ambulances and by training of ambulance drivers.  In that respect we have had a great deal of advice from abroad particularly from western and northern highlands in regard to the distances patients can travel in an ambulance to hospital.</P>
      <P>The FitzGerald Report, with the exception of old and outdated hospitals in Dublin, did not recommend the closing of hospitals.  It recommended change of function.  In certain hospitals it recommended that surgery might end and be replaced by something which I regard as far more valuable, a complete diagnostic outpatient service with ambulance consultants who would help to keep people out of hospital. One of the objectives in our policy is to keep people out of hospital because we have too many people in hospital and staying too long in hospital.  Our record for hospital stays is not too bad but it is not as good as in some European countries.  We want to keep people out of hospital and treat them in advance for many conditions so that they do not have to go to hospital or will be there for a shorter period.  The outpatient ambulance consultant diagnostic service is one of the most important features of the FitzGerald Report and is of far greater significance than anything related to where one conducts surgery of various kinds.</P>
      <P>As regards the closing of a hospital I propose that we repeat the sections in the 1947 Act so as to provide a democratic procedure and provide that the Minister must hold a local inquiry before directing the closure of a hospital or institution.  I hope that will satisfy the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be putting down an amendment on the next Stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, on Report Stage. Later on, I shall be explaining, in relation to the formation of Comhairle na nOspidéal, the proposals I shall have and the regulations will come <Col N="2020" /> before the House providing for a similar inquiry in the event of Comhairle na nOspidéal not recommending the appointment of some particular consultant in some particular hospital. That will arise on section 40.  I hope that will satisfy the House.  I believe in these democratic processes.  I believe a Minister must finally act according to his conscience after hearing the result of an inquiry as to what he should do but that he should have the inquiry.</P>
      <P>As the House may imagine it has taken me some time to grasp the main elements of our health services.  I have been Minister only since July 2nd and I have steeped myself in this Bill.  If I had the time to notice this obvious difference between the 1947 Act and this Bill, I think I would have said to my officers: &ldquo;In modern times and with the need for greater communication and with more interest being shown by people in institutions we should have that inquiry arrangement put into the Bill&rdquo;.  I am sorry I did not do it.  I think it is perfectly reasonable to do it and I hope that satisfies the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>A feature of the discussion on this Bill is that there are so many experts giving different views on it.  Everybody who comments on the Bill claims to be an expert.  I am not, let me hasten to add.  I am an ordinary layman, a member of a local authority and, like the Minister and everybody else in the House and most people in the country, anxious to do the best possible for all health services.  We should all accept that the people who drew up the Bill and advised on it, and the Minister, and both sides of the House agree that we should try to have the best possible service.  It is necessary to say that because some people tend to say that one side or the other are attempting to knock down the improvements suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this section I should like to point out a number of things and first the fact that before the elections Deputy L'Estrange in this House asked the previous Minister, Deputy Flanagan, about a hospital in Mullingar.  The reply he got was that it would be some time before a change would be made. <Col N="2021" /> Deputy Carter, who was sitting where Deputy Lenehan is now sitting commented: &ldquo;Will it not be 15, 20 or 25 years before it will be possible to have the new hospitals which will be required to replace the existing ones?&rdquo; Deputy Flanagan as Minister said, as far as I can recollect, in view of the money required and all the arrangements to be made, it could take that length of time.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to remember that when we talk about certain arrangements having to be made under this section.  Many people are under the impression that within five years we shall have a complete change in the hospital service but I think everybody now knows or should know, following the discussions here, that that is not so. Secondly, some of the suggestions made in the FitzGerald Report, which the Minister said was written after the Bill was drafted, are too ridiculous for words.  For instance, there is the suggestion which would move a hospital patient across 60 miles over terribly bad roads to a central hospital which on the map might appear to be central but which would mean bringing him entirely away, not only from the place where he would normally get treatment but away from where there would be a bus service or access of any kind for relatives wishing to visit him.  The Minister is as much aware as we are of the value of visits of relatives to people seriously ill.  We seem to be at cross-purposes in regard to some of these suggestions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made great play, and to an extent he is right, with the necessity to cut down the number of bed days in hospital if people could be treated as outpatients.  I wonder does the Minister know what actually happens in regard to outpatients in most hospitals.  These people are brought to hospital in one of three ways.  They travel themselves if it is convenient, they travel by ambulance, or they travel by a local taxi employed for the purpose of bringing them to hospital. Usually more patients are brought to the hospital than can be dealt with in a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>The first patient arrives at 9 o'clock in the morning and has to sit in a cold <Col N="2022" /> taxi, or minibus, or car, and it has been known for people, particularly people suffering from arthritis and ailments of that kind, to have to sit in a cold vehicle from 9 o'clock in the morning until 5 o'clock in the evening and, because of their condition, they cannot travel to get food.  No food is provided in the local clinic.  Will the Minister consider that when he is making arrangements for treating these people as outpatients?  Will he remember that the present staffs are inadequate and that the present arrangements are completely outdated?</P>
    <P>I was interested recently to hear in reply to a question that Kerry County Council had provided some food at their clinics&mdash;a mid-day meal or a hot meal of some kind for the patients who come in for outpatient treatment. The Minister must be aware that, in most cases, the best that can be offered is a vending machine offering coffee, which most people in the country do not drink anyway, or hot cocoa and usually the machine is out of order because somebody tried to get sixpence worth out of it for a washer.  Let us be honest about this.  There is no point in asking why do they not go down the town and go to a café or hotel.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister try to explain to me how somebody who has a payment of less than £3 per week can go to a hotel and pay for a meal, even if he is able to get there?  In many cases they cannot get there.  This is too serious to allow it to pass by and say: &ldquo;We will make a grand new world. All we have to do now is pass this Bill and we will have the patients who are not really ill, and who are being retained in hospital, treated as outpatients. They will be brought to the local clinics one or two days a week and there they will be cured in less time, and also have the comfort of their own homes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister must take an interest in this.  It is not sufficient to say that somebody else will be doing it.  This has gone on for far too long.  At local authority level we have complained about it and the reply we usually get is: &ldquo;The grant from the Department is not sufficient.  The rates are too high. We cannot provide it&rdquo;&mdash;and we are <Col N="2023" /> back where we started.  That is one aspect.</P>
    <P>The second aspect is the question of what the hospital buildings are likely to be.  The Minister said no one will close the local hospitals, though they may change the actual arrangements. They will not be used for operations but something else will be done.  That is all right up to a point but, if the hospitals are to be retained as the Minister says, what kind of staffing will be arranged?  Who will staff them? The previous Minister gave a reply in this House which I interpreted as meaning that there might be a resident doctor in the hospital but that the responsibility would revert back to the doctor who had sent the patient in. How he or she could be responsible for looking after the patient if he was retained in the hospital for a while beats me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They could be 60 miles away.  While most of the dispensary doctors, as we call them, are dedicated people, we know of the doctor who finds it extremely difficult to go 300 yards down the road to see a patient if he does not like him.  I can see him going 50 or 60 miles to the hospital to see his patient once or twice a day!</P>
      <P>Let us be practical about it.  If we are to pass a Bill through this House which will govern the health services of this country for at least 20 or 25 years&mdash;if I may take the Minister's predecessor's word for it&mdash;let us have something on the record which will stand up in years to come so that people will not be saying in this House later on: &ldquo;Were they not very ignorant when they passed this?  They did not realise this was so.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said at the start that all of us on all sides of the House are interested in improving the health services.  We know all about the extra cost, and we know how hard it is to raise the money. One thing which I detest is having something written down painted in glowing colours giving people the impression that they will get something <Col N="2024" /> which they will not get.  That is a big disappointment to people who really need treatment.  Passing section 37, even with the suggestion that the Minister will have another look at one subsection, will not solve very much of this problem.</P>
    <P>We must remember also that, apart from what Deputy Ryan has said about accommodation for the nursing staffs, there is another section of what I term nursing staff but whose title has changed from servants to non-nursing personnel.  If we looked at the accommodation some of these people have we would get a big shock.  Not so long ago, as a trade union official, I was asked to make representations to have certain accommodation provided for some of my members in an up-to-date hospital down the country, not in Meath.  I was amazed to find that there were 30 girls sleeping in 24 single beds. One of the beds was so bad&mdash;luckily they had been playing camogie&mdash;that they had to use some camogie sticks to keep the mattress off the floor&mdash;this in 1969.  There was one bathroom and toilet available to all those girls, plus the day-girls who came in.</P>
    <P>I was told what it would cost to make an improvement.  I was told how hard it would be to provide something extra.  I was told the money was not there.  It was not until I discovered there were a number of other bathrooms available in the hospital which was pretty close to them, which were not being over-used, shall I say, to put it mildly, and succeeded in getting the use of one of them for those girls, that it leaked through that the old idea of having two different races employed in hospitals was breaking out again.  I cannot speak too strongly on this.</P>
    <P>Those who work in hospitals are dedicated people whether they are doctors or nurses who have taken out degrees and trained for years or whether they are what is now known as non-nursing personnel, wardsmaids, and wardsmen.  These people work in hospitals where old people are in bed and they provide bedbaths for patients and, remember, they are non-nursing personnel. The sooner one standard is applied the better for everyone.</P>
    <P>There is one other section about <Col N="2025" /> which I have a question down for next week.  Perhaps, I could give the Minister advance notice of it now because it also comes under this section.  The question refers to what is to happen in regard to trainee nurses.  I do not want to go outside the section but I want to tell the Minister that in this city there are some trainee nurses who are very little better than slaves.  The accommodation offered to them is not what it should be&mdash;let me put it that way. I cannot refer in detail to hours of work, wages and food, but all these things will have to be provided for under section 37.  Certainly, the accommodation which is provided and the type of food they get and the way it is cooked will have to be included.  I hope the Minister will be answering my question next week and I would ask him to be pretty sure of the facts, particularly with regard to voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is deeply concerned to have this Health Act as near perfect as it possibly can be, but I would suggest when he found that certain things appeared to have been overlooked, that it would have been better to have withdrawn the whole thing and to have had another look at it with a fresh mind&mdash;I know the Minister has a fine mind for these things&mdash; and introduce a Bill about which all of us could be proud to say in years to come that we were responsible for putting on the Statute Book.  There are grave dangers that the Bill before the House is not like that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an enabling Bill.  To put it cynically a Minister can commit any number of follies or good deeds under section 37.  I agree with Deputy Tully that there are still grave defects in our hospital system. We have a great many improvements to make.  County homes are being replaced or improved one by one; changes have to be made in mental hospitals; and the question of nursing accommodation in certain areas has to be tackled.  We have made improvements but there is still a great deal to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the FitzGerald Report this Bill does not in any way proclaim <Col N="2026" /> a particular decision by the Minister or by this House on the implementation of some of the proposals in that report.  As Deputy Tully has said, it will take years and years before many of the decisions can be implemented because of the capital cost and because of the need to make further studies.</P>
    <P>I have not given a time by which all the decisions of the FitzGerald Report should be made.  I have been studying the report and I have been talking to people about it and within the next 12 months to two years I want to try to get an approximate time basis in relation to capital cost and to see what the cost would be if all the report was implemented, even though there is no obligation on me to implement it. Obviously, the report needs study and, no doubt, there will be amendments and changes to it.  It is not a sacrosanct report.  The report has been repeated in reports in Denmark and in Scotland. Only the other day we had published by the Department of Health and Social Security of the Welsh Office, Central Health Service Council, a book entitled, &ldquo;The Functions of the District General Hospital&rdquo;, which makes the same sort of observations.  The amendment I have suggested provides for an inquiry if an institution is actually to close.</P>
    <P>In connection with the formation of Comhairle na nOspidéal in making the recommendations which enable this body to decide on the appointment of consultants throughout the country, the regulations will have to include proposals or observations by the local county health committee before Comhairle na nOspidéal can make a decision to change the functions of consultants in a particular area. Indeed, so far as that is concerned the Minister has the ultimate power in all these matters.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I do hope the House will help me to proceed with this Bill.  I could come in here briefed for at least a two hours' speech on all the implications of section 37, in regard to the various changes of hospital administration. I could comment on certain inadequacies in the FitzGerald Report, not caused deliberately, but caused simply because it was a report <Col N="2027" /> prepared by people who did their best to examine the whole hospital situation in the country.  They could not possibly have known all the factors surrounding the hospitals in different places.  I could give a list of all the places where nurses' accommodation is being provided and I could discuss the quite evident lack of nursing accommodation in other places.  I could go through all the mentally handicapped institutions indicating the number of places that would be reserved in the next two years for mentally handicapped children, about whom I have a very intense and sympathetic feeling; and I could indicate the deficiencies in the child health services.  All these things arise on section 37 and the reason why I have not come briefed in that way is that we would never get the Bill through if we were to do that. However, I would be interested to hear Deputies' views on their interpretation of section 37 in order that I could reply to them on a great many local matters. We could have a long debate on the improvements and deficiencies in the hospital services, rather like the debate on the Health Estimate, but we have recently had two debates on Second Reading of the Health Bill and also on the resolutions put forward by the Fine Gael Party on health services and because of this I have not come briefed.</P>
    <P>As I have said, you can give the widest interpretation to this Bill.  I guarantee an inquiry before the closing of a hospital or an institution and I do hope the House will bear with me in regard to this.  I have already said on several occasions that we are going to put into a regulation to Comhairle na nOspidéal a statutory provision that the local health committee will be consulted before any action is taken by Comhairle na nOspidéal.</P>

      <P>This is a very wide section dealing with hospitals all over the country, but I am only concerned with the problems of the people who sent me here.  I appeal to the Minister not to close Roscommon County Hospital but to upgrade it instead.  The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, promised the people of Roscommon that this hospital would be upgraded before the general election.</P>
      <P>I think it is dangerous and unfair to expect emergency patients to have to travel anything up to 100 miles to a hospital.  The Minister has spoken about good ambulance services, but I do not think they are good enough to get a patient to hospital in time.  In the West of Ireland we have very bad telephone services and our roads are not the best.  I do not know what will happen with regard to the weather conditions but they are a very important consideration when operating these services.  I can see many deaths occurring. It will be far too late to do anything about it when lives are lost.</P>

      <P>The Bill does not require me to close the surgical facilities in Roscommon County Hospital. If the Minister is inactive, when the Bill is passed, nothing need happen. As the House well knows, this is an enabling Bill which gives the Minister powers to do certain things.  I cannot close Roscommon County Hospital as soon as the Bill has passed through the Dáil and Seanad and has been signed by the President.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important section.  It is a very wide section in that it interests everyone in all parts of the country.  I should like to direct the Minister's attention to the fact that a totally <Col N="2029" /> different set of circumstances exist in the built-up areas in the bigger centres, than in rural Ireland.  Therefore, it is necessary that each and every one of us in this Dáil should contribute in so far as we can our views in relation to the future hospitalisation of the country.  The Minister has just replied to Deputy Mrs. Burke that the passing of this Bill does not necessarily imply the closing of Roscommon Hospital. This is an enabling Bill and it is possible not only that Roscommon Hospital would be closed but many other hospitals as well.  The legislation will give power to the Minister to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That could be done under previous legislation, under the 1947 Act.  There is no change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree that Ministers could do it and I am not suggesting for a moment that the Minister is waiting for the Bill to be passed to close down hospitals wholesale. I am simply stating that the Bill will enable the Minister for Health to close hospitals.  That is why those of us who represent rural constituencies whether in the west of Ireland or anywhere else are gravely concerned about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has further met us by saying he will have a local inquiry prior to taking any drastic action in relation to a hospital in any particular county.  We are deeply appreciative of the offer the Minister has made to the House, but that does not mean we should close down on this debate and say: &ldquo;Let us pass the Bill and everything will be grand afterwards.&rdquo;  We must fully state the pros and cons in relation to hospitalisation.  The most important thing in this section is the overall hospital plan.  Many of us who have discussed this matter among ourselves, with our constituents, with people on local authorities and others who are particularly interested are not very happy with the overall hospitalisation plan.  Anyone with any medical understanding of the situation will naturally agree that you must have bigger centre hospitals to deal with definite specialities which are not within the compass of an ordinary general surgeon or general physician even though <Col N="2030" /> he may be of consultant standard.  But that does not mean <i>ipso facto</i> that you should do away with the functions of the existing consultant staffs that exist in certain areas.  It can be done but it is not in the interest of the public or the patients to do it.  Serious harm and injustice would be done to the public at large.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accusing the Minister of being unreasonable. I admit he is a reasonable and honest man and I know he has given a great deal of study to this. He said a few moments ago that he was prepared to be fully briefed, if necessary, to speak for two hours in answering us.  Surely it is up to us as the representatives of public opinion&mdash; we have just gone through the mill to prove that; it is not so long since we were elected here&mdash;to place before the Minister all the facts as we see them. When the Minister comes in here to reply to us fully briefed, by whom will he be briefed?  He will be briefed as far as the governmental side is concerned by the officials of the Custom House who are experts on matters of health administration and that kind of thing, but they are not necessarily fully conversant with the facts, and that is what we are here for, to make the facts known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may have made a wrong interpretation of this plan in relation to bigger regional centres whereby we are to have consultant staffs, experts, to deal with certain matters.  For instance, an operation for the removal of a brain tumour would be far beyond the competence of the general surgeon; the complete removal of a lung would also be beyond the competence of the general surgeon.  It is only natural that operations such as those would be conducted in highly specialised centres. Heretofore such cases went to Dublin and Cork, mainly to Dublin, and instead of these cases going to Dublin, there will be more up-to-date regional hospital centres to which they will be sent.  I am not against that.  I am sure any medical colleague of mine in this House will agree with me that it is <Col N="2031" /> necessary to have this absolute specialisation, but that does not mean that for the sake of economy&mdash;and very false economy it would be&mdash;that we must eliminate the existing operating centres in the different counties of Ireland.</P>
    <P>What Deputy Tully said just now is perfectly true, that a patient may have to go 60 miles to one of these regional centres.  One does not need any medical knowledge to know that if a person is bleeding it would be dangerous to send him 60 miles in an ambulance even though there is an emergency squad and there are up-to-date facilities in that ambulance. Travelling that distance, possibly over a pretty bumpy road, will increase the haemorrhage and increase the risk to the life of the patient.</P>
    <P>One of the most frequent reasons for operations is the acute surgical emergency. Apart from the fact that, in my opinion, it is not right to send these patients 60 or 100 miles, it will be very expensive to do so.  Secondly, it is entirely unreasonable to the relatives concerned.  When a patient is sent into hospital we all know the anxiety of the relatives.  They will get up at an early hour the following morning and phone to find out how the patient is getting on.  The Minister was once the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and must know it is very difficult to get on to a hospital, which leads to further anxiety on the part of the relatives.  Another problem is that of visiting patients. People like to visit their next-of-kin. Take the case that was just cited by Deputy Mrs. Burke in regard to the Roscommon Hospital.  Under the scheme the people of Roscommon will have to go to Galway.  How are people who live in County Roscommon to visit people in Galway?</P>
    <P>I think every one of us should make some reference to his own constituency. We have formed innumerable committees in Wexford in connection with health matters.  An organisation has been formed of which the Bishop of Ferns is the president; it is called the Save the Hospital Committee.  It was formed because we believe what we have heard, that the surgical facilities that were to be available in Wexford <Col N="2032" /> will not be available.  In Wexford we have been waiting for over 20 years for a new hospital to be built.  We had got to the stage where the patients were moved out of the general hospital into another place to enable the new hospital to be built.  We are now told the hospital will not be built, and the assumption is that we shall not have the surgical facilities we expected.</P>
    <P>I accept the desirability of having up-to-date specialist hospitals for certain conditions that ordinary general surgeons and general physicians, even of consultant standard, are not able to deal with.  If our hospital is closed&mdash; and the indications and suggestions in the FitzGerald Report are that it should be closed&mdash;our people will have to be sent to Waterford.  County Wexford is in the province of Leinster and our patients will be sent to Munster to be operated on but, apart from that, they will be sent a considerable distance. The people who live in the north of Wexford will be sent further than the distance from Dublin to be operated on.</P>

      <P>Come, come &mdash;unless Deputies are going to speak for two or three hours.  I shall not detain the House much longer.  Having stated the general position, I simply want to state the position of those who sent me here from Wexford.  The road from Wexford to Waterford is frequently liable to fog.  That is another hazard in sending a case such a great distance.  As the Minister grows impatient, I will conclude by making this suggestion to the Minister and to those who advise him: certainly, go ahead <Col N="2033" /> with specialisation; certainly have hospitals outside the city of Dublin provided you can get adequate staffs; certainly have specialisation outside the scope of the ordinary general consultant surgeons, physicians and gynaecologists but do not do away with facilities for acute surgical emergencies within county boundaries.  If the Minister does away with these facilities he or some future Minister will be back in this House with a Bill to create the situation which I believe is necessary for the carrying out of acute surgical emergencies within the confines of a county.  That is an opinion that is held by the greater number of rural Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot let this section pass without some comment because I accept that this is the section that will eventually implement the FitzGerald Report.  Naturally enough, each Deputy has his eye focussed on his own local situation.  We in Roscommon find ourselves in a difficult one which has three contents: first, a political content which, for quite a while, has been the most difficult one because it was one of the issues in the general election and in the referendum and we had to deal with that and, in fairness to the people, we dealt with it adequately and the results of the election show that.  It still continues to be a political problem within the county.  This is unfortunate because this adds a second aspect to the emotional side of it which becomes both political and emotional.  Emotion in discussions in local papers has become highly charged.  The people are very conscious of the fact that they may be losing surgical facilities in their hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to the third point which is the vitally important point&mdash; the medical services which will be available to the people of the country following the decision of the Minister on this question.  It is only fair to say that the county of Roscommon finds itself in a most unusual position because it has had a high standard of surgery there from the early 30s.  The present surgeon has been there for some 30 years and he was preceded by a man who happens to be a Member of this House, Deputy Hogan, who sits <Col N="2034" /> on the Fine Gael benches, and whose services were very highly regarded within the county.  So that the people feel that over this length of time they had acute surgical facilities comparable to those available in any part of the country and it was only in latter years, when the specialities and the specialists arrived, that there has been diversion of the surgical work out of the county hospital.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the FitzGerald Report came out at a rotten bad time for everybody concerned, not only for the politicians but for the unfortunate people who had to make decisions on it.  This was at the time of the referendum and the time of the general election and, in fact, we never got down to absolute basic thinking on the problem.  It is very difficult to do basic thinking on it because this is based on statistics which have come from medical groups not alone in Ireland but in Britain, America and other places throughout the world. Personally, I find medical statistics very difficult to understand and at times I find it very difficult to draw conclusions from them or to understand the conclusions drawn from them. However, there is one aspect of this that I should like to have cleared up.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde said that the Department will be advising the Minister and that they will advise him in a certain direction.  I am absolutely confident that whatever figures are available to the Department will be made available to anybody who wants them.  I would not entertain the thought for one moment that they would advise the Minister in some way that would be to the detriment of the health of the people not alone of my constituency but of any other constituency. I have no doubt that other people examining those figures would disagree with them, unless they are very compelling altogether.  I have complete confidence that if the Minister thinks he has to make a decision he will make it as he believes to be right. This is what troubles me&mdash;that in a very important matter like this it is very difficult to convince people because conclusions were reached by a <Col N="2035" /> committee who never visited our hospitals and it is alleged&mdash;I do not know how true this is&mdash;that they were unaware that there was a fully qualified anaesthetist in the hospital.  This, again, is coming back to this much paraded question of failure and lack of communications.</P>
    <P>In the last week it has been drawn to my attention that there was a seminar of some kind on regionalism&mdash;in Waterford I think it was&mdash;and one man&mdash;I do not know whom he represents&mdash;I suppose it is a British health authority or a Scottish health authority &mdash;spoke there.  Unfortunately, I have not the original document.  I have only the comment on it from one of the daily newspapers.  He remarked on the fact that in Scotland before they changed their health services they went around and consulted with everybody &mdash;the people, the doctors, the nurses and everybody else.  This must have some lesson for us.</P>
    <P>Going back again to the general election, our local newspaper challenged all the candidates as to their attitude to county hospitals.  I put mine in print.  It was to the effect that the committee said this policy would not be implemented until 1980; 1980 is a long time away yet.  I said that conditions would have changed so much in my constituency by then that all the circumstances would have to be re-examined before any decision could be made.  The Minister's predecessor gave assurances to a deputation from Roscommon County Council that no decision would be taken without consulting the county council.  The Minister restated that this morning; he said he would meet the future committee appointed.  He also stated that to me and to others on one occasion.  I accept that the Minister will do what he says.</P>
    <P>My concern is that people should be convinced.  The other aspect is the problem of acute surgery.  I call acute surgery acute haemorrhagic complaints, acute appendicitis, appendicitis with perforation, ordinary perforation and strangulated hernia. These are five that strike me offhand.  These are the cases in which the patients come back to the doctor afterwards and thank him for <Col N="2036" /> getting the patients into hospital in time and they are very pleased the surgeon got out of his bed and operated.  Of course, if the doctor is missing for two or three hours, it is just too bad for the doctor; it may also be bad for the patient.  There is this time element.  From a medical point of view there may not be any absolute urgency but, from the point of view of relatives and patients, the urgency is immediate. Now the Minister and his Department will have to get it across to the people that time is not important.  It is, of course, the duty of the Department to go into all these problems before they advise the Minister and it is their duty to be absolutely certain that their advice is sound.</P>
    <P>Most of the statistics in medical journals seem to be based on concentrated populations in London, Manchester, Birmingham and cities throughout the United States.  Such statistics have no application to Ireland.  The Canadian figures have some relevancy.  I should like to have the figures from northern Norway, northern Sweden and northern Finland. If these can show that the people will lose nothing, then this approach is correct.  I confess I am somewhat confused. There seems to be this political content all the time, plus a highly emotional content, and we do not seem to be able to get down to the most important content of all, the medical content.  I shall not repeat what has been said about relatives having to travel long distances and so on but so long as the matter is fully considered and the Minister comes back to the county committee again adequately advised I will have no argument against the proposal.  I have no doubt that whatever advice is offered will be considered genuine advice, but I am more than anxious that he should have absolutely full advice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say how much we appreciate the Minister's offer to amend the section on Report Stage in order to provide for a local inquiry in the event of a proposal to close a local hospital.  That will ensure that local views will be clearly understood before any decision is taken.  I say that with some reservation: my <Col N="2037" /> experience of local inquiries is such as not to give me much confidence in such inquiries.  Local inquiries seldom if ever bring about a reversal of intent. Not infrequently a local inquiry is little more than window-dressing designed to give the appearance of democratic processes.  It is, I suppose, a matter for the local people to appreciate that they must make their case, and make it well, before they can hope to convince the powers-that-be that some proposal is not to their advantage.  I am not concerned with local pride or local prestige.  That is a matter of no consolation to sick people or their relatives.</P>
      <P>It is important that this Dáil should emphasise the importance of the small, voluntary, local hospital.  Many of these were established as charitable foundations and they have something which general and regional hospitals do not have and will never have.  They are run by committees of civic-minded people who give their time, their energy, their money and their expertise, far beyond the call of duty, to the successful running of these institutions. Religious orders and lay people have dedicated their lives, quite indifferent to financial reward, to looking after the sick, the infirm and the aged. Ministerial directions and organisations and methods will never replace the kindness, the understanding and the sympathy which is natural to a small community-involved hospital but which is a stranger to the large modern monster.  This personal involvement, this intimacy, is many times more vital to the recovery of a patient than the best medical skills or modern drugs.  If we depart too far from this purely social aspect we may end up like the Scandinavian countries with the large wards manned by television cameras and other monitoring systems, scanning patients in their beds, patients who are seldom visited by nurses, by the kindly people to whom the sick always look forward for the touch of a human hand in time of pain and suffering.  We must be on our guard against this or we will create a monster which will generate new social and psychological problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should all join with the Minister <Col N="2038" /> in his aim to cut down the number of days spent in hospital.  There has been a substantial improvement, but we are all aware of the numbers of people who go into hospital for what are called &ldquo;tests&rdquo;.  This is the modern practice.  People are hospitalised for the purpose of making tests.  It is not uncommon for people to be required to enter hospital two or three days before the hospital is in a position to make the tests.</P>
    <P>Parkinson's Law operates with constant and never-failing rapidity where there is a hospital bed.  A hospital bed abhors a vacuum and a hospital bed without a patient is something that is very rare.  It is something which, apparently, is abhorrent to hospital administration because a bed without a patient is a loss of income while a bed with a patient in it means income.  It is because of that that we have this very high rate of hospital bed occupancy in Ireland.  We are the most hospitalised nation in the world and I say that because all the recorded figures from the known countries indicate that we have more people in hospital beds than any other nation. The less-developed nations have not half enough hospital beds while we have far more than any other country of comparable social and medical standards.</P>
    <P>That is something of which we ought to be proud but it is also something which should give us food for thought. We do not want a situation as they have in other countries where people are pushed out of hospital long before they should be.  That is something we must guard against but, at the same time, we ought to try to orientate our health services so that they are socially involved and so that all the great improvements that social medicine can bring to bear on health problems are made available.</P>
    <P>If that is done we will keep many people out of hospital beds who should never be there, many people who could be better cared for at home, many people who would not develop psychological and other problems if they are kept at home, and many people who by being at home <Col N="2039" /> can be involved in their own family and their family in them so that we would have a much healthier community.</P>
    <P>I ask that in using this section the Minister would give particular attention to the overhauling of out-patient departments of hospitals.  From what the Minister has said I know he is concerned to improve substantially the diagnostic services and the outdoor hospital services.  There is a crying need for a radical overhaul of our out-patient departments.  The experience which many mortals have to undergo in waiting three, four or, perhaps, five hours for attention in out-patient departments is appalling. Our efforts should be concentrated, if our resources are limited, on the improvements of the out-patient departments of hospitals so that we can get away from this business of requiring sick and injured and invalided people to wait for hours in hospitals.  The pain and boredom of being forced to wait and waiting without the appalling cup of appalling coffee that Deputy Tully referred to is bad enough but it also creates very serious family problems because children and other members of the family are upset and this in turn upsets the invalided or sick person.  It is something that we should try to avoid.  I ask the Minister to give his attention to this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentions that he will have a local inquiry before closing a hospital but I notice that section 37 does not require the Minister to consult the regional hospital board before he gives any direction.  However, I suppose it is unlikely that the Minister would proceed to issue directions for the closing of a hospital without having available to him the advice of the regional hospital board but this is not mentioned in section 37.  Perhaps, as the Minister will provide for the local inquiry he might also consider having provisions for consultations with the regional hospital board.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Gibbons and Deputy Esmonde, I have experience of GP practice in the country.  I welcome the new proposal <Col N="2040" /> to have highly specialised hospitals. It is a wonderful thing that we can have treatment of the highest type in Ireland but it is the distances about which I am worried.</P>
      <P>In my constituency of Clare-South Galway I have been called down through the years to frightening cases in the middle of the night such as those cited by Deputy Dr. Gibbons.  I remember on one occasion being called during the night to a man who was believed to have died.  He had a perforated ulcer and I got a message to the effect that the man had vomited a lot of blood.  When I arrived at his home I found that his pulse was imperceptible. He had been anointed but he was alive.  We would have had to wait too long for an ambulance to get him to hospital.  I suggested bringing him saying to his wife that he would probably die on the way.  His brother and the priest and I carried the man to the back of my car and rushed him to hospital.  The houseman there immediately put up a drip which I helped with myself and the surgeon operated.  Thank God, that man lived and is an active farmer today but that is just one of the many cases which I have experienced.  If we only had hospitalisation in, say, Cork, Galway or Dublin that man would have died There are often cases of women suffering bad haemorrhages during the night.</P>
      <P>I mention that case to emphasise that we must have services locally and even improved services to cater for those urgent emergency cases.  Afterwards, if it is necessary, they can be transferred to specialised hospitals for specialised treatment.  That is the opposite to what was suggested by Professor FitzGerald on a television programme when he said that we should send the patients to the specialised hospitals and after they had been treated take them back to our rest homes or hospitals down the country. It is the urgency that I am worried about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a fine hospital, Portiuncula, in East Galway.  This hospital serves a large portion of Galway, North Tipperary and over to Athlone.  A wonderful service is provided by this hospital <Col N="2041" /> and they have an excellent nursing school.  I would much regret any reduction of services at Portiuncula.  There is also a wonderful county hospital in Ennis.  There is an excellent county surgeon there about whom I could not speak highly enough.  I do not wish to say anything further on this section except that I would be very cautious in recommending the reduction of services in rural areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KiearanCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Esmonde that county hospitals should be kept.  The service being provided by county hospitals to local people is much too important to be discontinued. I agree that specialisation is a wonderful thing, but if we could have specialisation in rural areas rather than in Dublin alone it would not be necessary for so many patients to be sent to Dublin and other places for hospital treatment.  This would be possible if county hospitals were expanded and the surgeons, physicians and adequate facilities made available in these hospitals.</P>
      <P>Over the years, a large number of patients have been sent for treatment in Dublin whereas they could adequately be treated in the local hospital if we had the staff to do it.  We cannot expect one man to do the work of two men.  This is what we are expecting of our county hospitals at present. Our hospital in Kilkenny is being extended and lately a gynaecologist has been appointed.  If it were extended even further it would be of great advantage to people locally.  This aspect should urgently be attended to. The big problem is lack of knowledge of what is to take place.  The Minister said this morning that he has no plan. On the other hand, there are people who consider that the FitzGerald Report is the basis for future hospitalization in this country.  It would ease the minds of a lot of people if the Minister would make a statement on his intentions and also on the FitzGerald Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our local authority the fear is that our hospital, which is first-class, will be downgraded to become a rest home, a centre for geriatric treatment.  It would allay a lot of the fears of local <Col N="2042" /> people and of the local authority if the Minister would state that the surgical treatment at present provided there will continue.  Some people say that politics enter into the matter.  My belief is that it is too important for politics.  Certainly, the people in my area are at one in their view that our hospital in Kilkenny should not be downgraded and the services at present provided there taken from it.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny is the centre of the south-eastern region.  Yet, for some reason or other, the FitzGerald Report recommends that the regional hospital be situated in Waterford, a place which is on the coast.  Perhaps this is the only political angle which attaches to the whole problem in the south-eastern region.  Kilkenny was chosen as the site for an orthopaedic hospital because of its situation in the centre of the south-eastern region.  To follow that thinking to its logical conclusion, Kilkenny should also be the centre for the new regional hospital.  We have the most suitable hospital in the area for expansion: I do not think the Waterford hospital is suitable in this respect. If they want to site a regional hospital in Waterford they will have to erect a new building there for the job.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister intend to leave existing hospital services in country districts which the local people consider necessary in their areas or does he intend to downgrade these hospitals? If people had some knowledge that the Minister intended that existing hospital services should remain, it would allay their fears and I do not think he would have much difficulty, then, with the regional aspect of his proposals.</P>

      <P>The contributions to the debate by the medical Deputies have been very interesting.  I would wish, too, that the Minister could assure&mdash; as I feel he can&mdash;the people in rural areas that their position will in no way be worsened by the proposals in this Bill.  This is the age of specialisation. We need to have as many as possible under the one roof so as to avoid sending people from one hospital or building to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;downgraded&rdquo; is the most unfortunate word ever used in <Col N="2043" /> this context.  I believe that &ldquo;down-graded&rdquo;, as understood by the general public, is not what is intended here.  I should imagine that hospitals will continue to be used as they are now but that, as time goes on, a greater number of people will by-pass them and come to Dublin for specialist treatment. That is happening even at present. I would wish that the Minister could give the assurance that the position of the rural population and emergency cases will in no way be worsened and that the facilities at present provided in local hospitals will be available as long as we can foresee into the future.  The time may come when there will be no delay involved in taking patients to specialist hospitals. I should be glad if the Minister would assure the House that until such time, there will be no worsening of the position of patients who need immediate and specialist attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is considerable concern in County Meath about the implications of the FitzGerald Report as regards the future of Navan Hospital, an excellent hospital of its kind.  It is generally recognised that the surgery carried out in Navan Hospital is almost unequalled in other parts of the country.  The nursing facilities there are also of a very high standard.  The health authority have never in any way been cost-conscious in regard to the hospitals or in regard to the services in general.  Nothing but the best has been afforded to the people of Meath in Navan Hospital and it is understandable, therefore, that they should be concerned that the FitzGerald Report would involve the downgrading of their hospital to the status of a rest centre.  They are particularly concerned in view of the fact that Navan Hospital is very well situated.  The roads leading into Navan are very fast and well maintained.  Therefore, people can reach the hospital very quickly.  I am afraid that if the facilities which are at present available in Navan were moved to Cavan or Monaghan people from south Meath, and indeed from most of Meath, would find it much more difficult to get to the new centre than they do to get to Navan.  This is <Col N="2044" /> not only because of the distance but because of the accessibility of Navan Hospital.</P>
      <P>I want to echo the concern of other Deputies about certain types of cases which require speedier treatment than others and which would perhaps be endangered by their having to travel the extra distance to Cavan or Monaghan.  Strangulated hernia, perforated appendix, accident cases and haemorrhage cases, have been mentioned in this regard.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will be able to allay the fears of many people concerning cases such as these in relation to the FitzGerald Report.  I know of an accident case which occurred relatively near to Navan.  The person in question was able to go and get treatment in the orthopaedic unit in Navan.  I am reliably assured that if this patient had had to travel to Cavan or Monaghan she would not be alive today. I would also be interested to hear the Minister's remarks on the future of this orthopaedic unit which is situated in Navan.  This is a regional orthopaedic unit.  Will the FitzGerald Report proposals involve the closure of this orthopaedic unit and its move to Cavan or Monaghan?  I sincerely hope not.  This unit is of a very high standard indeed.</P>
      <P>There is another matter I should like to refer to.  The doctors and medical people in Navan Hospital have been able with great effect to make use of consultancy services from Dublin and to have close liaison with the highly specialised facilities in Dublin.  If facilities were moved to Cavan or Monaghan I envisage that it would be a great deal more difficult for the people in the hospitals further north to make use of help from Dublin which has been so efficacious in Navan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of visits by relatives to people in hospital.  I realise that when patients have passed a critical period they will be moved back from the proposed regional hospital to rest homes but even so there could be many Meath people who would find it difficult to visit relatives in Cavan or Monaghan.  These visits <Col N="2045" /> would have a useful medical effect because they would raise the morale of the patients and help their recovery. If the FitzGerald Report proposals are put into effect Meath patients would not receive as many visits from their relatives as they do at present.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that in the future there will be developed in Navan centralised and computerised diagnostic facilities with a large number of doctors who will be able to specialise in the various areas and ensure that proper diagnoses take place.  With the increasing complexity of medicine the general practitioner will not perhaps be able to cover the whole field and a specialised diagnostic service would be of great benefit.  I hope the Minister will consider having such a service installed in Navan.</P>

      <P>In this day and age, with the cost of health services both at local and Government level, we know that in a county like Carlow which has no county hospital, we cannot expect to have a general hospital of the type we would normally expect to have.  For that reason we are, as Deputy Crotty said, in the south eastern region.  We had a meeting with the Minister and his officials in Kilkenny.  I agree with Deputy Crotty that this is the centre of the region and I hope it will be the administrative centre of the region and that Kilkenny will have a hospital also. As far as Carlow is concerned when we reported back to the county council after this meeting with the Minister and his officials the members were unanimous, irrespective of which party they belonged to or which area they represented, that Carlow, which has been traditionally associated with Dublin for extern hospital purposes, should remain in that area.  This might mean cutting across county boundaries or it might mean a change in the south eastern region but the 21 members of Carlow County Council gave their views in a very constructive debate that they want to remain in the eastern region.  For years the people of Carlow have been taken to the district hospitals, diagnosed and then sent to Dublin.  It is hard to break with tradition.</P>

      <P>The Minister gave us an assurance that he would have an inquiry before any hospital is closed. We accept that in good faith.  I know the Minister is anxious to meet the wishes of the public representatives as far as possible.  A strong case was made by Deputy Esmonde and Deputy Dr. Gibbons for specialist surgical services which could mean a saving of lives.  I agree that that is true in certain cases but then we have specialist hospitals already.  We have cancer hospitals in Dublin in which they carry out specialist treatment.  We have a clinic for people suffering from polio and various other complaints.  We have the Cedars in Dún Laoghaire where people come from many parts of Ireland for specialised treatment.  If we are going to give our people specialised treatment, except in the cases mentioned by Deputy Dr. Gibbons, Deputy Esmonde and other Deputies, we should try to give them the best specialised treatment we can.  Deputy Clinton, Deputy Dockrell and I, with other Deputies, have been trying to co-ordinate seven or eight hospitals in north Dublin with seven or eight hospitals on the south side.  We are doing so because we want to give our people very specialised treatment and we do not want to have small hospitals duplicating expensive specialised equipment.</P>
      <P>The Minister has tried to meet us fairly.  I should like to see him being able to replace every county home in the country with modern hospitals.  I visited a county home in another constituency recently and it is not fit to be open at all.  We are trying to deal with a huge problem.  The Minister has already said that this is an enabling Bill to make a start on the reorganisation and improvement of our health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2047" /> The cost of the health services has gone up so much that we are always talking about it in this House.  We want to provide the best services we can for our people.  In Dublin we need to have a specialised general hospital to deal with specific prolonged diseases. This is a very involved matter.  I admit that all Deputies can make a special case for keeping hospitals in their constituencies open.</P>
    <P>We have been trying for the last eight or nine years to keep people out of hospital and to enable them instead to have treatment at home.  The only way we can do that is to give some allowance to enable them to remain at home.  If we give them £4 or £5 a week to remain at home it is cheaper than putting them into hospital where it will cost £15 to £20 a week to keep them there.  I accept the assurances the Minister has given us.</P>

I know it needs no words of mine to let the House know the good work which the medical profession and the nursing staff are doing in St. Michael's Hospital and the same can be said of Monkstown Hospital. Those hospitals are serving a large area.  It is very difficult, with transport the way it is, for a person in that area who is brought into a Dublin hospital to be visited by his or her family or friends.  I want to see the services which these hospitals are rendering at present retained for the people in that area.</P>
      <P>I should like to say the same for the medical staff and the nurses in Loughlinstown Hospital, which is serving a growing area.  I cannot refer to it as a rural area now because it is almost completely built up.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that the Loughlinstown Hospital will continue to give to the people in that area the services that have been given to them in the past.</P>

      <P>I can hardly be <Col N="2048" /> too critical of this Bill when I know that a hospital in Mayo is to be upgraded, not down-graded.  I am glad to see the improvements this Bill envisages. However, I admit that this section is written in typical Civil Service language.  It can be read so many different ways that some Deputies are doubtful about what the final interpretation will be.  I would suggest, especially to Dublin Deputies, that they should stop throwing mud. We are living in an era of reports.  We have the FitzGerald Report, the Devlin Report and I suppose it will not be too long until we get the Micky Mouse report.  I never read those reports. We are inclined to be influenced by them.  It is much better for public representatives to make up their own minds about matters and not be influenced by all those reports.</P>
      <P>I remember on one occasion CIE brought over a man from British Railways to tell them what to do with CIE to make it pay.  At that time CIE were losing about £500,000, and British Railways were losing about £50 million.  This was the genius brought over to tell us how to make CIE pay. I consider all those reports are tripe. I would be dishonest if I said otherwise. There are not many fools here in this House.  If they were fools they would not be elected by the people. Deputies should not be influenced by any of those reports.  Most of them are written by alleged geniuses.  Nowadays anyone who specialises can call himself an expert.

To some extent they are, but when country people want to get into one of the Dublin hospitals <Col N="2049" /> they very often have to wait six or nine months.  I do not agree with what has been said here, that we should have a hospital at every crossroads.  We would end up with a lot of tenth-rate institutions. If we are to put up more hospitals they should be capable of giving a first-class service.  On the other hand, the background to this debate seems to indicate that either everybody in the country is already ill or is going to become ill.  I do not think so.  There are, these Deputies may be surprised to hear, a lot of healthy people in the country.  It is an extraordinary attitude. We have seen commercialism and parochialism already in relation to the centralisation of schools.  We had the &ldquo;lollypop man&rdquo; and the haircream men objecting because schools were being taken away from them.</P>

The views that come from such people are much fairer and more valuable and will eventually benefit the people much more than a lot of the tripe and nonsense printed in those reports put out by people who do not know what they are talking about.  We are the public representatives and the Minister should accept what we recommend instead of accepting the views of these lay television geniuses and self-appointed experts.

On this section it was inevitable we would have a lot of discussion because local hospitals are involved. We are fortunate in having in this House Deputies who are doctors as well.  We have had very sensible contributions from Deputies Gibbons, Esmonde and Loughnane.  Their contributions are helpful because they can look at the thing from the two sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my point of view, the FitzGerald Report is an excellent document, although in Dublin we are not concerned very seriously with the problems posed; most of the difficulties will arise in the country areas.  It is fair to say, however, that on the team which produced the report there was nobody but medical consultants and surgeons&mdash; there were no general practitioners. That was a great mistake because the <Col N="2051" /> general practitioners are the men who know the hazards and the difficulties with which we are faced.  Nurses were not represented and neither was there an administrator on the body.  The report was compiled in seven months and it is correct to say that some of the evidence was not 100 per cent reliable because the personnel of that body, excellent people though they may be, had not the time to visit the various institutions about which they were making recommendations.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister in regard to this section because he has an extremely difficult job to do.  One objection I have to the section is that it gives the impression that the Minister will have to do and decide everything and that if the boards do not do what he directs he will go the following morning with a flamethrower and burn them out.  Of course, it is the manner in which the section will be implemented that will be important in deciding whether institutions stand or fall.  There will have to be a very much closer examination of all the aspects of the institutions before decisions can be made, and my honest belief is that the Department as at present constituted are not equipped to carry out such an examination.  Therefore, the Department will need all the assistance they can get from the members of the boards because they are the people who have the knowledge and the experience.  This is a job that must be done very carefully because anybody with any experience knows there was a considerable amount of rationalisation and regionalisation required in the hospital service throughout the country.</P>
    <P>People who have read the FitzGerald Report, which we are trying to implement by this section, will realise that it is as much concerned with the training of nurses and medical personnel as it is with the patients.  This aspect may have caused too much concern but we all know there is a great shortage of nurses and that it is developing.  One of the reasons why it is developing is that there are not enough of our hospitals large enough and with a sufficient variety of medical work to be done to train nurses.  In other words, there are <Col N="2052" /> not enough training places for nurses. Every public representative comes face to face with this problem every day. A lot of girls have been trying to get into training and at the same time we have this acute shortage of nurses.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the programme we should embark on must aim at building up the level of most hospitals to a good general hospital standard.  This is desirable and it is something that should not be resisted.  In the long run, the Minister personally will have to make the decision because it is always extremely difficult in a local matter of this kind, where there is so much sentiment attached to an institution, even when it is totally inadequate, to recommend a closure.  It is easy enough to recommend that it should be built up into a sizable institution, and that may be the right thing to do in quite a number of cases, but it must be done by somebody who is a little remote from the situation.  Let us be fair about it.  We have to live as public representatives and we have to live with our neighbours, and as long as you have local attachments and feelings about institutions no action will be taken.  In the final analysis the action must be taken by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I should like this section to be worded in such a way that the Minister will not be directing everybody to do everything.  If this is going to be the future pattern of things, and if we are going to have the Minister and the Civil Service telling area and hospital boards: &ldquo;You will do this or that as we tell you, how and when we tell you&rdquo;, then by taking the entire initiative we will kill any interest and we will not get anyone worthwhile to serve on these boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 42:</P>
      <P>In page 21, before section 39, to insert the following new section: 39. (1)  A health board may, on the request of a body which provides or proposes to provide institutional services or any other service similar or ancillary to a service which the health board may provide, and with the consent of the Minister, provide for the body any land which is shown by the body, to the satisfaction of the health board, to be required for the efficient performance of the functions of the body.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where a health board decides to provide land under this section for a body, it may acquire the land either by agreement with the consent of the Minister or compulsorily under Part VIII of the Health Act, 1947, and may lease such land to or for the benefit of the body.</P>
      <P>(3)  Where a health board is requested by a body to provide under this section any land for the body, the board may, as a condition precedent to its so providing the land, require the body to undertake to defray the whole or part of the cost of so providing the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to widen section 39 to permit that a health board can acquire land for bodies operating services outside hospitals. Deputy Ryan made a suggestion in regard to this on Second Stage and he was quite right.  The section was too restrictive.  This will permit health boards to acquire land for <Col N="2055" /> bodies operating services outside hospitals&mdash;bodies engaged on work for mentally-handicapped people, and so forth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 45:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 22, line 7, to delete &ldquo;advise the Minister on the regulation of&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;regulate&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The proposal to form Comhairle na nOspidéal was one of the recommendations of the FitzGerald Report, namely that there should be a central council co-ordinating and integrating the appointment of consultants and senior para-medical staffs for local authorities and voluntary hospitals.  The main object, which I think was accepted by all on Second Stage, was that consultants should pull together, that they should be enabled to operate in a more flexible fashion throughout the country and in future the organisation of consultant staff should be such that the full use of available hospital facilities should be achieved to the best possible degree.  One of the objectives was to expand outpatient diagnostic consultant services throughout the country so that whatever concentration of facilities was required for acute surgical and medical cases it should be possible for people to get better consultant services and to be able to see more than one consultant when required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House knows the whole bent <Col N="2056" /> of modern medicine is towards greater specialisation.  The consultant gives advice, the patient already having attended the family doctor whose services are absolutely vital in this connection. This is proceeding regularly and, moreover, the Todd Report which I think will be implemented in Great Britain and which will have its inevitable repercussions here, provides for medical teaching to be based on advising all medical students of the likely openings in the various specialities and in screening them so that in relation to, for example, the inadequacy of radiologists at present and, in this country, of pediatricians and even of psychiatrists, medical students who finish their first degree of university training will be given advice as to the kind of specialities they should follow.</P>
    <P>This, in turn, will encourage what might be described as a minor degree of specialisation in the case of certain doctors who will remain family doctors and go into group practice, and greater specialisation in regard to those who want to become senior consultants. The period of training will be very long and because of this it is felt essential to have this central body and, in the second stage, it is suggested that the body might advise the Minister and be advisory in character.  My predecessor and I have had this matter examined and in view of the fact that about 50 per cent of the people who go to hospital from local authorities under State payments go to voluntary hospitals, it was felt that for me to take responsibility for taking the advice and making the final decision in regard to all these appointments would be impossible and that, therefore, this board should be given the actual power of making decisions.</P>
    <P>The constitution of the board will come before this House in the form of resolutions that will be discussed in regard to the formation of the board, its constitution and its procedures.  It is clear that the medical profession will have to be consulted at every stage in regard to this matter.  Comhairle na nOspidéal will work in the first instance to regulate consultant posts throughout the country but it will not <Col N="2057" /> select personnel.  Selection will continue to be done by various methods which are known to most Members of the House.  There will be some slight changes inevitably because of the formation of the regional hospital boards. When Comhairle na nOspidéal has made a proposal for the appointment of a consultant to perform purely non-teaching duties, a consultant to work in a non-teaching local authority hospital such as the appointment of a new county surgeon, the appointment procedure will be based on the existing Local Appointments examination and so on.  If Comhairle na nOspidéal recommends the appointment of a consultant to work in a teaching local authority hospital there is already a procedure for the selection of such a person in section 62 of the 1953 Health Act; in other words, a selection board set up by the Local Appointments Commission consisting of two members selected by the teaching body, two members selected by the Local Appointments Commission and a chairman selected by the Minister. That system is operating, as far as I know very satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>If the appointment is to be made for work entirely in a voluntary hospital the existing procedures which vary from hospital to hospital, particularly where a teaching body is concerned, will continue.  There are other cases where, in order to have more intergration and co-ordination, Comhairle na nOspidéal might recommend that a consultant be appointed to a local authority hospital and also do work in some voluntary hospital in the district or wherever they consider this to be a good thing.  In that case, the Local Appointments Commission have a special procedure if this consultant's services are to be accepted on an agreed basis in the voluntary hospital as well as in a local authority hospital. Equally, one could envisage a situation, which already occurs now, where an appointment had to be made in a voluntary hospital but where clearly a considerable amount of the time would be spent by the consultant in a local authority hospital on a sessional basis. Again, Comhairle na nOspidéal would have to recommend a form of procedure <Col N="2058" /> that would be satisfactory to both parties.</P>
    <P>I think I have made that position clear.  We are now in an interim period. It is hoped at a later stage that Comhairle na nOspidéal will set up its own special selection procedure for these consultants which will be on a basis that will ensure the same kind of impartiality as is now possible with the Local Appointments Commission. That will come only after consultation with all the medical interests involved. When the resolutions come before the House for the procedures in relation to the setting up of Comhairle na nOspidéal and the regulations in regard to the appointment of their own staff&mdash; this also applies to the regional hospital boards&mdash;they will only deal with the body as one to regulate the number and character of the posts.  They will not deal with the selection procedure which will have to come up a year, 18 months or two years from now after consultation with the medical profession on the actual method of selection for posts as consultants.</P>
    <P>I have given the House a fair idea of the reason for the change in this. I might add that the reason is that the cost of hospital services is enormous. Out of the total cost of health services, the cost of hospital services has reached a figure of £40 million. When I read reports on hospital services in countries far wealthier than ours, I find there is an enormous financial problem and that even in the case of a country like Sweden where they have managed to solve many of their social welfare and health problems and have a very advanced hospital service, they regard the cost of hospital service in relation to their economy as enormous and they are frightened by the number of bills involved and the capital costs of such future construction as they deem necessary.</P>
    <P>The same is true here.  The economy is advancing and production is growing but, nevertheless, we must ensure that we can continue to improve the character of our hospital services so that we can provide more and more specialist treatment of a multiple kind with several consultants examining a patient in a very detailed way in the <Col N="2059" /> case of many maladies.  We want to continue doing that and we also want to make economies by having the system of consultant practice rationalised as far as possible so that every consultant can work most effectively.  This also relates to the fact that it will not be possible to get these specialists unless they have enough work to do.  No specialist would take up a post&mdash;this is increasingly the case and will become more and more the case in the future&mdash;unless he or she has enough work to do.  The population is scattered and there are concentrations of population. It has been possible to work out approximately the number of beds required in relation to certain maladies, based on British or Swedish experience. There may be variations here; there are some, but they are not very great. So, we can make use of these calculations to rationalise the use of consultant services to the greatest possible extent by making them mobile, by requiring that they move around the country.  I am very glad I have been able to get the agreement of the Medical Association and hospital interests in regard to the formation of Comhairle na nOspidéal.</P>
    <P>They are willing to accept Comhairle na nOspidéal as a regulator, and they are also willing, in view of the very great difficulties in doing anything else, that I should be able to appoint the first comhairle.  Consideration will be given later to who should appoint the second comhairle.  I can assure the House that my appointments will be based upon a very wide knowledge of hospital practice.  They will have to include a number of consultants of various kinds.  They will have to include consultants from the three regional hospital board areas, and they will also naturally include some officers of my Department.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the characteristics of the comhairle will have to come before the Dáil in the form of resolutions after this Bill has been passed.  As well as that, the regulations for the appointments of the regional hospital boards and their procedures will also come before the Dáil in the same way at a later stage.</P>

      <P>The amendment proposed by the Minister is important with regard to the making of appointments to the service.  I was very glad to hear that the Minister has given various undertakings in relation to the closing of the local authority institutions.  I have a lot of sympathy for him in his problem on this particular issue because, to use a cliché, we are at a watershed and in a very important changing period in the whole organisation of our health services.  It is very difficult for anyone to be quite certain as to what are the real needs of the community health services in the future.</P>
      <P>We have many reports at present. There is the FitzGerald Report, the Todd Report, the Gills Report and the Mellaby Report.  Most countries are attempting to alter&mdash;I was going to say upgrade, but I think the use of the word &ldquo;downgrade&rdquo; in the FitzGerald Report was most unfortunate&mdash;their services in a way which will meet the great changes which have taken place in medicine in the past 20 years.  No one can claim infallibility.  All we can do is read all these reports&mdash;I do not agree with Deputy Lenehan; I think we should read them&mdash;and, from our own experience, put our conclusions at the disposal of the Minister.  It is he who has to take the important decisions finally.</P>
      <P>This was the decision which was taken about 30 years ago.  I think it was a correct decision at that time: the grouping of the county hospital, the district hospital and the regional hospital, based on a single general practitioner, or a pair working in partnership. That is all going now.  There is a great reluctance on the part of everybody to see any change, because there is a great sense of security in knowing that there is a doctor and a hospital quite close to you.  The pattern is changing.  It is important for the layman to try to understand that the pattern is changing in his interests, and that it is not being changed just for the sake of change.  It is being changed to make the services better for the community generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very glad indeed to hear that the Minister has not closed his mind on the question of the FitzGerald Report, that he will use the best part of it, that he will try to extract the best part of <Col N="2061" /> it and use it, and that he will reject what he does not think is applicable. The basic proposal which I should like to put before the Minister on this section is the idea of trying to move away from the hospital orientation which I myself had 20 years ago when I was responsible for many of these hospitals, and which I think must change.  In the Twenties my predecessors, Dr. Ward, Seán MacEntee, Seán T. O'Kelly, and those on the Cumann na nGaedheal side too, had to accept the fact that there were at that time pretty poor communications, that hospitals in different areas were inaccessible, that there were poor ambulance services and that medicine was at a fairly primitive level.  One has to admit that surgery was at a fairly primitive level. That is all changed now, and the idea that the services should be based on a hospital will have to be changed.</P>
    <P>That does not mean at all that the small hospital is to be downgraded. That is an unfortunate word.  It simply changes its role in the new set-up.  It is for that reason that I was anxious that the Minister should, instead of restricting it to &ldquo;advise the Minister&rdquo; on making appointments and so on in hospitals, also include &ldquo;and other medical appointments&rdquo; of those engaged in the service.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly there is to be a complete fragmentation of medical care as we know it now.  Many Deputies were genuinely concerned because they felt that if a hospital is 60 or 100 miles away the people they represent will suffer in consequence.  Our county hospitals have done wonderful work under great difficulties.  Most of the county surgeons, county physicians and anaesthetists worked under most undesirable conditions.  They worked long hours, not only long hours on active work but long hours with the responsibility of knowing that they had to be available.</P>
    <P>Hospital procedures now have become very much more complex than they ever were before.  One now finds that most serious surgical procedures are the work of a pretty complicated and pretty large team encompassing everything from the diagnostic side right through to things like blood transfusions, blood typing, and transplantations. <Col N="2062" /> All of these procedures are enormously complicated and they simply cannot be provided in the smaller type of hospital.</P>
    <P>The first great change has been in the quality of medicine and surgery. Enormous strides and advances have been made.  Secondly there is the physical change in our community in so far as we have very good communications, generally speaking, throughout the country.  One can get from one place to another pretty quickly and, when one does get to the point to which one is trying to get for the sake of the individual in the ambulance one gets such a level of service that it is well worth the difference which would be involved in the distance if the person were being brought to a small hospital.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, the Minister will probably be concerned to greatly improve the quality of the ambulance service.  This would have to proceed <i>pari passu</i> with an alteration in the role of the county hospital.  They are reasonably efficient; they are not as bad as people say they are, but they can be greatly improved, and the ambulance equipment could also be improved. However, the main concern is that the Minister would not restrict this Comhairle na nOspidéal to the role of concerning themselves with the hospital.  I want to try to persuade the Minister to re-orientate himself into the concept of the community approach to the health services, that these small hospitals will become very active, vital, health centres that you will no longer have the general practitioner on the corner, no longer get the small partnership, that there will be seven, eight or ten doctors working in groups in a health centre.  I never understood how the general practitioner was able to take on the great responsibility which he frequently must face unsupported by the tremendously valuable hinterland of the scientific and technological information which is available to most doctors working in hospitals.  There will be this health clinic providing complex scientific and technical diagnostic services, as Deputy Bruton suggested, computerised diagnostic services which will make available very rapidly to the practitioners in the <Col N="2063" /> group the information which will help them to come to a reliable conclusion as to what the patient is suffering from.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan made the very good point that many of our hospital beds are filled with people who should not be there at all because they are simply waiting around to have some diagnostic procedure carried out.  Although it may not be deliberate, there is a misuse of beds.  We should develop this community concept in the approach to our health services so that the general practitioner is supplied with top quality technicians, radiologists, radiographers, laboratory assistants, all the resources of a blood transfusion service and so on.  If we had all these facilities available, then we could lower very much the great pressure on many of our hospital beds.</P>

      <P>I was not sure whether the Minister was dealing with the section or the amendment.  I welcome the idea in the amendment.  I had intended to put down an amendment myself if the Minister had not done so.  It is an advance on &ldquo;to advise the Minister&rdquo;. Reading through this Bill, it seems to me to be a sort of bureaucrats' charter in so far as there is very little left to the public representatives, that whatever powers they did have are even further reduced, and that the only people that seem to matter in the new Health Bill are the CEO and the Minister for Health.  While I know quite well the record of the local authorities and their activities over the years which led to many of them having to have powers taken away from them, I myself am an absolutely immutable believer in the concept of democracy.  The less power we give to local representatives, the lower the quality of the people who will come into the local authorities. People will not come in simply to spend hours debating an issue and then find the CEO or the Minister changing the whole decision simply because he <Col N="2064" /> does not agree with it.  The change in the local authority status was probably inevitable because of the behaviour of many of them, but we are changing very rapidly as a community generally.  Anybody who watches the change in the quality of this Dáil and the change in local authorities generally&mdash;I hate to sound supercilious about it&mdash;knows that there is a much better educated person coming into public life and into the local authority.</P>

Therefore, the Minister's amendment to the effect that the council would determine appointments is an advance on the previous proposal. The idea that this council should be simply an advisory one is a bad idea, and wherever it occurs I would disagree with it.  Over the years there have been various advisory bodies, national health councils and so on, in which advice was frequently given and nearly equally frequently ignored by the Minister.  I think this is an improvement as long as the Minister intends the phrase &ldquo;to regulate&rdquo; to mean to determine, that is to have a final decision on the number and type of appointments which I think is implicit in the word.</P>

      <P>The House will also appreciate we are attempting what might be described as an elaborate pattern of hospital administration by decentralisation and by communication. We have the health boards and the regional hospital boards and we have an comhairle.  Obviously an comhairle must consult the regional hospital board and, in turn, the regional hospital board will have representatives of the health board.</P>
      <P>This will have to be a careful operation, otherwise the council could be intensely resented.  The operation of the council will depend on the understanding it has with the regional hospital boards, the health boards, and in particular the understanding it has with the voluntary hospitals.  The voluntary hospitals have given wonderful service in this country but their representatives now recognise that there must be growing co-ordination and integration under the circumstances of medicine at the present time, which have been very well described by Deputy Dr. Browne.  Everything he has said relates to the most modern view of medical practice.  It would be wrong for me to speak of the powers of the council without referring to their co-ordination with the regional hospital boards and the health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I retain the power first of all because there must be an overall budget.  The regional hospital boards' duties will be to plan and perpare the organisation of the operation <Col N="2066" /> of services both in the voluntary hospitals and in the local authority hospitals in their region.  For the first time it is proposed that they themselves, on the recommendation of the council, could pay for the services of a consultant working in a regional hospital area who would move around the area and who might work either in a local authority hospital or in a voluntary hospital.  The regional hospital board would be the first employer of the consultant and they would have to be recouped from the health board and the voluntary hospitals for a proportion of the expenditure.  The regional hospital boards will have a very important function and it is essential that the council keeps in touch with them.</P>
      <P>In regard to budgeting, before the beginning of each financial year the health boards in the regional hospital board area will present their budgets in so far as the hospitals are concerned to the regional hospital board. The regional hospital board will also receive from the voluntary hospitals in their area the voluntary hospitals' budgets.  The regional hospital boards will examine these budgets and make their recommendations which will, in turn, come to the Minister for Health. The Minister for Health will consider the matter in relation to the total budget and then send back the budgets to the boards.  The object of this exercise, which is novel, is to try first of all to secure a basis on which the central council look at the situation over the whole country.  They can consider the operation of these services regionally and then the operation of services in the regional boards.  This is an exercise in decentralisation and co-ordination. I hope I have made the position clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that the members of Comhairle na nOspidéal would be drawn from regional medical people.  Does this mean there will be no representative from the future county hospitals, from the medical association or from general practitioners?  The Minister has said that the local Appointments Commission will be responsible for the appointment of what we now call the county physician and the county <Col N="2067" /> surgeon whereas there will be a different system of appointing people who are expected to teach.  I would recommend the Minister to ensure that all those appointed should be able to teach and, having succeeded in this, he should make it part of their duties to have them teach on one or two occasions in each year.</P>
      <P>I envisage the situation where the hospitals in places like Sligo, Castlebar and Roscommon&mdash;if it is lucky enough &mdash;would hold post-graduate courses once or twice a year.  If the Minister accepted that this was administratively feasible, naturally the onus of producing the programme would fall on the county surgeon, the county physician or the county obstetrician.  As I see medicine evolving, and Deputy Dr. Browne has indicated at length the changes which are taking place, teaching at local level will become more and more important because the amount of literature being published is something that no one person could read and absorb.  I do not think this system of teaching at local level obtains in any other country in the world. Knowing the Minister as I do, I feel that, if I can convince him that this would be of tremendous advantage to the general practitioners, private practitioners and even county surgeons, he will consider it seriously and try to draw up something along these lines. There is no doubt whatsoever that this is one of the easiest ways of exchanging knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with the Deputy.  One of the proposals in the FitzGerald Report, which no one would disagree with, is that general practitioners should play a greater part so far as rights of entry into hospitals are concerned.  The report suggests that they should play a greater part possibly in district hospitals and general hospitals.  This has progressed in certain hospitals but obviously it needs much more attention.  The FitzGerald Report points out that existing general practitioners who work very hard in isolated districts have not the opportunity in many cases of doing ward-rounds with consultants in <Col N="2068" /> county hospitals in order to see new treatments and new techniques.</P>
      <P>I have already stated that I regard the development of the choice of doctor administration as essential in this country.  We have got to have built into that, at some stage or another, an arrangement for regular refresher courses.  Having read the Edinburgh and Manchester reports on the method of apprenticeship for general practitioners, I feel that apprenticeship methods of general practitioners need reconsideration. Indeed, the Irish branch of the Royal College of Physicians has made some excellent proposals about improving training in that regard.</P>
      <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal and the regional hospital boards will naturally take account of that in their decisions. I will be responsible for negotiating the fee for service arrangement, which is inevitable, with the choice of doctor system.  I am not saying that I could begin to do this right away but I shall have to consider how far the opportunity for refresher courses could be evolved.  Some doctors are very much overworked and it might be difficult to replace them for a long period.  Nevertheless, I regard it as one of the objectives of my term of office that I should undertake the improvement of the two matters referred to by Deputy Dr. Gibbons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise for clarification of the Minister's amendment. It seems to me that the Minister is divesting himself of authority.  In other words, he is decentralising.  No one would disagree with that.  This amendment deals largely with the voluntary hospitals and Comhairle na nOspidéal, which will have control over the local authority hospitals.  The governing bodies of the voluntary hospitals will still exist.  With regard to the employment of consultants, where you have such a system of dual control, there is always the possibility of disagreement between the interests involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is divesting himself of authority.  If there are two separate bodies dealing with a problem it is usual to have a titular head as a means of final mediation between them. <Col N="2069" /> According to the Minister's amendment, he goes out of the picture altogether except that if they do not agree among themselves, supposing the governing body of the voluntary hospitals are forcing a point that the Minister considers not to be to his satisfaction or to the best interests of the medical services, he can withhold grants which I think come from the Hospitals' Trust, and, likewise, if Comhairle na nOspidéal do not agree to do what the Minister considers they should do he can withhold money from them.  Am I right in thinking that that is his sole function in regard to any differences that may arise between the two boards?  If it is, then we may be facing considerable difficulties in the future.  I am the last person to look for severe ministerial control but the control in this section is rather nebulous. The Minister should keep to himself some limited control without interfering in the minutest degree with the two boards that he is setting up.  He should not leave it the way it is.  In the case of a dispute there would be doubt about to whom they should go for settlement.  It would seem that the Minister would simply say, &ldquo;A plague on both your houses.  I will stop your grant.&rdquo;  I may have misinterpreted the intention behind the amendment.  If I have not, the Minister should elucidate the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something in what Deputy Esmonde says.  This amendment is rather woolly.  Its implications are not clear.  Is the Minister not, in fact, retaining a right to vote on the number and type of appointments? If he is, how is he going to do it?  Is he not laying in store for himself an enormous amount of responsibility? Presumably, each regional board will have to submit their proposals to him for sanction and he will have to concern himself with everybody from the hall porter to the consultant pediatrician and so on.  Would it not be wiser for him to accept that this is a very responsible board that he is establishing and that they would work within a particular budget and that they should then have the responsibility of making decisions in relation to appointments and be restricted by the particular <Col N="2070" /> budget?  The budget would be a global one and they would work within that global budget and would then have to cut their cloth according to their measure.  It seems to me that the Minister will find himself saying to one of these regional boards &ldquo;You want another pediatrician.  I do not think you should have one.&rdquo; Is this going to be the position or is the Minister simply going to give them a global sum and tell them to get on with it or will he inspect each single appointment within the ambit of responsibility of each board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Browne, it is proposed to give a global sum in this connection and Comhairle na nOspidéal will obviously have to operate their regulatory device bearing in mind the budget situation.  I am quite aware that the working of Comhairle na nOspidéal will be extremely difficult.  This will be a test of character not only of the members of the comhairle but of all the voluntary hospitals and the local authority hospitals that are concerned in their recommendations. I have seen in my career, and Deputies have seen, boards of a similar kind who managed to operate successfully, managed to do a tremendous amount of good in this country and who had to exercise the same sort of tact and understanding in the discharge of their duties.  I am quite certain that there will be difficulties and I am quite certain that I am going to have rows when this body gets into operation and until it finds its feet and until people all over the country begin to accept the fact that the health services are one, in one sense; that they are regionalised in another sense and further regionalised in another sense and that then you come down finally to the GP and public nurse working in a rural area.  It is this total concept that has to be considered. That is the position.  They have to work within the budget.  I hope the budget will be expanded as the years go by.  I hope it will be expanded partly because I really do believe that if we spent more money on consultants and on good laboratory facilities in hospitals we would reduce the cost of keeping people in hospital and of keeping them too long waiting for beds <Col N="2071" /> in hospitals, as mentioned by Deputy Tully.  Nevertheless, it is going to be a very expensive business.  I do not think I can go into it in any further detail than that.</P>
      <P>As I have said, the method of appointing the comhairle will come before the Dáil in the form of a separate resolution and also the method it will employ in appointing its own private staff.  So that the House will be able to discuss this body again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear from the amendment that the comhairle has the ultimate responsibility and the ultimate decision.  When it makes a decision about the appointment of a consultant, the health authority or the voluntary hospital will have to accept that decision.  That is the kind of executive decision which I am going to entrust to this body.  I am going to find about 24 or 25 people to do this work and I do have enough faith in the medical fraternity of this country to believe that I can find people who, along with some officers of my Department, will be capable of doing this work effectively and capable of exercising tact and of understanding particular and difficult situations.  I would have to give them the authority.  It would be quite impossible for a Minister to exercise this final regulatory authority.  When you consider the different interests of the voluntary hospitals and the local authority hospitals all around this country it would be absolutely impossible for me to do it. There would be emotional pressures of every kind, personal pressures of every kind, exercised upon the Minister for Health of the day.  So, the Minister must delegate this authority and I, naturally, will have to keep in touch with the comhairle through the officers of whom I imagine there will be at least four from my Department.  The officers who are most skilled in the development of hospital services will be chosen for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2072" /> I can look back on my experience with eight State companies.  Although there has been criticism of these companies, as well as a great deal of praise, on both sides of the House, I found that the most important thing of all was one's personal connection with the board through meeting the members on occasion and discussing matters with them in a general way.  That personal connection is very important.  That was stressed by Deputy Ryan and others in the case of those who are sick.  The personal connection between the Minister and this new board will be very important to ensure that the Minister will have a proper understanding with them and they with him in this entirely new procedure designed to bring local authority and voluntary hospitals into closer contact in operating together and co-operating together.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already indicated my reasons for tabling this amendment.  My purpose is to enable the board to adapt itself to realities.  There will be a complete breakaway from the strictly hospital orientated type of service.  The general practitioner will be, as the Minister said a moment ago, a completely different kind of person; we will have a consultant general practitioner just as we have the consultant surgeon at the moment.  General practice is very, very complicated and no individual could possibly have all the knowledge required.  One could not <Col N="2073" /> have the knowledge available to doctors in respect of the different medical traditions, and, because of that, there is not likely to be much more specialisation amongst general practitioners. There will then be the status of the consultant general practitioner.  He will have the right of access to the hospitals. I was very keen on that myself but I did not have the courage to try to bring it about.  It is overdue now because of the changing status of the general practitioner.  There is bound to be an expansion of the specialist type services, like the prison service, and the paediatric and geriatric services, so that there will be a great many changes leading to the development of specialisation in health clinics outside the hospital and it would be wrong, therefore, to isolate the powers of Comhairle na nOspidéal to functions within the hospital.  I do not want to labour the point.  I believe the Minister agrees with this.  It would be better to give that body the right to make the appointments for the total service rather than for one particular sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>While I sympathise with Deputy Dr. Browne's concept of what might be extended powers of Comhairle na nOspidéal, it would be quite impossible to accede to this request. The district medical officers and the general practitioners who will take part in this scheme will be under the control of the regional health boards and they will be able to cross the boundaries of existing county health authority areas.  The arrangements for the choice of doctor appointment will be done by regulation under section 56, which will come up for discussion later.  There is nothing to prevent Comhairle na nOspidéal giving advice and co-ordinating consultant appointments. This is simply a question of management.  One draws lines so that management will be both effective and practicable.  It would be quite impossible for Comhairle na nOspidéal to deal with such a large number of appointments, some 1,200 in all.  I would not consider it wise to control the number and type of appointments to the medical officer service of health boards.  Possibly the Deputy was <Col N="2074" /> thinking more of co-ordination between consultants and medical officers.  The actual appointments should, I think, be done at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with the Minister here.  On reflection, Deputy Dr. Browne may find that he will defeat his object rather than achieve it were he to take away from health boards and confer on Comhairle na nOspidéal the power to regulate appointments extra-murally.  Comhairle na nOspidéal is concerned with institutional personnel and if social and general medical services are to be available they must be based on local knowledge and local concern.  This amendment would only delay appointments and, goodness knows, appointments are slow enough at the moment. The situation would be intolerable if they had to be put through the conduit pipe of the medical hierarchy.  There is already ample scope for consultation at the proper level in connection with the appointment of medical and other staffs outside of the hospitals.  It would be a pity to draw that, from its large field of local responsibility, into a board which would probably sit in Dublin and which would be far removed from local pressure&mdash;and I use the word &ldquo;pressure&rdquo; in a flattering and not in an offensive sense&mdash;because if there is local pressure it means there are local demands for services.  That is where services required locally are determined and not through a national body of the nature of Comhairle na nOspidéal.  I think the section would be best left as it stands.</P>

      <P>I am more concerned with getting an idea of the Minister's attitude and I do not wish him to feel bound, as it appears to me the FitzGerald Report was bound, by this obsession with the hospital as being the centre of the health service.  It is not, but it is a component and an important component, but all the others are equally important components.  If it is broken up in such a way that there is to be priority&mdash;this was implicit in the use of the word &ldquo;downgrading&rdquo;&mdash;then I should dislike the Minister to continue to accept that attitude in <Col N="2075" /> regard to centralisation.  Does the Minister propose breaking up the LAC, the central authority in Dublin which already makes these appointments?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 56 would account for the question of a choice of doctor and naturally the Local Appointments Commission will continue to operate in the appointment of dispensary medical officers for permanent posts, such as those that are required, but when it comes to the selection of those general practitioners who wish to partake on a fee-for-service basis one could not make use of the same procedure.  There will, therefore, be some sort of special selection procedure devised, regulations for which will be placed before the House. It would not be possible to make use of the local appointments procedure in regard to the choice of general practitioner who had served in an area for a long time or at least for two years, and who would be willing to accept the fee-for-service principle and to help those with medical cards.</P>

      <P>I will not try to discuss that concept but it seems to me that some of what Deputy Dr. Browne has in mind might be achieved if, in the selection of personnel for Comhairle na nOspidéal, some appointments were to be given to general practitioners, to medical social workers, to people who are actually involved in this type of activity which needs to be considered. It would be undesirable that Comhairle na nOspidéal should be composed only of hospital consultants and officers from the Minister's Department because that might well be at variance with developments in the wider field of medicine, whereas if the right views are represented on the board there is a reasonable prospect that the disciplines which Deputy Dr. Browne has in mind would be in the minds of those on Comhairle na nOspidéal, providing they would make new regulations.</P>

These matters must come before the Dáil.  The first stage is only concerned with the actual structure of Comhairle na nOspidéal and its procedures for regulating as distinct from selecting.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give us his ideas on the reason for this preponderance of the consultant in this type of body.  <i>Prima facie</i>, I suppose one could say that the doctor is the ideal person to dominate an organisation <Col N="2078" /> of this kind but it is not as simple as that.  Naturally, as a doctor and also as a specialist, I have no grudge at all against doctors or specialists.  However, I know enough about our profession to be aware that we are really craftsmen in a very narrow sense.  We know our own subject.  A specialist is said to be somebody who knows more and more about less and less.  To that extent, we may know our jobs extremely well and practise competently. That does not necessarily mean that we are good administrators.  It does not follow that a person who is, say, an ENT man knows much about paediatrics or geriatrics; that a geriatrics man knows very much about psychology; that a surgeon knows very much about general medicine, and so on.  I cannot see the special qualifications a consultant has which would merit so many of them being on this body.</P>
    <P>I can quite see that there should be a specialist or doctor on a body of this kind.  If a doctor is a good administrator put him on it but not just because he is a consultant.  I set up many boards &mdash;the blood bank, the cancer body, BCG, boards for the building of hospitals and so on.  I usually included a doctor but I did not feel I had to have half the board composed of doctors. The record of my profession over the years is not glorious when it comes to the question of progressive or radical health legislation.  It seems rather absurd to accord to them this very great power in a body to which they are so closely linked and with which their financial interests are so closely linked.</P>
    <P>I know that the average doctor simply works in a team composed of everybody&mdash;ambulance drivers, theatre nurses, nurses generally and adminstrators&mdash;and that each one of these people knows his job well; he is an essential component in the total structure which is the hospital.  In my view, one person is as important as another in the team: one cannot go on without the other.  If there is to be representation on Comhairle na nOspidéal, it should be representation which is representative of the whole hospital.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been a very short time in the Department of Health.  He <Col N="2079" /> may not have such a sanguine attitude to the medical profession after a year or two, by the time he is finished with his negotiations, particularly in relation to remuneration, and so on. Over the years, with different Ministers with different outlooks, the position has not been good.  The general attitude of the doctor, the specialist and the consultant in particular, has not been a progressive one in relation to the health services.</P>
    <P>I should not be taken as damning the whole medical profession.  There are marvellous people working in medicine in consultant capacity as well as in general practice.  The medical practitioner likely to end up on Comhairle na nOspidéal is likely to be a person who is not particularly disposed to consider even the mildly radical proposal&mdash;and, God knows, they do not go very far in this Bill. The Minister is cutting a stick for himself and he may very greatly regret it if he does not dilute very much more the doctor content and particularly the consultant content of this board.</P>
    <P>This sort of thing smacks in many ways of a sort of vocational organisation. If the Minister wants to take professional advice, let him do so but not in this sort of overdose since it could quite easily lead to great trouble for himself.  I am not so worried about the Minister being troubled.  I am worried that we may not get as good a service as we would if we were to take people from the total hospital service who know it from every aspect &mdash;the nurses, the general workers within the service, the people in industry, the general practitioner from outside as well as the consultant.  The Minister would be well-advised to examine the position of this body and to reduce considerably certain proposals he has for it at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with Deputy Browne.  The Minister should listen very carefully to his remarks. They are all the more convincing when they come from a medical man and a specialist in his own line.  I have seen a good deal of what he talks about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2080" /> I think that medical people are too close to the subject when they are appointing medical people; that they are too close to the pressures from medical people and that their decision therefore is often not the best decision. If an attempt is being made to make an impartial appointment, an outside assessor should be brought in.  There is more merit in that than in bringing in people to make radical decisions for medical people.  A preponderance of medical people is proposed for this board.  That is unwise and it is unwise for precisely the reasons given by Deputy Browne.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot in what Deputy Browne says.  At the same time, I believe it is possible to choose the kinds of consultants who are advanced in their views and who think radically: I know they exist and so does the Deputy.  If you choose consultants in varying disciplines, some of them will come from different parts of the country.  You then get what happens in other connections: you will have what makes for an inevitable clash of interests in the sense that a conservative proposal by one would be totally against the interests of some other member of the board who will want to act radically.  In that way you would get a balance between excessive radicalism and conservatism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to appointments, I want to make sure, for example, that the officers of my Department are people deeply skilled in hospital and health administration: I think there are such persons.  I have the very highest opinion of the officers of my Department.  I have heard this view expressed by Deputies on all sides of the House.  I believe three, four or five very good such officers can be appointed.  They are practical men with a long record of experience.  They have been helpful in devising new health services and they have shown a willingness to go ahead.  There is an opportunity, obviously, for some other people with administrative experience, as suggested by Deputy Clinton.  One might choose, for example, a number of chief executive officers who, if they have the same qualifications as Deputy Clinton no doubt attributed rightly to Mr. <Col N="2081" /> O'Keeffe, would have an understanding of medicine and of people.  If one combines a group of people like that one should get satisfaction.</P>
    <P>I have met enough consultants to know, as Deputy Dr. Browne knows, that there are consultants who know about administration.  Some of the consultants who prepared the FitzGerald Report&mdash;like any other report it is not perfect but at least it shows great signs of progressive thought&mdash;were men of very considerable administrative ability. Therefore, one can find consultants with administrative ability.  I do not think any 12 consultants or any 12 people appointed for any purpose related to a national operation could combine together to prevent something forward-looking being done if sufficient of their number were people with forward-looking views.  If the consultants combine with some people well skilled in administration procedures such as chief executive officers and such as the fine officers of my Department I believe it will be workable.  If it does not work we will have to alter the character of Comhairle na nOspidéal in an amending Bill but I have confidence that I can get the right kind of people for this purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is digging a very big hole for himself and he will regret it but that is his business.  However, this will not be in the interest of the improvement of our health services. I feel that the confidence he is placing in consultants is misplaced not on ideological grounds but on strictly technical grounds.  The whole training, background and education of a doctor is very narrow and specific from the very beginning and it becomes more and more specific as he becomes a consultant. Therefore, the amount of useful knowledge which he will have which would help Comhairle na nOspidéal, which will have a very diverse function with very disparate outlets in relation to their responsibilities, will be very small.  What in heaven's name would an ear, nose and throat man know about any other speciality?  What use would he be if they were trying to decide on the setting up of an orthopaedic service?  He would be little more use than an ambulance driver, a <Col N="2082" /> road worker or a builder's labourer.  I feel there is a snob content in a Minister's approach to this.  He was in two other Ministries&mdash;Lands and Transport and Power.  He never brought into the House a proposal, for instance, that the number of CIE engine drivers or bus drivers on the board of CIE should be not less than half, or forestry workers when he was in Lands.  He really is attaching to the consultant an authority, a power and a disinterestedness which he has not got, on average. There are some who have.  For that reason this is a backward step both from the practical and the ideological point of view.</P>
      <P>Why is this sector of society&mdash;the medical profession&mdash;chosen from all other sectors of society to be given control of a body in which they have a very direct and very important financial interest?  It is wrong for the Minister to do this. He is suggesting that if one gets an ear, nose and throat man, a geriatrician, a paediatrician, a psychiatrist and a surgeon around a table they will start agreeing with each other.  He knows this is not true.  When we were trying to get a decision in relation to building a big regional hospital the person who eventually made the decision was the reverend mother because they could not get any agreement among themselves. There will be a continuous conflict not only among the consultants but between the consultants and the other members of the board and it will be a continuous squabble.</P>
      <P>I believe the basis of the Minister's choice is wrong.  I believe the decision to take it in a practical sense will also prove itself to be wrong.  I am not concerned to knock the consultants.  That is not my function nor my intention.  I am simply concerned to see that this very important body functions well and properly in the interests of the community, not in the interests of a small sector of the community which, I believe, will benefit under this proposal of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am praying that some grammarian will say that it is all right to say &ldquo;Comhairle na h-Ospidéal&rdquo; instead of Comhairle na nOspidéal. Every time I say it I feel I am stuttering, <Col N="2083" /> a facility I had in infancy.  In fact, at one time I was in a class for stutterers.</P>
      <P>We must consider the present practice under which consultants are appointed.  The truth is that consultants have an immense and almost limitless scope at the moment in relation to appointments of other consultants subject of course to <i>ad hoc</i> boards which are established.  The Minister today said that unofficial influence is sometimes greater than the statutory influence. The unofficial influence of existing consultants is, of course, immense. Therefore, I suppose it is wise to endeavour to obtain their goodwill in the establishment of new boards.  At the same time, I agree with those who feel that there should not be a preponderance of consultants on the new board because if that occurs we will lose some of the great value that we have in the present system.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to concern himself regarding the disadvantage and, indeed, the dangers that could arise if appointments are to be made by known personnel of a permanent board.  At present various boards are set up for the purpose of making appointments and the practice is frequently to bring in outside experts, assessors from abroad, and people who are not known in advance.  I do not know whether it is proposed that the new Comhairle na nOspidéal is to make all the appointments and all the selections or whether it will be open to the Comhairle to appoint a board.</P>

As long as half are consultants their interest and their special knowledge and experience will be available and the balance can be made up of people experienced in the other fields of medicine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure what the Deputies mean by &ldquo;clear&rdquo; recommendations.  The Commission of Inquiry on Mental Illness summarised its findings in 146 numbered paragraphs, covering almost every aspect of the services for the mentally ill.  These recommendations, or findings, were not addressed only to the Minister for Health or the health authorities but included many other interests, such as the universities, the courts, the ecclesiastical authorities, An Bord Altranais, etc.  Many of the recommendations relate to improvements which have to be carried out over a period, such as the raising of <Col N="2085" /> the environmental standards in mental hospitals, the development of community services, etc., and it would not be possible to say in respect of every recommendation whether it has been implemented or not.</P>
      <P>In August last I asked each health authority to indicate, in respect of every recommendation appropriate to it, whether it has been put into effect and, if not, what prevents its implementation, or what action is intended. Full replies have not yet been received from all authorities.  I may say, however, that many of the commission's recommendations are in line with policy which has been in operation for some years past.</P>
      <P>To give some examples, the commission recommened the establishment of short-term psychiatric units and this is being proceeded with, two new units having been recently built.  It recommended the promotion of planned and purposeful activities for patients within mental hospitals and this is being done on a continuously increasing scale.  It placed special stress on the need to develop community services and these are being widely extended, and a reorganisation is well advanced in Dublin which should result in a very full development of the idea of a community mental health service.  It referred to the desirability of making special provision for children and adolescents and such provision is being pressed ahead as rapidly as possible and a new unit for psychotic children has now been built and is expected to commence operation in the very near future.  It drew attention to the inadequacy of the existing facilities for post-graduate medical education in psychiatry and a scheme which will help to remedy this has been inaugurated in Dublin.  These are but some of the more important measures which have been taken.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that on 5th April last a road hog mowed down a young girl of seven years of age, that he failed to stop after the accident, that he failed to report the accident, despite the fact that there were two lady passengers screaming to be let out of the car?  This road hog was fined £40 in the district court and was suspended from driving for seven years.  On appeal, however, the judge allowed him off with a fine of £2 and he lifted the driving disqualification. Does the Minister not regard that as a disgrace, as bringing the law into disrepute?</P>

      <P>I do not think it is proper here to canvass decisions of judges one way or the other, but for the record, from what I know of the case the Deputy has certainly given a wrong version of it.  Number one, there were indictable proceedings against this man in respect of which there were penalties imposed in the circuit court, including, I understand, disqualification from driving for two years.  On the other charges, the accused was brought before the district court which imposed certain penalties and there were appeals against these to the circuit court.  The misconception is that the appeals or any ruling on them did not affect the original disqualification of this driver for the period set out.</P>

    <P>In my speech introducing the Estimates I made it plain that I was satisfied that the existing probation service, which consists of the six Dublin probation officers, was inadequate, in spite of the exemplary efforts of the individual officers concerned, and that, on the basis of the report on probation and after-care which I am at present examining, I expect to be able to bring about a substantial improvement. <Col N="2102" /> The average number of cases per probation officer is 60 at present.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions 20 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>As it often happens that several parties may be involved in the finding of suitable employment for prisoners, it would be impossible to give a precise figure for the number of jobs that could be said to have been found by the welfare officer, but during this year he played an active role in finding employment for 41 inmates and for 50 ex-inmates with whom he kept in touch after release.  In addition to the welfare officer two chaplains, one of whom is full-time, and the members of the visiting committee are actively concerned with the inmates' welfare.  Furthermore, there is a voluntary organisation known as St. Patrick's Welfare Association the members of which do valuable and much appreciated work in this field.</P>

Members of the visiting committee and others associated with them do very valuable work in this field which I take it the Deputy means to be that of job placement.

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that 50 per cent of the inmates of St. Patrick's Institution, Dublin, are only semi-literate and according to the researchers of the Social Science Department of UCD could not have benefited from ordinary primary education; and what steps are taken to remedy the educational deficiencies of these inmates.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that a survey carried out by members of the Social Science Department of UCD showed that 35 per cent of the inmates of St. Patrick's Institution, Dublin were either mental defectives or borderline mental defectives; and what specially qualified staff, if any, are involved in the education and rehabilitation of these inmates.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The survey referred to by the Deputy, which was carried out with the <Col N="2105" /> co-operation of my Department, indicated that one boy out of the random sample of 32 inmates was mentally defective.  The others were borderline.</P>
    <P>As for educational backwardness, the position of course is that this problem, is a long-standing one and, as I mentioned in the course of my Estimates speech on Friday last, a psychologist is being appointed in the near future in an effort to improve the situation.  One of the psychologist's principal functions will be to plan and to put into operation an educational programme geared to the individual needs of the inmates of St. Patrick's.</P>
    <P>I must point out however that 80 per cent of the inmates are serving terms of 4½ months or less and it is not practicable to remedy serious educational deficiencies in such a short period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if rule 114 of the Rules for the Government of Prisons 1947 applies to St. Patrick's Institution, Dublin; and if he has any plans to amend it in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This rule, which prohibits familiarity between prison officers on the one hand and prisoners, their friends and relatives on the other hand, applies also in St. Patrick's.  It is designed for the protection of prisoners and does not seem to call for any fundamental amendment in its application to St. Patrick's.</P>
      <P>As I announced in the House recently, however, I have set up a departmental working group to examine, <i>inter alia</i>, the 1947 rules.  Rule 114 will come up for consideration in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider it rather odd that this rule should apply if prison officers are supposed to play any positive part in <Col N="2108" /> rehabilitating the inmates?  Surely if they cannot talk to them unnecessarily they cannot play much of a part in rehabilitating them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the rule about talking is designed to be for the protection of the prisoners themselves. There is talking and talking in it.  It is talking by way of rebuke that the rule is designed to prevent.  It is for the protection of the boys concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a typical Nkrumah twitch to the answer I gave. These rules are not designed to stop people looking after the prisoners but for the specific purpose of restraining warders from unnecessarily badgering or reprimanding these boys or saying anything that would upset them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the Deputy that in the re-examination that is going on this rule also will be examined. The purpose of the rule is very clear and the portion of it prohibiting warders from writing to people afterwards was designed for a very special reason, because of potential blackmail.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 31 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>Our policy is to avoid taking stands on specific issues of the type raised in the Deputies' questions, when we are certain that to do so would have no useful effect whatever, but on the contrary might prevent us from making a positive contribution in promoting peace and in helping in relief both now and later on.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not agree that in view of the very <Col N="2110" /> long-standing connection between this country and the area most devastated by this war, the eastern region of Nigeria, and in view of the way many people in that area are looking to this country with hope, replies of this kind occasion considerable disappointment? Will he not agree that it is possible for us, in fact, to take initiatives of the kind suggested here which do not involve recognition of Biafra?  We are not asking that.  We are just asking the Minister to do something; he is doing nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>This is neither fair nor true.  We are not doing anything publicly but we are doing a lot privately. I think the Deputy will remember that in closing the debate on the Estimate I did say that we favoured a cease-fire. I think that in any dispute, and this is the worst type of dispute, one must accept that a cease-fire must be negotiated between the parties concerned. The parties concerned are seeking certain guarantees against the abuse of a cease-fire for political or military purposes.  We shall be glad if we can contribute in any way to having it brought about, but I believe it must be negotiated and, as I said, when summing up on the Estimate, I think the best we can now do is to try to get a minimum contact between the parties so that they can negotiate.</P>
      <P>If we make any contribution with which either side does not agree, we are not contributing to a cease-fire.  If we take a rigid position at this stage, we are removing any possibility of our being able to contribute later on.</P>

      <P>Accepting the fact that it is possible to do something privately in this, and that we may believe the Minister is trying to do <Col N="2111" /> something in relation to a cease-fire, I should like to ask him about the question of an international arms embargo.  That is something which surely he will agree cannot be attained by private discussions?  It would require public initiative, and that is the kind of initiative which many of us hope for.  Perhaps the Minister might say something about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I have against an arms embargo is that the Governments supplying arms are permanent members of the Security Council. The only possibility of an effective arms embargo would be one which the Security Council had agreed on and agreed to implement.  I am not against an arms embargo.

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but I wondered whether the Minister had sought to get this agreement.  I can quite see that the French and Russian Governments might not have welcomed very much an approach from the British Government as one of the other Governments concerned.  Our position as a neutral in this affair would enable us to take an initiative and I am wondering whether we have taken such an initiative privately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>This might have some effect.  I will consider it, but I should like to say that, even if the Security Council did get agreement, which it will not, because the Governments supplying arms are permanent members of the Security Council, there are private suppliers of arms, surreptitious suppliers of arms, and there would still be a supply of arms.  I think a cease-fire would be needed to make an arms embargo effective.  I go back to what I said on the Estimate.  The most we can do now is to get some minimal contact between the two sides so that they will be prepared to negotiate. Both sides are quite rigid and without negotiation of the two sides to any dispute&mdash;and this is the worst type of dispute&mdash;you will not get any solution.</P>

As regards Government relief aid, I have <Col N="2114" /> already set out in detail our programme in my reply to questions in the Dáil on 20th November.  I indicated at that time that we had made available a sum of up to £25,000 for Irish Red Cross medical teams for either side.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 38 together.  As I already stated in my reply to a question <Col N="2117" /> in the Dáil on 8th July last, Ireland supported the resolution unanimously adopted on 6th May, 1969, by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe which shared the anxiety of the Consultative Assembly over the situation in Greece and reaffirmed the need for a speedy return to a democratic regime in that country.  I have seen the press report to which the Deputy refers.  As to the question of suspension of Greece from the Council of Europe, the Government will decide what action to take in the light of the various proposals which will be considered at the meeting of the Committee of Ministers on 12th December.</P>

      <P>We have just received the report of the Commission on Human Rights, and it is being studied. I will make up my mind on what we should do and suggest a course of action to the Government, but I do not believe we should decide this until we are actually voting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the way our Parliament has worked.  The Government have to take certain decisions. This is a particular case where I think it is essential that other people voting will not know how we are voting until we decide to vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Ireland is now one of the principal promoters of a new draft recommendation calling for non-discrimination in relation to the exercise of a number of fundamental rights, would the Minister not consider it most important that at this stage there should be no doubt in anybody's mind as to Ireland's attitude in relation to the behaviour of a Government which are, on many grounds, committing breaches of the fundamental conditions of membership of the Council of Europe, in particular, without any question of a dispute, in regard to parliamentary representation? One does not have to await the outcome of the report of the Commission on Human Rights to deal with the question of parliamentary non-representation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 to 45 together.</P>
      <P>The provisional trade figures for October which were released last week showed an increase in the import excess of £6 million as compared with October, 1968.  While exports rose by £5 million, imports were £11 million higher.  The increase in imports includes £6 million attributable to imports of aircraft and machinery, which add to our stock of capital, and a large part of the balance was attributable to imports of materials for further production.</P>
      <P>In regard to the forecast of the balance of payments for the year as a whole, I am informed that sales of aircraft abroad valued at about £4½ million which were scheduled to take place in the last quarter of the year are likely to be postponed until 1970.  My pre-budgetary forecast of £55 million in 1969 for the balance of payments deficit may therefore have to be revised to this extent though the postponement is of no economic significance.</P>
      <P>As I have been stressing, we cannot continue to incur balance of payments deficits of this year's order of magnitude without damaging effects on confidence and growth prospects.  I am keeping the situation under close observation and will take any steps necessary to ensure that steady growth of the economy is not hampered by excessive demand pressures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the second part of <Col N="2123" /> Deputy Corish's question I would refer him to my answer to his question of 13th November, 1968, in which I gave him a detailed account of the short-term forecasting techniques used by the Department of Finance and the review procedure by which these are up-dated. I pointed out that the techniques were those adopted internationally for purposes of demand management.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the last three months there was an import excess of £12 million?  Does he not think this import excess is having a very bad effect on the availability of capital here for private enterprise and the employment of our people in productive work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It has no bearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I disagree with the Minister.  Does the Minister not know that we have to pay for things we buy from abroad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the surprising things is that despite the continuing deficit in our balance of payments our external assets are increasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that this constant threat, &ldquo;I will take steps one of these days&rdquo; is likely to increase imports?  Surely the Minister is aware that importers take steps because of this constant threat and the effect is to increase our imports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it does. Another factor of the situation is that the import excess is due only marginally to consumption goods, it is almost entirely due to either capital goods or materials for further production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

Would the Minister now say on what grounds <Col N="2124" />&mdash;in the light of this deteriorating trend &mdash;he expects the deficit to be £59½ million now that he has added on this £4½ million for aircraft?  Does the Minister expect the position to improve in the last two months of the year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

There has been no departure from the Government's decision regarding the transfer of the Departments of Lands and Education to Castlebar and Athlone, respectively.  The provision of modern office buildings at these centres is in progress.

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the introduction of the breathalyser this is a serious matter and I am sure the Minister will agree with me.  There are numerous cases of motor accidents occurring in this country as a result of people having taken alcohol.  In Scandinavian countries beer at low alcohol content is available.  If the Minister provides such incentive, as outlined in his reply, can he explain why it is that the result of his incentive does not produce a marketed commodity by brewers?  We are all faced with having to drink either disgusting minerals or else alcoholic beer.  If low alcohol content beer were to be provided this would make a practical contribution towards reducing deaths through drunken driving.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The incentive in favour of lighter, weaker beer is very considerable.  Brewers cannot, of course, be guided by that alone.  They have to take into account the very important factor of taste.  I might mention that there is a great deal of misunderstanding <Col N="2129" /> about relative prices of beer here and in the United Kingdom.  The reason for this is that our beer is of a higher specific gravity and naturally it costs more.  In this connection people do not compare like with like.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the wages grade pension fund.  On 31st December, 1968, the amount of the fund stood at £6,049,397.</P>
      <P>The amount of the fund is increasing but the liabilities on the fund are increasing at a greater rate.</P>
      <P>The pensions payable to ex-employees of CIE comprise both payment from the CIE pension fund as well as social welfare benefits.  As recommended by the commission on CIE pensions and sickness benefit payments in March, 1964 the total payments made to long service pensioners retiring after 1st April, 1963, are intended to amount to about two-thirds of retiring wages.  Increases in wages are reflected in increased pension entitlements.</P>
      <P>The CIE wages grade pension scheme does not provide for increases in pensions already determined but the social welfare payments are, as the Deputy is aware, increased from time to time by the Minister for Finance and are due for further increase from January next.</P>
      <P>In relation to pension increases to the wages grade pensioners who retired before 1st April, 1963, and who were not included in the recommendations of the commission on CIE pensions and sickness benefit payments.  I have already indicated in reply to a question asked on 6th November, 1969, that I am having the whole position of this group of pensioners examined at present. I hope to be able to make a statement shortly.</P>

      <P>There is no information available to me which would enable me to answer the first part of the Deputy's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 14th November, 1969, the latest date for which figures are available, the live register represented 5 per cent of the workforce and 82 per cent of those registered were males.  As I explained during the recent debate on the Estimate for my Department the live register figures cannot now be regarded as a reliable indication of the <Col N="2141" /> number of persons available for and seeking work.  The register includes casual workers who claim benefits between spells of work but who are not interested in ordinary full-time jobs; it also includes married women who register for the purpose of keeping their social insurance alive.  I am satisfied that not all the people on the live register are available for full-time employment.</P>
    <P>An examination of the register is made four times a year to see how long persons have been registered.  The last such examination was made on the 29th August, 1969.  The position then was that of 41,830 males registered, 16,152 were on the register for less than three months, 6,671 from three to six months, 7,861 from six to 12 months, and 11,146 for 12 or more months. The Deputy will be well aware that it is the Government's policy to create conditions of full employment as early as possible and that various facilities are available to stimulate the growth of industrial employment.  There is clear evidence that this programme is paying off in the number of new jobs created.  In the transportable goods industries the estimated numbers at work in June, 1969, were 11,000 more than in June, 1968.</P>

When the subsidy scheme was discontinued in May, 1957, the necessity for the flour millers to instal a costing system related to that scheme disappeared.</P>
      <P>The flour milling industry introduced their own system of representative costings which I have accepted in relation to my present scheme of prices control.

      <P>In December, 1968, there were 6,900 more persons engaged in manufacturing industries than there were in December, 1967.</P>
      <P>During the six months ended 30th June, 1969, the latest date for which figures are available, the position was as follows:</P>
      <P>(a) 41 projects commenced production with an estimated employment potential of 1,935 at the end of the first year and 4,138 at full production.</P>
      <P>(b)  131 projects under construction on 30th June, 1969, or for which grants were approved have an employment potential of over 7,500 at the end of the first year and 13,700 at full production.</P>

For the 12 months ending in June of this year 11,000 new jobs were created in the manufacturing industry and this figure is ahead of the target set by the NIEC Reports on full employment which proposed 11,000 new jobs in the whole industrial sector.</P>

The total acreage of land in the State is in the region of 16 million acres. The grant of consent under section 45 is an &ldquo;excepted matter&rdquo; reserved to the lay commissioners.  I understand that the categories within which there may be some prospects of consent being granted are as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>Section III, paragraph 19 of the first report of the Higher Education Authority, recently published, contains a summary account of the activities of the authority to date in relation to its task of preparing legislative proposals for the establishment of new universities at Dublin, Cork and Galway.  It is there made clear that the authority, while keeping in full view the Government's decisions in 1968, especially in relation to a better concentration of resources in higher education, has been consulting with the existing colleges and other relevant bodies.  The report emphasises that, while the task is proceeding, the replacing of the existing statutory framework of the universities must <Col N="2158" /> inevitably be a difficult one, involving much further consultation with interested parties.  In the circumstances, it would be premature to make a statement as requested by the Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos 113 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>The issue of reflectorised armbands to school-children is being undertaken by the Safety First Association.  The armbands are being distributed to the schools by the association in co-operation with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.</P>
      <P>Applications for armbands should be made to the individual school authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that this is something which should have been attended to several months ago.  The dark mornings have now arrived and people like myself and the Minister driving in from the country can barely see children going to school on the side of the road.  Without trying to criticise the Safety First Organisation who did a great job last year, would the Minister try to expedite the issue of the armbands?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>A very considerable number of them have been issued.  Of course, I will certainly look further into the matter.  It is essential that we should reiterate on every occasion the necessity for drivers to take particular care during the times that children are going to and coming from school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that mortar shells are being used in guns in the armoured cars in the armoured division which are not the proper shells necessary for the efficient functioning of the armoured car gun?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the Deputy's pardon, I did not quite hear what he said, but I think the general import of it was that the type of mortar shells in use in the Army are in some way deficient and unreliable.  This is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that these mortar shells are being used in the armoured cars for a purpose for which they were not intended, namely, armoured car use.  As a mortar shell fired from a mortar they are 100 per cent efficient but as a mortar shell fired from an armoured car they are totally inefficient and result in numerous misfirings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister no doubt is aware of the fact that this question is asked every year as many people on the register of employment exchanges who apply every year are apparently not engaged.  The Minister's reply-that men are employed if they &ldquo;are suitable&rdquo; is a very vague one. A number of men on the employment exchange register are excluded every year.  They never get the opportunity for this work and it is a great pity they are not considered for it.</P>

It is understandable in all cases where we take on people in relation to this type of work that there <Col N="2171" /> must of necessity be contacts and inquiries made with the gardaí in order to ensure that mistakes are kept to the minimum.

      <P>When a person makes an application for temporary employment he is asked to give references and he gives the names of two reputable individuals who may be checked with.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got figures of that nature but I can say in Dublin the number of unemployed men seeking temporary work at Christmas has been decreasing steadily over the past few years.  In 1959, for example, there were about 2,600 unemployed men seeking Christmas work compared with 927 in 1964 and 671 in 1968, which in its own way proves the point that has already been made today by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Labour.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say how soon the applicants are notified they will be accepted or not?  This is a very important matter.  Those people have to wait until the week before Christmas to know whether they will get an answer to their application or not.  This happens every year.  Those applicants for posts as temporary postmen have to wait for a reply up to Christmas week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, it is an extraordinary thing about people that they wait until the last week before Christmas to make use of the postal service.  We do not want to take on people at the beginning of November in anticipation of employing them one week before Christmas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely from experience during the years, the Department would have a good idea of the volume of traffic?  Surely they would be able to forecast the number of temporary employees required?

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether the statement by the Minister for Justice in the last paragraph of his reply to a question on 19th November, 1969, indicates any change in policy by the Government in relation to RTE as expressed by the then Taoiseach in the Dáil on 12th October, 1966.</P>

      <P>The precise wording of the reply of the Minister for Justice was that the Government rejected the view that RTE should be either generally or in respect to current affairs programmes completely independent of Government supervision.

    <Col N="2185" />
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 46c:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) (c), page 22, line 50, to delete &ldquo;after consultation with&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;following nomination by&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think it would be best if I first gave the House subsection (2) (c) of section 40 itself.  According to this section one-half of the members of a regional hospital board shall be persons appointed by the health boards the functional areas of which are included in the functional area of the regional hospital board and one-half shall be appointed by the Minister after consultation with such bodies representative of the persons concerned.  We are suggesting that rather than there being a consultative indication on the part of the Minister it should, in fact, be straight nomination by the bodies representative of the persons concerned with the provision of hospital services.  We feel that the right of such bodies to make formal nominations themselves should be enshrined in this piece of legislation rather than that the Minister should have a somewhat arbitrary provision open to him to consult and then to make the appointments as he thinks fit.</P>
      <P>In this context it is in accordance with Labour Party policy that the representative bodies shall make the nomination rather than that the Minister shall consult with them first and then make the appointment himself in effect.  This is the proposition that we are submitting to the House in respect of nominations to the regional hospital board in each jurisdictional area.  Accordingly, I trust that the Minister will see the good sense in this amendment put down by Deputy O'Connell and myself on behalf of our Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps this amendment has been put down because I have not sufficiently explained the underlying purpose behind the formation of regional hospital boards.  They will be concerned with the general organisation and development of hospital services and not with their day-to-day administration.  The three regional hospital boards will be taking <Col N="2186" /> over a number of functions which are at present functions of the Minister for Health and his Department.  In other words, this is a very valuable experiment which I believe will be successful in decentralising hospital planning and enabling people to make propositions which will, of course, require budgetary consent for the improvement of hospital services.  The appointment of consultants in an area can then be considered by Comhairle na nOspidéal.</P>
      <P>I regard it as a decentralising move. It will leave to my Department the work of some of the superior planning for the whole country.  Indeed, my Department are pretty hard pressed at present.  There is a tremendous amount of work to be done because of the expansion of the services.  There are many health reports to implement.  Five reports have been presented to us, all excellent, all highly commented upon by the community generally.  So, we will have these regional hospital boards helping with planning.</P>
      <P>Under the circumstances, quite definitely it would be entirely reasonable for me to appoint one half of the membership of these boards.  I can assure the House that, as they will consist of consultants, possibly general practitioners and other people concerned with health services, they will be appointed on the basis of their capability in relation to the whole area in which they will operate.  They will not in any sense be politically appointed.  These are bodies for planning purposes.  I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>It is very important also, referring to Deputy Browne's fears arising from his statement on the previous amendment, that I should make certain that the half of the regional hospital boards which includes consultants and other similar persons, should include consultants in a regional area who are far-seeing, who are people of a reasonably progressive turn of mind.  I am not saying that if they were nominated to me the case would be otherwise but, at least in the initial stages, I think this should be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the House that the composition of the regional hospital <Col N="2187" /> boards as a whole will come in its final form before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the shape of a resolution to be passed by the Dáil and Seanad, along with the regulations for Comhairle na nOspidéal, and along with the regulations for the appointment of the health boards.  All that can be considered again but, nevertheless, it is right and proper that I should have the opportunity of direct appointment in this case.</P>
    <P>If I set a good example to my successors in these appointments, I do not believe that in this modern age any successor of mine would downgrade the appointments made by him, either to serve a purely narrow political interest or to serve any other purpose. That is the position and I must remain absolutely rigid in regard to this matter. I hope the Labour Party Deputies will see the point that this is the devolution, to some extent, of my Department.  I am asking experts who will not include officers of the Department to do part of the work of the Department which will, of course, eventually be referred to the Department in one way or another, through the budgetary process, through the planning of each year's health and hospital administration, and through the officers in my Department who sit on Comhairle na nOspidéal.  It is important to preserve this principle in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know which side to take here because, no matter which side makes the appointment, there are certain dangers.  I am opposed to the Labour Party amendment because it is very often the most popular and not necessarily the most suitable person who comes from this type of nomination.  If the Minister makes the appointment it will be said that it is a political appointment or, at least, it can be said that it is a political appointment and not necessarily the best appointment.  Of the two, I think it is safer that the Minister should make the appointment because he at least will have to answer to this House in some shape or form.  The bodies referred to will not be answerable to us or to anyone except their own <Col N="2188" /> organisations.  On that account I would not be in favour of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I most certainly feel there is comment to be made by us in respect of Deputy Clinton's viewpoint and the statement made by the Minister.  We are specifically asking that the half who are to be put on the regional hospital boards, representative of those providing hospital services, should have the specific democratic elective right to make the nomination themselves.  I do not accept the comment made by Deputy Clinton that the most popular man might emerge.  That would be reflection on the ability of the various staffs and health organisations and consultative organisations to get the best person.  I do not think his popularity, or the colour of his eyes, or his lack of hair, or any other aspect, would enter into it.  Even if one could question the people who might emerge from that kind of elective process, these people still have the right to make the appointment and, if they make a mess of it, well, then, they have made the mess themselves and they are responsible to themselves as organisations for having done so.</P>
      <P>I do not think we should have such little faith in the representative organisations as to think that they cannot do this.  We know quite well what happens in practice.  The Minister will write to the various organisations.  He will ask for a panel of names.  There will be the usual internal difficulties in these organisations in submitting a list of names to a Minister who will then, in his wisdom and judgment, decide from that particular panel who are the people to appoint, or he may do what his predecessor did, he may ask for such a large panel that it would be very difficult to decide who should go on it anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asking the Minister to get rid of this half-hearted devolution which he talks about.  In other words, we are asking him in regard to the staffs of the various regional hospital boards to have sufficient trust and sufficient faith in them as to say: &ldquo;Right.  Make the nominations.  Give us the people.  I, as Minister for Health, will stand over your right to elect <Col N="2189" /> people to the boards and I will therefore appoint them.&rdquo;  Remember, the Minister can always bring very considerable pressure to bear on any appointee who may be grossly unsuitable, and he can consult further with these organisations.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I do not think we should accept the comment made by Deputy Clinton or the comment made by the Minister in response to the fundamental approach by the Labour Party that those who represent shall appoint. This is the way this House is run.  I am sure we have some specimens in this House&mdash;I may be very wrong in my choice of term&mdash;whom we would not necessarily put on to these regional boards, but I have no doubt that it is the right of the electorate to select whom they wish.  It is also the right of the workers and the professional staffs in the health services to select whomever they want on the boards of the regional hospitals.  That is the way it should be.  That is the democratic way in which it should be seen to be in operation in practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my two colleagues because, as I said earlier, this Bill seems to be a complete bureaucrat's charter.  As far as I can recollect there is no mention of anyone except the CEO and the Minister.  Then we come to section 40 where I suspect the Minister is giving only lip service to the devolution of power from the centre to the periphery in order to allow democratic elections to take place in these various bodies that would be nominated to this board.  It is quite wrong that one should presuppose that the different nominating bodies would not be sufficiently responsible or sufficiently conscious of the need to appoint the best person to any position.  That presupposes a level of immaturity in the nominating bodies which I believe is a very condescending attitude and which I do not think comes well from all of us here who depend on the democratic process to be elected to this House.  Responsible or irresponsible, reliable or unreliable, it does not matter; we all believe in the democratic process.  Why can we not accept that the democratic process <Col N="2190" /> would be just as valid and as valuable in producing the best person for the post?</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister should seek to mollycoddle these various bodies he is setting up.  Why does he not either run the whole of the health services from the Department of Health or grant a serious and significant devolution of power to the regional boards?  In turn these regional bodies should encourage a devolution of power down through the various professional and technical bodies that would be nominated to these regional boards.  This whole measure stinks to high Heaven of the whole concept which I regard as anathema, the democratic centralist idea of Stalin in his heyday.  The attitude is that the ordinary citizen cannot run his professional body; he cannot run his trade union; he cannot run the local authorities. Why not tell us he cannot even nominate the right people to this House?  Many of us believe that he has not, and a good case could be made for it, particularly in the case of the Minister.</P>
      <P>This type of provision represents the continuation of &ldquo;big brother&rdquo;, in the Department of Health having the final say.  Anybody who knows the record of Fianna Fáil Governments over the years understands this business of: &ldquo;Give us a list but we will have the final say.&rdquo;  State bodies like Telefís Éireann have been blatantly misused and abused over the years by the Government who exercise this right of veto in relation to nominations, and in that way policy has been dictated.  People who are nominated allegedly by democratic process end up as further supporters of the Minister, so that in fact he has the majority of power on a superficially democratic body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I can argue this any more.  I have expressed my point of view, that these regional hospital board representatives would provide a very democratic, so to speak, admixture to the total board.  I hope that the people who are nominated by the regional health boards will be people who will be really skilled in the operation of the health service.  In <Col N="2191" /> the initial phase it is essential that the Minister should appoint the other half of the people but I gather from consulting those who are legally responsible for drafting this Bill that if I feel convinced that the system of nomination is acceptable, it can be done later; in other words, when I consult the medical bodies including those engaged in medical education, which is the subject of the next amendment, I can say to them: &ldquo;You choose&rdquo;.  Therefore it is flexible.  The emphasis is on the proposal that I should appoint them but it could be done the other way.  I do not want to expand the debate.  I have given the full position in regard to this, so I will leave it to the House to decide whether they wish to accept this amendment from the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider bringing in on the Report Stage even the mention of the term &ldquo;nomination&rdquo;?  After all, it could be said here that one half should be appointed by the Minister after consultation or on a nominatory basis.  The principle of people sending in names rather than the Minister asking them to give a panel of names would be more effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We will put it in as an alternative.  Would that satisfy the Labour Party: &ldquo;by consultation or by nomination&rdquo;?  However, I want to make it clear that in the initial phase I shall certainly do it by direct appointment. We will put it in as &ldquo;by consultation or by nomination&rdquo;.  Nothing could be more democratic, and we can leave it to the Minister of the day.</P>

      <P>This amendment will give the council itself the function of regulating the number and types of appointment of consultant medical staff and certain other staffs who may be employed by the regional hospital boards.  The object of the amendment is to ensure that the Minister's function will not, in those circumstances, duplicate those of the council.  It is really a drafting amendment. As I have said earlier, the regulations in regard to all this will have to go before the Dáil and the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 49:</P>
      <P>In page 23, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7)  The following provision shall apply in relation to appointments referred to in subsection (1) (b) (i) by a regional hospital board:</P>
      <P>(a)  the remuneration and allowances and any ancillary expenses in relation to a person so appointed who is assigned to a health board or a particular hospital or group of hospitals shall be recouped to the regional hospital board by the health board or the authorities of the hospital or the group of hospitals;</P>
      <P>(b)  any such person while so assigned shall be subject to the like controls as apply under this Act or otherwise to officers of the health board or to appointments to the particular hospital or group of hospitals, as may be appropriate&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2193" /> I have already dealt with this in the course of previous observations.  It would appear advantageous that a regional hospital board should have the authority to employ consultants on their establishment to do work in the health board and in the voluntary hospitals in the region.  These consultants will naturally be under the day-to-day management of the voluntary hospitals concerned and the health board, in the case of health board hospitals.</P>
    <P>The object of this, as I have already said, is to extend the appointment of consultants servicing both kinds of hospitals or servicing outside the area of a single health board.  This will mean in the future that you can have more consultants who might be appointed by a voluntary hospital doing sessions for the health board in the health board hospitals within or without the area of the health board where the voluntary hospital was; or you might have the reverse situation with the appointment of a consultant who would primarily be employed by the health board in a health board hospital, perhaps a teaching hospital, but who might undertake sessions in voluntary hospitals.  It was felt in this case that they should be employed formally by the regional hospital board and that the remuneration, allowances and any ancillary expenses must be recouped to the regional hospital board by the health board in respect of the portion of the salary or sessional fees as established, or by the authorities in the voluntary hospital, who would also pay a representative portion of the services undertaken in a particular voluntary hospital.  I think this is fairly clear.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes to do something similar to what is already being done by the federated voluntary hospitals at the moment where new appointments are being made by the federation, and they are assigned to particular sessions in hospitals all over the place.  Very often it is not possible for one institution to find sufficient sessions for a consultant, and I think this is certainly the right way to do it.  At present the individual hospitals pay sessional fees, but it is <Col N="2194" /> a better arrangement that there should be payment from the hospital board as a whole.</P>

      <P>I agree with what Deputy Clinton says.  It is a very necessary administrative arrangement. I do not like the use of the word &ldquo;controls&rdquo; in subsection (7) (b).  I do not think the word &ldquo;controls&rdquo; is used anywhere else in the Bill.  One talks about &ldquo;terms of employment&rdquo;, &ldquo;conditions of service&rdquo; and so forth, but the word &ldquo;controls&rdquo; reflects a state of mind which seems to infer that the persons would be out of control unless the permitted controls proposed by the Bill were enforced against them because of this particular section.  I do not strongly underline it but I do not think we should use the word &ldquo;controls&rdquo; if a happier word could be found.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Ryan that the word could be misconstrued. The word is referred to in section 16 subsection (3) (d) and I understand it is a word which has been used in the past in other Health Acts. It does not mean any extra formal control, it is just part of the administrative phraseology but it has no sinister significance.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 50:</P>
      <P>In page 23, to delete subsection (7), lines 25 to 27, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) (a)  Regulations under subsection (2) may provide that any reference to a health board in this Act (other than in sections 12, 13, 15 and 16) or in any other enactment shall be construed as including a reference to a regional hospital board.</P>
      <P>(b)  This subsection shall not operate to permit the application by section 14 of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Acts, 1926 and 1940, to appointments other than for hospitals maintained by health boards.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2195" /> The purpose of subsection (7) of this section was to permit the general provisions in the Bill about health boards and their functions to be applied to regional hospital boards.  It would be inappropriate to apply to those boards the provisions in sections 12, 13, 15 and 16 of the Bill.  Subsection (6) of section 40 makes it clear that the regional hospital boards would have special provision in regulations relating to the employment of their officers and servants. There is no need to apply the provisions in sections 15 and 16 of the Bill relating to the chief executive officers and their functions to the regional hospital boards.  The boards will not be concerned with the kind of day-to-day administration for which the provisions of sections 15 and 16 were designed.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of the amendment will make it clear that the selection machinery of the Local Appointments Commission cannot be compulsorily applied to the making, by a regional board, of a consultant's appointment. It is made clear that this selection procedure could not be made compulsory for a consultant who would work in voluntary hospitals.  It is simply an amendment clarifying the actual position in regard to employment given by regional hospital boards.  In relation to the regional hospital boards' choice of their own officers and staffs, which will be small, regulations will come before the House to deal with this.  The regulations with regard to the employment of what small staffs these hospital boards will have will come before the House in the form of special resolutions. I am not taking away any responsibility from the House in deciding how the staffs of these regional hospital boards will be appointed.  The actual method of appointing administrative staff will come before the House when we deal with the formation of regional hospital boards and the health boards in the form of a separate resolution.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 51:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 23, between lines 33 and <Col N="2196" /> 34, to insert the following subsections:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;( )  A draft of regulations which it is proposed to make under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.</P>
    <P>( ) Section 5 (5) of the Health Act, 1947, shall not apply to regulations under this section.</P>
    <P>( ) Nothing in this section or in regulations made thereunder shall operate to terminate or affect in any way any rights which a person referred to in subsection (1) (b) (i) had on the 1st day of October, 1969.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an amendment which is being placed before the House because when we were preparing this Bill we had to think of the purpose underlying the operation of the regional hospital boards and Comhairle na nOspidéal and we decided it was essential that the regulations in relation to these bodies should be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  The second paragraph of the amendment simply means as we have laid them down before the House we will not have to comply with the section of the Health Act whereby regulations of this kind must be laid before the House and annulled and unless they are annulled within 21 days they come into operation.  In other words, one does not need two kinds of examination in the House.  The last paragraph is inserted as a safeguard of rights which consultants in voluntary hospitals may have.  Such a safeguard exists in section 14 subsection (5) of the Hospitals Federation and Amalgamation Act, 1961.  It simply guarantees the rights and privileges of those consultants now in employment.  It is purely a protective paragraph.  I know the House will want to discuss the whole question of the procedures and methods of appointment of Comhairle na nOspidéal and the regional hospital boards in so far as they have not already been defined in the Bill up to now.</P>

      <P>We are very glad the Minister has met the objections which <Col N="2197" /> we voiced on Second Stage of this Bill in relation to this particular section. Our objection to the section at that stage was that it proposed a mountain of new ideas.  It gave the Minister permission to make voluminous regulations to legislate by means of a blanket, without the House being afforded any way of even commenting on the regulations.  We feel the Minister has gone a long way to meeting our objections in this regard.  The House will have the opportunity to legislate, if only by means of approving regulations, or by way of making suggestions or tabling amendments. The Minister has provided that draft regulations shall not be made until a resolution, approving them, has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas, and in this way our fears have been mollified to a reasonable extent. While we still have some fears about the workings of Comhairle na nOspidéal, we appreciate that we are to have another opportunity of considering the Minister's detailed proposals and on that account we certainly accept and thank the Minister for this amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing that we can do about it now but there is such a profusion of authorities and boards that it is very difficult to see that so many of them are necessary. There are eight health boards, three regional hospital boards, local committees and Comhairle na nOspidéal. There will be a good deal of overlapping and a good deal of difficulty in getting the various authorities to understand the limitations of their functions and where one stops and the other begins.  Personally, I find it difficult to separate the functions of the various bodies set up under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing that will create confusion is that there is an eastern region and a hospital board for a region, including some of the counties in the eastern region.  For instance, there is the board covering Dublin city, Dublin county, the borough of Dún Laoghaire, Wicklow and Kildare and then there is <Col N="2198" /> the regional hospital board covering the whole of Leinster, Cavan, Monaghan, South Tipperary and, I think, Waterford.  It is a mystery to me as to how they will separate their functions and why the functions of the various bodies cannot be carried out in the same way as they were carried out by a health authority covering a wide area and being responsible for all the institutions in that wide area. There was one body responsible and if something went wrong it was an easy matter to go to that one body and ask what was being done about it.  In this case there is a proliferation of boards and authorities criss-crossing one another in the various functions they have to perform.  We have probably gone beyond the point of being able to do much about it but I do not know whether or not the Minister himself feels that this is the best way to set up an administration for the health services. I do not see how he could possibly believe that it is necessary to have so many boards and so many authorities doing the work that has been done in the past by a single authority.  I realise that in regionalisation there must be a larger region for institutions than for intimate services.  A region such as the eastern region is sufficiently large to have one authority performing the functions for the region, including institutional functions, without going outside and including a larger area for the purposes of the institutional services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the Deputy.  I always believe in being frank in this House about matters of this kind.  I made a very great effort to conceive the entire smooth flow of administration in relation to these bodies.  Of course, it is quite clear that the county consultative committees are purely advisory bodies that will not engage in administration.  So that you have left the health boards, regional health boards and Comhairle na nOspidéal.  I thought it would be a very good thing to clarify the mind of the House by presenting a special White Paper, not, perhaps, couched in the same language as many White Papers use&mdash;spelling out in considerable detail absolutely specifically how <Col N="2199" /> we think the administration will operate.  It will be presented to the House when we present the regulations for the regional health board formation, for the formation of Comhairle na nOspidéal and the regional hospital boards.  I might add, it will help me as much as the Deputy to see this.</P>
      <P>I am reminded of the fact that when I was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs we decided to take much more account of the Swedish telephone system, which is a Civil Service system. We went to Sweden and the heads of the Department spent three full days with us explaining in English how they were reforming the Swedish telephone administration.  When I asked the head of the Department: &ldquo;How could you give us the time?&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;We have made so many changes in the last two years that it was a very valuable exercise for the whole of my staff to see how it looked as presented to an outside person&rdquo;.  In that sense, I intend to present this White Paper to the House.</P>

      <P>Now that we are coming to the end of the discussion of Part III, section 40, I welcome the Minister's assurance that there will be a full examination in any case where closure of the county hospital is being or has been recommended.  His assurance will give the people in any area some hope that the position will be improved when the inquiry is completed.  The particular location of County Clare and of the county hospital warrants special consideration.  We have impressed on the Minister at regional board meetings the necessity to give us an additional member on the board.  I hope the Minister will seriously consider doing that now.  It was also impressed upon him that Clare County Council was unanimously supporting the improvement of the facilities being granted to the surgeon and hospital staff there.  Should the recommendation in the report be implemented it would mean that patients would have to travel in some cases 80 miles to a hospital. That is not reasonable either medically or in any other way.  In the case of a patient who was haemorrhaging it would be very dangerous.  It is desirable <Col N="2200" /> that that fear should be eliminated.</P>
      <P>Any suggestion that the county hospital was not successful because of the small number of operations performed in it over the years would not bear examination.  Indeed, any suggestion of that kind would be false.  The physician, surgeon and staff there are of very high calibre and they are recognised as being at the top of their professions.  We are anxious to retain these people in Clare.  The Minister is fully aware of the views of the people. Deputy Loughnane spoke about that. Being a medical man he understands the position.  I ask the Minister to keep in mind the need for a county hospital in most counties.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister elaborate on subsection (2) (b)?  It provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A regional hospital board shall perform such functions as may be prescribed in relation to the general organisation and development of hospital services in an efficient and satisfactory manner in the hospitals administered by health boards and other bodies in its functional area which are engaged in the provision of services under this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In most areas there will be existing voluntary hospitals functioning under voluntary boards.  To what extent will the new regional hospital board have either the right or the authority to upset the working of these boards, to interfere with what the hospitals are doing, and to give definite directions and instructions?  This could be a very sticky wicket and I should like to hear what the Minister has to say about it.  I have always recognised the need for some overall authority to ensure that the potential of all hospitals is fully utilised.  We did have the situation in which hospital beds were provided at enormous cost and never occupied.  We also had the situation in which hospitals had many unoccupied beds over long periods and yet it was impossible to admit people. This is the kind of overall function that could well be performed by a body like a regional hospital board. <Col N="2201" /> But there should be no question of dictating to these voluntary hospitals which have given such excellent service over the years.  Would the Minister give us some idea of the kind of functions the board will perform in relation to what is described as the general organisation and development of hospital services?  How far can they go on this board beyond giving advice and ensuring that the best possible use is being made of the potential in the area?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy reads what I said he will find that, in the course of the debate, I outlined most of this.  The Hospitals Commission was set up under the 1933 Act.  That commission is being dissolved and its work will be done by Comhairle na nOspidéal and the regional hospital boards.  The functions of the Hospitals Commission were to record and digest information in relation to hospital and nursing facilities, the needs of the people for such facilities and the adjustment of such facilities to such needs; to investigate and report to the Minister on every matter relating to hospital or nursing facilities referred to them by the Minister for such investigation and report; and to make and submit to the Minister schemes for the improvement and co-ordination of hospital or nursing facilities or both hospital and nursing facilities in any part of the country. They also had power to examine the voluntary hospitals and report on the accounts and, in so doing, to recommend the amount of grant from the Hospitals Trust Fund to meet deficits. There were the general powers of the Hospitals Commission.  These will be transferred to the regional hospital board which will receive the budgets of the health boards in respect of their hospitals and the budgets of the voluntary hospitals in the area.  The regional hospital board will examine them and make proposals for the improvement of hospital administration.  They could engage in work study of various kinds. They could encourage more central services to reduce the burden of costs in certain areas of administration.  There is no intention to invade the existing privileges of the voluntary hospitals <Col N="2202" /> through the operation of the regional hospital board.</P>
      <P>The whole purpose of this Bill is to integrate the work of the voluntary hospital and the local authority hospital because of the frightening cost of hospital management.  The voluntary hospitals, I am glad to say, accepted very readily the need for that general progress towards co-ordination and integration and the Medical Association have accepted the formation of Comhairle na nOspidéal which will have certain regulatory powers of a kind not used before except in a very vague way. The Deputy need have no fear that there will be any trouble with these voluntary hospitals which have served the country so well.  The Hospitals Commission was a centralised body; its work is now being decentralised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The side heading reads: &ldquo;Bodies for co-ordination and development of hospital services.&rdquo; I go a long way with Deputy Clinton in agreeing that we will have a multiplicity of boards.  I gather one of the main functions of the Bill is to co-ordinate services and reduce overhead charges as far as possible.  I should like the Minister to give us some information about that.  If there is a multiplicity of boards there will also be an increased secretariat.  It seems to me that Comhairle na nOspidéal will take over to a large extent the functions of voluntary institutions.</P>
      <P>All State boards cost a certain amount of money.  Even though the individuals concerned on the boards are not actually paid, there are travelling and other expenses.  It seems to me that, apart from a certain amount of confusion which will be caused by this multiplicity of boards, there will be considerable overhead costs and I am not satisfied that we will get a better co-ordinated health service.  Let us hope that we will, but I am not satisfied that we will get a more economic health service.  It has been my belief from the implementation of the Act of 1953&mdash;the first Act that I was concerned with in this House&mdash;that the great struggle was to endeavour to give to the people the best medical services possible at the cheapest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2203" /> One of the curses of the health service has been the administrative costs, which have been increasing all the time.  This Health Act, as a whole, is built largely on the idea that administration should be made more perfect and brought more to date and that we should reduce the administrative charges.  Personally, I cannot see how that would happen but I may be wrong on that point.  Perhaps, the Minister will make a short statement on this before we leave the section.</P>
    <P>I welcome very much the Minister's statement that he will produce a White Paper, that is, a White Paper that the ordinary individual can understand without having a supersonic brain.  My experience of White Papers during the years has been that I go back from them to the Bill itself and end up very confused.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the staff of the Hospitals Commission will play a very useful part on transfer, which I am sure they will accept, to the Dublin Regional Hospital Board.  The staffs of the other boards will have to be recruited as a result of the inevitable administrative changes that will take place.  When the regional hospital boards are formed there should be certain savings and certain rationalisation. The local medical officers will continue to have to work in their county areas. It would be very difficult for me to forecast the total cost of administrative staffs but I have been discussing this with the officers of my Department and it is quite obvious that the Hospitals Trust Fund will have to pay the cost of the staffs of Comhairle na nOspidéal. That is quite evident.  There will have to be a sort of management examination in each area for which chief executive officers will be responsible so as to ensure that there is no Parkinsonian development of staff.  However, the principal increases in the cost of administration in the past ten years have been caused by the very great increase in the salaries and wages of staff.  Some of these were what have been described familiarly as status increases. The House well knows the reason for this.  There was a time when virtually the only administrative jobs <Col N="2204" /> open in this country were in the Civil Service and local authorities and the people were glad enough to have them. That applied also to the Post Office. There has been a very great jump in salaries and wages of health staffs throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Nurses in all countries until recently were very badly paid.  On a job analysis basis and taking the human factor into consideration, it is very hard to say whether they are yet adequately paid; but I am glad to say with regard to in-living nurses, pay and conditions are very satisfactory by comparison with England as a result of the recent increases, increments and reduction in working hours.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I do not think that the increase in costs were due to what might be described as red tape administration but that they were largely due to increases in salaries and wages. I have not been in the Department long enough to have been able to make a survey of this but I am very interested in management courses.  When I was in charge of eight State companies I did my utmost to persuade them to make use of every sort of technique to ensure maximum efficiency and I am glad to say that many of them show efficiency.  I hope that will be the case in respect of the health boards and I must say that I was delighted to hear great praise from all sides of the House about the general management of the Dublin Health Authority.  I understand that that authority is very well-conducted and I have not heard any suggestion to the effect that the people who are heading the Dublin Health Authority have engaged in Parkinsonian practices in regard to staff.  I hope that is the case.  That implication was there in everything that was said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said that I do not think the cost of the staffs of the regional health boards or of Comhairle na nOspidéal will bear heavily on the rates or taxation in relation to the huge amount of £52 million that we are spending.  We will consider every possible method of keeping the cost to the minimum, consistent with the inevitable transfers and without any worsening in conditions of staffs.  I have discussed this with officers of my Department and it seems that we may be able to get help for this very <Col N="2205" /> big operation by providing some people who are skilled in the practice of administration, not a private commercial administration necessarily because the two are not the same: running an insurance company is not the same as running a health service and giving medical cards, although there are elements common to both operations. However, great care must be taken to distinguish between one and the other.  That is all the assurance I can give the House in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>We must separate from our minds the evidence of advisory committees.  I hope they will do very useful work, but they are not executive committees. The executive committees will consist of a smaller number of health authorities than now exist.  As the House knows, there is one for every county with the exception of the Dublin area but there will be a smaller number of regional health boards, plus Comhairle na nOspidéal.  I hope that the whole operation will move smoothly but I agree that it will need careful consideration. Therefore, I shall be very glad, on the occasion of Health Estimates or in connection with any new resolution that might be moved in the House, to have constructive criticism of the operation of these boards and this new elaborate organisation in the year 1972, if I still happen to hold office.</P>

It did great work in its time.  It acted during a time of great change and great challenge.  It kept the Irish hospitals system very much to the forefront of the hospitals of the world.  In recent times, however, the changes in medical science and knowledge and techniques have advanced rather more rapidly than the structure of our existing hospital services.  The fact that tremendous changes are now proposed is in no way a reflection on the Hospitals Commission which has done well in its time.  It deserves well and it deserves the gratitude of the Irish people.  I think we in Dáil Éireann should record that fact on this occasion; thank them for what they have done; wish them well and hope that some of them at least will see service in the new Comhairle na nOspidéal.</P>

That has been as a result of the preparatory work of exploration and examination by the Hospitals Commission reporting to the Minister for Health.  I quite agree with the Deputy.</P>

      <P>With regard to the abolition of the Hospitals Commission the function, as I know it, of the Hospitals Commission was to utilise to the best purposes the funds that were available.  When an application came in from a hospital for, say, an increase in X-ray equipment or any other section of it, it was the function of the Hospitals Commission to decide <Col N="2208" /> whether that was a good idea.  It was the function of the Hospitals Commission to decide whether that was a good idea.  It was their function to see that the money was utilised in the best possible way to secure the most advantageous services in our hospitals, taking them as a whole.  Now that they are disappearing altogether, my query is whether their function&mdash;the function I have just cited&mdash;is to be taken over by Comhairle na nOspidéal.  Will they take over absolutely all the functions that the Hospitals Commission had?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The regional hospital boards will take over that function.  In my Department, we shall naturally look at every modern technique in the same way.  We can refer these proposals to the regional hospital boards and Comhairle na nOspidéal.  My Department must continue to be the Department where we receive the reports of what is going on everywhere, in every country, and to feed these to Comhairle na nOspidéal and to the regional hospital boards.  I have already explained how the functions of the Hospitals Commission will be divided. This, again, will be a matter of my Department operating in conjunction with these new bodies.  If it is essential to have consultation with them jointly, that can be done.  We can consult the comhairle at any time.  We could consult representatives of the regional hospital boards if we wanted to suggest that we had some new equipment or some new facilities in mind.  Then, of course, we also have the many groups of consultants who come to see us.  I have never been in any Department where there was so much perpetual consultation on every conceivable matter as there is in the Department of Health.  The officers of my Department are most anxious to bring forward new ideas and to consult with everybody. The Department of Health is a vastly consultative organisation.  I do not think the Deputy need fear that there will be a lack of facilities for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that we are forming three different types of board does not mean that there will not be continuous consultation with people who come to see us on all sorts of matters.  For example, <Col N="2209" /> if somebody wants to discuss an intensive care unit, which is a very expensive operation, in addition to going to the Dublin Regional Hospital Board there is not any reason why the promoters of that idea could not come to discuss it with our chief medical officer and get his views on it.  There will have to be co-ordination of operation and an avoidance of overlapping of decision-making.  That will all have to be provided as a result of the inevitable changes that will take place in how my Department work in relation to the regional hospital boards and Comhairle na nOspidéal.  I could not go further into it; I have until April, 1971, to think out this super-management structure in my Department. I even have the Devlin Report in relation to that to consider.  I could not go into any further detail today. I have not had enough experience. Indeed, these boards have not been formed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 53:</P>
      <P>In page 23, before section 42 to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2210" />&ldquo;42.  (1) The definition of &lsquo;hospital&rsquo; in section I of the Act of 1933 is hereby amended by the insertion of &lsquo;or for providing services for hospitals' after `medical research&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>(2)  Section 14 (5) of the Act of 1933, in its operation in relation to appointments made between the commencement of this section and the commencement of section 41, shall be constructed as if &lsquo;such period as may be specified by the Minister' were substituted for `two years&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>(3)  In this section &lsquo;the Act of 1933&rsquo; means the Public Hospitals Act, 1933.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This proposed new section would achieve two objects.  It is extending the definition of &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; for the purposes of the Public Hospitals Act, 1933. Through this means, it would permit grants to be made to the hospitals joint services board, which are to provide a laundry service and provide a sterile supply service for hospitals.  At present, it is necessary to make some peculiar arrangements for the financing of the body through the participating hospitals, which is a very complex matter. This board are already in operation and are providing a sterile supply service for Dublin hospitals and they will supply a laundry service.  This money goes through a number of channels until it finally reaches the hospitals joint services board.  We shall get around that through this amendment.  It is possible that other similar boards might be formed to try to reduce the enormous cost of supplies for hospitals of one kind or another.  The hospitals can already purchase certain goods at a certain price through certain purchasing arrangements but we may have an extension of this activity or we may ask the hospitals joint services board to do something.  They would be able to carry out most of the extensions required.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the section will amend section 14 (5) of the 1933 Act which requires appointments of ordinary members of the Hospitals Commission to be for a period of two years in each case.  This amendment is in order to permit all the members to retain their positions to a uniform date when <Col N="2211" /> the Commission will be dissolved under section 41.  That is purely a drafting amendment consequent on the previous section.</P>

      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) The officers transferred under the provisions of this section shall not receive less remuneration or be subject to less beneficial conditions of service than the remuneration to which they are entitled and the conditions of service to which they are subject in the service of the Central Mental Hospital.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to obtain an assurance from the Minister that when the transfer of the administration of the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum to the relevant health board takes place the officers transferred under this section shall not receive less remuneration nor be subject to any less beneficial conditions of service than the remuneration to which they are entitled and the conditions of service which they have in the service of the Central Mental Hospital.</P>
      <P>This, therefore, is an inquiry in the form of an amendment to the Minister. In view of the considerable change now and the large number of staff directly involved we are asking him to give an assurance to the House and to the public that there will be no general worsening of conditions of employment of the specialist personnel doing the tremendously difficult work in Dundrum.  I would ask the Minister for his views on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that the conditions of service in the Central Mental Hospital have at all times been those <Col N="2212" /> involving very great dedication.  I can assure the Deputy that there will be no worsening of conditions nor reduction in remuneration.  I gave assurances in regard to the right of these people to appeal to me and in regard to the setting up of such joint consultative councils as will be necessary when these transfers take place and eventually the establishment of better conciliation and arbitration machinery by the Minister for Local Government which will cover health officers.  I should like to repeat those statements in relation to this amendment.  In view of that I imagine the Deputy will withdraw the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 42, as amended, stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that we welcome very warmly the transfer of the administration of the Central Mental Hospital to a health board.  This is long overdue.  It takes away from the criminal world the whole management, control and approach to people who committed what were technically described as crimes and on that account were committed to the Central Mental Hospital.  We appreciate of course that eight years ago this matter was dealt with in another Bill in so far as personnel were concerned but the administration of the hospital still remained something apart from the local health services.  This was bad both for the services provided in the mental hospital itself and for the community.  We welcome therefore this change to make the management of the Central Mental Hospital not such a strange and unique thing that it could not be dovetailed into the general hospital service.  This is a progressive move and a good one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are however, disappointed that the Central Mental Hospital is to remain vested in the Commissioners of Public Works.  We cannot readily think of many hospital institutions which are vested in the Commissioners of Public Works.  This may raise staffing difficulties where there are some maintenance men or other personnel employed by the local health board and others employed by the Commissioners of Public <Col N="2213" /> Works.  The probability is that they would have similar conditions of service but there are little variations between local government and central government which could give rise to difficulties.  There will be the strange situation in Dundrum that if repairs and maintenance works require to be done the health board will have to make a requisition to the Commissioners of Public Works to do the work.  Goodness knows the Commissioners have not got an unsullied reputation as far as expedition and efficiency are concerned in maintenance and repair.  It might need a little more speed and expedition than we have been accustomed to on the part of the Commissioners of Public Works.  I feel, therefore, that the ownership and the control of the Central Mental Hospital should now be transferred.  If the administration is to be transferred transfer the whole thing holus-bolus, or have the Commissioners of Public Works some sinister idea that some time in the dim and distant future when we will all be dead the Central Mental Hospital might be used for some other function of the State, be it as a new launching pad for a supersonic missile or for Government offices?  There does not appear to be any necessity for retaining the vested ownership of this in the Commissioners of Public Works. It will give rise to difficulties and it ought be presented to the local health board in order that they may have full control without the unnecessary conflicts which are likely to arise if there is dual responsibility for the institution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy but we were not able to persuade the Minister for Finance and the Commissioners of Public Works to do this.  Under subsection (4) of section 42 the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, arrange for functions relating to the repairing, enlarging, improving, upholding or furnishing of the Central Mental Hospital to be performed by the relevant health board.  I hope to have another go at this when we have a Mental Health Bill introduced here on which a number of matters relating to mental health will be cleared up and there will be improvements in <Col N="2214" /> the legislation.  I cannot say when this Bill will be introduced.  I am afraid that is as far as I can go.  I was not in on the first arrangements made in connection with this.  I cannot satisfy the Deputy in regard to that for the present.</P>

      <P>I am glad that I have lent my voice to the representations made by the Department of Health. May I point out to the Minister that under subsection (4) the local health board will be unable to demolish any part of the existing structure if they want to do so?  While power is given to repair, enlarge, improve, uphold or furnish, power is not being given to demolish any part of it.  They will therefore, have to send to the Board of Works to demolish an outhouse. It might be as well to have that power if the Minister for Finance is still to remain the landlord.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Deputy Ryan and to assure the Minister that we certainly wish to see this residual piece of property handed over by the Commissioners to the Department.  I do not think that the Bill as it is currently framed, with the sort of sideways attempt by the officers of the Minister's Department to try to capture this building from the Office of Public Works, will prove very successful. Certainly in terms of a national Bill relating to the health services there is no good reason why the Commissioners of Public Works should not have long ago agreed to the representations made by the Department of Health in this matter.  We would urge the Minister to impress on the Minister for Finance and the Parliamentary Secretary that in accordance with the Devlin Report this is yet another shedding of necessary responsibility and rationalisation of the Department's functions.  Most certainly this should be under the direct responsibility of the Department of Health.  The Minister could be assured of full support if he agrees to this.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(5) Section 5 (5) of the Health Act, 1947, shall not apply to regulations under this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is another simple drafting amendment. Regulations under the Health Acts will have to be in relation to the provision of standards or the provision of medical cards.  Those standards will have to be brought in the form of resolutions before the Oireachtas. Therefore, it is unnecessary to repeat again the provision in the 1947 Act that such regulations come before the Oireachtas and can be annulled in 21 days if the Oireachtas so desire.  Both procedures are not required.  We propose to bring the resolutions, in regard to those matters, before the Oireachtas for discussion and I hope subsequent approval.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 58 in the name of Deputy Ryan is out of order as it involves a potential charge on State funds.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 43, as amended, stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the amendments tabled by me on behalf of Fine Gael have been ruled out of order because they might constitute a charge on Central Funds is we believe the greatest justification there is for the amendments we sought to make.  We are unable to accept section 43 because that section proposes to retain all the worst elements of our existing health services.  It simply changes the phraseology of the means test but retains the means test in all its harshness, in all its inhumanity, in all its degradation, in all its viciousness, in all the worry, <Col N="2216" /> upset, concern and illness which it engenders.  We sought to provide in the Bill, and we would seek to provide in any health scheme Fine Gael had, an opportunity to ensure everybody would get medical attention according to their requirements without regard to means, that everybody would receive general practitioner, medical, surgical and hospital services when they wanted them without having to pay for them.</P>
      <P>We believe, and we have proved down through the years, that this could be done under the system of national health insurance.  The Government, on the other hand, have argued that hardship is not caused to 70 per cent of our people by medical expenses.  That is what the Government said in their White Paper three years ago and apparently the philosophy still underlining Fianna Fáil's approach to health services is that hardship is not caused to 70 per cent of our people.</P>
      <P>What is undue hardship referred to in the Minister's Bill?  The Minister and his predecessors have given an undertaking that the number of people who will in future enjoy free medical services will not be any greater than the number of people who at present enjoy full entitlement to medical services. Who are the people who now get free medical services?  They are the people, to use the words of Queen Victoria's lawmakers, who are unable by their own industry or other lawful means to provide for their medical requirements. This is the same test which is applied in relation to home assistance or pauper relief.  Now, guaranteeing not to increase the number of people who will enjoy free medical services we put in the phraseology &ldquo;unable without undue hardship to arrange&rdquo; so it is quite clear that the words &ldquo;unable without undue hardship to arrange&rdquo; equate &ldquo;to enable by their own industry or other lawful means to provide&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our third amendment to this section, which sought to give relief by inserting the words &ldquo;people who are unable without difficulty to provide that service&rdquo; was ruled out of order, again, because this small change might lead to a charge on the national Exchequer. At this early stage &ldquo;undue hardship&rdquo;<Col N="2217" /> is interpreted to be more stringent than &ldquo;difficulty&rdquo;.  Again, the section calls for a more severe test than that connoted by the word &ldquo;difficulty&rdquo; before assistance will be given to people in the provision of necessary medical assistance.</P>
    <P>The consequences of the appalling means test which we operate in this country and which is far worse than that which exists in any European country is that people postpone consulting their doctors.  People, having consulted their doctors, do not sometimes purchase any or all of the drugs, medicines or surgical appliances prescribed for them.  It is not everyone who knows, first of all, that they have a right to support for some of those services if they can prove hardship. It is not everybody who knows, even if they have that right, and they have their application rejected, that if they go crawthumping to some politican the odds are 50/50 they will get it on second application.</P>
    <P>It is not everybody who knows that, having been turned down twice, you can come again knocking at the door and adding difficulty on difficulty, adding prescription to prescription and bringing in all the medical expenses of wife and all dependent children, that some assistance can be provided. It is not everybody who knows those things who will subject themselves and their families to the indignity of an inquisition by people whom they may know and, therefore, the inquisition will cause greater embarrassment or by people whom they do not know and whom they feel on that account would be unsympathetic.</P>
    <P>It is very sad indeed that the social thinking of Ireland should be reflected, in the latter half of the 20th century, by a means test which would do credit only to Victorian lawmakers.  We do not speak with contempt of Victorian lawmakers, they had to raise the social sights and the charitable outlook of the people of those days from one of leaving the poor to fend for themselves because God made them poor, into a society which accepted some obligation to those people.  On many occasions that obligation was accepted not <Col N="2218" /> out of a charitable disposition but rather out of the fear of disease or perhaps out of a criticism which we still hear voiced in relation to itinerants, that they were dirty and useless.  This is still our approach to the health services. No matter how humane officers of health authorities may be, no matter how well disposed they may be, they are curtailed by the law; and we feel it is wrong that Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann should again be asked to be parties to what is accepted by all clear-thinking people as being an unjust law.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister is seeking power in this Bill to bring more certainty to entitlement to medical cards. We can see there are advantages in this but it is very important that if regulations are made conferring entitlement, they would not be of such a nature as to exclude certain people.  Such regulations would be of assistance if they could avoid the necessity to make inquiries into the means of people in certain categories, such as social welfare recipients and others in the category of limited means.  We should be anxious to remove as many means tests as we can and we should not require that people who are suffering under a series of means tests from one end of the year to the other should in the case of illness have to undergo new and more exacting tests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Those people will not have to go through a means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The making of these regulations is welcome because it will remove the necessity for having applications processed.  However, regulations have a tendency to be out of date.  It is not known for regulations to have been made on the basis of anticipation of depreciation of money; it is not known for regulations to be made on the basis of hardship which may arise in the future; invariably, regulations are tied to present or past experience.  The real danger, therefore, is that the regulations will be behind time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the very next section of the Bill we find a clear example of lack of sympathy between regulations and actual requirements, because there is a means test for limited eligibility in respect of which the means is <Col N="2219" /> to be less than £1,200 a year.  That is a figure which was considered in 1966 as appropriate, a figure above which people were deemed to be in the middle-class and below which they were entitled to certain benefits.  Since then, the average income of the people has risen and now, for instance, in the building trade the figure would be £1,600.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The £1,200 figure first came in in 1959.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, it is ten years out of date.  In any case, it is accepted by many people now as being not in keeping with their requirements. Indeed, I had a reply to a recent Dáil question which pointed out that almost one-third of the people who were under £1,200 in 1966 are now above it. Yet here we are writing into the Act a figure which is already out of date.  I hope the regulations will have the merit that they will exclude a number of people in a certain category.  It is necessary to have such regulations up-dated more frequently than has been the case in the past.  We do not say this in order to delay any beneficial regulations there may be, but it is right that the House should re-state the social thinking of the people, which is far ahead of the Fianna Fáil Government's. The pity is the Government have not begun to realise that medical costs are becoming a real difficulty, a serious hardship for many people.  Because of this, the only real solution is a national health insurance system with contributions from everybody in the community who has an income.  If that were done we could provide the services people want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People frequently approach me to ask me about such a service.  Workers in the lowest income brackets have asked me to agitate to have a national health service based on insurance in order to do away with all the anxiety, the insecurity and the sense of injustice which the present system imposes. People may feel we are exaggerating the situation.  Quite seriously I do not believe we are.  There have been constant complaints from people.  Some people <Col N="2220" /> cannot get medical cards while others with better means have them.</P>
    <P>While there is a means test that situation will obtain.  It makes for the kind of conflict, the kind of uncertainty, of bewilderment, which leads to a sense of injustice because of the many people who contribute to a health scheme from which they are excluded. We hope and pray the day will soon come when the Government will respond to the social thinking of our people and meet the health needs of our people and adopt the techniques which all other countries in Europe have adopted long ago&mdash;a modern health insurance system.  We are decades out of date.  We are in the sad position, for many reasons, and because of our health services in particular, that we cannot sign the European Social Charter.  Because the European Social Charter requires that medical services be freely available to people, we are unable to sign it.  Other countries in Europe have not done so for a variety of reasons, but no country has been so embarrassed about signing it as Ireland has.  We could not sign it because if we did our hypocrisy would soon be exposed to the rest of Europe and the world.</P>
    <P>Let us, therefore, think again on this &mdash;think hard and fast and arrive at a solution.  I do not think it is sufficient after more than a decade of constant debate on the matter for the Minister to say his Department are having a look at this.  I heard this before: we have all heard it before.  We saw it when a select committee of the Dáil was used by Deputy MacEntee in an effort to impede the progress Fine Gael wanted to achieve nine years ago when there was a proposal before this House to have a national health insurance scheme.  We saw what happened then, as we have seen what has happened every time this has been projected.</P>
    <P>We had the present Minister himself, together with the then Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, saying during the 1965 election that an insurance scheme was objectionable, that it would be a poll-tax.  This poll-tax, of which he spoke with such contempt in Monaghan and elsewhere, is now <Col N="2221" /> apparently so respectable that it is receiving the consideration of his Department. How sad it is that it has taken so long, that so many people have continued to suffer, and that we have fallen behind the other countries in Europe and modern States in the world in the introduction of an adequate health insurance service.  This is what our people want and are prepared to pay for.  It is the only kind of scheme which will give us the type of health service which does not impose great hardship on people, prolonging illness and indeed even causing illness and certainly perpetuating a sense of injustice such as that under which our people are labouring at the present time.</P>

      <P>However you will find them as between counties at the moment.  This section removes this. It gives an element of certainty, which I think Deputy Ryan admitted.  The section ensures the removal of certain people from the application of a means test and therefore lessens what one might call an inquisition.  We have inquisitions in every walk of life where people are getting something.  We have inquisitions about income tax and so forth, but inquisitions from a Health Act viewpoint will be considerably lessened by this section.  First of all, we will remove the anomalies, straighten out things between county and county; we will define certain classes who are entitled to medical cards and thereby lessen the area where people will feel they are being investigated excessively. To my mind, that is an important thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may make regulations and put them before the House.  We <Col N="2222" /> may be behind in the value of money and so on, but it is up to the Dáil to remind the Minister when he is laying regulations before the House that they are outdated if that is the case.  For the first time eligibility is clearly laid down in a Health Act and I commend this section in full to the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by regulation specify a class or classes of person who shall be deemed to be within the categories mentioned in subsection (1). By so doing we remove a large class of people and put them into this free category. I should like the Minister to tell us how many people in Ireland are getting completely free medical services, and how many people under the £1,200 bracket&mdash;which I admit could and should be lifted&mdash;are getting free hospital and medical treatment.  I am sure the Minister will let us have those facts. I commend all of this section to the House; it is high time we had something on these lines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to comment on the reservations expressed by Deputy Ryan.  Admittedly, the Minister is encouraging a more sane public attitude in terms of the definition relating to eligibility.  Nevertheless, he is ignoring the nub of the problem, namely, that the present and successive Governments have failed abjectly and miserably to develop a comprehensive national health service based on contributions, particularly on a graduated wage-related contributory system for all wage and salary earners in the country and indeed a system whereby the self-employed and the farming community would make appropriate contributions for elementary general rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many people who will argue&mdash;and the argument has a great deal of validity&mdash;that there should be some selectivity internally in general services.  However, those who argue so vehemently for the principle of selectivity should equally place the same emphasis, they should put the same spotlight of passion, the same spotlight of public notoriety, on the need to make our services as universal as possible. This is a fundamentally disturbing feature in terms of the reaction of <Col N="2223" /> those engaged in administering the health services and those engaged in formulating health policy in this country. They have become so obsessed with the administration and the various methods of selectivity that they have failed abjectly to broaden their vision and to give us as good a national health service as possible.</P>
    <P>No matter how much we may read of criticism of, for example, the British National Health Service, the adoption of this service was one of the greatest unifying features, one of the greatest built-in national tolerances any country could have had.  We in Ireland have failed to interpret and implement the tremendous social vision of the Beveridge Report which advocated universality of the national services of a social kind.  We tinkered around with developing our health services and we thereby stand indicted.  It is all very well to say that people have got certain rights under the health services and, based on income eligibility, that they can avail of these rights.</P>
    <P>I suggest they cannot be called rights unless people know these rights exist. A large number are ignorant and unaware of their rights in many areas because of the peculiar methods of administration of our health services. They get into a situation in which they cannot assess in any precise degree their entitlement to general health services. Whatever may be argued in favour of selectivity there are still very real and obvious defects in the means test system as it operates.  These should be the subject of continuous public discussion. They have not got attention to the extent they deserve.  Once the principle of the means test is embedded and enshrined in the health services as we now have them, there will be continuous frustration, inevitably, and many people will believe they are being discriminated against on a general selective basis.  I think it is the general attitude on the part of many people that they are being denied service on the basis of income discrimination, on completion of forms, on giving to the health services officers their income figure as best they can, and that in one way or another the great defect of the <Col N="2224" /> means test is the social frustration that people have in believing they are discriminated against.</P>
    <P>But there is an even more serious objection to the services on the selective means test basis and it is the widespread conviction that public services are allegedly inferior to private services. People believe, and the Government have done little to counter this belief, that public services on a means test selectivity basis are inevitably inferior to private practice, where they believe, because they pay personally, they will get better service.  This causes serious concern in this House and it is something to which we should address ourselves in public discussion.</P>
    <P>There is also a universal belief that inevitably a large number of people will be disqualified for political reasons or social reasons or reasons not readily apparent to them.  It is quite wrong that there should repose in the administrative offices throughout the country definitions of eligibility and of assessment of eligibility and the various criteria of income, of illness and family circumstance on what I suggest is an <i>ad hoc</i> basis while people seem to be unable to obtain a precise definition of general eligibility and general qualification for these services.  That is a very common complaint and as a result there is a good deal of social frustration which the Government have done very little to offset.</P>
    <P>The Minister should, therefore, particularly in this section of the Bill, spell out unambiguously his future intentions on the general question of eligibility and give the House some assurance that within the next four years, at least in the lifetime of this Dáil, a massive effort will be made and, if necessary, a transformation of the whole basis of the health services, to ensure that we shall not have such excessive dependance on selectivity as we now have. Admittedly&mdash;and I should be the last to suggest otherwise&mdash;services must be paid for in the form of contributions and taxation by the community.  I am not suggesting a general free-for-all as many Government spokesmen seem to suggest when we make our criticisms but I am saying that it is not all right <Col N="2225" /> to rationalise the whole health structure while, in fact, there is a very serious imbalance internally, in terms of bringing about a more humane and more acceptable political health-social security system based on employee contributions which I have no doubt would be, in many instances, quite large if implemented but which, nevertheless, would be generally welcome.  That kind of fundamental prerequisite, as I would call it, for the growth of a more civilised community in Ireland, namely, the introduction of a national health service based on insurance contributions and rights deriving from social insurance, would elevate our self-respect and our respect for the rights of others.  It would make Ireland a more compassionate society and, above all, it would temper a good deal of the political attitudes in relation to health services.</P>
    <P>I am appalled that there should be such an excessive dependence built up and fostered by the political system of people having to approach public representatives to the extent they do in order to obtain benefits which they are allegedly entitled to under the general health services.  My experience, limited as it is, has confirmed the general national belief that by means of a politician going to the health authority and making some special pleading on behalf of somebody or by means of a Minister or his private secretary being induced to write to a health authority or by getting a Member of the House to badger a public servant, some extra special consideration will be given to a case which it would not normally get. This almost universal belief is fostered by many politicians themselves quite wrongly in the sense that we are debasing the health services if that necessity arises.</P>
    <P>These are my criticisms.  I am urging, in effect, greater universality of our health services.  I am pointing out sharply to the Minister that there are serious public criticisms of the means test as currently operated in the health services.  I say, unequivocably, that I want to exempt from blame in many areas the public officers and officials who have to implement a totally imperfect system of selectivity.  In all these instances there is, perhaps, excessive <Col N="2226" /> dependence on income as a means of determining eligibility.  There are many other aspects in regard to eligibility that should be taken into account. Reliance on a certificate of income which has been virtually the signal for the issue or giving of health benefits, is far too narrow and inadequate as a general way of making assessments. These are the criticisms which I would make and, now that we have had the 25th anniversary of the Beveridge Report, I hope that in the next five years, within the lifetime of this Dáil, a public universal health service system will be introduced which will be costly on all concerned in terms of eligibility, and that the Minister, with the Cabinet, will come to grips with the problem of bringing in as wide as possible a net of contributors.  I do not want to see that net confined in any way to wage and salary earners.  There is a large body of the self-employed whose eligibility is very difficult to assess generally, and there is a large body of persons engaged in agriculture. Admittedly, there are administrative difficulties in getting contributions from them and bringing them into the general net of a comprehensive national scheme.  These are not insurmountable difficulties.  If, in our lifetime, we can see a man going to the moon on a computerised basis and returning safely in the best of health, the exercise of getting somebody who is ill into a hospital, or the exercise of administering a drug to someone else, in an age of technology and computerisation, should be well within our capacity.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would make these criticisms and urge the Minister that when he is replying he should not launch into what I might call a Fianna Fáil diatribe, from which I exempt the Minister: &ldquo;We all want a free health service, blah, blah, blah&rdquo;, and off we go on a merry-go-round of a political nature.  I certainly welcome the comments made by and the participation of Deputy P.J. Lenihan whom I also exempt from my strictures.  I have no doubt that the Minister will make a serious attempt to expand the health services on a national basis.  This is very much overdue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Deputy who <Col N="2227" /> has spoken on this subject many times in this House, I should like to welcome the contribution I have just heard from Deputy Desmond.  I hope I did not misunderstand him, but I think he repeated on a number of occasions his agreement with the idea of a national health scheme based on insurance. This, indeed, is a welcome expression of view.  I should like to state for the record, if not for the benefit of Deputies who have been here through the years, that the Fine Gael Party were the only party to develop and consistently advocate a national insurance scheme based on graduated contributions.</P>
      <P>We suggested that scheme as a solution for the difficulties then apparent in the administration of our health services ten years ago.  Subsequently, when the select committee on the health services was established we went into that committee to advocate this idea and this scheme.  We pointed out that, as long as our health services were based on the old public assistance approach, we were not measuring up to our obligations as a Christian community. Unfortunately, our views found bitter and, I regret to say, absolutely intractable opposition on that committee from the then Minister for Health.  It is worth recalling that, while that committee was still in session, set up as it was to consider the feasibility, amongst other things, of the introduction of a health insurance scheme, the then Taoiseach came into this House &mdash;the committee was sitting in one of the rooms in this House&mdash;and announced that the Government had decided against such a change in the health services, because it would involve&mdash;and this is where the phrase came from&mdash; a poll-tax on every person in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee broke up because their decision was pre-empted by the leader of the Government but, before they broke up, I had submitted on behalf of my party&mdash;I was the person responsible at that time&mdash;a detailed scheme for the medical services based on graduated insurance payments.  At that stage we were dealing only with the general medical service.  In the last Dáil we <Col N="2228" /> tabled a motion to advocate our point of view again.  I regret to say that, at that time, the attitude of the Labour Party left much to be desired because they expressed opposition to an insurance scheme.  They agreed with us that the scheme should be comprehensive, but they wanted it to be financed entirely by the State.  They did not find that they could agree with our point of view.  Therefore, it is a matter for comment and, I think, congratulation that now in this Dáil, Deputy Desmond, obviously speaking on behalf of the Labour Party, can express in such a clear and succinct manner his agreement with the point of view that we have advocated so consistently and for such a long time.</P>
    <P>It is now becoming more and more apparent that, if we are to grow up in relation to the provision of adequate health services, we must accept that the approach can be only on the basis of social insurance.  We have tried the other way for far too long.  We have tried to have a scheme based on cold public charity with the built-in ingredients of means tests of one kind or another.  That scheme has not provided the kind of service the people want. Up to this&mdash;and, indeed, regrettably continued in this Bill&mdash;we had the taxpayer married to the ratepayer in order to finance a limited service for a section of the community.  This has led to a variety of standards, depending on the exigencies of the rates in different parts of the country.  It has meant that, generally speaking, there has been a consistent criticism of the kind of services our people were getting.  Whether that criticism was well-founded or not, it has persisted and continued.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is&mdash;this I regret to have to say but I am going to say it&mdash;that successive Fianna Fáil Governments have been guilty of the gravest deception in relation to this entire problem of the health services. In the general election prior to the passing of the Health Act, 1953, the Fianna Fáil Party went out with posters asking for votes with the slogan: &ldquo;Should health depend on wealth?&rdquo; In that there was an implied promise that if they got back there would be a <Col N="2229" /> new approach to health which would disregard a person's means.  The result was the Health Act of 1953.  In relation to eligibility for general medical services, for all the other services which our people required, that Act laid down as a test that a person had to be unable by his own industry or other lawful means to provide these services for himself.</P>
    <P>These words were taken without change, without altering a comma, from the public assistance code, words which were borrowed from the last century, from the time when in the height of the famine the purse-proud imperial Parliament was forced to do something for the starving, sick people of Ireland.  That was Fianna Fáil legislation in 1953, and it was that class of person only who were regarded as requiring the attention of our Government and of our organised community here.  That was an appalling bit of legislation; it was retrograde and it was wrong.</P>
    <P>Although my party had opposed the passing of that Health Bill as it then was&mdash;we had opposed it from these benches and had advocated then the insurance approach&mdash;I found myself as Minister for Health with the obligation of bringing that Act into operation, and I made a pledge to this House, which I am glad to say I honoured, that before I left office I would have that Act fully in operation.  I am glad to say that that was done, but it did not mean that I in any way subscribed to the mentality behind the Health Act of 1953, and I made that perfectly clear.</P>
    <P>My view the whole time was that we had to move away from what Deputy Desmond correctly called this approach of selectivity, that we had to accept that we as an organised community had a responsibility comprehensively to provide against the exigencies, the hazards, of ill-health for all our people and that we had to do that within our own resources and in the best way available to us.  My personal judgment at that time, and I think the view is shared now by many others, was that the approach should be on the basis of social insurance.</P>
    <P>Here today in this Bill in 1969, the <Col N="2230" /> year in which we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the first Dáil of 1919, we are legislating again&mdash;using other words but use what words you like&mdash; for the same kind of parsimonious approach to the problem of health in our community as the imperial Parliament did over 100 years ago: &ldquo;Full eligibility will be provided for adult persons unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants&rdquo;&mdash;new words but the same approach.  Those words replace the words &ldquo;persons who are unable by their own industry or other lawful means to provide for themselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Where are we going in this country? Twenty-five years ago in part of Ireland it was accepted as the concern of a community that there should be available a comprehensive system of medical services for the people living in that part of Ireland.  Twenty-five years ago the British health scheme went into operation in the Six Counties of Northern Ireland.  We are now in a session of the Dáil in which each one of us talked sincerely of how best we could achieve a situation in which all people living on this island would accept common responsibility for the future of this island, a situation which all of us agreed could only come about by the wholehearted agreement of a majority of the people living in the North of Ireland.  Here we are, in our first measure of social services since the debate on the Northern Ireland situation five or six weeks ago, saying that in the Republic we do not share any universal concern for the ill-health, the difficulties, of the general population.</P>
    <P>Who can regard us as being serious about providing an invitation, genuinely and honourably, to those living in the Six Counties of Northern Ireland to join us if we still approach this problem wearing this kind of blinkers, refusing to see anything except the need that so clearly exists among those who can wear their tattered garments and demonstrate without fear of contradiction that they have no means or have to face undue hardship?  Here is another example of the kind of political <Col N="2231" /> deception that many of us have criticised for so long, a promise made of a great leap forward, whereas it is merely a play upon words.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Ryan said, if we want to forget about the North of Ireland, where are we in relation to the rest of Europe?  It is well to recall that there is no country in western Europe today, except the Republic of Ireland, which does not recognise its responsibilities to provide a comprehensive medical service for all its citizens.  We do not appear to be concerned about this. That, perhaps, is an exaggeration.  The majority party do not appear to be concerned about it.  They are apparently happy with a promise of change in new health legislation, but in so far as providing for the ordinary people dealing with this social problem, nothing emanates from them.</P>
    <P>The Minister said yesterday that they were considering some form of health insurance scheme for people outside section 43.  That is marvellous, but what does the Minister mean by it? Does this mean that this kind of throw-away line is going to be a ration for the people to exist on in hope for the next couple of years?  I understand that it was the view of the Government that a contributory insurance scheme was out&mdash;that it could not be done, and as a result we had this bit of legislation. Apparently the penny has dropped and we are now going to have consideration of a contributory insurance scheme for some undefined section of the community. I do not believe the Government have given any serious consideration over the last 15 years, as to what is the proper approach to social problems in this country and in particular in relation to health.</P>
    <P>Alone in Europe we continue to do what ceased to be appropriate in all European countries at the end of the last war.  We are the only country in Europe affiliated to the Council of Europe unable to sign the European Social Charter.  We cannot sign it, because we cannot subscribe to the aims and ideas of a comprehensive medical service for our citizens which all other countries regard as minimum. <Col N="2232" /> I regret to say the reason we cannot do it is because we have a Fianna Fáil Government back in office.  The reason that the Government cannot do it is that they are not sufficiently big enough to recognise that they made a profound social mistake when they refused some years ago to accept Fine Gael policy on this issue.  Had they been big enough to recognise that we were right and they were wrong substantial progress could have been made.  That was not done. We had a series of operations in which heels were dug in and positions were adopted, decisions were made and announced and all this was precursor to the 1969 Health Bill.  This Bill, in the end result, means that nothing much has changed.  A new shop front has been put up but the goods being sold in the shop are still the same. There is a 50/50 approach to financing the health service, there is the marriage of the ratepayer to the taxpayer and the selection of those entitled to benefit on the basis of their lack of means. It is the same old thing wrapped up in new words, but so far as progress is concerned there is none whatsoever.</P>
    <P>I think it is a tragedy at a time when we should be planning and contriving, within our means, to raise social standards in an effort to make this country more attractive to our countrymen living in the North of Ireland that we have in office a party which has been so long there that it is incapable of new thinking on problems of this kind.  It is a pity that the unfortunate people should be given a tawdry measure of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be said that we have heard Deputy O'Higgins' argument before.  I want to draw his attention to the fact, since he saw fit to go back, that he could have gone back to the year 1951 when there was final disagreement in the Fine Gael Party on the question of health.  I should also say here that, if it were not for the 1947 and the 1953 Health Acts, we would not have the basis we have today for broadening the system.  It is all very well for Deputy Desmond to come in here and make what is tantamount to a Second Reading windy speech, speaking in clichés for two-thirds of the time.  Deputy O'Higgins <Col N="2233" /> saw fit to follow him.  Deputy O'Higgins is a man of some experience.  He knows a good deal about health, in fact he is an ex-Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw his attention to the fact that none of us likes means tests.  We do not like the means test in income tax and we resent it in the social welfare system.  It is very easy when a Deputy and his party are not carrying the responsibility for providing the wherewithal for the health services to find fault and to castigate the Minister and the Government on the question of means tests.  I do not defend the means test except in the context that a Government are responsible for taxation and for trying to re-distribute the national income.  The Government of the day are bound to see to it that no section of the community will be penalised and, in so far as it lies within their power, that all sections will have a fair chance, either in relation to taxation or in relation to the social services.</P>
      <P>I did not intend, on section 43 and this question of eligibility, to refer to these matters.  I thought Deputy O'Higgins had been disabused of the notion that he could formulate an insurance plan which would provide for the extension of the health services visualised under this Bill.  I had thought that he was even disabused of that idea when he was a member of the Select Committee on the Health Services prior to the 1965 general election.  I want to say that it was not Deputy O'Higgins's abhorrence of the means test or, indeed, his abhorrence of the system then working which caused the representatives of the Fine Gael Party to withdraw from that committee; it was the fact that we were about to embark on the 1965 general election.</P>

      <P>The Deputy need not be surprised.  I am making the point that it was not so much the quality or the scope of the then health services, which we are discussing now, which caused the withdrawal of the Deputy's representatives from the committee so much as the fact that we were facing the 1965 general election and he hoped to have some ammunition in order to ambush us in that campaign, and ambush us he did, and he has ambushed us since on a spurious issue. No matter what Deputy O'Higgins may have felt about the Beveridge plan or what Deputy Desmond, who has gone out of the House, may have felt about it, I read recently a statement made by Lord Beveridge when he was approaching the end of his life and he had quite a different approach to this whole matter.  The matter quoted by the Deputies opposite related to the time when he was starting out as an enthusiast and an idealist with his scheme.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins's argument that in present circumstances a health scheme could be mounted, extended, improved, made applicable to everybody by his policy of insurance would, on examination, fall to the ground.  When we were in committee long ago and when we went into his thesis or plan in detail we found not merely holes in it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed the Deputy's memorandum and we found <Col N="2235" /> holes in it, great gaps in fact.  All of us know that the insurable population would not be able to carry the burden of the stamp contribution indicated by Deputy O'Higgins.  Even if we had twice the insurable population that we have they would not be able to pay the contribution which the Government would have to seek.  Over and above this, when Deputy O'Higgins talks about his insurance scheme and when Deputy Desmond suggests that you could collect what the former Minister described as a poll tax&mdash;he was right in so describing it&mdash; from those not insured, I want to put it to the House that we must be realistic. As a party supporting the Government, we realise the Government must provide the money.  Despite Deputy O'Higgins's statement that we have a very bad health system, we know very well that the cost of the health services has increased steeply in the last ten years and we realise that £51 million, £52 million or £53 million is a fairly large sum of money which it is not easy to raise in a small country such as ours.</P>
      <P>I would also direct the Deputy's attention to the fact that there is an excellent voluntary health insurance scheme available to everybody here. The naked fact is that there are fewer than 350,000 people participating in that scheme.  I should like to see a survey carried out to discover if the existing voluntary health insurance scheme would not provide a better scheme than could be mounted by the State by a system of what we loosely call insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to dwell too long on this subject.  A great deal has been said about this mythical insurance scheme. We have heard about this nebulous group of people who might be induced into an insurable plan.  What I am wondering is why these people cannot be induced into the existing voluntary health insurance scheme.  I have nothing against the Deputy's ideas.  In fact, I would quite like to see an insurance scheme if I thought we were capable of producing a scheme which would be both fair and equitable and which <Col N="2236" /> would attract a sufficient number to support even some small part of our present health services.  I am not a betting man but I am prepared to wager that, if a gallup poll were carried out to find out to what extent an insurance scheme would support our present health services, we would find that it would not even cover the 30 per cent who qualify for full eligibility.  The financial implications have never been worked out.</P>

      <P>It has been said that we are the only European country with a depressed health scheme.  I would contest that.  I remember speaking to some doctors who have worked not merely in Europe but in Canada, New Zealand and Australia and they assured me that our health services in scope and efficiency were on a par with the services in any other country. It is a bad thing that we should always start to overstate the drawbacks and to perpetually run down our own system.  Those who do this should bear in mind that doctors returning here to set up practice find the position far from unsatisfactory.  If those who adversely criticise the system were to talk to these men they would be quickly <Col N="2237" /> disabused of the idea that we have a poor health service or a Victorian health service.  The Vote for health speaks for itself.</P>
      <P>Capital expenditure on hospitals in relation to our total national income will bear comparison with expenditure elsewhere.  It is all very well to argue that we can raise ourselves up overnight by our bootstraps and abolish the means test, as Deputy Desmond argued.  I should love to see the means test abolished, not alone in regard to health but also in regard to social welfare and income tax.  We must be realistic in our approach.  We have to have these means tests so that there will be equity of distribution in the community. We do not subscribe to the views that a means test inevitably downgrades those to whom it is applied.  The fact is that we have to approach matters like this from a realistic point of view.</P>
      <P>The scheme visualised here is a progressive scheme.  It has been both praised and criticised.  I agree with a great deal of what Deputy Dr. Browne said about the hospital system and the hospital boards.  If we cannot have the whole cake then we must settle for a slice of it.  The successful operation of the proposed system will depend in the main on the plan mounted to work it and on how people co-operate.  This is not the first time we have had a provision with regard to eligibility.  There are similar provisions in regard to social welfare.  Social welfare is working quite well.  If this scheme works well we will make progress.  We are not, perhaps, going forward as quickly as some of us would like, but we are advancing.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate on the health scheme is an interminable one.  It is at least 20 years old.  It goes on and on and on.  We have made such little progress that it is really very disheartening. We are not even back to what the Minister described last night as the halcyon days of the 1947 Health Act. We have gone back further.  In this particular section we have gone back to 1913, back to Lloyd George, back to the British House of Commons and the dreadful pauper laws.  This awful phrase &ldquo;without undue hardship&rdquo; is all part of a pattern and those of us <Col N="2238" /> who have watched the whole process over a long time are not very surprised.</P>
      <P>The party that have now introduced this Bill have a great record behind them of social legislation.  They were responsible for introducing many pension schemes; they were responsible for introducing children's allowances and wet-time insurance schemes and they were responsible for slum clearance. They have much to their credit but I suppose it is inevitable that a change took place with the change in leadership. This change probably started in 1959 and has gone on continuously since that time.  It is represented very clearly in the change in fiscal policy. The early party did want to change society.  It was a radical party which believed that the ordinary worker in the community needed to be uplifted in relation to education, health services and old age.</P>
      <P>However, we now see the gradual progressive change whereby the party have gone away from that attitude and we now find that what they are really doing is robbing the poor to pay for the very poor while leaving the wealthy practically untouched.  The insurance principle, as mentioned by Deputy O'Higgins, is simply a form of benevolent capitalism.  It is recognised that changes must be made.  There are pressures from the electorate as education improves even minimally but the pressures are such that certain concessions have to be made to the demands of the public for parity with what they see all around them, with what they see when they go to Britain or abroad, with what they see when they go to New Zealand &mdash;Deputy Carter is not correct in what he says but I will deal with that later&mdash; but in these other countries our people see that communities have so organised themselves so as not to have to divide themselves into two-tier classes epitomised in this type of health legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe Deputy Carter to be a sincere and genuine Deputy.  I listened to him for a long time.  He is sincere when he says that he would like to see an end to the means test but he will not see it in this piece of legislation.  People like Deputy Carter must face the dilemma which faces all of us and that is if we are to change society in a radical and <Col N="2239" /> fundamental way we must first see the end of the stigma of this class type of social legislation as is in this health Bill.  We must accept that there will have to be radical and fundamental changes in our whole economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>It has been said that economics are the source of our enslavement or our redemption.  I believe that to be broadly true.  Living in this isolated island in the west, we tend to give the impression that we are blazing a trail and that we are going somewhere that nobody has ever been to before, that we are introducing new ideas but that these ideas are rather dangerous, that we must take our time about them and tread gently before putting them to the test.</P>
    <P>There are many communities in which the contributory schemes suggested by Deputy O'Higgins have been introduced successfully.  As I said last night even the voluntary health insurance scheme, which I disagree with, is a defective scheme but basically it is a contributory scheme of a kind.  However, in my view, the services given are much too limited.  We have contributory schemes here in relation to old age pensions and the national health insurance contributory scheme.  There is no difficulty about bringing in contributory schemes.</P>
    <P>My objection is that we are not going to effectively redistribute real wealth.  There are a number of very wealthy people in our community and I want to see a good proportion of the money which these people have taken from them and redistributed among the people, the ordinary worker, the middle-income white collar workers and so on.  The contributory or benevolent capitalism schemes are devised to prevent this happening but I have never made a secret of the fact that as an interim scheme&mdash;a scheme based on general taxation&mdash;I should like to see a scheme such as that suggested by Deputy O'Higgins.  It would be an improvement on this old Lloyd George type scheme which is 40 or 50 years old.</P>
    <P>The complaint is made that we cannot afford the type of scheme that I <Col N="2240" /> would like&mdash;a scheme whereby the person who has the most wealth pays in order to help the person who has a lesser amount of wealth and where there would be a general redistribution of the great wealth that exists within our society.  I am not sure whether to agree or disagree with that because we note from the records that a free scheme was proposed 20 years ago.  I shall not go into that very bitter business that ended in such an unhappy way except to make the point that at the time I was being hunted by one very conservative Minister for Health who had also been Minister for Finance, Mr. MacEntee, who, in his day, was a very radical politician but later became a conservative but who, at that time, still held his radical views.  I recall being hunted by Mr. MacEntee and being told that there was plenty of money for this scheme&mdash;a scheme that would have provided a free no-means health service for mothers and for children up to the age of 16.  It was a magnificent piece of legislation.  Many times I have praised that piece of legislation&mdash; Fianna Fáil, Deputy MacEntee legislation. It used to embarrass him very much when I used to remind him of his good old radical days.  But that ex-Minister at that time used to press me&mdash;and I was delighted to be pushed. I got credit for that piece of legislation but it was not mine at all.  It was Deputy MacEntee's and the Fianna Fáil Party's, but I would readily take credit for it because it was a fine piece of legislation.  He continually pushed me: &ldquo;Why do you not&mdash;?&rdquo; and so on, and &ldquo;You will get support from us&rdquo;. I went ahead and got support financially; we are talking about the cost. I got support from the then, again very conservative, Fine Gael Minister for Finance who said, in effect: &ldquo;Yes, we can afford it; we have got the money&rdquo;, and so on, and then the other business intervened.  I am speaking purely from the financial point of view; there was then no difficulty.</P>
    <P>What Deputy Carter has got to try to work out for himself, what Deputy O'Higgins has got to try to work out for himself is the question: &ldquo;What has happened to the economy in that 20 <Col N="2241" /> years?&rdquo; Why is it that he feels we can afford only a contributory scheme and that Deputy Carter feels we can afford only this even worse proposal which is envisaged in this section here in this Bill?  It is no good coming in here, year after year, and saying: &ldquo;God help us, we are a poor country and we cannot afford it&rdquo;, and so on.  We are a poor country because we do not set about creating the wealth in order to provide for the service.  We continue to seek and to find refuge behind this whine, this complaint, whatever you like to call it, that we cannot afford it. Yet we take no steps to try to see that we can so reorganise our fiscal or our economic policies that we can then put ourselves into a position in which the money will be there.</P>
    <P>In the half-century we have got rid of the raw materials of wealth as a result of our various policies.  Land, it is under-used or abused.  Labour, we export it&mdash;one million&mdash;and that goes on continually.  We have 8 per cent unemployed.  Capital also is exported. I would appeal to a person such as Deputy Carter, for whom I have a high regard, to use his good offices within the Fianna Fáil Party first of all to remind them that there was a time, 20 years ago, when the economy was very much&mdash;we are given to believe&mdash; more underdeveloped than it is at present.  Remember, under the Whiz Kids&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, we are now on Committee Stage.  This has all been argued on Second Stage. Perhaps Deputies who oppose the methods, eligibility, in the Bill would suggest a specific remedy without going into the economics of the country and how money is to be raised.  Surely it would be better at this stage if we got to the actual alternative forms of raising the money, without referring back again to the national economy of the country?  It would mean that, if I were to reply to these matters, I might have to take one and a half hours&mdash;and we would never get the Health Bill through.  I do not want to deal with national economic issues but simply with the system in the Bill as it is at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to reply, as intelligibly as I can, to the case made that we must have this kind of poor law medicine because we cannot afford anything better.  I am trying to make the case that that answer is not good enough; that there is another answer. I am trying to supply that other answer. It is that if we continue with the right wing private enterprise, conservative, capitalist-type policies we have pursued &mdash;certainly for the past ten or 15 years and, generally speaking, in the past half-century&mdash;then this kind of legislation will go on and on and on and we shall never be able to reach to the ideal which we once had that we should treat everyone equally.</P>
      <P>In my approach to this business of means tests, I am not being doctrinaire in regard to them all.  Deputy Carter also talked about the means test in income tax.  That point has been made. I should like to put this to him.  Of course, we do not like the means test in our income tax but there is this great difference between a means test in an income tax form and a means test in a medical health scheme.  What it has led to in, say, the dispensary service&mdash;and that is all this is: a continuation of the dispensary service&mdash;is the creation of a two-tiered health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a doctor is given a bloc grant for the care of a group then, human nature being what it is, we can gauge what will happen.  There are many fine dispensary doctors who work very hard and who do exactly what they are paid to do.  However, human nature being what it is, there is an understandable tendency on the part of the doctor to act in a certain way.  If he is a good doctor, he will have big demands on him.  There are demands on him by the private fee-paying patient.  If the fee-paying patient comes along to him and says: &ldquo;I am ill&rdquo;, why should he not treat him?  He must treat him.  For that reason, the better the doctor the more demands there will be on his time by the fee-paying patient.  Naturally, the more time he gives to the private patient, the less time he has <Col N="2243" /> for the patient who no matter how often he sees him he gets the same amount of money.  There is that difference in the means test.  That is my objection to the means test.  It is not a doctrinaire objection.  It is an objection based on the fact that I think it leads to the creation of a two-quality service&mdash;a good service and a less good service.  In relation to health, above everything else, you simply cannot afford to have that situation in any kind of illness and particularly in serious illness.  You cannot really morally stand over, in my view, the concept that there is one quality of service for the wealthy and another quality for the less wealthy and for the poor. That is my objection to the means test.</P>
    <P>I defy anybody to contradict my general thesis that the dispensary service is a less good service, is a second-class service, is a second quality service. I doubt if anybody would bother to contest that view.  Therefore, that is one main objection.  The other, I remember talking about away back to the British Labour Party people&mdash; Bevin, and so on&mdash;when they were putting their own through.  They had an ideological objection to it.  But they also had the objection to this means test principle that it was a damned nuisance administratively&mdash;and of course it is.  As with even my colleague, Deputy Desmond, I would consider the graded system would also lead to the means test principle but it need not necessarily lead to the two-quality system in so far as there would not be anybody outside the scheme.  If everybody was within a scheme, then it is possible to introduce practically any kind of permutation of health scheme. The important factor in having a means test in a health scheme is (1) administrative and (2) that you tend to have this two-tier quality health scheme.  The Government have certainly got an amazing mileage out of this whole question of the health services.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Higgins pointed out, a number of elections have been fought on it since 1951.  We had the absurd Select Committee.  There was no necessity for that at all because we all know <Col N="2244" /> quite well that we had the precedent of the excellent free, no-means test health services of the fever hospitals, the infectious diseases services, the tuberculosis services and at that time the mental hospital services.  From the medical point of view we knew that they worked and from the administrative point of view we knew that they were simple to work.  Therefore, the Select Committee was a face saving, time wasting, completely unnecessary exercise in public relations.  The idea was to create the impression that we were seeking for the most ideal form of health service.  That of course was not true.  At a very early stage I resigned from that committee because I felt they were only making fools of us by keeping us month after month doing little or nothing.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to delay the House unduly on this because people know my views on health services over a very long time.  I consider that this is the same sort of thing as the change in fiscal policy, the introduction of all the different kinds of direct and indirect taxation, the contributory scheme for old age, the contributory scheme for national health.  Each of these things marks a step in the departure of the Fianna Fáil Party from the early radicalism which won for them, quite rightly, the mass support which they had in the country and which they are gradually but quite definitely losing as time goes on.  I am genuinely puzzled to know why Deputy O'Higgins, when he was Minister, did not introduce a serious contributory scheme rather than the emasculated voluntary health insurance scheme which has so many defects.  I shall go into that again, it would probably be relevant anyway.</P>

      <P>All right.  If that is the answer, fair enough.  We cannot lift ourselves up by our boot strings overnight. Deputy Carter knows quite well <Col N="2245" /> that Fianna Fáil came into office in 1932 and have been in office on and off, but mostly on, since then.  That is not overnight and Deputy Carter knows that quite well.  If they really were concerned with the health of the community, if they really wanted to bring in a proper health service they know precisely the kind of health service that should be brought in.  They were responsible for the magnificent Infectious Diseases Act, the tuberculosis scheme, the mother and infant scheme.  They know quite well what should be brought in.  This is a radical departure from a fine record but that record is a very old one now.  This is part of the pattern of the deterioration, the slipping into decay of a once fine radical party.  It is epitomised in this poor law section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister for Health claims that this section is any advance or improvement on the present legislation.  I consider that it represents practically no improvement.  There is one slight feature which I will refer to later on which I do regard as an improvement, at least it gives the Minister scope to do something that could be worthwhile. I feel that where before we had the lower income group and the middle income group we are now just saying &ldquo;full eligibility&rdquo; and &ldquo;limited eligibility&rdquo;. We are still providing services on the basis of a means test.  For that reason we find it completely unacceptable and objectionable.  Our reasons for this have been comprehensively stated and restated both by Deputy Ryan and Deputy O'Higgins.  I shall not cover this ground again.  If the Minister insists that we have this section we will have it.  From what he has said on previous sections I fear he has no intention of departing from it.  I am extremely doubtful whether it will be an improvement to standardise and specify by a known yardstick what makes a person eligible and what makes a person ineligible.  Many people are positive that if the Minister says: &ldquo;If a person qualifies for all these reasons then he is eligible&rdquo; that that is a good system.  We thought the same thing in Dublin County Council about the allocation of houses.  We had <Col N="2246" /> our own ways and means of allocating houses but now we have a points system and everything is specified and nothing left to anybody's discretion. After working with this system for a long time and after submitting this scheme to the Minister for Local Government, who agreed with it, we find that it is coming up wrong in many instances.  Many people who should be getting houses are being deprived of them because the points system is just not fitting the particular circumstances of individual cases.  I greatly fear that we will have the same thing here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the discretionary clause.  That was already there. I remember when the Dublin Health Authority started eligibility for the GMS card was not operated nearly as well as it is now.  A team of experienced people is built up and they learn that there is a human aspect to this and they can deal with individual cases as they meet them.  The system works much better when the point is reached where an organisation is working well and has experienced people administering it.  They have a far better opportunity of implementing this is a human way than any Minister can do in the distance by specifying that this, this and this makes one eligible.  One must look at individual cases.  I have no doubt that it would be an improvement if the Minister specified, for instance, that old age pensioners and a number of other classes were automatically eligible and that it was only a waste of time investigating their cases, but apart from that one should go out and see the particular case because there are a whole lot of circumstances that cannot be described on paper but can be seen by an experienced eye and by a person who is good and tactful at the job.  It is a human problem and can only be approached in that way.  I have considerable doubt whether a mixture of two systems would not work much better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody has ever given me a figure for the cost of administering a means test but it must be enormous.  We have a system here where there are two, three or four investigations to see <Col N="2247" /> whether people qualify for various social services.  This is something which has never really been straightened out. I really got up to say that the Minister in this section has power, for instance where there are children with certain permanent and long-term ailments, to be specified by him, to give help regardless of whether their parents are eligible or not.  This gives the Minister an opportunity to do something which I have been trying to get done since I came into this House.  We have the deplorable case of a family with a mentally retarded child and for 16 years that child has to be paid for if the parents are over the income limit. As soon as the child reaches 17 years of age he is given free treatment.  If it was detected in the national school that that child was retarded the parents would have got free hospital treatment for him regardless of their income.</P>
    <P>It is unbelievable that this has gone on for so long without being rectified. When the Minister is laying down conditions about people with long-term ailments of this kind I hope he will include this class of person for free hospital and any other services.  I made an attempt on numerous occasions in this House to get this type of child free services regardless of the income of the parents.  The parents of these children would need to have a very big income to carry such a burden for 16 years without feeling it.  Apart from that I doubt very much if there is any improvement in this section of the health services on what we have at present.  I have very serious doubts whether this will represent an improvement for people who need those services at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J. Lenehan Mr. J. Lenehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lenehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard a great many of the arguments made here.  Several of them appear to be concerned with the question of money. It is rather extraordinary that in the matter of health money should become such a serious problem.  When we decided to give what we call, through a complete misnomer, free education, we had absolutely no trouble obtaining the money to put the buses on the road, get the schools going and to get our <Col N="2248" /> allegedly free education system operating. Consequently, when it comes to health there should not be any serious problem and I do not really think for a moment that there is.</P>
      <P>A great deal of what has been said about this Bill is only commonsense. This Bill will be like every other Bill introduced in this House.  It comes in one form and it leaves in another.  It is quite likely that when the House has disposed of it, the Minister's intentions, whatever they were, will be converted, perverted or changed around one way or the other.  We have heard a good deal about the middle-class, the upper-class and other classes but we must remember that the people who not so long ago were lower-class are now middle-class, if not upper-class, thanks to Fianna Fáil.  We here are the people who fail to keep up with the people we represent.  We do not really know what those people want.  The voluntary health insurance scheme has undoubtedly something to recommend it, though not a lot.  In my case with six in family it costs me about £2 3s a month but there would be only a very small amount off the man on the dole. It certainly will not cost more than 10/- a week for anybody who is getting £2 5s on the dole although if he was married and exercising his prerogative there is no reason why he should not get more than that £2 5s.  We are all inclined to live more or less in the past and are not inclined to advance with the times.</P>
      <P>I would like to examine the insurance scheme which is mentioned. It certainly should be looked into.  It is quite possible it would not cost very much to find a solution involving some type of contribution made by the ordinary workers.  On the other hand, in places like the West of Ireland where a lower percentage of the people are insured it is quite a different matter. It could happen that it would cost a great deal more to collect the money than what would actually be received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is like reducing the pension for an old age pensioner.  The cost of sending out a pension officer is greater than the money saved on the reduced pension.  If God Almighty came back <Col N="2249" /> to earth he would not spend 33 years here now.  I do not think that he would be able to do so.  It is impossible to satisfy everybody.  The point is that no matter who the Minister is he cannot produce a solution which will meet everybody on this side of the House and I think we have enough commonsense among us.</P>
    <P>A short time ago Deputy Dr. Browne told us about his Utopian ideas.  When Deputy Dr. Browne had the opportunity he provided only one type of hospital.  Most of those are <Col N="2250" /> now white elephants.  I should not like to see the present Minister for Health pursue that kind of policy.  I do not believe he will and I do not think any future Minister will.  I honestly think any far as health is concerned that everybody should be able to get the services to which they are entitled.  I do not know who will pay for it but, as I said at the start, we are now able to pay for free education and we should be able to pay for health services for our people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The arguments which we advanced against section 43 are entirely applicable to this section also because this section purports to give satisfactory medical services to all the community whose means are less than £1,200 and it excludes all others from benefit, based on the Fianna Fáil credo that difficulty is not experienced by people in meeting their medical expenses when their income exceeds £1,200 per year.  We consider this to be entirely unrealistic and this is proved by the fact that even reluctant health authorities within the inadequate scope at present available to them are often obliged on the grounds of hardship to come to the relief of families who are earning in excess of £24 a week.</P>
      <P>I mentioned when speaking on the last section that the ceiling of £1,200 is completely inapplicable today.  I would emphasise that by pointing out that on 28th October last I asked the Taoiseach the number of persons in 1966 and now who are earning in excess of £1,200, as it was in 1966 that this ceiling was fixed.  Unfortunately the information for the whole country is not available but two categories of persons were quoted, and I should like to draw the attention of the House to this, as clearly indicative of the fact that this ceiling is wholly unrealistic and one we must get away from.  If the figure was acceptable in 1966 it should be much higher now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only relevant data available to relate wage-earners to the earnings <Col N="2252" /> figure are those of wage-earners covered by the census of industrial production and to persons in the Civil Service.  The number of wage-earners earning over £24 a week&mdash;£1,200 a year&mdash;covered by the census of industrial production, including building and construction, in October, 1966, was 7,842 while in October, 1967, which is the latest date for which figures are available, the number was 11,263.  In one year alone the number of people above the £1,200 a year mark increased by 3,421.  That is an immense increase, almost 40 per cent in one year.  Since then we have moved forward two more years.  We have had some substantial increases in earnings and it is fair to assume that we are now in a position in which we have from 20,000 to 25,000 people above the figure of £1,200 which was considered adequate in 1966.  If earnings have gone up so much in the meanwhile, we know also so has the cost of living, the cost of being sick, the cost of relieving suffering, the cost of dying, not to mention the cost of funerals.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if £1,200 was the appropriate figure three years ago it must now be substantially increased.  It is appalling that we should be fixing our sights now not on what would be the appropriate figure for 1969 but on what we know is a completely inappropriate figure, a figure which is three years old and which is even an old figure in relation to the incomes and the status of people when examined in preparation for the Government's White Paper.</P>
    <P>The Government at that time carried out a certain amount of research, as mentioned in the White Paper, where they say they carried out an investigation to determine whether or not hardship was caused to families in the middle income group and above it in relation to the provision of medical care.  The Government said their information was that hardship was not caused.  Those figures on which the Government worked are now out of date and there must be people, between the figures which they had compiled and the figures which would now be applicable, who would suffer hardship. The various minor reliefs which are <Col N="2253" /> given by way of assistance in the case of provable hardship for long chronic diseases requiring constant drugs and medicines are not adequate.</P>
    <P>Again, if I may advert to the reply of the 28th October which I received, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach mentioned that the number of civil servants earning over £1,200 per year, excluding allowances, in January, 1966, was 5,286.  In January, 1969, it was 8,704.  It appears they did not move as rapidly in income increases as other sections.  I think it is obvious, having regard to the fact that increases will take place this year, that you must have anything up to another 5,000 people in the Civil Service category who were within the insurable limit in 1966 and are now outside it and who, therefore, will not benefit even under the limited eligibility clause in section 44.  We believe this is a very grievous error.  If the dreadful system which we deplore is to be retained and if we are not to have what we in Fine Gael would like to give the people, a modern national health insurance scheme, at least let us, if we must operate the old scheme, do so on the basis of present day costings and figures so that the people who were within the scheme a few years ago will be within it in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be better to discuss this question of eligibility limits in connection with the regulations that will be brought before the House.  Section 44 makes it possible to vary the amounts by regulation. Regulations will have to come before the House and we can argue the point whether the £1,200 is still the right figure.  As the Deputy knows, any employed person who was under £1,200 in 1967, and was insurable still has eligibility for hospital services.  The criterion is that an insurance stamp must have been fixed within the preceding two contribution years.  Manual workers who go over £1,200 and are socially insured also take part in the middle-income scheme.  I do not want to argue the points raised by Deputy Ryan because they can be raised again. We are dealing with a Bill which will come into operation in April, 1971, and <Col N="2254" /> for which the regulations will be proposed.</P>
      <P>The only other point I want to make is that the figure of £800 was fixed in 1958 and it was changed in 1966 to £1,200.  In fact, if you go back to 1958 and take the £800 figure, then £1,200 is still right from the point of view of the increase in the cost of living.  Equally, one could take a shorter period and argue the point mentioned by other Deputies, that it is not right: it depends on which period you take.  I suggest we should discuss the rates of eligibility on the resolutions that will come before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give, for the record now, the figure before 1958 and for how long it applied?  If my memory serves me well, that figure was long overdue for amendment and that a decade or more passed before, in 1958, the figure was increased to £800.  I trust we are living in a more socially advanced time.  We should at all times be raising the limit.  The desirable thing, and what we in Fine Gael would propose to achieve, is to have no limit at all so that everybody would be brought within a national insurance scheme because the idea of leaving the better-off sections of the community free of levy is, we think, wrong.</P>
      <P>It should not be almost a badge of membership of the lower classes to be in a national insurance scheme.  It should be a common obligation of all citizens and everybody with an income should be contributing, without regard to the limit.  I can appreciate that there are administrative difficulties.  People of independent means who have no salary or wages may have some difficulties in regard to being included in the scheme but that has been achieved elsewhere.  The Minister has been known to look across the world for examples to exhort us to follow certain lines in the past and I trust that he will be able, in the course of his research in matters of health and insurance generally, to find a community which has this or a similar problem solved and apply the solution to our requirements. I began by asking for one item of information, the figure before 1968.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 45.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 64:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 25, lines 43 and 44, to delete &ldquo;either another officer of the health board or a person not such an officer&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;a person who is not another officer of the health board&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 45 provides that, in assessing means under the previous two sections when an officer of the health authority decides that a person does not come within a category specified, an appeal shall lie from the decision to a person being either another officer of the health board or a person not such an officer appointed or designated by the Minister.  The Minister may make regulations dealing with such appeals.  The purpose of the amendment is to delete the section which would allow the appeal to be heard by an officer of the same health board.  If an appeal is to be effective it ought to be to a person who is not employed under the same discipline, the same jurisdiction, the same advisory code, the same control as the officer who made the original decision.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment which the Minister could make without any loss to the Central Fund or to the efficiency of the Bill or any loss of the assessment of means which the Minister wishes to retain.  We would prefer to do away with any assessment but if the assessment is to be there we think it would be a good and welcome thing to have this right of appeal.  If there is not a right of appeal the whole procedure would be open to some question and doubt and certainly would not carry that degree of confidence in an appeal to an independent authority which there ought to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment if a health authority rules that a person has an income in excess of £1,200 a year an appeal lies against that decision to the Minister. Now we are to do away with the appeal to the Minister and instead <Col N="2256" /> allow an appeal to a person who may be a member of another authority. We think that is bad.  We appreciate, of course, it can also be to somebody else but we think, in all instances, the appeal should be to an independent person and, as I said earlier, that would in no way jeopardise the whole system of assessment of means but would stimulate confidence in the appeal procedure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the middle-income group the appeal, as the Deputy said, is to the appeals officers of the Department of Social Welfare.  In the case of the medical card, those who receive general medical service, we think that the decision should remain at a reasonably localised level.  Therefore, it is proposed that the decisions of junior officers of health boards in this respect would be subject to an appeal to a higher level within the health boards, probably to the chief executive officer.</P>
      <P>In a regional board of some size this will ensure the kind of independent view that can be taken by the chief executive officer, having examined the decision of the junior health officer in a local district.  This will provide uniformity of decisions throughout the boards' areas while, at the same time avoiding undue centralisation.  I honestly do not think we need to centralise appeals in regard to medical cards in connection with the regional health board.  We have this arrangement with the Department of Social Welfare because they have their limit of £1,200 a year, except for manual workers, and it is convenient for that reason to do this.</P>
      <P>I might add that statutory appeals from one officer to another can be found in the case of the Department of Social Welfare where some officers of the Department, with the title of deciding officers, take decisions on social welfare assistance payments, or other matters in connection with social welfare, and these decisions are then subject to appeal to other officers of the Department called appeals officers</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that I have had immense experience of dealing with old age pension and widows' pension appeals <Col N="2257" /> which come to me in my capacity as a Deputy and I am sure Deputies have the same experience.  I think on the whole that the appeals system, as devised, whereby one level of social welfare payments is examined by one group of officers and can then be appealed to another, has worked fairly well.  We certainly ought to give it a trial in connection with the general medical service, relating that kind of appeal system to what will operate in the regional health boards.  I am afraid I must resist the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed that the Minister has adopted this attitude.  It is not unreasonable to assume that, where an application is turned down by any officer&mdash;even a junior officer of a health board&mdash;it will be turned down by him acting under the policy of that board.  No doubt he will have certain norms and rules given to him.  He will assess the means of the applicant within the rules given to him. Such an officer will be guided by the same set of rules as the officer who is to hear the appeal.  That, we think, is undesirable.</P>
      <P>I think I am right in saying that this is the first time there is any right of appeal in relation to the issue of general medical service cards.  At the moment, a person may be unsuccessful in making an application, but he can try and try again.  Perhaps he will go to his local TD or councillor in the process of making an appeal.  It not infrequently happens that he succeeds in his appeal simply because he makes it, and sometimes he succeeds because the local public representative knows the kind of information which should be gathered for the purpose of presenting the appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The danger is that, if a person is turned down and told that he may appeal to an appeals officer, he may exercise that right of appeal without adding any information.  At the moment, the present system, which I regard as undignified, and which forces people to go to their local politician, at least has the merit that the local politician can, in many cases, advise the person how to present his appeal, how to collect additional information, for <Col N="2258" /> instance, not just to make the application based upon the illness of one person but to bring in the other members of the family if they happen to be ill as well, and to set out all expenses, including expenses of hire purchase, house outgoings, transport to and from work, and so forth, all of which is very properly taken into account in the assessment of means, because means has little reality if you do not also consider unavoidable outgoings.</P>
    <P>All that is now available and the people who are turned down flatly go through the processes which at least some of them know and they get advice.  The danger is that, if they are notified of their simple right of appeal to another official, they will exercise that without having their appeal properly prepared.  The present right of appeal which applies in relation to what used to be known as limited eligibility, which relates to whether or not the person has an income of £1,200 a year or less, has a success rate of one-third.  One-third of the people who appeal at the moment from the local health authority to the Department are successful.  That is a very significant rate.  It seems to me that this shows the value of having an assessment made by someone other than an official of the board which made the first rejection.</P>
    <P>Therefore, as the Minister has provided that an appeal may be made to an officer other than an officer of the health authority, I would ask him to make it mandatory to have the appeal to someone other than an officer of the health authority.  It should be possible to have such an official.  Quite clearly, within any health board area, you will have at least one person who will probably be doing nothing else except dealing with appeals.  Why not have that person employed independently of the health board?  Why not put him under some other authority, be it the regional hospital authority or even the Department? Leave that person free of the control of the health board.  Let him feel that he has not got a senior officer in his own health board looking over his shoulder.  Let him not feel in any way beholden to the officials of his own health authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2259" /> I believe you will have more independent judgment and, perhaps, a rate of success in appeals equivalent to that which now operates.  I know the Minister would be anxious that an appeal should be a genuine one but, if you do not remove the decision-making on the appeal from the same health board as that which makes the original decision, you will have people feeling dissatisfied and feeling that they did not get a fair hearing on appeal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the section it is not mandatory and, if the Deputy wants it to be mandatory, I think he might well accept the fact that I will look into this and make quite sure that the appeal machinery is of the right kind, and we do not have to choose another officer of the health board.  We can choose a person who is not such an officer.</P>

      <P>I think that fair objection can be taken to some of the forms now in existence in relation to the assessment of means.  I have seen forms issued by health authorities to their officers who assess means containing questions such as these: &ldquo;Is the home well furnished or badly furnished?  Is the home well kept or badly kept?  Are the children well clothed or badly clothed?&rdquo; These are items which should not be the determining factors.  There is many a poor person who keeps a good home; there are many people who fall into ill-health and have immense medical expenses who should not be required to become destitute, careless and ragged before they get assistance.  In practice, certainly in many areas, these rigid assessments which exist on the form are not taken into account, but that anybody should ever have devised such a form absolutely appals me.</P>

      <P>With respect, I do not think it is reasonable.  It might be reasonable for an officer to make a remark upon this form, but the question should not be specifically put to him to make a report on it.  Even a person who is looking for home assistance might be keeping a good home; it might be well furnished, and the children might be well clothed.  Again, they should not have to be down to the point of having holes in the heels of their socks, ragged pants and dirty faces and there should not have to be filth and dirt on the floor in order to qualify.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The old forms we used for the purpose of collecting information were in the nature of making a report upon the person's condition.  My purpose in making this point is to ask that these forms asking for a declaration of means would respect the person's right to maintain a good home and keep it well furnished and would not require him to sell his capital assets, including his personal belongings, in order to qualify.</P>

      <P>Nobody suggests that, and when the home help comes into operation, and when some of the other proposals that will emerge when the report on the aged poor that has not been published yet and will be published fairly soon, come in, we shall <Col N="2261" /> be providing for looking after the aged poor in their homes.  There will need to be a detailed description of the household because part of the proposals will include helping the person to live in his own home, particularly in regard to certain kinds of furniture he can use if he is disabled.  Therefore, the Deputy need not worry about these forms at all.</P>

      <P>If one looks at the last few words of this section one finds: &ldquo;The health authority may take such steps as it thinks fit to verify a declaration.&rdquo; This seems to me to be the kind of steps which they might take and which I deplore, that the officer will be told to look at the home and see whether the declaration that the person has a small income is justified by the appearance of the home.  I have known of an application for medical assistance to be turned down because the son had given his widowed mother a television set as a present.  It might be said it would have been better had he given her medical expenses or something of that kind, but a television set for an elderly person has great therapeutic value.  Anyway, we want to ensure that what has occurred in the past will not occur in the future, that people will be encouraged to maintain their selfrespect, will be encouraged to look for help in order to maintain the status and dignity which the home had before they fell on evil times.</P>

      <P>I raised a question on Second Stage and, if my memory serves me right, I did not receive a reply to it at the conclusion, although the Minister mentioned by way of intervention at the time, that his experience was different from mine.</P>
      <P>Section 48 proposes that the health authorities will be entitled to recover charges from people who receive benefit without entitlement to it.  If we have to have this horrid means test, we cannot object to that measure, although we would prefer it to be otherwise. Although a person may have some substantial capital, their means may be such that they are entitled to hospital and other services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am thinking of the case of a mentally deficient person who entered a mental home about 30 years ago.  The health authority, the ratepayer and the taxpayer has maintained that unfortunate person in a public institution ever since.  The cost must have been enormous.  The person was made a ward of court because she had a piece of land.  The value of that land has immensely increased in the meantime. I do not know what its market value is today but it is probably in the region of £25,000.  The situation is that, although the health authority has put in <Col N="2264" /> a claim for expenses, it appears that the health authority is not entitled to get a refund because the necessary monetary order, for fixing the levy at which the person should be paying, was not fixed, and because it was not fixed the health authority cannot recover any more than six years' contributions because the statutory limitations debar the health authority from recovering any more than that.</P>
    <P>The people who are now going to benefit are very distant relatives.  As I understand it, they showed little concern for the unfortunate person during that person's incarceration in the mental home, and from what I gather the person was not very much concerned anyway because her mental condition was such that a visit would be unmeaningful. I do not see why the ratepayer and the taxpayer should have to pay all the cost when the deceased person has in fact left an asset of very great value which is about to be seized upon by people who made no contribution to that person's welfare during her life.  It seems to me that the public purse is deserving of consideration in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>This section, as drafted, would not cover the case I have just cited.  The person was entitled to treatment under the Act because, even though the person had a capital asset, it could not be sold unless the person had the good fortune to recover.  I think the Minister should take a look at this section and, if he is going to keep the means test, try to recover some part of the cost for the benefit of the ratepayer and the taxpayer, particularly where the would-be beneficiaries of the deceased are very remote relatives.  It might be different if they were the immediate family.  I think it would be unfair to require the immediate family to pay it.  In this Bill we are excluding the means of everyone except the spouse.  I think it would be fair to consider the relief which occasionally falls &mdash;I know it is infrequent&mdash;in cases of the kind I have mentioned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is one which allows the State to impose charges for hospitalisation.  I think I am right in saying the reality of the situation is that the proportion of the hospitalisation costs recovered by way of these charges is in the region of one-thirtieth of the total hospital costs.  Allowing for the fact that in the case of proven hardship, which requires a person in a time of stress to go along cap in hand begging for mercy, it is possible to get a reduction on the current figure of 10/- per day, and in cases of significant hardship this can be abolished altogether.  This whole machinery costs money to administer.  It requires the issuing of notices in the first instance and the testing of the means of the applicants.  I would urge the Minister to seriously consider, as he has already <Col N="2266" /> decided to waive the puny charges made for X-rays and for minor treatment, waiving altogether the charges in respect of in-patient services.  If a person is only in for a few days the cost of recovering the money is greater than what comes in, and when a person is in for a long time it is considered that he has suffered sufficient hardship not to justify the recovery of the money.  If the Minister is going to be realistic in this measure he should do away with these charges altogether.  If he does not, I will have a sinister suspicion in my mind that the Minister's intention is to increase the 10/-a day.  The only justification for retaining it would be to make a more worth-while contribution to the cost of hospitalisation. The present figure is so small that it is not worth keeping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall be looking into this question because the costs of collection are very heavy.  I cannot give any assurance as to what will be done after we have looked into the administration costs.  Of course, under the section the charges can be made flexible and a new limit, or a number of limits, relating to different circumstances could be substituted for the flat limit under the sections.  Any decisions about this will have to come in the regulations which will be coming before the Dáil and we shall be able to have another discussion on them on that occasion.</P>

      <P>It costs up to 9/- to process the books and make the book-keeping entry for that payment.  There is little point therefore in collecting 10/-.  Most of these accounts are paid by instalments and there is little point in collecting puny instalments.  It was reassuring to hear from the Minister that he is thinking of modifying this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 52 provides:</P>
      <P>A person entitled to avail himself of in-patient services under section 50 or the parent of a child entitled to allow the child to avail himself of such services may, if the person or parent so desires, instead of accepting services made available by the health board, arrange for the like services being provided for the person or the child in any hospital or home approved of by the Minister for the purposes of this section, and where a person or parent so arranges, the health board shall, in accordance with regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make in respect of the services so provided the prescribed payment.</P>
      <P>We seek to amend that section by providing that prescribed payments shall not be less than the cost to the health board if the services of the health board were accepted and the purpose of the amendment is this: the health board should not contribute any less towards the cost of the hospitalisation of the person simply because the person is hospitalised in some institution other than one of the health board's own hospitals.</P>
      <P>I have known a case of an elderly couple in Dublin, one of whom, needing acute hospitalisation and having difficulty in finding accommodation, found it in a hospital in the midlands. It is a hospital; it also has attached to it a home for geriatrics.  The Dublin Health Authority have made a regulation providing that they will make a contribution towards the maintenance of elderly people in that home for a period of only six weeks but here is a position in which the couple in question, one of them hospitalised, the other a geriatric patient, the doctors considering that it was most desirable that the two of them should continue to be as close to each other as possible, not having a home of their own to which to return, are now in a predicament that they are in a home in respect of which the health authority, after six weeks, say that they will not contribute anything towards the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Representations are now being made following a satisfactory reply which I <Col N="2268" /> had from the Minister last week, in which the Minister indictated that the health authority had a discretion in these matters to extend the period of assistance beyond six weeks but, again, the health authority, even for the six weeks, were not contributing as much towards the maintenance of these people in the home in the midlands as it would have cost the same health authority to maintain them in a Dublin home for elderly people.  This would appear to be wrong.  The health board should be delighted that people are able to find accommodation in institutions other than health board institutions and if the next-of-kin of such people are prepared to pay in addition to the cost which would arise on the health authority the difference between the health authority's costings and the costings of a home, then these people should be encouraged to do this kind of thing.  It would relieve the health board of the immense capital costs, of the immense nursing difficulties, of all the multitudinous problems which arise in relation to the maintenance of people in their own institutions.  The purpose of my amendment was simply to say that if somebody is in a home other than a health authority home or hospital, let the health authority pay as much&mdash;no more and no less&mdash;as the health authority would pay if the person were in one of their own institutions.</P>
    <P>You can imagine how disappointed we are when we find that that reasonable proposal is ruled out of order because it is considered that it is a potential charge on State funds.  Why is it considered a potential charge on State funds?&mdash;because the State and the Minister, apparently, do not propose that health boards should pay the same amount as it would cost the health board to maintain the person in one of their own hospitals and it is going to fix it at the lower figure.  This will mean that health boards will have to provide accommodation which is being provided elsewhere, will have to provide services which are being and could be provided in other places.  I would urge the Minister, when he does fix the figures, if he will not accept our amendment, to fix them at a level which will be commensurate with what it would <Col N="2269" /> cost the health authority to keep people in their own charge.</P>

      <P>The health authorities do their best in regard to these people. If a person chooses to go to a private nursing home where the cost is very much less to the health authority than the cost per patient in a regional hospital&mdash;it might be up to £4 a day&mdash;it is rather unreasonable to require that the health board should make subsidies at the high rate to the nursing homes or small hospitals.  I think they should pay a reasonable percentage of the charge. I cannot quite see the Deputy's point. I have not had many complaints of this I must say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case I have in mind&mdash;I cannot give the exact figures &mdash;let us produce hypothetical figures &mdash;it might cost £7 a week to keep a geriatric patient in a hospital in Dublin.  It is usually a great deal less than to keep a person in an acute hospital.  The family might be able to arrange to have the person taken into a home where, perhaps, the standards of comfort and so on are slightly higher, where it might cost £10 a week.  The health authority is being relieved of having to provide accommodation at the rate of £7 a week and I think the health authority ought to pay the £7 a week towards the £10 cost, leaving it to the family to pay the £3.  In fact, what happens is that the health authority in many cases will pay only £3 or <Col N="2270" /> £4, leaving the family to pay the other £7.  People should be encouraged to find accommodation elsewhere, accommodation in accordance with their own standards and perhaps, sometimes, nearer their own home.  In some cases the local authority hospital or institution might be far away from the family. If the family can arrange accommodation nearer home the health authority ought to pay the cost similar to that which it would cost them to maintain the person elsewhere.  If a case arises where it would cost the health authority more if they kept the person I do not think they should be required to pay the greater amount.</P>

It would be very important that people from that part of the country should be able to avail of the services in Dublin which are of a much wider variety and which are much more convenient to them than services in the centre chosen for the region.  I hope the Minister will consider the point and make it easy for people to avail of the services in Dublin.</P>

The effect of this is to put eligible persons who opt for private or semi-private accommodation in much the same position as a person opting similarly in a voluntary hospital.

I wanted to make that statement because the medical profession were worried in case the Bill was defective.

      <P>I move amendment No. 77:</P>
      <P>In page 27, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>(2)  In making arrangements under this section, a health board shall act in accordance with the directions of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to strengthen the power of the Minister to lay down standards for the provision of ambulance services or other means of transport for the conveyance of patients.  We have a consultative service on the ambulance service.  It has been doing very good work&mdash;training ambulance drivers and providing new standards for ambulances and the equipment in them.  I am very anxious that the entire ambulance service <Col N="2275" /> should be improved as far as possible, with radio-telephone control and centralised in the very best possible way.  There has been quite an improvement in the ambulance service but, as the House knows, much more is required and I want to be sure I can lay down standards in this connection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very welcome amendment.  We were disappointed there was no provision like this in the original Bill.  I did advert to it in tabling an amendment, but the Minister got there before me, I am glad to say.  That is highly desirable. The success or failure of the Bill will depend on the availability of a firstclass ambulance service, equipped with every modern aid, operating around the clock and available without delay to any person requiring the service. If there is any difficulty in obtaining ambulances there will be serious hardships and, possibly, deaths with resultant embarrassment to the Minister. This amendment is certainly a very welcome move in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Ryan in this.  As he has said, an upto-date ambulance service is the corner-stone of an efficient health service. Would the Minister tell us if he envisages the ambulances concentrated in one particular place or will there be ambulances stationed at various localities in the particular region?  It would be better if this were the case because if the ambulances were all centralised in, say, my own region of Cavan, there would be some difficulty for people living where I live in Dunboyne to get a phone call through to the ambulance station in an emergency. There should be an ambulance station in every electoral area so that there would be no difficulty about telephone calls and so that the journey from the ambulance station to the patient's home would be as short as possible. When the Minister is laying down the standards envisaged under this very welcome section he might consider these points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The work study involved in determining the very best <Col N="2276" /> type of ambulance services is a highly technical one.  If the ambulances are controlled by radio-telephone the centre points for them have to be considered in the best possible way.  There are two ways of doing it.  One way is by studying records.  It is possible to computerise the records of all people who are taken to hospital and to find out how long it took to get them there, what hospitals they went to and where the ambulance started and finished.  It is a highly complicated business and I hope we will be able to make progress. There would not be any automatic practice of having ambulance stations in one place because the health board was in the larger area.  This will be done on an intelligent and commonsense basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

      <P>Question proposed: That section 55, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We find this section very disappointing because it does not include a subsection similar to the one tabled by me.  The purpose of our amendment was to allow a person, in an emergency, to use an ambulance other than the health authority's ambulance. Such cases can arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Donegal, for instance, it was found that the local health authority ambulances were not able to reach the remote parts of Donegal in time to bring people to hospital for urgently needed medical attention with the result that some people died, according to the best medical opinion in Donegal, and this has been established and recorded. The people in the remoter areas of Donegal got sufficient funds together out of their own savings and by their own efforts to purchase ambulances <Col N="2277" /> which were superior in equipment to what the local health authority was making available.  They also made provision for the cost of staffing the ambulances.</P>
    <P>It would not do to encourage people all over the country to become reckless or unduly worried about the availability of ambulances and, certainly, we would not want a situation where we would have a lot of hypochondriacs who would believe that they must have an ambulance following them around all the time.  However, apart from the Donegal incident there have been other cases in which local authority ambulances have not been available but where other ambulances have been. There are several private ambulances in the Dublin region and some of these are called into service from time to time by the health authority; in fact, some of them are under contract to the health authority to provide a particular service, but emergencies will arise when the health authority ambulance is not available and when the fire brigade ambulance is not available.  In cases such as this it should be open to people who are entitled to free ambulance service to get any other ambulance that may be available and these people should be recouped from the health authority for the cost of using the alternative ambulance.</P>
    <P>The only argument the Minister can advance against our suggestion is that it would be administratively difficult to determine whether an emergency existed to warrant the calling in of an ambulance other than the health board's ambulance, but these difficulties could be surmounted.  In cases of hardship other than the health authority ambulance.  This is one way in which the Minister could supplement, without capital cost, the ambulance services which he proposes to improve.  We urge him to consider this between now and Report Stage.  Even if it is only a permissive section, we would appreciate if the Minister put it in.  It would not be obligatory on the health authority to give assistance but it would allow them to adjudicate on cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told that under section 25, subsection (1), the health <Col N="2278" /> board would have authority to make arrangements for the use of private ambulances, but between now and Report Stage I will see whether the power in the section is sufficiently flexible.  It is obvious that the use of a private ambulance while the health board one was readily available would not be justified, at least for subvention, but as far as I know, under section 25, subsection (1), the health board would have the authority to pay for the private ambulance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Without having to go to section 25 to enable the health authorities to make arrangements for providing ambulances or any other means of transport this could be done under section 55, subsection (1).  Section 25, subsection (1), allows the health authority to make arrangements with some other body, but that is in the nature of an advance arrangement system such as arranging with ambulance A to provide transport for people living within a particular district.  That is one thing but what I have in mind is another.  I am thinking of the person living within the area in which the health authority's ambulances are but who cannot be taken quickly enough because the health authority ambulance is out on some other case.  In such cases it should be possible to bring in other ambulances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important section.  It provides for a choice of doctor system for persons coming under the Health Acts.  I wonder if subsection (1) is rather restrictive in so far as it uses the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; make available.  There are some areas where you would be using a dispensary doctor rather than availing of a choice of doctor.  Perhaps the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; would have been a better word to use. I am all in favour of a choice of doctor.  It is an excellent new concept; indeed, it is one which the Fine Gael Party have proposed for a long time. There is also a question of the trend among practising doctors to come together in a group for the purpose of practising.  Three or four doctors come together in a city or a rural area to serve an area.  They arrange between themselves their time off and the times during which they will be on duty. This may be a technical problem: if a person opts for Dr. A, and Dr. B is on duty, what is the position in regard to that patient?  I should like to hear the Minister's views on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also very important that the Minister will come to an agreement as to the fees paid to a general practitioner for the work he does for a patient.  I understand that there is quite an amount of trouble with the medical bodies in this respect.  I sincerely hope that agreement can be reached which will be satisfactory to all concerned.  I hope it will be to the satisfaction of the doctors and of the patients.  At the moment, there is a feeling among <Col N="2280" /> medical card-holders with full eligibility that they are not being treated properly by doctors by virtue of the fact that they do not themselves pay doctors, that it is a charge on the Health Act.  I hope this attitude will be removed by the introduction of a satisfactory fee scale payable to doctors and also to surgeons.  This is perhaps a complex field.  I am not medically qualified to discuss the availability of specialist or surgical services.  It is important to attract into the various areas in the country men of ability, men outstanding within their own profession, and that patients will be happy with the surgeons who will agree to come under the new Health Act when it is in service.  I should like the Minister to give his views on dispensary doctors and their future.  What compensation will be paid to dispensary doctors at present giving service, a very good service?</P>

      <P>I have stated that there is a general dissatisfaction among the patients.  I have had many complaints from patients who feel they are not treated as they should be treated by virtue of the fact that they are medical card-holders.

I hope the Minister will come to an agreement with the doctors and that they will remove this unfortunate stigma on medical card-holders which is keenly felt by the ordinary workingman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be possible to make arrangements for group practices. We are very keen on the idea of group practice, particularly with a group of the younger doctors who will be entering into service some years from now <Col N="2281" /> and who will have to be trained under the new Todd Regulation.  We are having detailed discussions with the medical authorities.  The discussions are continuing, they have not broken down. We are beginning to get down now to the hard basis of negotiation.  I am perfectly certain that the arrangement will be one fee for service.  It will encourage the medical profession throughout the country who will now begin to take part in the provision of medical card practitioner services.  It will stimulate the whole area of general practitioner operation.</P>
      <P>It is intended to maintain the present dispensary officers.  It is intended even to appoint additional dispensary officers.  This can be done under section 56 (2) where they are required and where the choice of doctor system is not operable.  Therefore, we have the existing dispensary doctors who will continue until their normal period of retirement.  We have the possibility of appointing additional dispensary officers if that is required.  We were in negotiation with the medical authorities for arrangements for a fee for service basis for choice of doctor for those with medical cards.</P>

      <P>There are extra payments in certain remote areas.  One of the reasons I want to ensure that this Bill can come into operation on 1st April, 1971, is that I want to end the period of uncertainty in the whole of the general practitioner world which has arisen through holding up the appointment of permanent dispensary <Col N="2282" /> officers in areas where we know that the choice of doctor system can operate because there are enough doctors in the area, or because doctors are likely to be attracted to the area.  There are some of our own doctors in England who would be anxious to come back once there was some certainty in regard to their positions.  For that reason I am particularly anxious for us to complete the study of the Bill so that we can have it in operation in April, 1971, and end this phase of uncertainty.  I agree with everybody who stated that it is most undesirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Eighteen is a very small drop in the ocean of 250.  The Minister should go a great deal further.  There are some areas where there will be only one doctor.  It is practically impossible, short of a population explosion, to have two doctors because there would not be a living for them, they would be bored.  The only way to have a doctor in some of these cases is by having a national health scheme and by the State paying a doctor to stay in these regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Bruton says, that the terms of service must be made attractive enough to keep people in the remote areas but it means more than remuneration.  It means also reasonable conditions and reasonable conditions include reasonable time off. When doctors, or any other group, in this day and age are asking for every second week-end off and one half-day a week and one evening off a week, it is the least we can give them.  I can see administrative problems in giving this in remote areas unless one arranges that people will not get sick every second week-end but in those areas <Col N="2283" /> where there are plenty of doctors' plates and where people must pass doctors in private practice to reach the dispensary doctor, a scheme to give doctors reasonable time off should be brought into operation immediately. The fact that it cannot be applied in all areas is no reason for delaying it any longer in those areas where it can. If this is not done it will be difficult to get doctors to work in the public service at all.</P>

      <P>It would appear that this section enables the health board to refund actual expenses incurred by people obliged to purchase drugs and medicines and medical and surgical appliances.  It seems to be in the nature of a refund, a retrospective payment, and that people will be required to expend money before they receive any refund.  At present the system of giving assistance to people who are unable without hardship to provide drugs and medicines is to arrange for the people to collect them at their local dispensary subject, in some cases, to a charge being made on the patients. This at least is a system which enables a person to get them without parting with substantial amounts at the time. In relation to medical and surgical appliances the system is that the health authority issue an authority to the patient to collect the appliances from the manufacturers or suppliers.</P>

If I am wrong I would be glad if the Minister would allay my suspicions because it does appear to be in the nature of a refund which in some <Col N="2285" /> cases would be all right if people had cash available but in other cases could cause serious embarrassment and might lead to people postponing getting drugs and medicines because they had not got the cash available.  Cases have arisen in relation to surgical appliances under the system as operated at present whereby people, having got fed up waiting for the appliances through the system operated, have gone to the suppliers direct and received them ten times faster as private patients than if they were waiting for the health authority.  Unfortunately in such cases in the past when such people went to the health authority to get a refund it has been refused on the grounds that they did not go through the existing machinery.  We should not copperfasten it in any particular way. If it suits a person to get advance payment that should be made.  If it suits him to get the goods free or at a subsidised cost on presentation of authority then we should allow the person to do that.  We should not tie it to any particular system.</P>

      <P>People with full eligibility can get these drugs and medicines, medical and surgical appliances in the ordinary way.  They must get a prescription for the drugs or an authorisation from the health authority for the appliances and then they can get these things from the chemist.  In the case of the middle income group, I honestly do not think it is practicable with an elaborate scheme of this kind to do it otherwise.  Where they are <Col N="2286" /> getting a contribution towards the cost of surgical appliances they could, because the matter would not be urgent, get an authority from the health authority so that they would not have to pay more than the net amount they are required to pay to the chemist but I do not think it will be a great difficulty if the middle income people either get credit from the chemist or pay and then get a refund afterwards.  Any other way of doing it would be too cumbersome.</P>

      <P>It will be in the nature of a refund then?  Suppose a person gets credit from a chemist of say £10 and then says to the health authority: &ldquo;Here is the chemist's bill for £10. You contribute £6 and I will pay the other £4.&rdquo;  What is the machinery then? Will the health authority issue a cheque to the chemist or issue a certificate to the person saying that they will pay the £6?</P>
