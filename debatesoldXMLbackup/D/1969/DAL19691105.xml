      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland) (for the Minister for Health)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have decided not to approve a proposal to provide a permanent residential centre for severely and moderately handicapped children at Lady Lane, Waterford.  Approval had been given to the use, as a temporary measure, of these premises but the cost of necessary adaptations was found to be very high. I could not justify the considerable expenditure involved on a building which would be located on an unsuitable site and which could never form the nucleus of a suitable centre.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that his predecessor was disposed to the siting of the residential school but, apparently, there has now been some re-thinking on the matter? What does the Minister mean by a day centre?  What type of school has he in mind?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If this particular site were developed it would not be really suitable and the Minister, therefore, decided that it would be a mistake to expend a considerable amount of <Col N="176" /> money on something that would not be satisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that a deputation of women recently appealed to Kerry County Council to make more hospital facilities available for the treatment of maternity cases, as over 400 maternity cases a year have to be treated in hospitals outside Kerry; and whether he proposes to consider an increase in the provision of maternity accommodation in the proposed new Kerry County Hospital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there is a demand for more hospital facilities for maternity patients in Kerry.  Provision is being made in the plans for the proposed new hospital at Tralee for a maternity unit of 40 beds, an increase of 19 beds over the maternity unit in the existing hospital.</P>
      <P>I should add that a part-time consultant obstetrician-gynaecologist has recently been appointed at the county hospital in Tralee and that a wholetime appointment will be made early in 1970.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if, in view of the fact that at this time of the year farmers in the creamery areas generally draw up their annual farm programmes and milk prices are an important factor in determining the size of the dairy herd, he will now give some indication of the creamery milk price prospects for 1970.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as Exchequer support for creamery milk is concerned, I have nothing to add to what was very recently announced.  As regards the other element which affects price, namely the net market returns secured by creameries from sales of their various products, it is rather early to forecast trends in 1970 but at this stage there seems no reason to expect any appreciable change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give <Col N="177" /> any clear indication of what the price is likely to be for the coming season? Has he in mind changing the present price structure for the coming season? Milk producers are anxious to have this information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Market trends for 1970 are, I am afraid, pretty difficult to forecast with any degree of certainty at this stage, but the implications are that there will not be any appreciable change in market trends during the coming year.  In so far as the other major factor in milk price structuring is concerned, namely, Exchequer support, I cannot see any major restructuring of that arrangement at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it there will not be an increase in the price of milk delivered to creameries in the coming year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only project what may happen in so far as Government intervention is concerned.  I cannot project with any certainty what the market trends may be or what the various producers may succeed in getting on the various markets throughout the world.  Therefore I cannot say with certainty that there will be no increase, any more than I can say that prices obtainable abroad may not decrease.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The close seasons for salmon fishing are intended to keep a reasonable balance between conservation and exploitation.  I would not consider changing the season for any river system except on the basis of being satisfied that a change is desirable in the interests of the fisheries in the river system.  The salmon angling season already varies so much from river to river that sport may be had in any year from 1st January to 12th October in one area or another.</P>

Is the Minister further aware that there are 500 applications for forms for lanes, <i>et cetera,</i> received in Cavan County Council and that at the present rate of grant it would take ten years to clear up that number?

Is the Minister not further aware that the 38 applications to which he refers is the final number of lanes handed over by his Department to the county council two years ago, which they had received but had not done?  Is the Minister further aware that it is not possible, in view of the amount of the grant, even to get an application form in Cavan at the moment?

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether it is his intention to have consultations with the building industry following the reported statement of the Minister for Finance regarding the need for a slowing down in the rate of office block development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Capital for office block development is not normally provided by the building industry.  There would, therefore, be little point in my having consultations, as suggested, with the industry.</P>
      <P>I may say, however, that I have been and am keeping under review the need for ensuring that the maximum concentration of the resources of the industry is centred in the building of houses and that other types of building do not prejudice the Government's housing programme.  Announcements have already been made of the measures taken to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I was heartened, as I am sure the Minister must have been, by the speech of the Minister for Finance because the Minister for Local Government did not seem to share a similar sense of urgency in this matter. Whilst it may be true&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Has the Deputy a question to put?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that while it may be argued that capital which goes to office block development does not go direct to the building industry, the fact is that the spate of office block building in Dublin has put up the price of property and has indirectly affected building costs and that, therefore, it should be the Minister's duty to discuss with the building industry how they can bring their costs more into line and make it possible for people once more to purchase houses? It is impossible for working people at the moment to purchase houses.  He knows this and he is the responsible Minister for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that this is by any means impossible.  I do agree, <Col N="184" /> however, that it is desirable to concentrate the resources of the building industry as much as possible on the building of houses and that that involves the discouragement of excessive office building.  The point is that the capital for office building does not, in general, come from the building industry. There is not any point, therefore, in my having a discussion in that regard with the building industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister appreciate that insurance companies are advancing a great deal of the capital to speculators while these same insurance companies are refusing mortgage facilities for people who wish to purchase houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The insurance companies are not the building industry. The Deputy suggested that I should have consultations with the building industry&mdash;and it is now the insurance companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>All of these are involved in the circle of interests that should be consulted by the Minister. The Minister is showing a noticeable lack of urgency in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received no <Col N="185" /> proposal for the erection of 32 houses at Newcastle West.  My sanction was, however, sought, on 30th September, 1968, to plans for the development there of 32 sites for private houses. Sanction was given to these plans on 23rd January, 1969.  I do not know when tenders were invited.  The deputy county manager's order accepting a tender was made on 6th June, 1969. A contract has not yet been signed. I am not in a position to say when work will be commenced as the tender proposal is still under consideration.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of the very serious hardships and inconveniences caused to many members of the gardaí who were called on to do emergency duty in Dublin on or about 18th August last and who are still away from their stations and wives and families; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Temporary transfers of gardaí for duty occur as a normal practice incidental to terms of service.  It is not correct to say, however, that the recent tranfers to Dublin created hardships for many gardaí on the grounds stated by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Of the total number of members involved in these transfers, less than 5 per cent are married, and one-half of these have already been returned to their permanent stations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider it highly advisable in the circumstances to issue a communication to, say, each superintendent's area to inquire from the members of the Garda Síochána if they would be prepared to come to Dublin and, by that method, receive the co-operation of people who would not mind coming to Dublin instead of drafting members in against their wishes?</P>

      <P>Claims for repayment of income tax, apart from PAYE repayments, are dealt with in the Revenue Commissioners' claims branch. Owing to staff shortages there has been some increase recently in the number of cases on hands in that branch.  The clearing of these, however, is not being unduly delayed and there has been very little complaint from taxpayers or their agents.</P>
      <P>PAYE end-of-year refunds are worked in the various tax districts. These refunds are made as early as possible, but delays are sometimes caused by the failure of employers to furnish certain information in time.  If the Deputy has any actual instances in mind perhaps he will be so good as to write to me about them.</P>

      <P>Arrangements have already been made for the making by Departments, where the employee has no objection, of suitable provisional deductions of income tax in advance of the Department's receipt from the Revenue of the statutory notification of full liability.  These arrangements are designed to ensure that deductions are made over as long a period as possible with a view to eliminating any element of hardship; but if the Deputy is aware of any case in which hardship is complained of I shall be glad to have it examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>The question presumably refers to PAYE tax deductions which are made by an employer from an excess of an employee's pay over his tax-free allowances.</P>
      <P>In the normal case the employee, having completed his income tax return of income, will have been supplied with particulars of his tax-free allowances either before, or at the same time as, the employer is required to make the appropriate deductions from his pay.</P>
      <P>If an employer does not receive from the employee, or from the tax office, a certificate of tax-free allowances he is required to apply the emergency PAYE procedure which involves making deductions from the whole of the pay (after a period of four weeks in which tax free allowances of £6 a week are given).  This procedure is not, however, brought into operation without warning to the employee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether it is the policy of the Revenue Commissioners to reduce the number of separate income tax and surtax assessments against individual taxpayers; and, if so, why the inspector of taxes for Public Departments has recently made separate assessments against income from public funds based upon out-of-date data relating to allowances and other matters against persons who have long-standing arrangements for single assessment and payment of tax on all incomes.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of the Revenue Commissioners to reduce the number of separate income tax and surtax assessments made on individual taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="197" /> It has not, so far, been possible to integrate into this system assessments made in respect of income from salaries and remuneration paid out of public funds.  However, where the main source of income is assessed elsewhere, the inspector concerned with income from public funds may make arrangements to cover such income by personal allowances in order to avoid a separate tax deduction.  The allowances given are those which appear to be due by reference to the latest return received from the taxpayer.  The separate tax deduction cannot be avoided if the income from public funds exceeds the allowances.</P>

    <P>The payment of pensions to the widows of pensionable public servants who retired or died before 23rd July, 1968, will operate with effect as from <Col N="199" /> 1st October, 1969.

There may, therefore, be some delay before payments can be made in all cases.  However, every effort is being made to expedite the issue of awards including payment of arrears from the 1st October.</P>

      <P>I understand from Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta that all possible steps have been taken to ensure that beet growers in the Thurles factory area will not be at any loss because of the unavoidable delay in starting the factory campaign.  The company is transferring beet from the area to its other three factories at a rate exceeding 50 per cent of the weekly beet tonnage that would normally be received at the Thurles factory, and this transfer is being carried out at no extra cost to the growers. The factories at Carlow, Mallow and Tuam are working at maximum capacity at present and deliveries of beet from growers in these areas have had to be reduced to cater for the intake from the Thurles area.</P>

      <P>In the course of my remarks to which the Deputy refers, I expressed the Government's belief that office building should be slowed down for the present and that developers, including insurance companies engaging in such work, should examine whether schemes for the provision of houses, flats or hostels could be substituted for new office projects they may have on hands.  I expect that in response developers will consider carefully the extent to which it will be possible for them to meet the Government's view.</P>

      <Col N="201" /> It is proposed that consultations regarding their investment policies should take place from time to time with investing agencies, including insurance companies.</P>
    <P>The insurance companies are one of the most important investing agencies. As I indicated in my statement, they are under an obligation to ensure a good return to their policy holders. They must keep a balance between this objective and the making of a reasonable contribution to the solution of our fundamental social needs.  I would point out that their annual allocation of funds to house purchase loans has been increasing and now amounts to £6 million a year.  Their contributions to national and public authority loans have also shown a substantial increase.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree, arising from his speech, that it is a peculiar situation to find an insurance company like the Irish Life Assurance Company, in which the Minister has a 95 per cent controlling interest, refusing mortgage facilities to any new applicants over the past six months while the same company is up to its neck in property development?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to bring out in my speech recently that we must keep a sense of proportion about these things.  A life insurance company is the custodian of the life savings of a very large number of people and these people look to the company to make sure that they get a good return on their policies.  An insurance company, therefore, has to seek remunerative outlets for the funds it has at its disposal. I suggest that the right thing to do&mdash; and I think all insurance companies agree with this&mdash;is that they should aim at a balance, they should take on a number of socially oriented projects, and at the same time balance those out by more remunerative projects like property investment.  Between the two they try to ensure that their funds are invested in such a way that a contribution <Col N="202" /> is made to meeting our fundamental social needs and at the same time they discharge their moral obligations to their policy holders.</P>

The company plays an important part in the commercial life of the country and supports any worthwhile developments.

      <P>This building to which the Deputy refers will be erected on the site of the former Church of Ireland Training College in Kildare Place.  As a result of negotiations which have been proceeding for a number of years the fee simple interest in the site is to be conveyed to the Commissioners of Public Works who will then lease it back to the developers for the purpose of the erection of the building.  The State is to make a capital contribution of £½m, to be paid in two equal instalments, one in the current financial year and one in 1970-71, towards the cost of site acquisition and the erection of the building which will contain approximately 165,000 square feet of office space.  The State will also pay an annual rent over a period of years and the building will eventually become the absolute property of the State.  While it would be contrary to standard practice to disclose the amount of the annual rent I can say that it compares very favourably with rents being charged at present for modern office accommodation.</P>
      <P>It is intended to centralise in the new building at least all the headquarters staff of the Department of Agriculture numbering about 1,100 who are now dispersed over several buildings a number of which are, by modern standards, unsuitable.</P>

This goes back to what Deputy Belton said. The insurance companies are involved up to their necks in this development <Col N="208" /> and the Government also because of the large extent of their rented accommodation in Dublin.  Very much of that rented accommodation is already guaranteed to these companies before a block is put on a particular site.

      <P>No.  On balance we gained substantially by this.  It is a question of the organisation of air traffic between the scheduled carriers. The main pirates, if you like, in this sphere, come from the United States of America, so that the people who can benefit most from organised air traffic through scheduled air lines are the European countries, including ourselves. The whole purpose of the exercise is to ensure that as far as possible world air traffic is regulated and, in particular, that there is no breach of IATA regulations through a large number of private enterprise charter operations in the United States.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8a:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In subsection (3), page 6, line 39, <Col N="228" /> after &ldquo;Council&rdquo; to add &ldquo;and persons nominated by such organisations as, in the opinion of the Minister, are representative of officers and servants employed in the functional area of each local committee&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My fellow Deputies and myself have tabled this amendment because we feel that one of the major difficulties facing the Department of Health and particularly the regional health boards that will be established will be to convince the electorate particularly at local level that there will not be any undue bureaucracy and that there need not be any excessive allegations of domination by political party representatives, that there will not be a faceless public servant behind such committees unanswerable and generally unadvised by the persons employed in the functional area of each local committee.</P>
    <P>It is essential that these committees should be more broadly based than is envisaged by the Minister in this Bill and that they should be seen to operate on that basis.  There seems to be in this House and, indeed, throughout the country the belief that the only basis of representative capacity is the elected one of public representatives themselves.  I suggest with respect that there is a very urgent need that those who spend their lives in public service should be given an opportunity, and have, in fact, the basic right and entitlement to have the opportunity, of contributing directly their advice and guidance to the benefit of the services themselves.</P>
    <P>As we are fully aware, the health services are now a major growth sector in the social security system of the State.  It is our desire and intention, as it has always been the policy of our party, that they should be extended on an even greater scale.  If the local committees of these regional health boards to be set up by the Minister in 1970 right up to 1971 do not afford an opportunity for those employed in the services to contribute their advice and guidance, then the effectiveness and authority of those committees will be considerably diminished.  There is a whole host of medical personnel in the <Col N="229" /> State, doctors, surgeons, county medical officers, pharmacists, dentists and so on and while they have representation at committee level on a limited scale, there are many other categories who should be able to select from among themselves substantial representation on these local committees.  It is a reflection on the democratic instincts of the State and on the representative capacity of our people that, for example, a whole range of para-medical staffs such as ambulance drivers, proters employed in hospitals, switchboard operators, ward attendants, laundry workers, dieticians, boilermen, radiographers, physiotherapists, social workers, almoners, together with the regular medical personnel, have, under this legislation, no formal involvement or participation at local committee level.  Accordingly, I would recommend that the Minister would give very serious consideration to this amendment.  It would be opening up, if I might bring in the vogue term, the concept of participative democracy, industrial democracy, whatever else one wants to call it.</P>

      <P>I do agree with the Deputy that in the modern world there must be more participation in discussion in relation to Government matters or local government matters.  The difficulty is how to provide for this without making the machinery unworkable.  In this case the proposed constitution for each of these local committees is two county councillors for each county electoral area, the county manager, the county medical officer or his equivalent, the resident medical superintendent of the district mental hospital, one general hospital consultant, two other doctors in the county elected by the profession and two other persons.  The two councillors for each county electoral area will be elected by the county council and the two other persons will also be elected by the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is more than possible that county councillors themselves would represent the interests of those who are regarded as staff and workers in an area. County councillors of all parties claim they represent, and listen to representations <Col N="230" /> from, people in the trade union world.  In their own right under the category of &ldquo;two other persons&rdquo;, if they so choose, they can appoint a person with trade union interests in mind or who represents particular classes of workers taking part in health administration.</P>
    <P>I find it very difficult to accept the amendment when I consider that there are some 15 organisations representing officers and servants of health authorities. I think it would be rather impracticable under present circumstances to provide that they should have their representatives attend the health committees. As the Deputy knows, conditions of employment are decided on by the chief executive officers of the health boards with an appeal to the Minister, and the trade unions have an ample opportunity to make such representation as they desire with regard to the changes in the conditions of employment.  Negotiations for remuneration are provided by conciliation and arbitration machinery.  Up to now this has not been a statutory machinery.  In the past the trade unions have engaged in discussion with the county managers but when this Bill is passed they will engage in discussions with the chief executive officers. There is nothing to prevent any group who represent officers and servants of the health authorities sending a deputation to discuss possible improvements in the health service in that area with the local committee.  That kind of work could prove to be most useful and I would regard it as a practical kind of participation.  Some of these 15 organisations might play a very minimal part in relation to the number of officers and servants belonging to them; but if any one of these organisations felt they really could contribute something they should be received by the local committees who would examine their grievances in relation to the character of the service and examine their grievances in relation to improvement of the service.  The committee could then make quite sure that the health board examines such proposals if the committee itself approved of them.</P>
    <P>I simply could not see a proliferation <Col N="231" /> of representatives over and beyond those I have already mentioned.  There will be a considerable number of people on these committees who will be very much aware of the views in regard to health services expressed by the representatives of the officers and servants of the health authorities.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the validity of what the Deputy is seeking in theory but I suggest the best way to deal with this is by discussion with the health committee. In that way the Deputy cannot say there is not participation.  The health committee itself can make no decisions; it can only give advice to the health board.  It can then make decisions in regard to recommendations if it so chooses, having met a deputation from any one of these organisations in an area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we must make a distinction between advice given, participation within and representative capacity.  I recall reading many of the Minister's speeches made in his other capacities during the last decade in which he was a consistent advocate of the concept of participation. It would be a rather futile exercise for any one of the 15 staff organisations referred to by the Minister to go cap in hand to give advice to the local advisory committee, who in their purely advisory capacity would in turn convey this to the regional health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot honestly accept the Minister's assurance that because there are 15 organisations representing officers on the health side it would be difficult for representation to be given to them on these committees.  The vast majority of the 15 organisations in question could nominate local committees on an area basis in the same way as the local harbour boards are nominated by the Trade Union Congress.  It is all very well to say to the nurses in the local hospitals that they can have their medical superintendent on the local committee but they cannot have representatives of the nurses' organisations.  The resident medical superintendent of the psychiatric hospitals may be on the local committee but the thousand <Col N="232" /> nurses in the hospitals within the area of that local committee will have no representative.  We are not asking for a very big concession because it has been clearly stated that the local committees are purely advisory ones.  All we are seeking is greater participation. It can be quite easily alleged that they will become monolithic bureaucratic structures, as they are in Dublin, catering for 1,000,000 people.  I hope that before the Report Stage the Minister will be able to find a solution to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sympathy with the Deputy in what he is seeking.  The nearest comparison I can think of is the joint consultative council in CIE in which the management staffs in regional areas meet the operative staffs and consider suggestions for the improvement of the service.  They also, of course, consider grievances, which are provided for in another way in this case.  I shall think the matter over and, if there is any way of providing some sort of consultative council, and if it is practicable to do so without making inroads on other local government legislation, which might confuse the issue, then I will so provide.  If I cannot so provide I still maintain that these groups of workers should be able to have effective participation through meeting the local committee on an arranged basis.  However, I shall consider what the Deputy has in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following new subsection:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  The number of members of the council of the county or county borough or Dún Laoghaire <Col N="233" /> Borough Council, as the case may be, provided for in regulations under subsection (2) of this section shall exceed half of the total membership of a local committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to secure that on the local committee a majority will be given to the representatives of those who are called on to pay for the services provided.  The Minister has already accepted the Fine Gael idea of providing that a majority on the local health board will be members of the local authority and the purpose of this amendment is to secure that a similar provision will apply in the case of local committees.  It would appear from the Minister's proposals that in a number of local committees the elected representatives will have a majority.  That would be the case where there would be eight electoral areas with two councillors from each area, which would give 16 councillors altogether; the people proposed by the Minister would number eight and that would give a two to one majority in favour of the local authority representatives.</P>
    <P>In some areas there would be no more than four electoral areas which would mean there would be only eight local councillors matched, on the Minister's proposals, by the county manager, the county medical officer, the resident medical superintendent of the district medical hospital, a consultant from a general hospital, two doctors residing in the county elected by the profession and two other persons.  The two doctors residing in the county would meet Deputy Dr. O'Connell's amendment but that amendment would, of course, impose a statutory obligation by giving such representation.  For the Minister simply to indicate his proposals does not amount to a statutory obligation.  The two other persons would presumably be the Minister's own nominees; both could be people of the calibre Deputy Desmond mentioned.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to accept what the Minister says in good faith, but he is Minister for <Col N="235" /> Health <i>pro tem.</i> There may be a change.  We have only got the Minister's statement to go on.  The section does not definitely indicate who the members of the local committee will be and I would be much happier if the Minister were prepared to embody this in legislation.  There are usually four electoral areas.  That is more or less the overall pattern, but it does not obtain in all cases.  You would have eight elected representatives, two from each electoral area.  On top of that, according to the Minister, you would have the county manager, the county medical officer, the resident medical superintendent of the district hospital, a consultant from a general hospital&mdash; that is four.  It is all a bit nebulous because, as far as I understand the Fitzgerald report, consultants will disappear altogether out of some counties. There will be no hospitals.  There would then be two doctors residing in the county elected by the profession; that makes six.  And there would be two other persons.  That means the local committee will be eight against eight.  Is that a satisfactory state of affairs?  Who has the majority?  Is it the people outside the elected representatives who have the majority or is it the elected representatives who have the majority?  It would appear that neither of these groups has the majority. It is eight and eight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9a, which stands in my own name and that of Deputy O'Connell, Deputy M. O'Leary and Deputy Cluskey:</P>
      <P>In subsection (5) (a), page 6, line 45, before &ldquo;on&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the general public&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to seek an expansion of the role of local committees.  What we have suggested is that, in addition to a local committee advising a health board on the provision of health services in the functional area of such committee, it should also have devolved on it the obligation to advise the general public.  It may be that objection will be raised on the grounds that this is an advisory board on the provision of services.  We take the broad interpretation of the term &ldquo;provision of services&rdquo; and we consider that it is not enough that a local committee should advise the board on the need for the provision of services in an area but should also perform the very useful social and public function of giving to the general public essential information on the entire range of health services available in a given area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in mind, for example, that there is an absence of effective public information and advice bureaux for a great many citizens entitled to health services.  If the amendment is accepted it may be that the health board will give local committees some appropriation of funds to enable them to perform this kind of essential work which would be of major public benefit.  I find that a great many constituents become befuddled and bemused by the complexity of the health services and are not aware of the facilities open to them or the precise manner in which they can avail of them.  I am also conscious of the fact that if this kind of work were done by local committees, then the total absence of Deputies from this House who should be concerned with the major matters of national legislation would be obviated; Deputies would be more frequently here rather than trying to unravel for constituents the complexities of health legislation.  This is the kind of work <Col N="238" /> that local committees could do extremely effectively.  They could delineate and make available in pamphlet form information for the public. Naturally, they would have close liaison with the welfare officers and other staffs in the areas of health committees.  They certainly could perform an essential function.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that at the moment there is full information on the range of facilities available to the public. Bearing in mind that the health services in many areas are administered on a selective, means test basis, and that there, therefore, must arise problems for many persons, it would be a very useful addition to this legislation if the Minister were to introduce an amendment on Report Stage to provide for this public necessity, if our amendment is not sufficiently precise.</P>

The preoccupation of a great many Deputies who may also be members of local authorities appears to be with getting the maximum number of persons appointed to these committees.  It is not the number that should be the important matter; it is the calibre of the persons appointed.

To come now, to the amendment, I consider it a very worthwhile amendment.  I can foresee a situation in which a lot of pressure would be taken off the shoulders of local and public representatives if this information were freely available from the local authority.  An advisory service should be set up to make known to people their entitlements.  I urge the Minister to give this amendment serious consideration.  It would dispel a lot of thinking in the minds of theorists that public representatives do not go to a lot of trouble to find out the position for people or alternatively claim they got the entitlement for them.  This is not to say that Deputies and county councillors do not do much good work for the people they represent.  However, the more information that emanates from the central or the local authority the better for the body politic and the better from the point of view of the esteem in which public representatives are held by the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the view that it is imperative not only to make the services technically available but to make them actually available and this requires a knowledge about the availability of the services.  There is no use in pretending that we assist the least fortunate in our community unless these people see to it that the services are there for them.  The danger is that we will make the administration of the services more remote from the people whom the services are intended to benefit.  The further we remove the administration of services from people the greater will be the possibility that people will not be aware of the services available to them.  I agree with Deputy Lenihan regarding the Bill as originally drafted.  It is within the competence of a local committee to exercise the function of communicating to the people the availability of services but I cannot see anything wrong in Dáil Éireann's imposing it as a specific statutory obligation.  It is undesirable to leave everything to the possible goodwill or good intentions or possible good practices of local committees. There might be local committees who would say, in effect: &ldquo;This is not our function.  It is part of the function of the Department of Health and we shall not bother with it&rdquo;.  If this is something which the local committee should do, let us write it into the Bill itself.</P>

      <P>In clause 99 of the 1947 Health Act, health authorities are permitted to provide information and advice on matters relating to health and it may be disseminated by the Minister or by local authorities through advertisements, notices, pamphlets, lectures, radio, cinema exhibitions or any other means.  I hope that one of the functions of the health board will be to provide information offices and, with them, information officers.  I agree that a considerable number of people are not aware of the scope of the services and how they apply to a particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some information offices already.  One is run by the Cork Health Authority&mdash;there may be some in Dublin, too&mdash;which, I am told, <Col N="241" /> operates very satisfactorily.  The provision of information offices depends on the raising of the necessary funds. The health board might not be able to accept proposals for too many information officers.  The health committee will have a very valuable function in advising where its information offices should be.  There is no need to write into the Bill a requirement that they should give advice to the general public because they are an advisory committee, reporting back to the health board and the county council.  Therefore, I would ask the House to leave this to the intelligence of the health boards who will be encouraged to promote information offices and the local committees can give them information as to where these should be.</P>

      <P>As one with experience in Cork I may say that this is in operation there for 12 months or more and is very satisfactory.  The local councils will know best where these centres should be placed.  It seems to me, however, that every representative will have in mind a place in his own locality and that we could have a multiplicity of centres as it would be very hard to refuse anybody's claim for his own locality, no matter how small it might be.  Once we say that the public should know exactly what they are entitled to &mdash;what the law provides for them&mdash;I think we are doing all we should do. We should have some confidence that the local authority will know best where these centres should be provided.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The object of this amendment is to provide that the public shall have more information on the health services and that it shall be a statutory obligation on a local committee to give this information on the health services within its functional area.  I gather from the Minister that the Act under which we operate at present contains a provision by which health boards and health authorities may give this information, but the object of this amendment is to impose on the committee a statutory obligation to give that information. This is a good thing and, as a matter of fact, there should be a statutory obligation on local committees to <Col N="242" /> advise the public regarding health hazards.</P>
      <P>At the moment the drug problem is very much before the public mind and I share the Minister's concern about this problem.  I do not intend to deal with it at length.  I am glad that it is now recognised by all that there is such a problem in our midst.  No opportunity should be lost to bring home to the public and the young people in general what the dangers are to health in drug trafficking or dabbling in drugs. The statutory obligation which is imposed here could be used in the future to expose the danger of a similar problem. While the drug problem is advertised considerably, I do not think that the danger to health and the ruin that can be brought to young lives is fully stressed.  I have in mind a programme on Radio Éireann last week when three young people were interviewed about the problem and the ways and means of getting drugs was discussed. The difference between the heavy drug and the less habit-forming drug was discussed but listening carefully to the programme, I noticed that sufficient emphasis was not given to the danger that can be done to health and lives through drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be a statutory obligation on a semi-State body like Radio Éireann and a statutory obligation on our local health committees and boards that when such subjects as drugs are being discussed it should not be taken for granted&mdash;I do not want to be critical of the programme which I am sure was very well-intentioned&mdash;that all young persons or people generally who are likely to be tempted to use drugs know all about their effects.  I am afraid that this programme in which these teenagers took part assumed that every other teenager in the country knew the great danger involved even in experimenting with drugs.  The programme was spoiled because a few minutes were not devoted to emphasising that even experimenting or dabbling in drugs for the sake of experience could lead bit by bit to a habit-forming practice which could end up by people who started to experiment for &ldquo;kicks&rdquo; or experience spending the rest of their lives in and out of mental or similar <Col N="243" /> institutions.  Let me return to the amendment and become completely relevant.  If a statutory obligation were placed on a local health committee to advise not alone a health board but the general public on the health services and health hazards in general it would be a very good thing.</P>

      <P>In view of the support given to this matter, perhaps, the Minister, on Report Stage, could under Part V incorporate the suggestion about public information.  I have no great objection to health boards having this function and disseminating information at local committee level.  Perhaps the Minister would consider introducing an amendment on that basis on Report Stage.  We welcome the Minister's innovation in regard to drugs but there is no point in prohibiting drugs if people do not know what their effects may be.</P>

      <P>Members of the House have given me some very useful advice on this and on Report Stage and, perhaps, we will consider bringing in an amendment which would impose on regional health boards the obligation of establishing information offices, but the number of them and where they would be located would be for the health board.  However, as in everything connected with health, this would depend on finance because we would have to plan in such a way that an over-enthusiastic regional board could not establish information offices in far too many areas, having regard to present day travelling habits and the facilities of communication.  I will consider that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to dangerous drugs&mdash;we do not want to have a debate on this&mdash; I agree with a great deal of what Deputy Fitzpatrick said.  We have not received any advice yet on the particular <Col N="244" /> form of publicity to be used in connection with dangerous drugs, from the dangerous drugs working party.  I understand from the experts that human psychology is something that has to be attended to with great care because there is an awful fear that if you give too much publicity to drugs you encourage drugs even though you warn people of their effects.  I am not an expert and I am awaiting more advice.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not want to be misunderstood about this.  I know that the Minister is very concerned about the drug position but what I am concerned about is that there is a considerable amount of publicity about drugs, and rightly so, but that publicity seems to assume that every teenager and every adult has been fully instructed and advised about the dreadful dangers inherent even in embarking as an isolated experience on taking drugs.  I am afraid the danger is not as fully or as widely appreciated as the experts think.  Even at the risk of using a mallet to kill a fly, every time the drug question is discussed or mentioned the inherent dangers should be ventilated.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 7 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage I mentioned that it might be desirable to ensure that at least some members of the local committee should also be members of the local health board.  The advantage of that is to have a situation in which members of the local health board would be acutely and directly aware of local health needs.  It is quite possible that this will, in fact, occur that some of the members of the local committee and of the health board will be the same people.  I think that is desirable.  It may be difficult to write it into regulations but it is probably something local authority members will bear in mind in making the appointments. It is something we should think about because of its desirability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some respects it is a pity that the Minister is proposing that the local <Col N="245" /> committee will be only an advisory body because there are some areas which are geographically remote from centres of concentrated population which will have peculiar difficulties and which, perhaps, should be administered locally.  It may be insufficient to have a local advisory body without any administrative powers.  Therefore, we urge on the Minister that the peculiar problems of isolated districts receive special consideration so that where you have hospitals and other services far removed from the centre of a health area, local executive powers would be given to the local committee.  If you do not do that there is a grave danger that the services would become inefficient and unobtainable in the more remote areas.  If we are careful in making the regulations we can avoid these things.  One of the great drawbacks about this section is that the regulations which the Minister is to make creating the local health committees, dealing with terms of appointment, tenure of office, disqualification, removal of members, appointment of the chairman and vice-chairman, holding of meetings and so on will not be reviewed by this House.  They will not be open to suggestions by this House although they will probably be open to review under amendment by this House.  They are to be made by the Minister only after consultation with certain local authorities but he may consult them and feel in no way bound by the advice he receives from them.</P>
    <P>We think it undesirable that regulations so far-reaching in their effects, so far as health services are concerned, should be made by the Minister without having to come before this House for consideration at the time of the initiation of the regulations.  We would like to know what steps the Minister proposes to take to have further consultations regarding the regulations that he will make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have given enough indication of the method by which these local committees will be appointed and I hope the House will take my word for it.  Naturally, there will be no change when I publish the regulations.  I think we are sufficiently <Col N="246" /> democratic here, certainly to the point where if I were to publish regulations that did not, in fact, come before this House&mdash;they do not have to under the Bill&mdash;there would be certain protest in the House if I quite obviously departed from what had been clearly said in the House.  I should be a very foolish man to do so.</P>
      <P>As regards remote areas, in subsection (5) (b) of section 7 it is provided that a local committee shall perform such other functions as may, subject to any limitation specified by the Minister, be delegated to it by the appropriate health board.  As the House is aware, this is a complex piece of legislation and we want to make quite sure that the new regional health boards operate not only efficiently but with due regard to the health service needs in every area.  The delegation of functions by a health board offers interesting possibilities.  I do not pretend that at this stage I have thought them over.</P>
      <P>One of the possibilities is that one might give specific executive authority to a health committee in relation to a particular service in a remote area. This must be very carefully examined. We do not want to make regional health boards ineffective through too much delegation of work to executive committees.  At the same time, we want to ensure that a health board, as Deputy Ryan suggested, should not become monolithic and indifferent. I think we shall arrive at this partly through the advice we shall receive from health boards who can make suggestions to me about delegation of functions and partly through some ideas we may have in the Department on this matter.  I think I could satisfy the Deputy by telling him that it is possible that a local committee could have some particular function, especially in a remote area where there are problems but, of course, they cannot have the function of raising finance.</P>

      <P>I have not really thought it out.  I hope the Deputy will forgive me.  This is an immensely complicated measure and I have not thought it out but I suppose that under the circumstances a local committee might have an executive function in relation to the provision of the general medical service and the operation of medical service and the operations of financing that particular service must come to the regional health board but they might be able to give very valuable advice in areas where questions arose about the choice of doctor scheme or the appointment of additional dispensary officers because the choice of doctor system was not providing sufficient medical assistance or in dealing with areas where, because of their remoteness, it is very hard to find a doctor.  I shall not commit myself to this but it is a good example of what could be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Those health committees in some counties rarely met.  There seems to be no machinery for convening them except for <i>ad hoc</i> purposes. I take it that it will be provided by regulation or otherwise that those local committees will meet at some regular intervals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall consider that. As everybody knows, if an advisory committee is effective it is ultimately the result of enthusiastic members.  If they are to be effective they cannot be talking-shops or exercise their function of visiting without due preparation and, as everybody in local and national government knows, an advisory committee depends for its success on the enthusiasm of the members in asking for an agenda, for reports, for discussion on particular matters, services and problems.  I think I must leave it to the initiative of the committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy says, there are some <Col N="248" /> quite effective health committees throughout the country and there are others where the members, in their wisdom, have not been active.  It is not for me to criticise them or pronounce on their activity or inactivity.  This is part of what Deputy Desmond described as participation.  The local committees will have to listen to the voices of those who say: &ldquo;For heaven's sake, participate.&rdquo;  They must have an agenda, work to do, specific objectives, so that they will ask for reports in advance, make inspections and do work.  If they simply sit and talk, and listen to some report prepared for them by the local medical officer, they will quickly vanish.</P>
    <P>I know that these committees will be quite capable of doing very useful work in stressing the needs of the health services in a regional board which covers a number of counties. This will be a spur to them.  Now that there is a regional board, one county council area will be very anxious to make sure that it participates adequately. Perhaps, the regional board concept will result in these committees being more active than voluntary committees established in connection with county councils.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the local committees to a certain extent will be rather filleted boards?  They are in the position that they can give advice to the regional boards.  I see certain controversies that are likely to arise in the general pattern and set-up of the new idea with regard to the health services being transferred on a regional basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, without going very deeply into it, there is one thing that will arouse the widest controversy and that will be the question of the spacing of regional hospitals.  The local committees who, naturally, will be the people in the best position to advise on what is beneficial and necessary to their own particular interest, are there purely in an advisory capacity.  That is all right.  They will give their advice for what it is worth to the regional <Col N="249" /> board, but there is nothing in the Bill to support them in any way.</P>
    <P>For instance, if I happened to be on a local committee and the Minister, say, was on a regional board and I proffered certain advice to him, it could simply be marked &ldquo;Read&rdquo;. That is all.  I should like to see some measure introduced in this legislation under which it would be necessary for the regional board to take cognisance of the advice offered to them by the local committee.  Perhaps, the precedent for that would be in the National Health Council.  The National Health Council is the advisory board that comes to mind in this instance.  It advises the Minister.  The advice which this board gives to the Minister is known because a report is issued at the end of every year.  It is placed in the Library and becomes an official document.</P>
    <P>I can envisage a local committee having a particular grievance and meeting and making certain suggestions to a regional board on which they have only a limited number of representatives and might be outvoted. They express their opinion to the regional board and the board say: &ldquo;We will not take any notice one way or the other.&rdquo;  Where do we go from there?  If they have no statutory function, so to speak, they have no means of enforcing their opinions. They have virtually no official publicity other than what they can get in the press.  We do not know whether their meetings are to be private or public.  We must bring democracy into the health services.  We cannot deal with them entirely by regulation.  We must give every section and every area the right to express their opinion.</P>
    <P>I agree that the concept here is good and that a local committee should be set up to deal with local problems but there is nothing to ensure that they will be listened to.  I have a feeling, with the best will in the world towards this section, that it is not giving the local committees the opportunity of making their opinions widely known and not endeavouring to create a situation in which the regional board must take cognisance of what they say <Col N="250" /> and the recommendations they offer whether they accept them or not.  I should like the Minister to give us his opinion on the opinion I have expressed.</P>

I should like to make sure that the Minister will continue the local health committee that has been working in Dún Laoghaire for many years.  I would say to Deputy Dr. Gibbons that it works there very successfully and I should like to see it continuing to do so.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately for us in Dún Laoghaire, in the Minister's origional suggestion we were to have only one member on the regional board.  I should like to press the Minister at this stage to tell us how many he will put on the regional board so that we can service the local health committee in Dún Laoghaire.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> This section proposes to set up local committees which will be purely advisory bodies.  Even in that capacity, under section 7 (5) (a) they can do good work provided that the Minister does not kill them before they are brought into existence, so to speak.  It is essential that these local committees should not be regarded as a replica of the Custom House or as committees controlled absolutely by the Minister's office.</P>
      <P>As these committees were envisaged in the memorandum circulated by the Minister, they were to consist, in an average county with four electoral areas, of eight elected representatives and eight other persons.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had replied by describing the general functions of these committees.  They are advisory committees.  They can give advice in the ordinary way on all sections of the health service in their area.  They can advise the regional health board as to what they consider should be the function of a particular hospital in that area.  Quite obviously, if we are going to accept the regionalisation principle and everything implied therein, local committees will administer the health services in general in their area.  They cannot make decisions in regard to a number of aspects of the health service in that area and the reasons for this have been explained.</P>
      <P>In the modern world it is essential to enlarge the area of health administration. It is being done in all civilised countries.  It arises from modern techniques of medicine; it arises because of the enormous costs of health and hospital services in every country; it arises because of the growth of specialisation and the scarcity of certain types of specialists, which is likely to continue for some time; and it arises because of the high cost of the very complicated equipment and machinery now being used.  This has been explained at great length and it has been accepted by a great many people from all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>The local committee might be given some comparatively minor executive function but it is the business of the regional health board to provide the services in the area.  There will be a regional hospital board, arising on another section, which will give advice on the planning of all the hospitals in a regional area, and the appointment of Comhairle na nOspidéal will arise for consideration later in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never seen any lack of publicity arising from strong feelings held by our community in regard to changes <Col N="257" /> in its way of life.  I do not think we can make any change in this Bill, by way of amendment, which could prevent representations of the most massive kind being made in any country area or any town area, if public opinion were strongly against a proposal to change materially the function of some very big unit of health administration &mdash;and everyone in this House knows exactly what I mean by that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has quite understood the point I was trying to make. I am not against the regional system; I just want adequate safeguards.  There must be local problems and the position with regard to the local committee is that they may issue advice but there is nothing to certify that they will be listened to.  I want it to be mandatory on the regional board at least to discuss and consider the advice they receive from a local committee. That would satisfy me and I think it would satisfy the local committee as well.  As the legislation stands at the moment the position is that the local committee may offer profound and good advice to a regional committee but there is nothing to stop the regional committee from putting a red mark through it and ignoring it.  Surely the Minister could devise some scheme whereby it would be mandatory on the regional committee to take cognizance of the advice of the local committee? We cannot deny that the existing health authorities are being virtually abolished so far as the conduct of their own health and sanitary affairs is concerned. They will have to rely on what the regional committee decides to do. I feel the local committees have the right to be heard and the right to receive some communication from the regional board to say that their case is at least being debated.  That is the point I am trying to make.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy still requires it I am quite prepared on the Report Stage to put in such a clause. I do not think it is necessary but if Deputies think this clause would have a good effect by compelling a regional health board to take cognizance of recommendations made in regard to <Col N="258" /> health services in an area, I am quite prepared to put it in.  I do not think it will have the effect that the Deputy imagines it will.  There are two points of view about that.  My own belief is that these regional health boards will be bound to take cognizance of such recommendations, but to satisfy the House and give more teeth to the local committees I will put in an amendment stating that they must have cognizance of the local committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>Our experience in Cork has not been like that suggested by Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde.  A regional board in the new situation will have a majority of public representatives and some of these people will, more likely than not, be on the advisory board.  They will have public meetings as at present.  Public representatives are never slow in ventilating any grievance they have; they will make sure that the regional health board will take cognisance of them.  If it were to happen that the regional health board did not do so there would be a tremendous amount of criticism of the regional board at the next meeting. As the principal voice in both the local committee and the regional health board will be that of the public representative, there is no doubt whatever that cognisance will be taken of any legitimate claim or grievance.</P>

      <P>The health board could appoint a committee to discuss, for example, the general organisation of the medical service and the choice of doctor.  They could discuss how far the crossing of county boundaries would make such a service more effective, and the executive committee would then report back to the regional <Col N="259" /> health board.  It could even be given a function of overseeing the general medical services for an entire area for as long as the regional health board desires.  That is only one of many examples.  It would have another committee examining district hospitals within the regional board area, making reports on their operation, on their efficiency and on the work they were doing.  I could think of any number of examples.  We do not want to exhaust the members of a regional health board by their having too many executive committees.  In the matter of good management and, at the same time, attention to detail it would be very difficult for me to spell it all out at this stage.  There are committees of local authorities, as Deputies are well aware, and it is a matter of working out what type of executive committee is advisable.</P>

      <P>The amendment which has been ruled out of order is an amendment which sought to delete from this section the words &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;. It is appalling that in a Bill of this magnitude, under which £50 million will be spent, there is this unnecessary insertion which provides that puny expenditure cannot be incurred by a responsible health board, under the advice and control of a responsible Minister for Health, after it has been processed from the local committee to the local health board to the regional hospital board, to the Department of Health, until their majesties, in the guise of some executive officer in the Department of Finance, say: &ldquo;That is all right.  You may increase the mileage allowance from 1/- to 1/1d. per mile.&rdquo; This is appalling nonsense.  You have this duplication of the deadhand of bureaucracy running through this <Col N="260" /> whole Bill and it was in relief of the taxpayer and the ratepayer, and to avoid the folly of undue processing of every minute expenditure, that I sought to have this deleted.  It is an appalling reflection on the Minister for Health, on the regional hospital boards, on the health boards and the committees to provide that every expenditure they consider proper and valid cannot be incurred until some junior official in the Department of Finance applies his great brains to the matter.  This is the kind of nonsense which brings Parliament and the administration of the State into well-deserved contempt.  I urge the Minister and his colleagues, the Members of this House and the Members of the Seanad and the Parliamentary draftsman to put an end to this unnecessary consultation with the Department of Finance in relation to matters which are certainly not deserving of the enormous administrative cost and waste of time involved in this kind of unnecessary consultation.</P>

There is nothing in the Bill to prevent them rotating their meetings, if they so desire, but such rotation might make it difficult for the staff of the health board who would have to travel around with all the information and records that would be required.  There is, however, nothing in the Bill to prevent rotation.</P>

      <P>I agree whole-heartedly with what Deputy Ryan has said about the last phrase in this section. The fact of the matter is this is undiluted hogwash.  The section should read: &ldquo;Payments under this section shall be in accordance with a scale determined by the Minister.&rdquo;  That would be both sensible and reasonable. Presumably, he will determine the matter for the whole country.  Put in here, probably by some clerk in the Department of Finance when the Bill was being drafted, is the phrase &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.  Actually that has no meaning, but I agree with Deputy Ryan that this is the kind of thing which has brought the Oireachtas into contempt. Allowing clerks in the Civil Service to behave like this has earned for this Oireachtas the well-deserved contempt of a great many people.  I could talk about this at length.  As one of the newspapers remarked last week, what was being discussed here last week was the kind of society we are to have and this kind of thing&mdash;creating expenditure, not saving money&mdash;is anathema. There is expenditure involved in typing letters and memoranda and sending them to the Department of Finance, in circulating these around the various divisions, in opening files and all the rest of it.  I know the whole story though, indeed, the Department of Finance was much smaller when I was there and it had a great deal more control and better control over expenditure than it has today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Finance like certain people exists by sticking its nose into everything.  I remember a man asking me on one occasion to describe the functions of the Department and, when I had finished, he said: &ldquo;You know, the Department of Finance must be the greatest lot of Nosey Parkers <Col N="262" /> ever.&rdquo;  This is an example of Nosey-Parkerism and nothing else.  Literally, there is no meaning in it.  What the Minister puts up will be accepted, but some officials will write to one another between the two Departments and some officials will do the same in the Department of Finance.  I do not mind officials in the Department of Health writing to one another inside the Department of Health because someone has to come to a decision as to what the proper expenditure should be.  But this is not a complicated or a difficult matter.  We have, of course, the position where even the expenses of this House are determined with the consent of the Minister for Finance, an absurd and ridiculous position.  It would be very easy to talk at length about this.  I agree with Deputy Ryan that this last phrase is an utter absurdity.</P>

      <P>One of the privileges enjoyed by Labour Deputies is that they need not necessarily agree with one another.  I could not accept Deputy Ryan's amendment at all nor could I support the concept.  There is the basic question, whether we like it or not as Members of this House, <Col N="263" /> the question of public accountability and the ultimate accountability&mdash;the accountability of public officers, of elected public representatives, to the Exchequer for every penny of national expenditure&mdash;and it would be quite inappropriate that, for example, the Minister for Health should fix scales of expenses, travelling rates and so on, in respect of these boards, which could be quite heavy because of the large distances to be covered by the members in the performance of their duty and that similarly other Ministers of State could have equal leniency in fixing rates.  Equally, there would be the overall problem of individual pressures being brought on Ministers.  I know that one can be very critical of the Minister for Finance and so on but if it is £50 million that must be spent, it must be spent properly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is, perhaps, a legalistic matter.  Nevertheless, I should like it clarified.  There is provision in subsection (3) (d) and (e) for the use of a common seal by a joint board and this runs into two lengthy subsections. I notice that the same matter is got over in one simple subsection in section 5 subparagraph (c) in relation to a single health board.  That subparagraph says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the board shall provide and have a common seal and all courts of <Col N="264" /> justice shall take judicial notice of the seal;</P>
    <P>but, when we come to a joint board we say:</P>
    <P>the board shall provide and have a common seal which shall be authenticated by the signature of the chairman or some other member authorised to act in that behalf and the signature of an officer of the board authorised to act in that behalf.</P>
    <P>and in (e):</P>
    <P>judicial notice shall be taken of the seal of the board and every document purporting to be an order or other instrument made by it and to be sealed with its seal (purporting to be authenticated in accordance with paragraph (d)) shall be received in evidence and be deemed to be that order or instrument without further proof unless the contrary is shown.</P>
    <P>I do not know why it is necessary to spell the matter out at such tremendous length in section 10 when it was able to be dealt with in a very simple way in section 5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The section does look rather immense to me, too, but, apparently, the simplest thing to do was more or less to copy section 45 of the Health Act, 1953, and this is to enable us, if necessary, to appoint health boards as bigger units than the proposed health boards.  They can be appointed, apparently, for specific administrative purposes.  In other words, you can have two health boards joined together for the purpose of drug pricing and payment of doctors under the general medical service, as an administrative device to save expense in administration. There are a number of matters where it would be possible for two health boards to reduce expenditure by combining together and, apparently, if they do this, such is the general law in regard to boards&mdash; Deputy Ryan may know about the legal side&mdash;you do have to have all these provisions in regard to perpetual succession and so forth, even if the joint board so created may have very, very limited powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="265" /> On the question of the seal, there is the general provision in regard to the seal that is in section 30 of the Second Schedule which says:</P>
    <P>The seal of the board shall be authenticated by the signature of the chairman (or some other member authorised to act in that behalf) and the signature of an officer of the board authorised to act in that behalf.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11.</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 8, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) a draft of an order which it is proposed to make under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 11 is that section of the Bill which purports to give the Minister power to remove from office the members of a health board if it does not do certain things which the Minister considers the board should do. The effect of our amendment is to provide that, if the Minister feels that way, he ought to come to the Houses of the Oireachtas to justify the opinion which he has and to justify the action which he is about to take.  The effect of this, therefore, would be to prevent a Minister taking punitive action against a board which was in disagreement with him.  The effect of our amendment is such that the Minister would have to justify before that bar of public opinion, before his peers in the Houses of the Oireachtas, action <Col N="266" /> which he wanted to take.  It might also help to have a public debate upon the issue upon which a board and a Minister might be in disagreement.</P>
    <P>If one considers the position which exists in Dublin, one can see merit in the proposal which we have tabled.  In Dublin, the health authority is spending about £10 million, half of which comes from an area which is not represented on that health authority because the Minister for Local Government saw fit to dismiss from office the councillors of the Dublin Corporation who were of the same opinion as is held by all parties in this House, that the rates were not a proper system for the financing of the health services, and the only difference between Dublin Corporation and other people who have the same view is that Dublin Corporation said that not only do we consider the doing of the thing to be wrong but we will not do what we consider to be wrong and because Dublin Corporation were loyal to their own convictions and refused to do what they considered to be unjust, they were abolished.</P>
    <P>It does seem to be wholly undesirable that in circumstances in which responsible elected public representatives find themselves in conflict with the Minister on a matter of principle, the Minister can simply by an order signed at midnight dismiss them from office and appoint his own gauleiter to conduct the affairs of the local authority and to presume to represent the people who are being taxed in such a severe way. It is essential where there is taxation, that there should be representation. We have not that in the Dublin region at present.  We are seeking to insert this amendment to ensure that if ever the Minister wants taxation without representation he must come to the Oireachtas to justify what he is about to do.  If the Minister is certain he is doing the right thing he should have no reason to fear coming before the Houses of the Oireachtas to justify his action.  If the Minister is unwilling to accept our amendment it would appear the reason is that he fears an occasion might arise when he could be embarrassed if he sought to justify in <Col N="267" /> public the abolition of a health board. The matter is crucial.  It goes to the very roots of democratic practice.  It is an amendment which any Minister, confident that he is doing the right thing, should not hesitate to accept.</P>

      <P>I want the House to appreciate that not included in this section is power to remove a board where there is a dispute in relation to the raising of necessary finance for carrying on the health services: that remains within the power of the Minister for Local Government.  He alone could take this action which he has taken, I believe quite rightly, but it does not arise on this Bill.  The reasons for removing from office a health board are clearly stated here.  They do not relate to any crisis that would arise of the kind that arose in the case of Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>Members of the House can read for themselves the circumstances under which I can remove from office the members of a health board.  I do not think it needs a debate here to do this. I do not see why I should not have the power.  It will be exercised only very rarely.  Quite obviously, there will have to be some extraordinary circumstances for me to remove a health board.  Quite evidently, the health board would have collapsed: there would be malfunctioning in such a way that the health services would be in a state of chaos.  This is most unlikely to happen.  If it does happen, I think the Minister for Health of the day should have the powers provided in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. It gives a built-in safeguard of general public accountability of the Minister for Health to this House in relation to his actions.  No analogy should be drawn between local government and the functions of county councils or borough authorities and, literally, the mini-Dáils, on a health basis, that we are now constituting.  I think the members of these very large bodies&mdash;30-odd members on average&mdash; should be given the maximum possible security of tenure as appointed or elected members in the performance <Col N="268" /> of their functions.  It is unwise, undemocratic and generally undesirable that any Minister of State should arrogate to himself the power, even in the extreme he has outlined, to dismiss and abolish such a board.  Deputy Ryan's proposition that a draft order for the abolition of such a board should be laid before this House and should not be promulgated until the House has approved of it is a reasonable, rational and utterly desirable approach.</P>
      <P>Dublin Health Authority has now an income of some £10 million.  While the effect of disbursement of that money is a matter of national concern, I do not think that the entire scrutiny of such boards should lie in the hands of any one Minister.  While we regard the present Minister as relatively more enlightened, we tremble to think that some of his colleagues in the Cabinet would share health responsibility at this point of time.  We should be very perturbed as to what they might do if a health board in the 1970 or 1971 period became somewhat obstreperous. As can arise in any of these health board areas, you could have the explosive, very emotional issue of hospital functions, of the siting of regional hospitals, of a whole range of services under the health board, which could bring a health board into very sharp conflict with the Minister.  Any Minister would be extremely wise to have recourse to the House for full backing if he came into such public conflict which warranted their summary and general dismissal.</P>
      <P>The Minister also refers to a local inquiry in paragraph (a) of section 11 &mdash;wherever he is satisfied, after holding a local inquiry into the board's performance of its duties, that the duties are not being duly and effectually performed. I am concerned that there is no outline to the House as to what would constitute a local inquiry under the health board.  It may well be contained within the regulations.  I think, however, it should clearly be outlined here in respect of local inquiries because many of us are rather cynical about these particular operations, on occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister would be unwise to take this power to himself.  Consider, <Col N="269" /> for instance the board representing the greater Dublin region.  It will operate for some one million people.  I do not think final authority should rest with the Minister in relation to the disbandment of the boards.  We are seeking Ministerial accountability to this House for actions he might wish to take.</P>
    <P>We do not accept the outline of the function in the explanatory memorandum in which we read that, under section 11, the Minister will be given power similar to that which exists in respect of local authorities in Part IV of the Local Government Act, 1941, to remove from office, and so on, members of a health board.  While the powers are now similar as contained in this Bill, the conception of the whole arrangement, of the whole rationalisation of the health services as now envisaged is so totally different that it cannot be given any comparison with local authorities or urban district councils which might become obstreperous and be removed overnight by the State.  With the health board, at long last, bringing the regional concept into Ireland, we should be extremely careful about built-in safeguards and devices which Deputy Ryan has quite rightly proposed to the House.</P>

Paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of subsection (1), of section 11, spell out clearly where the board is automatically removed&mdash;if and whenever the board has refused or neglected to comply with a judgement, order or decree of any court; if and whenever the board has refused, after due notice, to allow its accounts to be audited by the auditor appointed for that purpose under section 27 or if and whenever the members of the board capable of acting are less in number than the quorum for meetings of the board.</P>

He will hold the usual public inquiry and that is the best means of getting at the truth in any event.  It is not a departmental inquiry, it is a public inquiry and I think we are all used to them.  The Minister will tell us the type it will be but I take it that it will be of the normal model.  There is in this section a built-in safeguard for the public that these mini-Dáils, as somebody described them, will do their job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Contrary to what Deputy Lenihan said, there is no built-in safeguard for the public in the section but we are endeavouring to put in the safeguard by requiring the Minister to justify his action here at the bar of public opinion in Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann.  We say that if he proposes to tax people in respect of services and then deprive those people of representation he should justify doing that through the national Parliament That is the built-in safeguard.  We do not think there is adequate protection in having a local inquiry conducted by an inferior in the Minister's own Department who will be conscious of whatever resentment the Minister may feel and will go to the public inquiry to collect the evidence which will justify the conclusion he brings into the inquiry.  That is the nature of a local inquiry of the kind we had in Dublin last year.  That is the nature of all such local inquiries.  We do not think that is protection for the public, the ratepayer, the taxpayer, the person for whom the services are intended to be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am prepared to accept that there is no need for either a local inquiry or for a justification to the Houses of the Oireachtas if a board should refuse or neglect to comply with the judgement of a court, or refuses to have its accounts audited, or if it becomes so depleted in numbers that it cannot discharge effectively its duties, but allowing for that we can on the Report Stage make further amendments to ensure that the particular safeguard we are bringing in is not applied unnecessarily in circumstances in relation to <Col N="271" /> which there can be no answer.  However, this does not in any way qualify what we have said in favour of our amendment where there is a clash of opinion between the Minister on the one hand and the local health board on the other as to the way in which the local health board should be discharging its duties.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation it is open to a local health authority to provide a service even if the Minister for Health does not approve of it, provided it is paid for out of the local rates.  A number of such services are being provided for throughout the country and more power to the local authorities who do it, even where they have to carry the full cost from the rates.  They do it because they are much closer to the needs of the public than the Department of Health.  Under this legislation such power is taken away from the local representatives so that in future if the local representatives with their immediate knowledge of the needs of a neighbourhood, in the exercise of their own inclinations to be humanitarian, decide to provide certain services for which the Minister is not prepared to pay, or towards which he is not prepared to make a contribution, they may find themselves in a situation in which the Minister may say &ldquo;We will not allow you to do that because we will not allow it to be done in other areas.&rdquo; In such a case there could be a clash and it should be imposed on the Minister as an obligation to come before the Oireachtas to say why he considers such a service should not be provided.</P>
    <P>The Minister replying to some of my earlier remarks said that my remarks were not justified because the Minister for Local Government was the person who now had and in future would have the power to abolish the health authorities if they did not do what Dublin Corporation would not do, and that is strike a rate for the health services.  The Minister, however, in his explanatory memorandum says that in this Bill he is seeking the same power as the Minister for Local Government had until now so that he can exercise it.  In other words, he will not have to rely on the Minister for Local <Col N="272" /> Government to exercise it, in future. He is seeking to do exactly the same thing as happened in the Dublin region.  The Minister may say that striking the rate is a matter for the local authority and not the health authority and technically he is right. But in the health board the annual estimates have to be adopted and the local health board will then have to send a warrant or a mandate to the local authority for the amount of money required to service the health services within the board's area.  However, if a board in its wisdom decides that a warrant or the bill should not go to the local authority but to the Minister, then the Minister for Health would use the power he seeks in this to abolish the board for daring to send the bill to him even though all parties in this State pretend to believe that the rates are not a proper system for the financing of health services.  But if any health authority in pursuance of its own convictions, in discharge of what it says to the public it knows to be the right thing, proposes to act in accordance with its beliefs then the Minister can abolish that health authority.  We believe that in that case the Minister should come before Parliament and justify his action and if he is not prepared to do that he stands condemned.</P>

      <P>While Deputy Ryan and Deputy Desmond are very anxious to get rid of the Minister here neither of them has made a convincing case, because hearkening back to what happened in the case of Dublin Corporation is not a very good comparison.  So far as the Minister for Health is concerned the function of financing falls to the Minister for Local Government and the local authorities.  I would ask the Deputies to suppose the Minister for Local Government had not been able to exercise the power he exercised elsewhere what would have been the state of health of the community in the city of Dublin and its surroundings?  Who was going to provide the wherewithal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to provide the necessary services for the people of <Col N="273" /> Dublin?  It is all very fine for Deputies to stand up and try to whitewash the actions of the people who undertook a specific job and when the bill was presented ran away from it, in effect.  I do not accept that sort of argument in discussing the power provided here for the Minister.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the Deputies opposite have a great trust in the human element and, in making a case for mitigation as it were of the Minister's powers, have put forward the argument that all members of society, shall we say, who are members of local authorities are above reproach. You could meet various obstacles and I think it wise that the Minister should have power to deal with disciplinary matters of this kind.</P>
      <P>The former Health Act was mentioned in connection with this amendment and in connection with health boards.  This is the first time in our health system that a board will be a statutory corporation, which means that the board may sue and be sued and therefore, to my mind, has a prime responsibility for the administration of the health services in its area.  Therefore, it seems that if there is a refusal on the part of any health board or, for example, if a health board persist in holding meetings with full representation from the various counties, or at least a quorum, then the Minister should rightly have the power to inter &mdash; vene and call for a local inquiry &mdash; and these are the words &mdash; to suspend the health board.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Deputy Ryan's amendment.  In doing so I am sorry that the draft of an order which should come before these Houses should also refer to paragraphs (1) (b), (c) and (d) as well as paragraph (1) (a) because in paragraph (1) (a) the type of local inquiry is not specified, whether it is to be Departmental or judicial.  The Minister should specify the type of inquiry he has in mind.  In paragraph (d) I should like definition of the words &ldquo;capable of acting&rdquo;.  This is very loose terminology and open to political bigotry which is something that we are trying <Col N="274" /> to avoid in the administration of this new Health Bill.  To safeguard the public interest it is essential that the Minister should accept Deputy Ryan's amendment because unless members of local authorities are guaranteed a certain amount of freedom from interference by the Minister, the public will lose interest and respect for them. The Government should take heed of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the confusion in Deputy Carter's mind on this I wish to emphasise to the House that we in the Labour Party are not in any way objecting to paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of section 11.  If the health board fails to comply with the judgment of any judicial court I have not the slightest objection to its being disbanded. Likewise, if it refuses to allow its accounts to be audited they should get a hammering on that basis or if the members were so indolent as to fail to turn up for meetings of the board, let us &ldquo;scrub&rdquo; them, to use popular terminology.  We do strongly object, above all, to the phrase used by the Minister &ldquo;duly and efficiently performed&rdquo;.  This is an extremely subjective concept.  How am I to say whether the Minister performs his duties in a duly effectual manner?  I submit that any Minister, if perverse enough&mdash;and we are legislating for the next 40 years in this measure in relation to the new composition of the health boards&mdash;who arrives at such a conclusion would be given freedom under this provision to invoke that particular paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the serious objection in relation to the local inquiry.  I know that you can marry into this particular piece of inquiry apparatus the provisions relating to local government, but we are concerned that where a local inquiry is held it should, above all, be seen to be a public inquiry.  I do not think that any officer or servant of a health board, if he is conscious that he has performed his duties to the best of his ability, would fear a public inquiry, whether he be the CEO or any subordinate officer.  Therefore, a clearcut statement by the Minister that it would be a local, public inquiry into a health board would mitigate our <Col N="275" /> objections to this particular section. But I think Deputy Ryan's amendment, namely, that where you want an abolition you can bring a draft order before the House to justify it is an eminently sane and reasonable proposition and in the best interests of health and the people working in these health boards and is well worthy of support.  I do not think Deputy Carter's preoccupation with the abolition of the Dublin local authorities has any particular relevance to the points we have made here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall compromise with the views of members of the Opposition by putting down an amendment specifying &ldquo;a public local inquiry&rdquo;.  In fact, I understand the inquiry would be public.  It is inconceivable that, if a board was so unsatisfactory that we had to have an inquiry, despite its being composed of members of local authorities from all the parties, or at least the major ones, professional consultants and other persons with a high reputation in their county, in most cases, for good service to the community, the Minister would intervene in this way unless something very serious had gone wrong.  The inquiry will be in public and I shall arrange for the necessary amendment.</P>
      <P>I want to get out of everybody's mind the connection with&mdash;although I defend the Minister's decision in every way&mdash;what the Minister for Local Government did in relation to Dublin Corporation; it so happens that the question of what he did then is not apposite to the amendment put down here.  Deputy Ryan said that a health board could refuse to send a warrant or demand for the local contribution to the local authority and could be dissolved for this reason.  Section 31 (3) says:</P>
      <P>Each local authority required under this Act to appoint members of a health board shall each year make to the board at the times specified by the Minister such contributions as may be specified by regulations made by the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The obligation, therefore, is on the <Col N="276" /> local authority to contribute and would come from regulations of the Minister for Local Government.  There will be no statutory demand by the health board on the local authority.  Accordingly, the issue of the removal of members for refusing to make a demand could not arise.  In other words, if people in their great unwisdom chose to do the same thing as Dublin Corporation did it would have to be the county councils of the health board area who would have to take the step of saying: &ldquo;We refuse to raise the rate for this purpose.&rdquo;  That will get us over a long and, perhaps, interminable debate on this other question on which I defend my colleague, the Minister for Local Government, absolutely.  It does not arise on this amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the cardinal objections we had to this Bill was this question of the Minister imposing an extra charge which would devolve upon the local authorities.  It was that which impelled me to put down this amendment, which has been ruled out of order, to the effect that the cost of implementing a scheme under this section should be met from central funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has placed himself in a rather difficult position here, in so far as he is introducing a Bill and <Col N="277" /> taking upon himself under section 4 and section 2 the right to make regulations, and yet he is contributing nothing from central funds to the running cost of the measure.  Therefore, he is forced to act to a certain extent with his tongue in his cheek.  He has paid lip service to the local authorities by giving them a considerable amount of apparent authority under section 2. The first part of that section states, in effect, that subject to the regulations the rating authorities may make out a scheme.  Prior to the introduction of this Bill a number of local authorities had already done so.  Some of them have demurred and some have refused so far.</P>
    <P>My greatest objection to asking the individual local authorities to make out a scheme under this Bill is the lack of uniformity this will produce.  We can all recall the analogous situation in which different local authorities were allowed to issue health cards and by virtue of the fact that they had different levels of incomes, there was an extraordinary divergence in the percentage of health cards issued all over the country.  In effect, it happened that where the health cards were most needed in the poorer counties the percentage of health cards issued was the lowest.  For example, Leitrim had the lowest issue of health cards in Ireland.</P>
    <P>If you have that difference existing between relatively comparable bodies like county councils, will you not have still greater differences when you take into consideration not alone the county councils but all the urban bodies?  A well-off county may be disposed to handle this generously but a poorer urban body will be less disposed to introduce this measure at all. Let us take my own constituency of South Tipperary.  Let us take the county council and the Cashel Urban Council.  A penny on the rates brings into the county council about £1,500 or £1,600&mdash;perhaps, it is more now&mdash; but a penny on the rates brings in only £20 to Cashel Urban Council.  Yet these two bodies are supposed to introduce this form of social service.  It is clear that a county council can carry <Col N="278" /> this much more readily than an urban body.</P>
    <P>The Minister says they are quite free to reject or implement it.  If, for instance, Cashel Urban Council refuse to adopt this scheme and the county council adopt it, we have the awkward situation that an old age pensioner living 100 yards outside the boundary of Cashel will be derated, while a similar old age pensioner in the same circumstances living in the town of Cashel will not be derated.  Here we have straight away distress and dissatisfaction.  By virtue of the fact that he fails to meet in any way the financial implications of this measure the Minister's action may lead to such a possibility.</P>
    <P>I feel, therefore, that the fundamental concept of this Bill is faulty.  If the Minister wants to help the less privileged sections of the community, that help should be based on need, and not upon the relative capacity to meet that need which will vary between one local body and another.  That can only be met by a substantial contribution from central funds on the part of the Minister.  To my mind this is a serious objection to the Bill.  The Minister has given so much authority and discretion to the local authorities because he is not prepared to make any contribution from central funds to this excess expenditure.</P>
    <P>In subsection (2) he introduces the idea that the rating authority may amend the scheme&mdash;again leading to a lack of uniformity.  South Tipperary has introduced a scheme under which people in certain categories will not have to pay rates.  These categories were drawn up, largely I think, at the instance of the Minister.  I think he sent a circular to the local authorities on these lines: non-contributory old age pensions, non-contributory widows' pensions, blind pensions, unemployment pensions, home assistance, disabled persons maintenance allowances and infectious diseases maintenance allowances.  These are all very deserving classes but, by virtue of the fact that local authorities are free to opt out of this scheme, it may mean that there will be pockets of the country where this type of social help will not <Col N="279" /> obtain.  How is the concept of cherishing all our children equally to obtain, when we have a type of legislation being introduced here where the under-privileged members of our society will receive help in one area and may not receive it in another area?  That is a fundamental objection to this Bill.</P>
    <P>Had the Minister met the local authorities in some fashion this risk would have been obviated.  When I put down the amendment which the Ceann Comhairle ruled out of order, I expected that it would be ruled out of order, but, in any case, I did not expect that the Minister would foot the entire bill.  However, if he were prepared to meet it on a fifty-fifty basis, which is the usual way we meet costs at county council level, it would have been something. I appreciate the central authority could not say to local authorities: &ldquo;Go ahead.  Derate as much as you like.  We will meet the bill.&rdquo;  If that happened, of course, there would be an avalanche of derating all over the country.  But he could at least have laid down fairly strict regulations as to whom it would apply to and make a 50 per cent contribution to the cost of it.</P>
    <P>Everybody recognises the increasing impact of rates upon the community. It is now in the region of £35 million, as I think the Minister told me the other day, and it is increasing steeply every year.  The Minister himself mentioned more than once in this House that it was an unfair form of taxation, not being based in any adequate sense upon a person's capacity to pay.  Yet he continues to rely on that method of collecting money, a method which has been generally decried and on which he himself has had three reports submitted to him in his Department.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances the Minister should reconsider the entire question of financing this Bill and give some measure of reciprocity in payment to the local authority.  He has placed substantial powers in the hands of the local authority, powers which I feel he might not have placed in their hands if he was making a contribution himself.  He has told us that he will draw up regulations, but I fail to see <Col N="280" /> what regulations he can draw up that will introduce any uniformity to this system.  For instance, section 2 (1) allows any local authority who may so wish to opt out of the scheme.  Will the Minister be happy with a form of relief obtaining in some areas and not obtaining in others?  I agree that, in practice, with the help of county managers and so on he may be able to get a more uniform acceptance of it That would appear possible at first sight, but it is quite possible also that some councils will still refuse to operate the scheme as put before the House by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Hogan is advocating that the State should meet the cost of this scheme or part of it from central funds, I want to make it quite clear that, even if we had decided that, and we have not, it would not be, in my opinion, appropriate to insert a provision to that effect in this Bill It would be more appropriate to do it either in the Finance Act or by making provision in the Department's Vote.  The provision that is here in section 2 (4) would be necessary in any case, even if this were decided. That means that the Bill as it stands does not preclude some subvention being made by the State at some future date.  If it should decide to do that there would be no need for any amendment of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill does not provide for relief for any particular class of ratepayer It simply establishes a legal framework which empowers local authorities to provide in their schemes for relief for the types of cases which an individual local authority considers should be dealt with in its own area.  I think it is obvious then that any possible question of recoupment of some of the cost by the State should be dealt with in the context of the categories of people whom it has been decided to exempt from the payment of rates rather than by writing into legislation what would be a blank cheque given in advance to local authorities to give relief to anybody they liked at the expense of the Exchequer.  In my opinion there is no need for any change in the section <Col N="281" /> of the Bill, even if it was decided that the State should contribute.</P>
    <P>The other point Deputy Hogan made was that there is likely to be a lack of uniformity in the schemes adopted throughout the country as a whole. This is quite likely, but that is what local government is all about.  We either have local democracy or we do not.  If decisions are not to be made locally then we have not got local government.  It is inherent in the whole concept of local government that there should be a measure of discretion allowed to the local authorities, that they should take into account the circumstances of the different types of areas under their control, rural areas, urban areas, some being relatively well off compared to others.  The circumstances are different in different local authority areas and, therefore, there should be this discretion left to them. If there is absolute uniformity imposed by the Government then you just have not got local government.</P>
    <P>The whole concept of local government is that local authorities should be free, within broad limits, to differ in their approaches to their problems. The suggestions Deputy Hogan attempted to make, although he was ruled out of order, that this should be met entirely from the Central Fund is not a realistic one.  It is simply not realistic to suggest that local authorities should decide who is to be exempt and that the Central Fund should pay the whole cost; that would amount to a blank cheque to the local authorities to exempt anybody they liked from the burden of rates at the expense of the general taxpayer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in his statement, said that the Bill had been drafted giving each authority the power to make and carry out a scheme for the waiver of all or a portion of the rates of different classes of ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the measure with regard to the classes of ratepayers is wide enough?  I am particularly interested in a group who suffer more to meet their commitments to local authorities than any other section of the community at the present time and they are the small shopkeepers.  We <Col N="282" /> have a number of such people who do not qualify for any social welfare benefits either because they have not the insurance contributions or because they are self-employed workers who cannot avail of the schemes giving assistance or making allowances to certain classes under the local authority regulations.</P>
    <P>In our towns and villages in rural areas we have a substantial number of struggling shopkeepers who find it very difficult to exist in view of the fight being raged by the supermarkets to wipe them out and take over the entire business whether it be grocery, drapery or any other classification of business. I want to know from the Minister whether or not the local authority is empowered to help such people if they so decide to seek help.  My understanding is that they are not unless they can make a case that they are unable to pay.  While we are discussing rating, payment by instalment and the question of waiving rates for certain classes of people there is no harm in bringing the plight of such people before the House.</P>
    <P>As far as agriculturalists are concerned the full rate on agricultural land is paid for from the Central Fund but the small shopkeeper has to bear the full burden of rates.  The rates in West Cork are more than £4 in the £ and in other districts the rates are even higher. I want to know if some form of legislation can be enacted to help these people who are fighting a very hard battle to exist at all at the present time.</P>
    <P>We all know the advantages the supermarkets have of bulk buying and the impersonal nature of the services they give which make it more advantageous for the customer.  Of course, our citizens are free to patronise any store they like but I do appeal to the Minister to indicate what powers this Bill would give a local authority to help such shopkeepers.  If there is not such power, I would ask that particular attention be given to this group of people.  I think I can say, without fear of contradiction, that this group do not want to impose themselves on the local authority for assistance.  They have held a certain standard down through the years and they are trying&mdash;in many <Col N="283" /> cases they are struggling&mdash;to educate their families and keep their independence. I appeal to the House and to the Minister to consider some way in which we can help these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies on the Opposition benches have suggested that the State should bear the full cost of relief given to the ratepaying shopkeepers.  If the State were to do this we would have the ironic situation whereby in order to relieve the social welfare class of its rate burden we would also be relieving the biggest business people in the city.</P>
      <P>We do not have a rich economy.  If the Minister was to give the full subvention to any local authority which had adopted this scheme we would be relieving some people well able to pay their own rates.  I think the local authority should be given power to have a kind of property tax on certain big commercial and industrial undertakings. I have in mind the small factory owner, the small business owner, the wealthy industrialists and the wealthy property owners who might well be subject to a property tax equal to the amount which the local authority would lose on the rates.  We have got to help the people in the social welfare class who just cannot pay their rates.  When looking for money one always goes to the place where there is most.  The big property owners and the big industrialists are well able to afford this extra tax.  It would not amount to very much in the case of Dublin because there are plenty of taxable properties, and it would give people the satisfaction of knowing they were relieving the social welfare class. This may seem to be rather idealistic and not very practical, but the Minister for Finance in the last Budget brought in a tax on office buildings and, perhaps, the Minister would have a talk now with the Minister for Finance and tell him that this new tax should go to the local authorities in the area in which the offices are as a further subvention towards the rates. I cannot see the sense in the State taking over everything without some compensation to the other side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned <Col N="284" /> giving a blank cheque to a local authority.  It would be a blank cheque if the Minister said he would underwrite all the expense involved in derating an unspecified section of the community but it would be no blank cheque if the Minister made strict regulations and exercised a strict control over the particular classes covered in any proposed derating.  There is a perfect analogy in this.  I refer to the agricultural grants.  In some counties a very high percentage of farmers are derated. In most counties, between total derating and partial derating, a huge number of ratepayers are already being helped and the Minister meets the position by means of a block grant to each local authority.  I forget what the exact figure is.  It has been increased year by year and is now quite substantial, running into millions.  Nobody begrudges this relief in the case of the small, uneconomic farmer.  But there should be no difficulty about the Minister meeting this particular problem in the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Murphy said, numbers of people in villages and towns get no help at all from the point of view of rates.  Small shopkeepers are in very poor circumstances indeed.  In every village there is an old man and an old woman in a little shop, barely able to survive.  These people should be helped It would be beyond the capacity of a local body, desirable though it is, to bear the burden of such help.  The Minister should make some form of block grant to enable local authorities to help out in these cases.  It is done for certain sections of the farming community. There is no reason why it could not be done for these particular sections.  It could be done by way of a means test.  Such a test would have more reality in assessing income and would be more in conformity with absolute equity than is the valuation stipulation in regard to farmers.  This is the approach the Minister should adopt if he is seeking after social justice.  Instead of doing that he throws the whole thing on to the local authority and then, willy-nilly, he is forced to give them a degree of local attitude, even to the point of their deciding whether or not to implement the <Col N="285" /> scheme.  From that point of view the Bill is a miserably inadequate measure. It is not calculated to give the kind of relief we would expect to be given. The Minister has sidestepped the issue but the Bill highlights a gap in our social legislation and social thinking and the Minister has focused attention on that gap.  He said, in his opening speech, that the measure would not cost the rates very much &mdash; .7 per cent of the total warrant.  If it is so small why would the Minister not meet the bill out of central taxation so that lowly rated local authorities need have no hesitation in implementing the scheme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Had the Minister not introduced any Bill there would, of course, be no problem and we would have continued as we are.  It would certainly be a long time before we would get a similar measure from either of the Opposition parties.  The position is somewhat unusual, but not very original, when it is remembered that local authorities will themselves have to find the money to give this relief.  The original example for this was given by the Coalition Government in a housing Act which provided that local authorities could pay exactly the same amount towards housing grants as the State paid.  From that day to this there has been mass robbery of local authorities.  This Bill will not take anything like the amount of money that has been paid out in my county and other western counties for housing. Some people seem to have very short memories when they come in here with the kinds of stories that were told here this evening.  That housing Act was one of the most crushing measures ever enacted.  We had to pay out hundreds of thousands of pounds, a bill which, in my opinion, should have been met by the Government.  It was the Coalition Government which enacted that measure.  I do not see any difference between this measure and that. The change of opinion that has taken place puzzles me.  Quite a number of people are in difficult circumstances for various reasons and I do not think it is envisaged that all these people should have their rates wiped out.  Nobody has been able to make an estimate.  I have been a member of <Col N="286" /> a local authority for 20 years and we have not been able to make any reasonable estimate of what this will cost us, but I know it will not put us in the county home, or anything like that.  It would be better if the Minister gave the old age pensioners a few extra shillings instead of taking a shilling off, as happened in my lifetime. There are various ways of giving relief.  We may not be doing it in exactly the right way but it is better to do it in some way than not do it at all.  I commend the Minister for the attempt he is making in this Bill. The only trouble is as to where the line will be drawn.  It will involve a great many county councillors in trouble.  They will be called on to make representations day and night for people who may or may not be entitled to relief under this Bill when it becomes an Act but I suppose we are so used to this in the west that the extra cases will not upset us unduly.</P>
      <P>There are some people who, although not old age pensioners, would be entitled to relief.  I have in mind Old IRA pensioners and their widows. I do not mind whether it is paid out of the rates or out of the Central Fund. There should be some directive from the top.  As I said here some nights ago, there should be some uniformity. If it is left to every local authority to adopt its own attitude towards this type of scheme, the end result may be chaos in many cases.  This risk was never more obvious than at some health meetings recently when we found that the richest counties had the highest number of medical cards.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>For instance, in Roscommon, which has the best farms in the west of Ireland, 53 per cent had medical cards; in Galway about 48 per cent of the people had medical cards, whereas in Mayo only 43 per cent had medical cards.  The percentage in Sligo is only 33 per cent.  It is possible that in other counties the percentage is even lower.  There is no uniformity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not concerned as to how this will be financed.  What I am concerned about is that there should be uniformity in the method of dealing with the matter, that a directive aimed at uniformity <Col N="287" /> should come from this House, that it should not be left to the local home assistance officer to decide.  If we come down to that point we are back in queer street.  I am sure my friends in the Labour Party will agree with me on that.  I do not want to see it brought down to the level where the decision as to who will pay rates or who will not pay rates or the amount a ratepayers will pay, will rest with the home assistance officer.  I would ask the Minister to insist on uniformity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to direct the Minister's attention to subsections (5) and (6) of section 2.  The burden of subsection (5) is that the county council may make amendments to any scheme they introduce.  This, to me, straight away presents an administrative difficulty.  We introduce, for example, in any county council a scheme such as the one I have outlined here and it operates for a couple of months and then immediately the local county councillors are inundated by demands from local persons to be included in the scheme and in the month of January Councillor So-and-So brings in an amendment; two months later there is another amendment introduced.  I can see administrative chaos.</P>
      <P>We have had examples of this in local administration as regards the simple question of taking over boreens.  In my constituency we had to introduce strict regulations to prevent some members jumping the gun because they had the agenda full of boreens at every meeting.  Amendments to this measure may be introduced by men who will be anxious to make themselves popular and that is a thing which every public representative is exposed to.</P>
      <P>Again, subsection (6) says:</P>
      <P>A decision by a rating authority as to whether or not a person is qualified for relief under a scheme under this section shall be final and conclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can you not see here a battery of section 4 notices of motion coming in demanding that Mr. So-and-So or Mary So-and-So should now be included in the scheme even though their qualifications to be excluded may be very <Col N="288" /> tenuous? This is the kind of administrative difficulty which the Minister is now providing us with by allowing so much discretion to the local authority by virtue of the fact that he feels impelled to do so when he is not providing any of the money.  If the Minister were financing this Bill totally or in part he would not be so inhibited as he is now in this matter and we would find that the regulations drafted by him would be pretty decisive and would say exactly what type and class of income would be included or excluded.</P>
    <P>I feel that subsections (5) and (6) will lead to many administrative difficulties, will lead to much abuse and it does not require too much imagination to realise that they may even lead to political discrimination up and down the country, certainly, discrimination of some sort or another, and perhaps, favouritism because certain councillors or certain sections may feel obliged to buy popular favour by pushing the case of someone whose entitlement may not be a very valid one.  The Minister has opened the gate wide to any county councillor to press that some special friend be derated as against a neighbour who may have lesser income and be less well situated financially.</P>
    <P>I do not know what thinking has impelled the Minister to introduce these two subsections.  They are calculated, I suppose, to appease the local authority, particularly elected members.  This was a reserved function and this is, perhaps, the carrot to encourage them to take on this scheme by just saying to them: &ldquo;OK lads, take over the scheme.  You will be running it and I will give you a free hand to run it. You will be paying for it.  So you may as well run it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is an element of pretence in this whole Bill.  The Minister reminds me of the chap who invites you into the bar and when you go in lets you buy the drink.  That is what is happening here.  The Minister is being very generous to certain sections of the rate-paying public but it is the unfortunate local authority that will have to buy the drink.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier in the discussion I mentioned a classification of persons who require help and I <Col N="289" /> should like to make it clear now that I anticipated that any help that would be forthcoming would be forthcoming out of public funds.  This Bill as set out is a great gimmick.  It is worth nothing. County councils have already the power contained in section 2 if we interpret that section strictly.  Any county council can, if they so decide, agree to waive the rates demand on a ratepayer because of his inability to pay.  That is happening all over the country.  We are getting no money.  This is a piece of political propaganda.  It will be published in the papers that Fianna Fáil are now waiving rates so far as certain classifications of our people are concerned. This is supposed to be another handout by Fianna Fáil.  In actual fact, whatever rates are struck out will have to be made up by the remaining body of ratepayers within the rate-paying authority.  No money is made available from central funds.</P>
      <P>I have reasonable experience of the work and administration of local authorities.  I cannot see what useful purpose this Bill serves.  At the present time, people in receipt of public assistance are not liable for rates.  It is quite usual that their rates are struck out&mdash;elderly people living alone, blind people, physically and mentally-handicapped people who are rated occupiers. What more does this section do?  I cannot see why we are wasting the time of the House on this measure.  I was seeking earlier the formulation of legislation whereby we would get a bulk sum, as mentioned by Deputy Hogan, from central funds to help certain classifications of our ratepayers.  I mentioned specifically small shopkeepers who are getting nothing under this Bill. What I have in mind was that they would get the same consideration from central funds as agriculturists do at present.  We know the money must come from other sources.  I mentioned that point earlier in this discussion. However, we must take into account changing circumstances.  There is no group of people whose circumstances have changed more than the group I have mentioned but there is nothing in this measure to help them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see why the Minister should <Col N="290" /> dictate to any county council or borough council in any part of this country what they should do with their own money.  That applies under a system where there is a dictator.  The Minister may be a type of dictator. However, I do not see his right to say to the Cork County Council members, for example, what they should do in regard to classifications of people who may apply for the remission of all or part of their rates&mdash;and I make that statement here as chairman of Cork County Council.  I do not see why we should take any dictation from the Minister through this measure.</P>
    <P>It has always been the objective of the county council&mdash;I am sure the same could be said of other councils throughout the country&mdash;where they were satisfied beyond doubt that hardship would ensue from payment of liabilities to the county council, to strike out the rates.  I do not think the system has been abused.  I would not like to see any system abused.  Close scrutiny must be kept.  We must have close scrutiny of such applications by virtue of the fact that, in striking out rates for Mr. A, Mr. B and company will have to pay.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up the time of the House too much on this section and on this Bill.  I would stress that no money is forthcoming from central funds.  What is in the Bill, any county council, urban council or corporation in this country has a right to do today. No new powers are imposed or given under it.  As I said at the outset, this is a gimmick.  We shall have people going around saying: &ldquo;Now, Fianna Fáil will make sure that those less fortunate sections of the people will pay no rates as a result of their Local Government (Rates) (No. 2) Bill, 1969.&rdquo;  I want Deputy Boland, Minister for Local Government, to tell this House the additional powers given to local authorities by virtue of this Bill and also to tell us whether he intends to formulate legislation that would make available grants to local authorities to help to ease the pressure of rates on sections of the people who are heavily burdened by them and who will not benefit under this Bill.</P>
    <Col N="291" />
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I made it clear in my Second Reading speech, and in my reply, that there should be in all these schemes a clause empowering hardship cases not covered in the classes specified to be covered by the provisions of the Bill.  Therefore, small shopkeepers, who, because of changed circumstances, find themselves unable to pay the rates, could obviously be covered by that.  But if it is found possible to classify any particular type of small shopkeeper in any way then these can, in fact, be covered as a class, though I must say I think it would still be necessary to decide individual cases on their merits.</P>
      <P>I have already pointed out that we are not in fact deciding in this Bill who will eventually pay the cost&mdash; whether it will be the taxpayer or the ratepayer.  The present intention is that it will not be paid from central funds but, if a decision is made at a later date to recoup part of the cost to local authorities, there is not any need for any amendment to this Bill. Even if that decision were made now, the Bill would not be altered in any respect.</P>
      <P>There seems to be a fairly clear divergence between the two Opposition Parties in regard to this matter.  Deputy Hogan argues for uniformity.  He argues that the classes to be covered should be laid down by the Government so that we would have uniformity as between one local authority and another.  On the other hand, Deputy Murphy describes any attempt to do this as dictation by the Government and as something that will not be tolerated.  Obviously, there are two different concepts here as to the meaning of local democracy.  In fact, the Bill leaves this at the discretion of the local authority and it does not attempt to dictate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to subsections (5) and (6), here again there seems to be an inconsistency in the approach of Deputy Hogan.  He now objects to the fact that local authorities are entitled to amend the schemes.  This seems to me to be an objection to the whole system of local government by councils comprised of elected local representatives. I find it difficult to follow the changes in the Opposition attitude to the whole <Col N="292" /> question of local government.  At one time, they are in favour of complete freedom for the local councils to decide all local government matters and, here, when it is being provided in a Bill not only that they themselves should be empowered to adopt such schemes as they see fit but also that they should be able to amend them, this is objected to.  Apparently, the local councils are not deemed fit to make these types of decisions for themselves.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that amendments are likely to be so frequent as to amount to administrative chaos seems to me to be an unwarranted reflection on the elected members of local authorities. I do not think there is any evidence to lead us to believe we would have this type of irresponsibility&mdash;that we would have amendments every few months, so that the scheme would become difficult to administer.  I have not found that type of irresponsibility in local authorities.  However, if this should happen well, just as the schemes have to be sanctioned by the Minister for Local Government, the same will apply to amendments; amendments would have to be sanctioned by the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy went on to say that this Bill which he has described as dictation by the Minister does not do anything at all, that it does not give any power that is not there already and he asked me to explain what it does.  I have already explained what it does and there does not seem to be any point in repeating myself in this matter.  It does, of course, change the position.  At present, rate collectors are required to take every possible step to collect rates from ratepayers whether or not they are in a position to pay them. It is only those ratepayers who are sufficiently well informed or sufficiently tough to resist the efforts to collect the rates who eventually qualify for exemption at the end of the financial year under the present system.</P>
    <P>This Bill will at least ensure in the case of local authorities, if they adopt the scheme, that there will be that amount of uniformity, that people coming within the same category will get this exemption from the payment of rates irrespective of their powers of <Col N="293" /> resistance to the various efforts that have to be made under the present legislation to collect these rates from them.  The only other point I need refer to is that raised by Deputy Moore who spoke about the possibility of a property tax.  This is getting into the field of differential rating which is being considered at present and will be reported on in the next report of the inter-departmental committee.  It hardly seems to be appropriate to discuss it here although I agree that it is something that possibly would merit examination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, the Minister would clarify one point in regard to the payment for this measure.  He states that if the Government paid the bill, the bill would still not be altered. I am confused about this.  How does he reconcile that with section 2 (4) which states:</P>
      <P>The cost of implementing a scheme under this section shall form part of the expenses of a local authority for the purposes of any provision relating to the determining, making, levying and assessment of rates.</P>
      <P>I find it hard to reconcile his statement with that subsection.  The Minister mentioned hardship cases.  I never like this question of hardship cases and I think they should always be kept to the minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>People should get these things as a right and not as a concession. The phrase &ldquo;hardship case&rdquo; connotes some poor fellow running around pulling the coat tails of a TD or a county councillor or writing letters to a Department.  As far as one can in social administration one should lay down on the line what classes are entitled to particular social services in operation for the time being.  We cannot eliminate hardship cases from society but good administration should reduce that category as much as possible.  The Minister in this loose type of legislation has left that category very ill-defined and it will ultimately lead to many people being disappointed and it will lead to a number <Col N="294" /> of people spending their time running around after local councillors asking to be included under a hardship clause, or that a special notice of motion be submitted to have them included under this derating Bill.</P>

I have been advised that section 2 (4) is necessary in order to put beyond doubt the local authority power to treat the cost of giving relief as an ordinary expense which can be charged to rates in the same way as other expenses, but if the Government at some stage decided to recoup the whole or part of the cost there is no need to alter that in any way.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) Without prejudice to anything in this section, any changes effected under this Act shall not in any manner cause any worsening of employment conditions, salary or emoluments of existing rate collectors.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a Parliamentary Question which I tabled the Minister stated&mdash; and I am speaking from memory&mdash; that he felt satisfied that local authorities would see that no injustice would be done to local rate collectors by any alteration which this Bill might introduce. I tabled this amendment in order to have it written into the Bill, spelt out beyond doubt, that this House was anxious to ensure that without prejudice to the operation of <Col N="295" /> the Bill, rate collectors throughout the country would not have their conditions worsened.  This measure will involve them in extra work and extra expense.  It is partially in operation in some places at the moment and I understand that some rate collectors are somewhat annoyed about the extra work being placed upon them.  They may be asked to act as assessors of the incomes of various categories who may now be claiming relief under the Bill.  The Minister may correct me if I am wrong but I assume that if somebody makes an application under this it will be the local rate collector, or the home assistance officer, who will be asked to give his views.  He may have to call out and interview that person and say whether he thinks he belongs to that specific category or not.  If that is so, it will involve extra work and expenses.  In view of that contingency I deemed it expedient to insert this amendment and I hope the Minister will consider it favourably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I fear I cannot accept this amendment.  As I have already told the Deputy in reply to a Parliamentary Question, I am satisfied that the interests of rate collectors will not be adversely affected by this measure, and if it should turn out that in certain cases this does happen I am certain the local authorities would make whatever arrangements were necessary to get over the difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not accept the amendment because it would be unthinkable that these improvements we are making in providing for the payment of rates by instalments as of right should, possibly, be prevented from coming into operation by any official who felt he would be adversely affected, making a claim that such a change would result in worsening his conditions of employment. If this amendment were accepted that is exactly what the position would be.  Any rate collector who felt he would be adversely affected could effectively prevent the granting of this right to ratepayers, not indefinitely, but, at least, delay it while a claim was being made and dealt with.  There are other methods available to local government officers who have complaints <Col N="296" /> in regard to conditions of service to have their complaints dealt with and I think these are adequate.  As I said in reply to the Parliamentary Question, it is very unlikely that there will be any worsening of conditions of any rate collector but, if it should happen, the normal methods of seeking a satisfactory settlement are available to those concerned and I think these are sufficient. A statutory safeguard of this kind is completely unnecessary and is unacceptable because it could result in delaying the granting of this right to ratepayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite understand the Minister's reluctance to accept this very simple amendment. There could be a worsening of conditions for rate collectors when this Bill is passed.  Most of our rate collectors were paid on a poundage basis in the old days.  Now, a number of them are paid a salary and a bonus. That bonus is contingent on their being able to get in a certain amount of money by a certain date.  I do not know how the instalments would be arranged but it could certainly depend on the measure of the collection decided on by the local county council, whether a man got, perhaps, a smaller bonus at the end of the year than he would have got under the old system.</P>
      <P>There is also the question that if he has to take a number of instalments and travel around as they do&mdash;they hold a collection sometimes in a town and may have to go from house to house&mdash;and if this measure will be treated in a liberal fashion, the rate collector will have to take payment in ten or twelve instalments instead of in two moieties.  In those circumstances his travelling and his work will increase and he may lose on his bonus. I cannot understand why the Minister so glibly states that he cannot see how this Bill will cause any worsening of rate collectors' conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also thinks that if the amendment were accepted it could cause some delay in implementing the measure.  On the other hand, if there is considerable local dissatisfaction among rate collectors it might equally cause delay.  I do not believe either will happen.  I think the rate collectors will <Col N="297" /> continue to do their job and, whether this provision is incorporated in the Bill or whether it is dealt with by arbitration later, I do not think it will matter and that the position will be ironed out either way.  I am sorry the Minister is reluctant to accept the amendment.  It was introduced in the hope that it would reassure rate collectors who are a little anxious at present about what the Bill may mean for them.</P>

      <P>May I inquire from the Minister in regard to this amendment, conscious that it is not generally desirable that this House should try to define conditions of employment of particular persons in the local government service, if, in the event of the local government officials union making particular representations to him on any alleged worsening of conditions, he would be prepared to meet them on this matter as it is a moot point whether there would be a worsening of conditions.  It could be argued that collectors operating the instalment system would, in fact, be getting their money earlier rather than getting it or chasing it all over a short period.  It is a matter of debate and I think the House should be reluctant to define conditions of employment with such rigidity.  If the Minister gave that assurance we, on this side of the House, would be somewhat relieved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had representations from time to time and from many councils to bring about payment of rates by instalments and this is now to become a legal right under this Bill.  I doubt the advantages of this method.  I say that knowing it has support from all sections of political opinion and several local councils. My view is and will continue to be that <Col N="298" /> where people are capable of meeting their commitment to a local authority they should pay their rates as early as possible.  We know the burden of paying interest on moneys borrowed by local authorities.  The principle is clearly set out and has been so set out in Cork county through the years, that the council expect those ratepayers who can afford to pay their rates to do so as soon as the rate is struck.  The advantage of that is that the ratepayer completes his contribution to the local council in one instalment for the year and it also gives the council the advantage of having that money at their disposal to meet liabilities.</P>
      <P>There is a section of our ratepayers who cannot do so.  That section can get consideration, and, in fact, get more consideration when the position obtains that those who can pay, pay early. Consideration can then be given to those who find it more difficult to pay and it can be spread out, as is happening, over two instalments.  Very often there is no set date for the payment of such instalments.  The rate collectors know their people.  They know them individually and generally they are helpful and sympathetic when they know a man is honest and willing to meet his commitments, and anxious to do so, but he may be finding it difficult to pay within a particular time.  He may have cattle for the fair or he may have a few pigs fattening and he may require a month, six weeks or two months.  By and large, that time is granted to him, particularly where the county council carries out the collection of the rates, the officer collection, and some of the outdoor collectors do the same.  Others may not be so helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this section these people will now find that they are legally entitled to pay their rates by instalments.  In view of the big price we have to pay for money and the interest which is available for those who have money to invest&mdash;running at ten per cent now &mdash;naturally the people who pay their rates regularly at present will avail of the instalment system because, looking at it on a commercial basis, and looking at the personal advantages, they will find that by investing their money now they can earn some interest.  They <Col N="299" /> have from April until February to meet their commitments legally.</P>
    <P>I am very doubtful about this section being a step forward, conscious of the fact that honest ratepayers who are in difficult circumstances get consideration from the councils.  I am sure that applies all over the country.  I can see extra difficulties arising from this instalment system.  Such difficulties have been mentioned in the House.  The Minister is pressed by Deputy Hogan and Deputy Desmond to make special allowances so far as such difficulties are concerned.  The views I am stating here are views I already expressed when this motion was brought forward in Cork County by some of the Minister's party, some members of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Labour Party.  I expressed doubt about it then. I did not give it support, although I am just as mindful of the difficulties of paying rates as any other person.</P>
    <P>A person who would like to avail of the instalment system of paying rates can open a little account in the post office and put in £1 or £2, or 1/12th of his rates, monthly, so that he will have the bulk sums to pay out twice yearly.  In this enlightened age there are several ways in which the difficulties which a limited number of ratepayers find in meeting their commitments twice yearly as against monthly instalments can be overcome. I doubt if this legislation is necessary. I think it will cost the local councils some additional money and it will induce those people who pay early, and who meet the demands of the councils and pay in the early part of the financial year, to avail of the instalment system.  It will undoubtedly result in additional burdens and possibly additional difficulties with office staffs, and so on, without contributing much to those it is supposed to help.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Murphy thinks this will cost the local authorities extra money but I think the reverse will be the case because the instalment will be payable from 1st April on, so that by 1st July four instalments will have been paid.  That is the time of year when, in most cases under the present system, the rate demands will <Col N="300" /> not even have been served.  So there should, if anything, be a saving to the council in interest on overdrafts.</P>
      <P>I quite agree that there are probably many ratepayers who are quite well suited by the present system but all this Bill proposes to do is to confer a right on ratepayers to pay their rates by instalment if they wish to do so. Anyone who wishes to continue paying his rates by the present method can opt to do so.</P>

      <P>I was going to make the point on this section that the councils have to work on overdrafts.  We are all familiar with this.  I often wondered if we could provide in legislation that ratepayers should receive an incentive bonus for paying both moieties of the rates together, thus reducing the overdraft or avoiding incurring an overdraft as far as possible.  We know that an overdraft is built up by reason of the fact that rates are not paid reasonably on time in some instances.  There is also the custom and the method of paying the first instalment in the spring and the other instalment in the autumn. Would it not be an incentive to any ratepayer if he got discount for paying both moieties in the spring, thus reducing the overdraft and thereby reducing the payment of interest to the banks?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), between lines 35 and 36, to add to the subsection the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(h) providing for the application of such a scheme to all classes whose incomes and circumstances are comparable to social welfare beneficiaries of the means test categories.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage of this Bill considerable dissatisfaction was expressed on this side of the House&mdash;and with even <Col N="301" /> greater emphasis by Deputy Treacy from the Labour benches&mdash;at the fact that the contributory social welfare classes were excluded.  The Minister gave his explanation, and it was simply this: that the income of the assistance classes was already known.  They had already been subjected to the means test.  Nobody knew what the income of a contributory old age pensioner or a contributory widow's pensioner might be.  They could be people substantially well placed financially and in those circumstances he felt precluded from including them.  However, while it may be true that the contributory classes on occasion may be quite well situated financially, it is also true that a number of contributory social welfare recipients are in poor circumstances.  I understand that there are 2,000 such persons in this city on public assistance.</P>
    <P>I think every Deputy here must be aware of the numerous cases of contributory social welfare recipients who would be deemed by them to be people not well off, to put it roughly.  I put down this amendment to embrace that category.  I am not going any further than the Minister has done.  He has limited his Bill to what he terms the social welfare beneficiaries of the means test categories, that is, the assistance classes under the social welfare scheme, but I merely introduced all other classes who would be in an analogous position having regard to income, family size and so on.</P>
    <P>If, for example, an old age pensioner getting so much per week is entitled to be derated, why should the contributory pensioner whose circumstances are the same not also be derated? Unless this amendment is accepted you are going to introduce discrimination of the worst type as between one poor person and another. It is to obviate that possibility that I have put in this amendment.  It would be quite unjust to walk down a street and find two persons of approximately the same income and that one was being derated because he happened to be a non-contributory old age pensioner and the other person, whose income is practically the same and perhaps has the same commitments, <Col N="302" /> merely because he has earned his income, should be discriminated against.  It may be argued that they all earn their income; but there is no doubt but that the contributory recipients, who have paid their contributions year in year out during their lifetime, have paid for what they get in their final years by way of contributory old age pension or contributory widow's pension, where she has contributed in the form of stamps or, if not, her husband has had stamps.</P>
    <P>We should not draw a line between one poor person and another.  We cannot deal with all these things by saying they are covered by a hardship clause; we would have so many clauses on our hands we would need a computer to work them out.  The proper way to cover these classes is to have them included in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>To adopt this amendment in the context of the Bill as it stands would be somewhat ridiculous. What the section does is to provide for the making of regulations, and paragraph (d) says that regulations may provide for the considerations to be taken into account by a rating authority in determining the classes of persons and so on to which such a scheme shall apply.  But the Bill does not specify any class.  It does not specify the social assistance recipients.  I think it would be rather silly to specify classes whose incomes are comparable to the social welfare beneficiaries of the means test categories.  It is intended that the schemes should cover such classes, and I know that at least five schemes adopted by local authorities have a clause to this effect.  I think they should all have it and I certainly recommend local authorities to include in their schemes a category such as this.  I have not spelled out any categories in the Bill, and I do not think it is desirable that I should endeavour to spell out the categories to whom it might apply.  I have already made it clear that I am leaving it for the local authorities themselves to decide, but, as I said, I think every local authority should adopt a scheme embracing recipients of social assistance, and obviously then they should also include people whose means are comparable <Col N="303" /> to those of people who are in receipt of social assistance.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to say that recipients of contributory social welfare benefits are excluded.  I do not think it would be appropriate specifically to include them as a class because nothing at all is known about incomes of people in receipt of contributory social welfare benefits by virtue of the fact that they are in receipt of those benefits, because they are not subject to a means test. The recipient of a contributory social welfare benefit is not necessarily excluded, and as I say, I would assume that local authorities would include people in this category.  I certainly think they should.  I know that some of them have already done so.  It would be quite inappropriate for me to specify this class when I do not specify any other class.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister envisage that the regulations would be able to deal with a situation such as this: there may be a widow getting a non-contributory widow's pension but she may have two or three of her family working and the total income of the family may be very high; whereas next door to her there may be a person with a contributory pension whose income is not nearly as high. Obviously if the widow is the rated occupier she may apply for this benefit. By analogy with the medical card system we could find ourselves in the position that it was decided that the family income would not be taken into account in the issue of a medical card for medical benefits.  Could the Minister say if in estimating the income, the total family income would be taken into account or would it only be that of the applicant?  I am thinking specifically of a non-contributory widow pensioner with three sons whose income could reach over £40 between them.</P>

      <P>Is it not now very obvious that the weakness of the Minister's position has become transparently clear?  In his effort to evade any financial responsibility for this Bill he is inhibited in making any specific ruling as to how it should be implemented. Under section 4 there are a lot of things about the procedure, period, content, consideration and conditions. But when the Minister is asked a very definite question by a member of his own party which should be answered he is not able to answer it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister waffles away and says that this is a matter for the local authority.  He cannot give us any guarantee that each local authority will not deal with it in a different fashion.  One local authority might say they will not avail of this gap and as a consequence say we will not give it to such a person&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;whereas another county council will give it.  The difficulty here stems from the fact that the Minister is trying to do things on the cheap.  He is trying to get local authorities to pay for something which central funds should be paying for. I understand his difficulty as regards my amendment; he approves of it, he say it's right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it was wrong and silly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister does approve of it.  He said he hoped and assumed that all local authorities would implement it, but there is no guarantee that they will.  Surely, if the Minister approves of it, what is preventing him from writing it into the Bill so that there will be some uniformity in the operation of this measure up and down the country?  I have already stressed the defect that it will operate in the same way as the issue of the health cards, where you have <Col N="305" /> one local authority giving out a high percentage of health cards and another giving out a low percentage.  The extraordinary thing was that the health authorities who issued the lowest percentage of health cards were in areas where they were, in fact, most needed. I mention Leitrim because it is the classical example.</P>
      <P>We have here a situation where the Minister is unable to adopt a specific course.  He says this is a matter for the local authority and, as a result of the multitude of the local authorities all with varying rating capacities, we will have different systems adopted everywhere.  I fail to see why the Minister, who says he approves of my amendment and assumes that local authorities will adopt it, will not incorporate it into the Bill.  The Minister knows quite well that the local authorities are free to accept or reject this whole Bill.  If the Minister is concerned with distributive justice and uniformity of social welfare dispensation he should at least ensure that all needy people, whether they are contributory or non-contributory, be treated the same.</P>
      <P>The type of distinction which will arise here will lead to considerable social stress up and down the country. I beg the Minister to reconsider this amendment between now and the Report Stage, and if he does not want to accept an amendment put down by me let him put in an amendment incorporating my amendment.  The Minister appears to be digging with both feet.  As the Minister for Local Government he has the audacity to say to a Deputy of his own party that he cannot answer his question because it is a matter for local government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The fundamental difference between Deputy Hogan and myself and between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil is that we in Fianna Fáil believe in local government but Deputy Dr. Hogan and Fine Gael do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All through this Bill the argument has been that I should lay down what local authorities should do.  This is an argument against autonomy for local authorities.  I accept that Fine Gael do not believe in local government and <Col N="306" /> that I do.  I made it very clear from the start that what we were doing here was giving power to local authorities to adopt this scheme if they saw fit. In my circular letter to them I suggested certain categories which should be classified.  I agree it would be reasonable to include a category such as that suggested by Deputy Hogan, and a number of local authorities have in fact done so, but that does not mean I have accepted the principle of this amendment.  I have described it as a silly amendment.  It would completely alter the whole Bill if I were to accept it.  What Deputy Hogan is asking us to do is to specify one particular section and leave out all the others.  That would be a ridiculous thing to do.</P>
    <P>I was asked a question by Deputy Dr. Gibbons and I replied that it was a matter for the local authorities to decide the classes to whom relief will be given and to decide specific matters to be taken into account.  Here again some of the local authorities have adopted schemes which cover the point raised by Deputy Dr. Gibbons.  Longford County Council is one that comes to mind.  They have adopted a provision in their scheme which will deal with that type of case.  Deputy Hogan does not think local authorities should be given the power to decide these things, but I believe in the concept of local government and that seems to be the sole difference between us.</P>

      <P>The point is if these regulations are to be made by individual local authorities there cannot be any uniformity.  The Minister saw what happened in regard to the issue of the health cards when it was made a local responsibility based on a means test.  The Minister must be further aware that the Minister for Health in the new Health Bill going through the House has taken back the authority to specify what classes and categories should be included for free service because he has found lack of uniformity. It was the very necessary lack of uniformity of a number of individual <Col N="307" /> local authorities which led to the position regarding the issue of health cards.  An analogous position will arise here because of the lack of co-operation between local authorities.  How can you get 30 to 40 local authorities&mdash;I do not know how many local authorities we have&mdash;to agree to produce a uniform system of social welfare, which this essentially is?  The Minister is merely twisting my remarks by saying that I am criticising local authorities.  I am criticising them by virtue of the fact that there are so many of them that they cannot produce any uniformity whatsoever in a matter like this.  If the Minister took it on himself to draw up the regulations just as the Minister for Health under the new Health Bill is doing now there would be uniformity. Those regulations, whether they be right or wrong, will at least be uniform and one person will not feel aggrieved as against another person, which is what will obtain here if there is not some uniformity.  I fear, by virtue of the lack of uniformity which will obtain when this Bill goes into operation, that those people will certainly feel aggrieved.</P>

I speak for the city of Dublin and I suppose it would be a fair comment to say that quite a few ratepayers in Dublin are poor, and those are not the people who are the recipients of social welfare benefits.  I share with him his anxiety and his concern that we should not discriminate but on the other hand I think he makes a bad case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, as I see it, does not necessarily exclude widows and old age pensioners who are in receipt of <Col N="308" /> the contributory pension, but the important point is that it does not necessarily admit them and I do not think it should.  You may have a situation where the recipient of an old age pension may have dividends and may have other sources of income.  It would not be fair, in a situation where the rest of the ratepaying community will be forced to provide the services, that a married man with a wife and family, who is trying to get by on a fixed salary, should be obliged to pay a contribution for somebody who is in a better position to pay it than he is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The truth is that, for instance, in the Dublin region there are over 2,000 contributory pensioners who are in receipt of home assistance because the contributory pension and their circumstances are such that they are unable under the Victorian law to provide out of their own industry or other lawful means sufficient to pay for food, clothing and shelter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are because, as far as I see it, the test the Minister is applying is the test of people who are on Department of Social Welfare, as distinct from Local Government, assistance, which is something entirely different.  The local authority at the moment have a totally different form of assistance in respect of which they receive no contribution whatsoever from the National Exchequer and that on a strict interpretation of the Bill would exclude them from benefit.  If we are wrong on this we would be glad to hear from the Minister that we are but it seems to me that such people are not within the scope of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there are those who are just marginally outside, whose circumstances <Col N="309" /> are such that perhaps with a strict application of the law, which does not provide for all the individual stresses and strains of human life and family circumstances, they would be excluded.  The sole purpose of the amendment is that where on a fair assessment it is considered the people are in comparable circumstances, they can be provided for.  It is not going to enlarge the scope or the benefits of the Bill greatly.  We would like to go a great deal further but it is in order to provide a basis for coming to the assistance of those marginal cases that Deputy Hogan has put down his amendment.</P>
    <P>Our experience in the Dublin region is such that we fear there are very many people who will not benefit, and their circumstances are such that they are in need of some relief.  In the constituency which I have the honour to represent there are many people who once knew better fortune than they now enjoy.  There are people who in days when the £1 was worth £1 had a reasonable standard of living.  I am thinking particularly of the many cases of widows in Rathmines and Rathgar who are living in homes which have a very high rateable valuation because at one time that area was regarded as having a certain status&mdash;and this apparently under our strange valuation laws obliges the Valuation Commissioners to put an enhanced value on their property.  Even though they have let their houses in flats to provide some kind of income, they are in dire straits at the present time endeavouring to pay the rates.  In many cases they actually go without necessary food and clothing in order to meet the rates bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned earlier that there are many cases where people are unaware of the fact that if they resist the majesty of the law and the threat of the rate collector they can perhaps get an exemption or some relief at the end of the year.  There are many people who are not aware of that.  In any event the unfortunate people should not have to live in a state of fear and in an atmosphere of intimidation. Those are the kind of people who will not be assisted by this Bill as it has <Col N="310" /> been drafted but who would be assisted if the amendment which Deputy Hogan has tabled were accepted.  It would allow the kind of humane administration which would provide assistance to people who are in those difficult circumstances.  These are circumstances for which it is next to impossible to try to legislate.  You certainly cannot fit them into any particular statutory definition.  Those are people who are living in a poverty which is often unrelieved and often unknown, but it would be possible to relieve it if you had the clause Deputy Hogan is endeavouring to insert.</P>

      <P>The big problem with regard to an amendment of this type is that the Opposition parties can bring in any type of proposition they wish because they know they will never be called on to implement it and that is where the trouble starts.  The Opposition themselves gave the original example of this type of thing.  When the local authorities had to pay the double grants, they did not say that the State should pay but they speak now on what is merely a triviality except that this applies to a number of privileged type people.  They can afford to be generous because they know they will be never called upon to form a Government in this country. Deputy Hogan has made a famous statement and he used the county of Leitrim as an example of what could happen.  The Deputy should understand that it is not the poorer counties which have the highest number of medical cards but it is counties like Roscommon and Waterford which hold the record.  Leitrim is a very small county.  How can the Deputy say that Roscommon should have a higher number of medical cards than, say, Mayo or Galway?  It does not make sense.  That type of argument does not get us anywhere.</P>
      <P>It is possible that the Minister will give relief in the long run and that he will give money to the local authorities to meet this change.  As a matter of fact, the Act is worded in such a way that it is possible for him to do that without even changing the Act.  We just have to wait and see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="311" /> The only point with which I am concerned at the moment is that I would not like to see every county councillor being chased around the country to county managers trying to get them to do something which should not be done.  It is for that reason that I have asked for some type of uniformity in this matter.  If we are to have 27 different councils dealing with this problem in 27 different ways much trouble will be caused.  However, when the Bill is implemented it will prove a tremendous boon and a great blessing.</P>
    <P>There appears to be some suggestion here that county councillors are fools of some sort.  Perhaps they were some years ago but I can assure the House that in the West of Ireland at any rate if one is not a very slick operator and does not know his stuff he has no business going forward for county council elections.  The idea of somebody going to a county councillor with a goose or a turkey in the hope of having his rates waived is something that has long since passed.</P>
    <P>One party is talking about centralisation while the other is talking about decentralisation.  I do not hold at all with county councils because I think they are achronistic and outdated and should be replaced by some other body. That would lead to more uniformity.</P>
    <P>If this matter is to be left to home assistance officers we will see the difference, as I said earlier, between Roscommon and Mayo.  In the rich county of Roscommon, 53 per cent of the people hold medical cards while in the so-called poor county of Mayo, medical cards are held by 43 per cent of the population.  However, wherever the money comes from, I hope there will be some degree of uniformity and that it will not be based on the percentage of people holding medical cards.  To take county Leitrim as an example is not very good because Leitrim is not representative of the whole country and when one sees what is happening in Roscommon, it is doubtful if any county is really representative.</P>
    <P>Many people seem to have forgotten that if there is not a rate collector in an area the county manager may waive <Col N="312" /> the rates in any way he decides.  Some parts of Kerry were without a rate collector for quite some time and I was told that the people in those parts were not in the least bit anxious to have a rate collector appointed.  In my county, rate collectors are all paid salaries now but there was a time when they were paid in a different way when they did not get their pay if the rates were not collected.  It is a question of what difference the percentage will make in the amount of rates to be waived now and what was being waived at that time.  I do not think it will be very great.</P>

      <P>To be quite honest, I am not particularly happy to support the Fine Gael amendment as it stands now.  I do not know what Deputy Hogan had in mind when he moved this amendment.  It seems to me that no matter what his intention is, the amendment in itself would not be adequate.  Perhaps I would be correct in assuming, because if not there is no reason for this particular section at all, that if there is to be relief in rates for anybody it should be for the people who are described here and, therefore, we consider the amendment to be superfluous.  There is no point in giving relief if it does not apply to the widowed old age pensioner who has to pay rates on a cottage that has been vested in her name or in that of her late husband.</P>
      <P>The amendment is too wide.  It applies, as far as I can see, to the rated occupier who might only have an income of £3 10s or £3 15s per week but who would be living in a household where the income was between £40 and £60 a week.  This is the flaw I see and I do not see any qualification in that respect.  The rated occupier is responsible for the payment of the rates and if there were other incomes of three or four children working it would be unjust and inequitable so far as the other ratepayers are concerned to give relief to one particular person when there was an income coming into the house.  If it does not provide for the type of person that Deputy Hogan mentioned when introducing this amendment there is no use having it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" /> I will not join issue with the Minister with regard to his attitude towards local authorities and their autonomy and what is or is not pure local government.  His opinion would not be very valued in this House on that subject.  It is only fair in this instance because they have to have regard to the rates.  The local authorities strike the rate.  For years afterwards they will have to make considerable provision for the amount of rates remitted in respect of certain people. They are the people who should determine the type of person who should have this waiver applied to them.  The local authorities will not be over-generous in this.  They would not take much notice of any copperfastened direction the Minister might give because they are noticeably mean when it comes to this type of person, particularly in the matter of home assistance. Take the case of an unmarried mother with three or four young children under 16 years of age.  About £2 is the extent of the generosity of the authority to her.  I can say that in respect of some of the constituencies I know.  I hope they will be more generous about the rates than they have been to the poor in their own areas where they could give relief to a certain extent so that the people would have a minimum standard of living.</P>

    <P>I expect I will get a stereotyped reply from the Minister.  This is a matter for the local authority.  We have seen fit in this House to introduce help of an analogous nature in respect of this category of persons in recent budgets.  On the same line of thinking, I put down this amendment here.  IRA pensioners are a dwindling number of our population.  It is true that many <Col N="314" /> of them are by no means wealthy men. Any of us who may have attended memorial functions and seen the parades of the Old IRA must realise that a number of them appear to be not wealthy.  Some of them are, perhaps, reasonably well off but there are a number of persons who are by no means well placed financially.  I have not mentioned any question of a means test.  I wanted to test the Minister's reaction and see would he be sympathetic to the idea of some concession to these people.  One may say there are certain IRA pensioners who may not want and would not look for a concession of this nature because they would not need it.  They can be excluded. By and large, I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment and to incorporate it into the Bill.  I know the Minister will tell me it can be done at local level but the question remains as to whether it will be done and how far it will be done.  If the Minister wishes to ponder over this and say that he will introduce an amendment of his own on Report Stage I will be quite happy.  If he gives me any indication that he would like the amendment adjusted in some way I would be quite happy to accede to his wishes in that respect.</P>

      <P>His amendment reads:</P>
      <P>providing for the application of such a scheme to all IRA pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we are dealing with matters of this kind we must realise that ratepayers are called upon to pay rates. This being so, when we are extending services to which the rates contribute we must be realistic and we must be aware of what we are able to achieve by any measure put through this House to accord relief to those in the <Col N="316" /> lower income bracket.  It has been mentioned that certain people are not included in the scheme and that a rigid code should apply; that the Minister should prescribe the various categories to be covered.  I suggest that local authorities would not easily fall in line with any attempt to prescribe for them who should and who should not be covered.  After all, it is the local authorities who have the responsibility of ensuring that the rates are collected and that the distribution is fair and equitable.  If we were to fall in line with the terms of this amendment one could not foresee where the scope of the scheme would end.</P>

Every year in Westmeath we provide for £5,000 or £6,000 of irrecoverable rates, rates that we know we will have to write off.  In Athlone Urban Council we have a yearly meeting in committee and we consider the circumstances of people and we write off rates.  In a sense we are operating a scheme like this.  We are putting that into law now.  Leave this to the local authorities to put through.  We will do our best with it, we will make our mistakes and if, in a few years time, it needs to be put on a better footing as regards eligibility as we are doing with the Health Act, well and good, but give the local authorities a chance first.</P>

      <P>This Bill does not include any class and it does not exclude any class.  It is quite obvious not alone that there would be no point in a local authority adopting any scheme that did not cover the type of person who would qualify for a special allowance under the Army Pensions Act or who would qualify for any of the various forms of social assistance but I cannot see how they could, in fact, devise a scheme that would not cover these classes.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> On the Second Reading I raised the question of the cost of implementing the Bill.  In other words, I objected to the provisions contained in section 2 (4) which places fairly and squarely on the ratepayers of the country the cost of implementing it.  The Bill is a move in the right direction and in so far as it relieves the social welfare classes and the people in similar financial circumstances from the demand of rates I welcome it wholeheartedly and I say it is long overdue but I feel that the provisions contained in section 2 (4) are all wrong because this, in effect, seeks to impose on the ratepayers the cost of discharging the social services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remission of rates for people who cannot afford to pay them is a highly desirable social service.  It falls into the same category in my opinion as old age pensions, unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance. I would have expected that not alone would the Minister, when he was introducing this Bill, have refrained from imposing this charge on the rates but <Col N="318" /> that he would have availed of this opportunity to move away from the system of raising money by rates because not alone does this party claim that the present rating system is unjust, unfair and inequitable but I think every Member on the Minister's side of the House acknowledges that the present system of rating is unfair in so far as it does not have any regard to the capacity of the ratepayer to pay. It raises a sum of £80 from a ratepayer in well-off circumstances and the same sum from a neighbouring ratepayer who is in very poor circumstances. Deputy Flanagan, the former Minister for Health, said in a debate on the Health Estimate that the argument in favour of paying for health out of the national Exchequer instead of out of the rates was that raising it from the national Exchequer was a fairer system.  That, in my opinion, is an unanswerable argument against the system of financing anything out of the rates that could be financed in any other way. I want it to go on record that, in my opinion, subsection (4) of section 2 constitutes an extension of the iniquitous rating system, an extension of the unjust system of raising money through rates.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am quite aware of that and I am referring to this subsection which I have just read out <i>verbatim.</i> The effect of imposing this as a charge on the rates will mean that small urban authorities, who find it very difficult at <Col N="319" /> the moment to raise sufficient money for their existing commitments, will be very reluctant to implement this scheme and the result will be that those whom it is intended to benefit will receive no benefit at all.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I asked the Minister to tell us how many local authorities had refused point blank to make or had adjourned the making of a scheme under this measure.  The Minister told us that something like 40 local authorities had agreed to implement it.  I should like the Minister to tell us how many have refused and how many have adjourned consideration of the matter and petitioned the Minister to accept financial responsibility.  It is because I believe this Bill could, if properly worked, relieve very necessitous cases that I am so disappointed with the particular provision which will, in my opinion, deprive these people of the benefit the Minister says he intends to give them.  We should be moving away from the rating system rather than consolidating it, as we are doing here, writing it in black and white into this Bill.  That is a mistake.  Everyone admits the system is wrong and unfair. It is deplorable that we should actually add to it instead of trying to get away from it.</P>

      <P>The fact is that the greater part of the expense which will arise for local authorities has already arisen because many of the people covered by this are, in fact, already covered when the accounts come to be examined at the end of the year.  All the Bill is doing is ensuring that those who are unable to pay their rates, but who succumb to the efforts of the rate collectors to extract them from them, will, in future, be dealt with in the same way as those better informed, who know that, if they resist the demands, they will be exempted at the end of the year.  There is no reason to believe that there will be any substantially increased commitment in this regard.  It is unrealistic to suggest, as Deputy Fitzpatrick suggests, that the adoption of the scheme should be a matter for the local authorities and the payment of the amount involved should be a matter for the Exchequer. As I have already pointed out, that would amount to giving a blank cheque in advance to local authorities to exempt whoever they liked at no cost to themselves.  That is quite unrealistic and I certainly would not recommend such an approach to the Government.</P>

If the Minister intends to get rid of a health board there should be a statutory obligation on him to bring the matter before the bar of public opinion in this House, outlining his reasons so that they will be published in the Official Report, bearing in mind that these boards will be catering for anything from 500,000 to 1,000,000 people.

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Desmond for keeping the matter open because it is a very vital amendment. I am afraid I am unable to accept what the Minister is suggesting, that it lies with the Minister for Local Government alone to abolish a health authority for the reasons which were advanced for the abolition of Dublin Corporation earlier this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have read the section that the <Col N="322" /> Minister has made reference to.  Nevertheless, it seems to me that a case could arise again in the future in which a health board would take a stand similar to that which was taken earlier this year by Dublin Corporation.  There were then and there would be in the future two methods open to a Minister for dealing with it and it is because we feel the Minister ought to justify the methods which he adopts that we have advanced this amendment.  The Minister can either abolish the authority or the board as the case may be or he can cause mandamus proceedings to be taken in court as a result of which an order of the court would be made which would oblige the authority to carry out whatever statutory function it had.</P>
    <P>That course could have been taken in Dublin earlier this year and if that course had been taken Dublin Corporation would have been faced with the legal obligation under order of the court to do the thing the Minister wanted the corporation to do but, instead of bringing that situation about, instead of letting the legal processes occur, the Minister did what he wanted to do, that was, to abolish Dublin Corporation because the fact that the Fianna Fáil Party had only 15 out of 45 members on the corporation was an embarrassment to the Minister.  He wanted to do it because he did not want Dublin Corporation to be there reminding him of his failure to live up to the promises made by the Government four years ago not to increase rates in respect of health services.  He wanted to abolish Dublin Corporation because it was there to remind him of the fact that he was on record and, indeed, in his own White Paper, as saying that rates was not a proper system for the financing of health services.  So, instead of adopting the reasonable course of expeditious and peremptory legal proceedings, he used what he wanted, that is, the means of abolishing Dublin Corporation because it was an embarrassment to him.</P>
    <P>It is to avoid a similar situation arising in the future that we say that if a Minister feels that a health board is acting so unreasonably that he ought to abolish it, that he is justified in <Col N="323" /> abolishing it, then he should come to the House to justify what he wants to do and if he is not able to justify it to this House and to public opinion, then he should refrain from doing it.</P>
    <P>I believe that if the Minister for Local Government earlier this year had had to come to the Dáil to justify the abolition of Dublin Corporation he would not have abolished the corporation but would instead have caused the city manager or whoever else it may have been to resort to legal proceedings in order to obtain an order of the court to bring about the same result.  But it was not the rates, it was not the health services, the Minister was interested in; it was the abolition of Dublin Corporation and because the corporation took a stand on a matter of principle, the Minister, although he agreed in principle that the corporation were right in their stand, in not using the rates for financing health services, used it as an excuse to abolish Dublin Corporation.  It is to avoid a repetition of that, a repetition of having taxation without representation, that we say that if the Minister is dissatisfied in the future with the conduct of a health board he should come in here to justify the abolition of that board.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Desmond has said, the new health boards will cater for up to one million people and it is not being unreasonable to say that if a Minister for State wants to abolish a body which is looking after one million people he should come into this House to justify the abolition of that body. Such a body, for instance, in the Dublin region will cater for about one-third of our population and if the Minister wants to abolish such a body it is entirely reasonable and necessary in the interests of democracy that he should come into this House to justify his conduct.</P>

      <P>Some of these boards will cover about 2,000 to 3,000. There is no use in exaggerating the case.  We are discussing section 11 of the Health Bill, not the Dublin Corporation. The greatest sanction of all is the sanction of public opinion.  The Minister accepted that it would be a <Col N="324" /> public inquiry.  That public inquiry would be publicised in the local newspapers and everybody would be speaking about it and would know what was happening.  There would be nothing done in a hole and corner way.  In those circumstances the Minister will think twice before deciding that a board should be abolished.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there should be any contention over this amendment because it is one that should be readily acceptable.  I cannot see any grave objection to it unless, of course, the Minister and the Government have little respect for this House. One must take into account in discussing the section and the amendment that Fianna Fáil already hold a threat over local authorities that are not favourably disposed to them, the threat of abolition, and there is no appeal from that action.  We have had <Col N="326" /> the case of Dublin Corporation.  We have had the case of Kerry County Council and other bodies, elected democratically, finding themselves abolished overnight and a commissioner set up in their place.  What the amendment is asking is that the report of a public inquiry should be brought before this House and it is reasonable to assume that it is unlikely that a health board will be abolished for the reasons set out here.  I think it is a fair assumption that it is unlikely that you will find that the performance of its duties by a health board are not being duly and effectually carried out, as stated in the Bill.  Health boards will, I hope, be composed, in the main, if not in full, of men of integrity.  It is most likely and most reasonable to assume they will carry out their duties effectually, as stated in the Bill.  However, if for any reason the Minister finds a public inquiry is necessary &mdash; I understand he has conceded he will hold a public inquiry &mdash; let us then examine the mechanics of a public inquiry if he decides to hold one and if he abolishes a board.</P>
      <P>The inspector appointed by the Minister &mdash; possibly a special appointee &mdash; will travel, say, to Tullamore, which was mentioned by Deputy Lenihan, for the inquiry.  He will dictate terms for the inquiry.  He will not make a decision. He reports back to the Tánaiste who is the Minister for Health in this Government, if this piece of legislation is passed.  Let me emphasise that if the Minister does not like the findings and report of the inspector he can dump them into the wastepaper basket and say, in effect, to the inspector: &ldquo;You keep your mouth shut; it is what I think that will go to the public&rdquo;.  Is that not so?  Is it not usual in public and local inquiries?  We have had housing inquiries under the Planning Acts where the inspector made a recommendation but does everybody not know that if the political strings are powerful enough the recommendation is forgotten and the decision is polished up &mdash; and I think &ldquo;polished up&rdquo; is a fair description &mdash; by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>What use is it, then? The board is abolished.  The Minister has made his finding.  The inspector's report is confidential.  Now, however, if this amendment were accepted it would indicate a great change.  It would indicate that, irrespective of any change the Minister might make in the findings of the inspector, the matter would be relevant to a discussion in this House&mdash;the Minister's report would be available for discussion here.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is honest and sincere in his efforts to formulate legislation here that is fair and just, surely he cannot but accept this amendment? I do not like the policy of the Minister for Health but I will concede that it is my personal opinion that he is a fair-minded man.  One can be fair and conscientious even though one's views may be wrong.  Then, having conceded that, I am amazed that he should offer any objection to this section. What has he to be afraid of?  If he will accept the findings of an impartial inquiry and if he will make a fair decision&mdash;either himself or a successor-in-office&mdash;why hide it from this House? Why not bring it forward, as the amendment requests?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the outset, it is unlikely that boards will be abolished.  The only possible chance I can see of boards being abolished by the Government is not on the grounds mentioned here but possibly because the political outlook of a board may not be in keeping with the Department and it may not kowtow to them.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment.  I do not see that it will make any drastic change in the Bill.  It will establish this House, as it should be established, as the final court for determining any abuses that may take place in any health board area.  Even though the Government of the day have the majority in this House&mdash;Whips are laid on and people even have to vote against their personal views: this is how this Parliament functions, has functioned and I suppose will continue to function&mdash;at the same time, irrespective of that, there would be an opportunity for all Deputies here to have their say on a decision such as one on the outcome <Col N="328" /> of the Health Act, and that is of vital importance.  I appeal, therefore, for acceptance of this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Murphy stated that there will be no contention about this: I agree with him though not, perhaps, for the same reasons.  We are discussing health.  Deputy Ryan has forgotten the health aspect and is back to his old bash at politics again. Deputy Ryan wants to justify his amendment <i>vis-á-vis</i> the abolition of Dublin Corporation.  First of all, I would remind him that Dublin Corporation was abolished simply because they would not carry out the duty the people had elected them to do under legislation passed by this House.  This House has already authorised the setting up of bodies such as the ex-Dublin Corporation.  The fact that he wants to bring it back under any order or authority would mean that we would have a rehash here of what happened in Dublin Corporation.  If the Minister were to accept this amendment <i>in toto</i>, it would not bring home to the members of local authorities that their job is to carry out their duties under the law.  I would also remind Deputy Ryan that Dublin Corporation was abolished before under his own Government and that they did not seek a writ of mandamus against the corporation or put on any extra inquiry.  They simply threw out Dublin Corporation.  On that occasion it was because Dublin Corporation refused to sack a number of men&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>We should try and for heaven's sake take politics out of the Health Bill.  Deputy Ryan is determined that this will not happen.  The health of the people of Dublin is not affected one way or the other by our having a corporation.  However, it is imperative that they have a central <Col N="329" /> authority, when a local authority is abolished for doing something wrong, to ensure that, despite the actions of some members of the corporation, the wages and salaries of its workers will be available to them.</P>
      <P>Had the Minister not acted as he did some months ago, we would have seen many hundreds, if not thousands of workers, left without wages or salaries and our health services would have broken down.  This is what we must do under the new health legislation which is before us.  Under the machinery to be set up we must ensure that our health services will be capable of being implemented for the benefit of the health of the people and not for the benefit of the political health of some individuals here.</P>
      <P>If there is any merit in this amendment&mdash;it is not quite obvious&mdash;then, if it were discussed without a political aspect, we might get somewhere.  The suggestion that before a Minister can make an order abolishing an authority it must come back here to be debated would mean that we would have the same old thing over and over again and I would suggest that the amendment should be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>The question of depriving citizens of medical services comes to my mind.  Efforts have been made from time to time to deprive citizens of medical services, to deprive the sick, the unemployed and other sections and those efforts were dealt with in a reasonable and realistic fashion.  There were members, of course, of political parties who wanted this particular authority abolished for their own political ends, in order to ensure their political runners would be weakened in the contest which was coming.  However, the machinery was there and it dealt fairly effectively with irresponsible members.  We may have irresponsible people again trying to prevent citizens from getting the medical services to which they are entitled and trying to impede the progress of a new board.  Like Deputy Moore, I feel that the time has come when it should no longer be necessary to have a rehash here of the affairs of an authority which fails to do its duty outside.  It can be dealt with in a realistic fashion.  It is a pity that there was not a public inquiry on the last occasion because if there had been some of the public representatives now in the Opposition would be in jail.</P>

      <P>What is desirable is that we should warn the House of the possibility of a repetition of a situation in which 600,000 people are required to pay for a service which is being performed without any right on their part to be represented in the carrying out of that service.  We are entitled to say, as any true democrat will say, that it is wrong that public representatives should be asked to operate under a system of intimidation, that they should be threatened with abolition, that they should live in a state of fear. Without identifying any particular body it is common knowledge that from time to time in the past members of inferior bodies in this State have received some ministerial letters warning them that if they did not act in a particular way they would be abolished.  That is most undesirable in a democracy.  It is particularly undesirable when people are asked to operate a system which the Government <Col N="333" /> of the day in a White Paper acknowledge to be wrong, and which all political parties acknowledge to be wrong, and to try to justify a continuation of a system in which public representatives are asked to operate in a regime of fear and intimidation is wholly unworthy.  We cannot see, therefore, that there can be any sound objection to our request that if the Minister finds himself in disagreement with the health board he should have his inquiry, if he wishes, to ascertain the facts and then, before he makes an order, he should come to this House to justify that order.</P>

      <P>We are on the Committee Stage and the Deputy is free to speak again, and he will be pleased to know that I can answer him again, but our amendment applies only to a case where a Minister is of opinion that the local boards are not duly and effectively performing what he considers to be their duties.  All we say is: let Parliament be the ultimate arbitrator if there is a dispute between a local health board and the Minister.  What can be more reasonable?  We say it is a reasonable and a necessary proposal where we are about to create monster boards catering for between 250,000 and 1,000,000 people.  If there is this disagreement, let it be justified by open debate in the Oireachtas.  If the Minister is not prepared to do that we say that he is afraid of public debate.  This is the place to have the public debate and not by necessarily abbreviated reports in newspapers of public inquiries or by inspired letters from the correspondents of political parties all of which represent a very necessary, vital and helpful contribution to public debate, but the ultimate debate and ultimate responsibility should lie with the Oireachtas in a matter of this kind. This is all we seek and we believe it is a reasonable request.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I make a brief final plea to the Minister on this matter?  We have now spent some two hours trying to wring from him acceptance of this basic principle.  We are visibly unimpressed by the arguments put up by his backbenchers.  Deputy Lenihan would like us to agree to a system of trial by <i>News of the World</i> as to whether public authorities should be abolished or not.  I think he should find a better argument.  Deputy Moore and Deputy Dowling referred to purely parochial issues which have no relevance to this major innovation sought by Deputy Ryan, and myself on the Labour Party side.  May I throw out another suggestion to the Minister?  He has said that he will now concede a public inquiry into the board's performance of its duties: could I also ask if he would be prepared to agree, <Col N="335" /> not alone to a public inquiry, but to publication of the report thereof?  If he would concede that, in addition, at least it would be a further concession.</P>
      <P>In relation to planning appeals in regard to a whole range of activities, or Departmental investigations into, say, vocational education committees, God knows what appears in those reports and many of them are never published.  Therefore, on the three principles of public accountability to this House, for abolishing major health boards catering for roughly six segments of the Irish population we think the Minister should be accountable to the House in terms of the draft order; in terms of public debate, and in terms of giving to such persons elementary security of tenure of office.</P>
      <P>Finally, we suggest that the operation of the old local government principle of inquiry has no bearing on, or relevance or application to this new health board situation.  We believe that what operates in respect of a local urban district council in respect of say 20,000 people has no relevance to the operation of 30 public representatives for 300,000 people or up to 1,000,000 people in relation to health boards or to expenditure in the region of £10 million or £15 million per annum, as against some hundreds of thousands of pounds for a local authority of a minor nature.  Therefore, we ask the Minister to concede this point in relation to the publication of the report and I should be very interested to know what his approach may be.  I do not think we are going to face a regime of fear or intimidation such as that anticipated by Deputy Ryan.  I do not think we have yet reached that esoteric aspect of ministerial administration.  We have still four years to go.  From some of the Ministers we might anticipate that, but I do not think we can use such highly emotive terminology yet.  However, it is still our job to make sure such a situation never will arise.  Therefore, I should be glad to hear the Minister's comments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputies continue to make one mistake in discussing this section.  I shall not try to prolong the debate by arguing the case <Col N="336" /> for the Minister for Local Government in dissolving Dublin Corporation.  It does not arise.  I want to make perfectly clear that so far as the finance required for the operation of the health board is concerned any action taken in relation to the refusal of a body to strike a rate which would cover the operation of the health services would be taken by the Minister for Local Government against the county authorities, the county councils or county boroughs required by him to raise the rate consequent upon a budget having been agreed on between the health board and myself.</P>
      <P>The whole argument about whether the Minister for Local Government was right in disciplining Dublin Corporation as he did, or whether there should be some kind of inquiry or whether the matter should be discussed in the Dáil, does not arise on this section.  I am trying to shorten the debate by not engaging, as I might unless I was forbidden to do so by the Chair, in a lengthy defence of the action of the Minister for Local Government in abolishing Dublin Corporation.  So far as the striking of rates is concerned there is nothing that relates to section 11 (1) (a) under which I may decide to hold a local inquiry into the board's performance of its duties on the grounds that these duties are not being duly and effectively performed.</P>
      <P>I believe Deputy Lenihan was correct in what he said.  It is inconceivable that in the present age the Minister for Health could conduct an inquiry into the performance of a health board and receive a report which he would consider and which would be private to him from an inspector of the office and be able to get away with dismissing a health board on the grounds that the health board was misconducting its affairs and not carrying out its proper duties, if he were to exercise that power either corruptly or simply with a political view or a political object in mind.  I just do not believe it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not something which will happen very often in the life of health boards.  The standard of local democracy is improving and has improved a great deal in the past 20 years.  It is most unlikely that the Minister for <Col N="337" /> Health would hold a local inquiry into the actions of a health board unless there was something really desperately wrong.  I think the Minister is entitled under the circumstances to make his own decision.  I am sorry I cannot agree with the Opposition.  I have been willing to make compromises wherever I could but, in this particular case, I am afraid I will have to stay with the Bill as it is framed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the fact that he would receive a report from his inspector which he specifically stated would be private to himself.  Can be frankly say that it is democratic that a Minister of State should receive such a report which would be purely private to himself? This is the basic objection we are raising.  I have asked the Minister specifically if he could agree that such a report should be published.  Deputy Lenihan wants to splash it all over the newspapers.  He wants the inquiry splashed all over the papers&mdash;all the evidence splashed over the papers&mdash;but if it is good enough to be in the <i>Tullamore Star,</i> if there is such a paper&mdash;I do not think there is&mdash;the report of the inspector who has got to sift and analyse the evidence and make a report from it, is also a fit matter for publication in a local newspaper. This is one elementary act of what I would call the purification of public accountability, an elementary act of political hygiene, if I might use the health term, which the Minister for Health could usefully bring in and agree on the Report Stage of this Bill if he is not prepared to accept Deputy Ryan's amendment at this point of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather it is clear that the evidence presented by the inspector can be published but the inspector's own recommendation is not published in these or other cases.  The Minister then determines the matter. If the evidence is published, if the inquiry is held in public and the people in the district where the regional health board operates can compare the evidence given in public and the evidence as presented by the inspector, they can see for themselves <Col N="338" /> whether it is fair and equitable.  That is the position.  The evidence will be published, but I think an inspector of my Department is entitled to make his report privately and I am entitled to make a decision on his report.</P>
      <P>Again, I think that at the bar of public opinion it would be most unlikely that the Minister would make the mistake of exercising an abusive action in this regard.  As I have said, we are not talking about a refusal to raise money.  We are talking about competence to run a complicated health service in an area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I understand the case the Minister is making.  He is making the case which has been made so often in this House by so many Ministers from the Custom House in the past.  It is the case for the maintenance and spread of bureaucratic control of public bodies throughout the country.  I have been in the Minister's position and I know the kind of language he is talking.  I can understand the kind of sentiments he is expressing. He is saying, in effect, that there must be retained in the Custom House.  In his Department, the power to abolish those bodies which disagree with him and his Department.</P>
      <P>We are very much face to face at the moment in this country with a real threat from bureaucracy.  I will not go into recent examples but it is certain that what is needed at the moment is a healthy independent local public opinion with the power and the right to stand up for a point of view that may in fact be contrary to the views currently being expressed by the Minister and his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in defending the section as it stands and in reply to Deputy Desmond a moment ago, said that the inspector's report would be privy to the Minister.  Why?  The inspector is a public officer.  He is paid out of public funds.  He is doing a public duty.  He hears evidence in public.  Is he to be a mere cypher?  If so, the inquiry is a farce.  If he is there to hear evidence, he is there to appreciate evidence and come to a decision upon it.  Whatever decision he comes to upon the evidence he hears is a public matter and the <Col N="339" /> recommendation he makes should be a matter of public knowledge.</P>
    <P>Bureaucracy works in many ways.  It works by stealth frequently.  It works behind closed doors frequently.  There is nothing more destructive of public confidence than a public inquiry, with evidence publicly heard and then a decision made by the Minister without anyone knowing on what basis it has been made.  One of the big defects in our system of local government over many years, one of the causes of considerable irritation, has been the fact that ministerial decisions frequently appear to come from out of the blue after a local inquiry, without anyone knowing the basis for their making, because the recommendations made to the Minister were not made public.</P>
    <P>Remember, that in relation to the problem dealt with in this section in effect the Minister is the accuser because he accuses a particular body of not carrying out its function.  He then sends down his own inspector to hear his complaint and, having done that, he does not even allow the views of his officer to be made public.  That is not a system of inquiry which stands up to any of the basic requirements of justice.  If, in fact, the result of such an inquiry is the abolition of a body which is intended to look after the interests of, in some instances, over half a million people, it seems to me quite contrary to any democratic concept that a power of this kind should be exercised by the Minister without this Parliament having the right to review it.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Ryan's amendment is basically a democratic one.  It will put a curb on this kind of bureaucratic control that has been exercised far too frequently in the past.  It will make Ministers stop and think, and think very carefully, before they embark on a course designed to abolish such a body.  I do not see who would suffer or who would be wronged.  If the Minister's case has been a good one, and if the inquiry has been properly and validly held, the Minister will be able to come in here to the Dáil and from his stand there he will be able to defend his position and the public will be satisfied that what he did was <Col N="340" /> done in the interests of the people and that he acted in a responsible way. If the section stands as it is and the Minister acts under it he will merely continue the situation in which many people will believe that he acted irresponsibly and there will be frustration and annoyance and the quality of administration will suffer.  I would urge the Minister to have second thoughts on this matter and to concede the point of view expressed by Deputy Ryan in this amendment.  I believe that if he did that he would be improving the quality of administration under this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I agree.  The purpose of amendment No. 12 is that, in the undesirable event of the Minister abolishing a health board, he should not be in the position of leaving the health board in a state of non-existence indefinitely.  The Minister, in the Bill as drafted, provides that he may at any time ask for the removal from office of members of a health board.  The Minister's suggestion is that there should be no obligation on him within any given time to re-establish a health board.  We think that is most undesirable. Again, I need not advance all the <Col N="341" /> arguments as to why people should have a health board, why people should have representation if they are being taxed, why there should be a body there to express the views of the people for whom the service is being provided. These have been advanced already on the previous amendment. What I can say, however, is that accepting those arguments&mdash;and I suspect the Minister agrees, in the main, with what we say about the desirability of having a health board&mdash;he should provide a time within which the new health board should be established. Nothing can be gained by the indefinite provision which he has in the Bill except to give the Minister powers of dictation indefinitely.  This Bill is based upon having in each area a health board which will, to some extent, reflect the wishes of the people of the area as to how they should be served, and will also give a voice in the running of affairs to the people who are called upon to pay for the service.  We, therefore, seek, if the health board is abolished, that the Minister should within two months, by order, provide for the appointment of new members of that board.  The Minister says that &ldquo;at any time&rdquo; he &ldquo;may&rdquo; do it; we say that &ldquo;within two months&rdquo; he &ldquo;shall&rdquo; do it.  It is a very simple amendment and we ask the Minister to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I could accept these amendments.  First of all, under the terms of the Bill the board would be elected in the usual way on the occasion of a local election, so unless the board was abolished immediately after a local election then it could not be left as it was indefinitely. Secondly, I do not see much point in reconstituting a health board in exactly the same way as before within two months after a complete breakdown in executive management. It would mean something really serious, that the board had utterly failed to carry out its duties in administering a great variety of health services covering the management of hospitals, the management of the medical service, child health service and so on.  If I really had to go to the point of abolishing a health board, then the situation <Col N="342" /> would be serious enough so that I might appoint a commissioner or two or three commissioners, and then try to see whether the situation could be changed to the point that a new health board could be elected.  I do not see the necessity for obliging me to reconstitute a health board in the same way as before.  We are talking about matters somewhat remote from reality, particularly if one eliminates the financial question I have already dealt with.  If a board was abolished it would mean that the situation would be very serious, that the board had completely broken down, and the Minister should be allowed discretion in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious from what the Minister has said that he feels that if for some reason he had to abolish a health board very shortly after a local election, then that area should be left without public representatives until the date of the next local election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did not mean that.  What I meant was that the House should know that the health board will inevitably be reconstituted at a local election.  I do not think a Minister would derive popularity for his party if he deliberately retained commissioners on the health board until the local election.  I merely meant the period was confined to periods between local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have at the moment the experience of a commissioner taking the place of public representatives, and I think we all feel that a commissioner is no substitute for public representatives.  A commissioner is a bureaucrat, and two or three commissioners would be two or three bureaucrats. They would not represent the people; they would not be in touch with the needs of the people, and it is a matter of some urgency that a board that would be abolished should be reconstituted as soon as is reasonably possible after the abolition of the board.  It is totally and absolutely wrong that it should be left to a commissioner for any lengthy period and I would appeal to the Minister to put some limitation of time on his right to <Col N="343" /> reconstitute a health board.  It is extremely important that a Minister should not be in that position.  We are legislating here for a long period, for something that can last the lifetime of many Ministers for Health.  Where you have the services being carried on by a commissioner I think it is extremely important that a limitation be put on the time he can exist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House support Deputy Ryan's amendment.  We think it is reasonable that this vacuum which the Minister has put in the Bill be deleted.  It is a clearly implied assumption on the part of the Minister under section 11 (3) of the Bill that:</P>
      <P>At any time after the removal from office of members of a health board under this section, the Minister may be order provide for a new appointment of members to that board.</P>
      <P>That section is liable to place the outgoing board in a vacuum for anything up to five years if they were to be abolished immediately after their appointment.</P>
      <P>This is the first occasion in relation to this Bill that the Minister has mentioned the concept of commissioners. There is nothing in writing about commissioners but the Minister has stated that it would be regarded as being within his discretionary power to appoint commissioners if necessary. Government by commissioner is becoming more fashionable and popular in this country and in four years time &mdash;with the advent of a change of Government, and I think of a rather likely change if only from sheer inertia&mdash;I can see some heartrending reactions from other sides of the House denouncing discretionary authoritarianism being brought into legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By having appointments within a two month period the Minister no doubt feels he will finish up at square one with the same crowd of alleged reactionaries that he had just demolished, but the Minister has by order a time within which to make the new appointments to the board.  There is nothing in this Bill to say what form <Col N="344" /> that order will take and he can therefore be as liberal, as reactionary or as progressive as he wishes.  There is immense disciplinary power given to the Minister under section 11, subsection (3), without putting a board into a vacuum.  We strongly support Deputy Ryan's safeguard because we do not want a situation to develop such as the one which developed when the Minister for Local Government disbanded the Dublin Corporation, the reconstitution of which is solely at the behest of the Minister himself.  We do not want a situation, in the event of health boards being demolished, where their reconsituation or, in fact, their continuation will lie solely at the behest of the Minister for Health.  I think the Minister could agree to Deputy Ryan's proposition without further ado.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of legislation by Ministerial edict which brings into question the whole principle of participation and attempting to make legislation reflect the norms of society.  Any Minister in the House of Commons or, indeed, ironically, in Stormont, who advanced this kind of legislation would be hooted out of the House, even by the most reactionary Unionists.  There is an irony about social legislation in the Republic.  We claim to be utterly tolerant and utterly liberal, yet at the drop of a hat we turn around and include a section which is open to public objection.  I do think the Minister should be specific on this.</P>

The Minister may do it within six months but &ldquo;not later than two years&rdquo; is the phrase I would like to be put in.  That is my suggestion.</P>

It is very unlikely that section 11 (1) (a) will ever be invoked in the modern world.  I feel rather airy fairy about the whole of this, but there has to be this kind of disciplinary legislation in relation to any board.  If I did have to abolish a health board under section 11 (1) (a) and not under the other subsections something really frightful, which I cannot conceive, would have had to have happened. Nevertheless, having said that, I cannot possibly accept two months; let us make it two years and end the argument.  This board will consist of representatives of county councils, the professions, decent men appointed from their organisations and medical associations; and the idea that a sufficient number of them would be so impossible and so inefficient that they were wrecking the health services in their own area is most unlikely.  If I did have to use that power something really frightful would have to have happened and it would be impossible for me to reconstitute the board within two months, so I suggest we make it two years.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to agree with the Minister, speaking against my own colleague Deputy Ryan, that two months would appear to be too short but I think two years is crazy.  It is an urgent matter that democracy be restored as soon as possible, and in a case where it is a matter of urgency surely the Minister could move&mdash;he has moved a bit already&mdash;a bit further and make it a year?  I was inclined to say six months but I think a year is more reasonable.  That would also be a sufficient cooling-off period.  It would give the Minister ample time to reconstitute a board with a completely different outlook.</P>

      <P>I will be very disappointed if the Minister leaves it at two years.  I readily confess that when I said two months in my original amendment it was an opening bid as far as I was concerned and I was hoping to get an opening bid from the other side.  Then, accepting the bid of Deputy Lenihan of two years, I think we could meet half way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and the Deputy will appreciate that when I said within two months it could be a shorter period.  I think a year as a cooling off period adequate enough. Those who have been abolished could possibly have different opinions and might appreciate the Minister's point of view.  You probably would have had a Budget, Estimates and so on and the processing of a health authority for 12 months or thereabouts.  I would ask the Minister to consider abbreviating the period from two years, perhaps, down to 18 months and that would ensure there would be at least a second Estimate and a second Budget before the new reconstituted board would start operating.  I think two years is rather too lengthy a time because the health authority could be in existence for two years or even three years before it might bring upon itself the wrath of the Minister. Two years is rather too lengthy a time.  Perhaps we could meet half way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(5) No modification may be made in the number of persons provided <Col N="347" /> for in section 4 (2) (b) or in the mode of appointing such persons.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In section 11 subsection (4) the Minister seeks to free himself from the obligations which exist under the Bill regarding the construction of health boards.  I can certainly appreciate that reconstituting a health board in the middle of its normal life-span would create a number of difficulties which would make it impossible to apply all the sections of the Bill but it seems to me essential that in the reconstitution of the health board the Minister would have regard to a matter which has been accepted here and accepted by the Minister, that is, the need to have a majority of local representatives on the new health board.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that the principal canons to be observed in the construction of the health boards would be observed.  I would ask the Minister not to negative all the matters which we seek to protect in this Bill by allowing himself completely free scope in the construction of the health board.  If he accepts the limitations which we set out in our amendment he can have a new health board and a satisfactory one without offending any of the principles of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 9, lines 23 and 24, to delete subsection (9).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We regard with considerable concern the provision which simply says that the Minister may, before the establishment of a health board, request the Local Appointments Commissioners to make a selection for appointment as chief executive officer because it imposes no obligation on the Minister to ask the Local Appointments Commissioners <Col N="349" /> to make the necessary appointment.  The subsection which in this amendment we seek to delete would entitle the Minister to appoint the first chief executive officer by simply making it a temporary appointment. What we consider highly objectionable is the probability that by making a temporary appointment of the first chief executive officer and letting him hold office for a number of years the Minister would ensure that person's automatic selection by the Local Appointments Commissioners when in the long run he would invite the Local Appointments Commissioners to make a selection.  In other words, the section as drafted would completely negative the whole Local Appointments Commissioners system which is one of the most fortunate institutions which we have in our public administration.  We should do nothing in this Bill to facilitate getting around the obligation to have appointments in the local authotity service made by the Local Appointments Commissioners.  There would be ample time for the Minister, once this Bill is passed, to invite the Local Appointments Commissioners to proceed immediately to the selection of suitable officers for the eight health boards.  There are certainly many eminently suitable people available but the choice should be made not by the Minister but by the Local Appointments Commissioners.</P>
    <P>We, therefore, think the way to do this is to deprive the Minister of this power to make a temporary appointment, certainly in relation to the first appointment.  We can appreciate that as vacancies arise from time to time after the health boards are set up it may be necessary to have temporary <Col N="350" /> chief executive officers but in such cases it would be highly desirable that the appointment would be made by the local health boards and not by the Minister himself.  We can see the need for having the temporary appointments in such cases but there is no need at the outset of the new health boards to give the Minister the power to make a temporary appointment.  The obligation should rest clearly on the Minister to request the first appointments to be made by the Local Appointments Commissioners.  I doubt very much if there is any Member on the other side of the House who has any genuine reservations about this.  They certainly would not have reservations about it if they happened to be on this side and we were over there.  The way to avoid political jobbery is not to allow it to take place, and that is the purpose of our amendment.</P>

    <P>In addition to the above, a number of proposals have been received from county councils to apply increases to roadworkers in accordance with recommendations agreed on 16th October, 1969, between the Public Services Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the County and City Managers' Association on the basis of Statement on Pay in the Public Service issued by the Government Information Bureau on 29th May, 1969 on behalf of the Minister for Finance. I informed all County Managers by letter dated 31st October, 1969, that where local authorities decided to implement the terms of the Agreement my sanction to the payment of increases could be assumed.</P>

    <P>2.  An allocation is made on the understanding that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  an authority may adjust allocations as between house-purchase loans and supplementary housing grants;</P>
    <P>(2)  an authority may incur debit balances on their accounts of up to 10 per cent of the amount of their allocation.</P>
    <P>3.  Because of the use of funds for various housing purposes, the figures for balances may not in some areas reflect the difference between allocations and payments.</P>
