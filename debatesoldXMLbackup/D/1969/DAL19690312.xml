      <P>The date of Ireland's accession to the European Economic Community will depend to a large extent on how soon the member Governments can agree among themselves on the opening of negotiations with the applicant countries.  While the applications for membership, including that of Ireland, remain on the agenda of the Council, it is not possible at this stage to forecast when agreement to open negotiations will be reached.</P>

These vessels are due for delivery in September, 1969 and February, 1970, respectively. I have no proposals before me at present for the acquisition of further vessels by the company.

I understand, however, that British Rail have arranged for the employment of an alternative vessel on the route during the period in question and Bord Fáilte have told me that they are satisfied that the tourist traffic will not be adversely affected to any significant extent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware. The control of upper airspace i.e. above 25,000 feet is the responsibility of Euro-control of which this country is a member. That organisation has initiated studies on the changes of the upper airspace control which may be necessary <Col N="156" /> or desirable with the growth of air traffic and the advent of supersonic aircraft.  Those studies, which include approval of the staffing and other implications for this country of possible changes, are still in progress.  The control arrangement to be adopted ultimately will be the subject of protracted investigation and it is not possible to forecast the outcome.</P>
      <P>Any concern the staff may feel in this matter should be pursued by them through normal Civil Service channels.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the answer to all these requests for extension is contained in the name of the scheme &mdash; pilot scheme &mdash; designated and put into operation on the basis that it was in quite a small area, roughly about a parish in each case, in each of the counties originally selected, with an intensifying of the application of all the aids and advantages and subsidies available under an instructor.  This then was further enlarged to see whether, in fact, what was learned on the quite small scale would continue to be true on an enlarged scale of up to three parishes as it has turned out to be on average.  This enlarged area in each county is only a relatively short time in operation and the experiment, which one might call it, is still continuing and it is really from what we are to find from these various experiments on the pilot area basis that we hope to draw the information which will determine in the future whether, in fact, some schemes should, perhaps, be deleted, some amended, some extended and so forth.  So really the purpose is pilot and experimental in the main.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he will <Col N="159" /> have the £8 beef subsidy paid for the first two cows on application as this will help small farmers in remote areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of the Beef Cattle Incentive Scheme is twofold: (1) to act as a counter attraction to commercial milk production and (2) to encourage an expansion in the output of good quality beef cattle.  The man with one or two cows generally maintains this small herd to provide milk for his household and cannot be said to be operating a genuine beef enterprise. Furthermore, if the first two cows were eligible for grant, a large number of persons, not engaged in farming at all, but maintaining a cow or two, would be drawing these grants.</P>
      <P>Also I should say it is estimated that it would cost an additional £1.6 million to extend the scheme to cover the first two cows.</P>
      <P>For these reasons, I do not intend to amend the scheme on the lines proposed by the Deputy, but I will have all aspects of the scheme examined at the end of its first year of operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Consultations with industry were conducted mainly through the Federation of Irish Industries and by direct contact with many of the larger firms.  It was initially envisaged that they would cover about 40 per cent of industrial output, but partly because of the timetable for the Programme's preparation and partly because of the poor representation of industry at the joint discussions, only about half of this coverage was achieved.  Trade unions were consulted through the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, who considered joint discussion unnecessary.  I do not regard the degree of consultation which took place with either side of industry as fully satisfactory and this is one of the areas of implementation of the Programme to which further consideration is being given.  The National Industrial Economic Council is at present considering the institutional arrangements which would best serve these needs.</P>
      <P>In the services sector, growth is largely a consequence of growth in the industrial and agricultural sectors, so that the same considerations for preparing projections for the sector do not apply.  The main areas of the public sector and, where relevant, other interests such as the banking sector were, however, consulted.</P>
      <P>Consultations with agriculture were conducted by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and included discussions in the National Agricultural Council and with farm organisations. These discussions extended to all important facets of the agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An early draft of the programme as a whole was also discussed with the General Purposes Committee of the <Col N="178" /> National Industrial Economic Council. These discussions, which were informal, yielded useful results.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the fares for schoolchildren using public bus services are primarily a matter for CIE.</P>
      <P>As from 2nd December, 1968, CIE introduced a new fare structure on their Dublin city and provincial city bus services.  This was the only time that fares to the school named by the Deputy were increased in the past six months.  Even then the increase applied only to children over 16 years of age and the average increase was about 12½ per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had a discussion with the people concerned with this matter in CIE recently.  We had a very full discussion the week before last and any change in the regulations would involve a substantial financial commitment.  To keep the fares at the present level for children under 16, as we have done, is already costing the Exchequer £130,000 per annum.  That is the cost of pegging the fares for children under 16.  If you begin to extend it you will be going into much bigger money.  We are having the whole matter examined.</P>

      <P>As I have explained to the House on a number of occasions the views of the Higher Education Authority have been sought in relation to the nature and extent of the institution of third level education to be provided in Limerick.</P>
      <P>I expect to have the recommendations of the Higher Education Authority on the matter shortly.  Following this I hope to give an early decision in relation to it.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister take any notice of the recommendation made by Dr. Lichfield in his Report in regard to this matter long before the Report of the Committee on Higher Education is considered by the Minister?

      <P>I have read Dr. Lichfield's Report with very great interest.  When I said &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;, I mean in a matter of a week or so.  I hope to have a very full and comprehensive report from the Higher Education Authority prepared by them after two consultations, as the Deputy knows, on the spot in Limerick.  What I promised the deputation from Limerick which saw me in January last was that we would take up this matter with every expedition.  In fact this has been done and a sub-committee of the Higher Education Authority has visited Limerick, has seen all the interested parties, and is fully <i>au fait</i> with all the facts.</P>
      <P>I hope to have their report within a week or ten days after which I shall then consult with the responsible people in Limerick who are interested in having an appropriate educational establishment in Limerick.  Following that discussion with them the Government will announce its decision and we shall have legislation in the Dáil to deal with that and a number of other matters in relation to higher education.</P>

      <P>Because, again, it is on all fours with the Lichfield Report which used the word &ldquo;university&rdquo; and followed the use of that word with the phrase &ldquo;orientated towards technological subjects&rdquo;.

I would direct the <Col N="189" /> Deputy's attention to the actual phraseology used in the Lichfield Report which says &ldquo;a university orientated towards technological subjects&rdquo;.  As far as the Limerick area is concerned the Government have taken a firm decision, which I am sure the Limerick Deputies in the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party support, to develop the whole Shannon region as an industrial zone, and to attract industrial development from the Dublin area.  This major area of industrial development will require technicians and technologists who can be paid well and can be recruited from our own people in that area.  We want the sort of educational and training institution in Limerick that suits the future industrial needs of that area.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any general complaints concerning delay by my Department in dealing with applications by Dublin hospitals for additional staff and equipment.  In particular instances, delays may occur, but any such delays would arise from the detailed examination of the applications which it is necessary to apply where public moneys are involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the proposal for a new lift for a particular Dublin hospital <Col N="195" /> mentioned by the Deputy a number of possible alternatives have to be examined before a final decision on the hospital's application could be arrived at.  This examination has recently been completed and I have arranged to have a grant for the work allocated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear whether the Deputy is referring to every kind of hospital or to general hospitals in particular.  On the assumption that the latter is the case, I would draw his attention to the report of the consultative council on the general hospital services which I have accepted in principle.  The report shows that the number of general hospital beds in this country in relation to population is high by comparison with other countries.  I am, in general, satisfied that the number of hospital beds is adequate to cater for the present patient demand and for expected needs for the next few years.  As to the number of hospitals it is clear that we have too many rather than too few.  The problem is that many of the hospitals are too small to support the type of organisation required in terms of present day medical practice.  Reorganisation of the service on an appropriate basis will require concentration in a smaller number of larger units and this will involve extensive building over a period of years.  The accommodation and facilities in hospitals which have been in operation for a century or more fall short of acceptable present day standards. These will be replaced as part of the reorganisation which I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Particulars of the extent and location of land held in common are not readily available and the extraction of the detailed information requested would entail an enormous expenditure of time and labour and the diversion of special staff for the purpose which cannot be arranged at present.  By way of general comment it may be stated that it is open to interested parties to apply to the Land Commission under the Land Acts for the partition of lands held in common. The relevant statutes are section 24, Land Act; 1939; section 25, Land Act, 1950; section 23, Land Act, 1953; and section 41, Land Act, 1965.</P>
      <P>Apart from the partitioning of commonages pursuant to the provisions quoted above, the Land Commission are also disposed to undertake the actual division and re-arrangement of commonages which are productive or reasonably productive and where the persons likely to benefit are the owners of substandard holdings which can be significantly improved by dividing the commonage and bringing it into production. The Land Commission have no such schemes on hands in County Roscommon at present.</P>
      <P>As regards the Ballinleg district, the Land Commission will examine the possibility of effecting some measure of re-arrangement as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is fair to refer to her as Deputy Dr. O'Connell's candidate.  The lady he recommended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It boils down to the same thing.  Certainly, I do not enjoy referring to this at all.  It was claimed that <Col N="202" /> political bias was shown in the selection of the successful candidate.  I want to contradict this as emphatically as I possibly can.</P>
      <P>Apart from that and apart from some remarks by Deputy L'Estrange to which I referred last night and to which I do not intend to refer again, the discussion was kept at a pretty high level.  One of the opening remarks made by Deputy Dockrell in leading off on this created a very good impression from my point of view.  He said, and I quote from column 1887 of the Official Report of the 27th February:</P>
      <P>The Post Office has a very enviable record in staff and labour relations and I hope that those excellent relations will always continue.</P>
      <P>This is so, despite some references which were made to some petty problems which the staff in the Post Office may have.  Deputy Tully referred to this and said that, perhaps, not enough attention was given to it.  In fact, the tribute from Deputy Dockrell was well merited by the staffs' relation section of my Department.</P>
      <P>While the Minister in his opening address referred to certain difficulties we have had over the past 12 months, on the whole, the amount of trouble of this type which we have had in the Department has been minimal.  This is a tribute in itself to the application of the conciliation and arbitration scheme which almost all members of the Post Office staff accept.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell mentioned that the big event in 1968 from the point of view of the public was the increase in Post Office charges.  He went on to deal with the 440 million letters which were handled in this country in 1967.  He remarked that this increase in postage rates represented 20 per cent and that it meant we would have a little more than 100 million extra pennies to play around with.  I have reckoned that 120 million extra pennies would bring in an additional £½ million in a financial year and this still left a gap to be bridged of nearly £1.3 million because the increased postal staff pay arising from the recent increase amounted to £1.8 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of that I must comment on <Col N="203" /> the general sweeping statement made by Deputy Flanagan who suggested that our postal rates must be the highest in the world.  I cannot let it pass.  Deputy Lindsay said he agreed our postage had got dearer but he commented that, of course, costs had increased.  It may be no harm to draw attention to the fact that as far as Western Europe is concerned our present postal charges, far from being the dearest in the world, are among the lowest.  In countries like Sweden, Italy, West Germany, France and Switzerland, postal rates are all much higher than here.</P>
    <P>It is natural, in a debate dealing with the Post Office which has such a large number of staff, that the postman should become the biggest factor.  After all, he is the man whom the public meet most often.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking into consideration the 19,000 staff we have in the Post Office, staff relations in general demand a great deal of attention. Deputy Tully asked if we had any special arrangements for the training of supervisors and for training in general in what he termed industrial relations. He suggested that I should consider releasing staff in the daytime to attend classes and courses, particularly those conducted by non-civil servants.  I agree fully that this is most important&mdash;that supervisors should undergo instruction in the skills of supervision.  My Department for quite a long time have been conscious of this and at present officials of the Department are conducting an extensive programme of supervisory training.  Shortly, nearly all our supervisors will have benefited from attending such courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they being conducted within the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>We realise, too, the value of training courses in industrial <Col N="204" /> relations conducted by non-civil servants and the Department have always availed themselves fully of courses of that kind conducted by outside bodies whenever we consider courses of that kind to be of value.  Already, substantial numbers of our personnel attend such courses each year and in all cases attendance at such courses is in the Department's time.  Whether courses conducted by the Department themselves or by outside bodies are more beneficial can be a matter of opinion. The Department have been able to strike a balance between the two types of course for supervisors so as to derive the maximum benefit and so as to have our supervisors as well qualified as possible.  From my point of view, this will be Departmental policy because I fully appreciate that the industrial relations field is a most important one and we are determined in the Department that there will be no lack of training in the equipping of supervisors in this aspect of their work.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully mentioned what he described as the hardy annual subject of the five-day week for postmen.  This is something which has been debated for quite some time.  First of all, I should like to dispel any ideas there may be that the Department are not serious in their efforts to succeed in introducing, all over, a five-day week for postmen.  It is not so.  It is something we are most anxious to introduce over the full range and already we have introduced a five-day week for a number of postmen in Dublin where it is possible to do so.  Personally, I should be very pleased if the five-day week could be introduced all over.  I think the House will fully appreciate, however, that it is no easy problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully suggested in the course of his contribution that there is no reason why we should not make Saturday a no-delivery day.  Let me say, off the cuff, that I could not go along with him and I doubt if Deputy Tully has worked out what kind of postal service we would have if we were to do it.  If there was no delivery on Saturday, in the same way there would not be any collection on Saturday and this would mean that deliveries on Monday would be much later than at present.  Any mail posted late <Col N="205" /> on Friday night or on Saturday would not be delivered until the following Tuesday.  That would bring about a worsening in the standard of the postal service at a stage when we have asked the users of the service to pay increased rates.  It would not be justified because I do not think the public could be expected to accept a substandard service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Staff relations have found many answers to a number of problems that have met the staff requirements over the past couple of years. This arises from Deputy Dockrell's remarks in regard to staff relations. In such a big body there will always be staff relations problems.  The Minister has given me instructions to devote myself to a considerable extent to the staff relations side, and having devoted quite a considerable amount of attention to the subject, the fact remains that I think relations of this nature within the Post Office&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I immediately think of the dust in Sheriff Street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to get around to talk about the dust in Sheriff Street. Perhaps it might be as well if I were to deal with it now.  The dust in Sheriff Street is a major problem and a number of steps have already been taken to alleviate or remove the problem.  It is not too easy.  Deputy Tully raised this question during the year.  He did not, in fact, raise it in the debate or mention the question of some dust extractor being fitted when the building was being erected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in this particular debate.  The Deputy mentioned it on a number of occasions previously.  There is the problem of dust and a number of efforts have been made to relieve or to minimise the problem.  Some of those efforts have been successful but there is no doubt that the close proximity of a coal yard to the building itself is probably a major factor.  One of the problems here is that there is quite an amount of glass in the building with the result that in hot weather you have quite an amount of heat.  It is difficult to open the windows because <Col N="207" /> of the coal yard problem and the result is that the place becomes overheated. When the Deputy raised this matter with me previously, I promised to apply myself to it personally.  He says his estimation of me has not been increased very much as a result of whatever remedial action was or was not taken.</P>
      <P>Maybe, on the face of it, I must accept that.  I have found one of the major problems there is the problem of getting the coal yard removed, and that is something which will not happen overnight.  That is something which will take time.  In fact, there is provision made as far as Dublin Port and Docks are concerned for the removal of the coal yard to, I think, the Ringsend area.  This is not going to happen immediately and there is no point in my saying during the course of this debate that the source of the problem will be removed within the next 12 months period because it will not.  I can only promise to continue to try to minimise the dust problem as far as possible.  In this regard let me say that mail bags are conducive to the collection of dirt.  They are now cleaned about four times oftener than they used to be in an effort to remove the causes of the dust.  I think other steps are being taken to try to keep down the incidence of dust from the fuel house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that although there are windows on the coal yard side, they cannot be opened, that only a small number of windows on the other side can be opened and that this makes the position almost impossible? The planning was awful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot quite accept that.  The planning may look at the present time to be awful but it would be quite unfair to condemn the planners. Let us look at it from this point of view.  At the time the plan was being made they were hoping before the sorting office was opened&mdash;I think there was comment enough that it took long enough to build&mdash;that the coal yard would have been removed.  They planned on the basis that there would be no coal yard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept we are worse off than we were in Pearse Street. I daresay if we remove the dust problem we will probably be creating some other problem.  We also have the parking problem, to which Deputy Tully also referred.  When this building was being planned about ten years ago the same thought was not given to parking problems.  The Deputy said there was no parking space provided for motor bicycles or cycles.  That is not the case. There is adequate parking space in the building itself for motor bicycles and cycles.  This is my information and I have no reason for thinking it is otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the point.  I would hate the Deputy to think I specifically took no action on the promise I gave some months ago in connection with the dust.  I was all over this sorting office and examined it from the dust point of view.  I had already been in there on a number of occasions in connection with letter sorting, parcel sorting and that type of thing.  I found that there is a covered space for bicycles and motor cycles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Very inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know it is pretty adequate.  For some reason or other the number of bicycles and motor cycles is becoming less and the parking problem arising from more of the staff using cars is becoming more serious. At the time of the planning this was not sufficiently taken into consideration. <Col N="209" /> I will not say that parking there is completely adequate but the parking problem in Sheriff Street is, I suppose, similar to the parking problem in the rest of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very bad recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough, but it is over ten years since this building was planned and it seemed there was adequate space at the time.  During the course of the discussion the Deputy said when we introduce more mechanical sorting machines and mechanical cancelling machines there will be inadequate space for staff.  If that is the case, let us accept the fact that when the site was taken ten years ago there was not sufficient space for car parking as such.  With regard to the machinery in the letter office, it may be taken that, when we reach the stage of introducing automatic letter sorting equipment, working conditions will not be worsened.  I can only promise the House that I will keep as close an eye as possible on this dust problem.  I wish to re-assure the Deputy that I have not stood up to speak here without having taken an interest in the matter.  In fact, a number of small dust extractors have been introduced and, as further suggestions are presented to me, I propose to take whatever action I can to help in alleviating this problem.</P>
      <P>Another of the hardy annuals to which reference was made by Deputies Dockrell, Tully and Crinion was the question of postmen's uniforms.  It has been agreed that a further improvement be made in the quality of the new design uniforms to which I referred in the last Estimates debate. This improvement is in the materials to be used which will be of a wool/ terelene mixture in a navy blue colour and supplies are at present being manufactured.  It is expected that the new uniforms will be ready for general issue early in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to these uniforms, Deputy Tully mentioned that the tunic will be somewhat different.  I see he is now playing with his tie.  Representations have been made for the issue of shirts <Col N="210" /> and ties to postmen and this matter is being considered.  The Deputy smiles, but he talked specifically about only one drip-dry shirt.  No doubt, when speaking of inner garments, one must speak in terms of the plural rather than the singular.  This is something that has to be looked into, because all these things cost money.  Deputy Tully and others also raised the question of the regulation which at present restrains, as he describes it, the freedom of members of the Department's staff&mdash;in common, let me say, with all civil servants&mdash;to engage in politics.</P>
    <P>At present there is a far-reaching claim before the Departmental council on behalf of certain grades of staff in my Department in this regard.  This claim is under conciliation and arbitration machinery.  The case is that the existing restraints on political activities be removed.  Until these negotiations come to a conclusion, I think it would be improper for me to comment, except to say that it is a recognised fact that the permanent post office staffs are civil servants and this has far-reaching implications.  Any arrangement that would be made in this matter would, I take it, have to be approved by the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a question which has come up on a number of occasions but, in view of the fact that this matter is being discussed at present by the Departmental council, I would much prefer to leave further comment until after the outcome of the negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>We are certainly not afraid about the outcome of the negotiations. From listening to Deputy L'Estrange yesterday evening there is no reason why we should be afraid because, according to him, every postman who is appointed is a Fianna Fáil cumann secretary, so that we should in fact be trying to ensure that they would have this right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="211" /> Another subject which has been mentioned during this debate is the question of pensions for part-time and auxiliary postmen.  Deputy Corish, I think, when speaking on this, actually mentioned the pay of the auxiliary postmen apart altogether from the pensions.  We must realise that an auxiliary postman is a man who does not hold a full-time post and the wages which he receives are worked out in relation to the number of hours he works.  Those wages fall in line with the full-time established postman's wages, but I do not think that an auxiliary postman's wages can be treated in any way differently from the manner in which they have been treated up to now.  In relation to the question of pensions for unestablished full-time auxiliary and part-time postmen there is a claim on this under conciliation before the general council. Again, this is something on which I should not like to comment at this stage because any question of amending the Acts in relation to this is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  Certainly, if the Departmental council can come to any arrangement on this, I have no doubt that my Minister would be only too willing to submit the case to the Minister for Finance.</P>

Far be it from me to speak in any derogatory manner about the Roland Hill Fund, which does a tremendous amount of good work and is a fund which is much appreciated within the post office by the staff in general, but there are gratuities payable to unestablished full-time and part-time postmen who have been in service for seven years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say that I am not at this particular stage too interested when those things were introduced. What I am trying to say is that I cannot allow Deputy Tully at the same time to claim that no progress has been made.  Quite a share of progress has been made.  Just because there are some things which still remain to be done is no reason to speak in a derogatory manner of the progress that has been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in fairness to people who have commented so far in this debate that I am endeavouring to go into as much detail as possible in replying to them.  Let me say, as I have already said in connection with the taking of interest and taking an active part in politics, that this matter is at present under consideration.  Both those things &mdash;interest in politics and the claim for pensions for full-time unestablished and part-time staff&mdash;is before the general council of the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme.  When it is being considered, I do not think it is appropriate for me to say too much about it.</P>
      <P>Reference was also made by Deputy Tully to this question of overtime and the payment of overtime to postmen at Christmas.  He raised it by way of a Parliamentary Question some time ago. I have been checking and I find that out of 5,000 rural postmen we have had complaints from seven postmen arising from those type of payments last Christmas.  They complained that they were not allowed sufficient overtime in respect of the pressure period at Christmas, 1968.  Those complaints are at present being investigated.  The fact that we have complaints from seven out of 5,000 men is an indication that the incidence of what they can claim to be short payment of postmen of this nature or insufficient overtime payment to them does not seem to be too justified.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully also criticised the issue of income tax assessment forms.  He referred to the forms for completion regarding income tax claims which were sent in Irish to postmen.  In this respect, let me say that since 1937, when postmen were first recruited through the Civil Service Commission and since that time, Irish was listed as an essential subject and the income tax forms of this nature are invariably sent by the Revenue Commissioners in their Irish form.</P>

      <P>It is intended to be a dirty word when used by the Opposition. I seem to be giving an extra amount of attention to the comments made by Deputy Tully but he does endeavour in the debate on this particular <Col N="214" /> Post Office Estimate to get down to all the little matters that might be annoying people.  He referred to the fact that those little niggling grievances are there and said that an accumulation of these over the years can in the end cause an explosion out of all proportion to the problems.  In this particular regard the Deputy is right.  He suggested that the delays were, perhaps, due to understaffing of the branch concerned. I cannot accept this and I should say that I and my Department are fully conscious of the point made by Deputy Tully that small unresolved grievances can lead to serious trouble. Every effort is made, therefore, to deal with this type of complaint as quickly, effectively and efficiently as possible.  I am satisfied in general that there is no unavoidable delay in dealing with staff claims and with general grievances. This is not to say that consideration of some claims and of various representations do not take time.  The consideration of them does take time but then I think it will be agreed that in most cases it is easier and takes less time to formulate claims than it does to answer them.  Claims and representations have to be examined from many aspects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should appreciate the difficulty of dealing with the claims.  If the Deputy says so much time goes into the preparation of the claims he will appreciate that to deal objectively with the claims and to try to meet the claims must of necessity take time.  It would be quite easy to go back immediately with a negative answer and say &ldquo;no&rdquo; on any matters raised but this certainly would not be the responsible way to deal with the problem.  I do not think anybody would condone this type of attitude.  My aim is that all matters raised should be dealt with as promptly and reasonably as possible, and I think this is being done.  If I find that the staff of the staff relations branch is not adequate to enable it to deal as expeditiously as possible with matters of this nature, I will not hesitate to strengthen that particular Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="215" /> Reference was made in the Minister's opening remarks to the increased number of welfare officers in the Department. The Department has been one of the pioneers in this country in providing welfare officers.  I suppose in an organisation with a staff of 18,000 or 19,000 this, in fact, was not to be wondered at.  Over the years welfare officers in the Department have done very good work in a quite and unobtrusive way.  They have dealt with a great variety of personal welfare problems among the staff.  Following a comparatively recent review of the work and the scope for further activity of this kind, it was decided, within the last two years, to create a number of additional full-time and part-time posts for welfare officers.  At present, there is a total of eight of a staff engaged on this work, four full-time and four part-time.  It is expected that they will be able to deal reasonably adequately with welfare problems arising among the staff.  This matter&mdash;the same as the staff relations side&mdash;will be kept constantly under review in order to ensure that those eight officers are sufficient adequately to cope with the problems.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies made reference to the inadequacy of post offices in both the city and the country. Deputy Dockrell raised the question of facilities for the posting of large envelopes in the Baggot Street and Fitzwilliam area.  These are all matters that I think it would be reasonably inappropriate for me to deal with specifically at this particular stage.  It must be realised that there are a number of different types of post boxes. The Baggot Street-Fitzwilliam area is an area where, I suppose, we are likely to have the posting of rather a large-sized envelope which can get itself peculiarly caught in a box so that, even though the post box may not be full, the next person posting might find some sort of a blockage at the aperture and might decide it was full.  He might even put in the envelope and it might come out again.  This matter is engaging the attention of this section of my Department with a view to seeing if we can improve the position in a number of these areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" /> A number of Deputies referred to over-filled boxes and to the inadequacy of the size of boxes in various places.  I think it would be inappropriate for me to refer to them now.  Deputy Dockrell referred to the Baggot Street-Fitzwilliam area and also to a box at South King Street; Deputy Esmonde referred to boxes in his own area; Deputy O'Connell, Deputy Crinion and a number of other Deputies referred to this matter, too.  I shall look into the various points raised by them and I shall endeavour to communicate with them in relation to the particular boxes about which they spoke.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies also referred to the closing of the rural sub-post offices.  I was rather surprised that Deputy O'Donnell tied the closing of rural post offices to the motorisation of rural deliveries.  Deputy O'Donnell said he found that we had let off postmen who had been a number of years employed as postmen when we introduced motorisation into a given area.  I have already contradicted this particular statement and I should like to take this opportunity of saying that, in order to avoid any type of hardship to long-serving postmen, the motorised services are introduced only on the occurrence of vacancies.  There is no change envisaged in this practice.  As such, motorisation has resulted in the disemployment only of temporary men taken on for a while after the creation of some vacancy pending the rearranging of the motorised area.  Certainly, the majority of the men displaced in this operation have been employed for far less than a six-months temporary period.  I have been endeavouring to check on the statement by Deputy O'Donnell.  I cannot find that we had anybody four or five years who was disemployed through motorisation.  In regard to any of the sub-post offices that were closed, they were not being used by the public to any great extent. The amount of post office business transacted at the great majority of them was quite trivial.  Sub-post offices have not been closed except where the amount of business was negligible and they were closed only when vacancies, for one reason or another, arose.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay, when speaking on the postal side of the business &mdash; before <Col N="217" /> he turned over to RTE &mdash; was quite rational in his remarks on this matter. He accepted that the closure of post offices of this nature is justified.  Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins raised a question which has been engaging my attention for some time.  In areas where sub-post offices of this nature are closed, she mentioned&mdash;I would imagine it would be an unusual one &mdash; the case of the old age pensioner who has to hire a car and to pay a considerable sum of money to go to the next post office to collect his or her old age pension.  One of the things that have helped to make the closure of sub-post offices in country districts a little bit more acceptable has been the fact that, since recent Budgets, old age pensioners now have free travel facilities.  I am fully mindful of the fact that that is not of much use where public transport is not providing a service but my experience has been that, in those areas where small offices have been closed, the number of social welfare beneficiaries affected is very small and, may be in 50 per cent of the cases, the alternative post office to which they would have to go to collect their pension is not much farther away.</P>
    <P>I think it would be inappropriate if I did not refer to the question of giro because this question of the establishment of a giro system in this country has been receiving what I can describe as intermittent consideration in my Department in recent years.  However, due to other more pressing commitments, it has not been possible to carry out the full detailed examination that would be essential before a firm decision could be made on whether a service of this kind could justifiably be provided.  The present Post Office money order and postal order remittance services and the commercial banks system in this country are more highly developed and widely used than in most of the European countries that operate the giro banks.  Consequently, it is by no means certain that a giro would provide a worthwhile medium for transmitting money here and that the demand for such a service would enable it to be provided on an economic basis.  Whether or not it would be economic, let me say that the setting-up <Col N="218" /> of such a service would require quite heavy capital expenditure while, at the same time, the demand for it from the general public has so far been practically negligible.  The need for the service and the expenditure involved could not, therefore, at this stage be put in any way high on the scale of priorities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully made reference to individual post offices.  I think it would possibly be more appropriate for me to deal with them directly with the Deputy.  He made the case that postmasters do not seem to have the power to have something in the nature of urgent remedial works carried out at their own post office or, indeed, any sort of necessary work. This is not so, but arising from his comments I did find that the functions of the postmaster in the area do not allow him to go ahead with redecorating his premises. It is a power which, perhaps, the local sub-postmaster should have and I propose to look into the matter.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked for more variety in designing new post office buildings. Frankly, I was rather surprised at this comment.  I wonder if the Deputy has seen some of the really new post offices we have had erected, the post office in Droichead Nua, in Wicklow and in Carlow, which is the most recent one.</P>
    <P>The Carlow post office is a fine building and one that cannot be criticised.  The Deputy did not say whether he was criticising the design but having looked at these three post offices some time ago, I felt that they were buildings of which I, as representing the Post Office, could be very proud.  It was also suggested that the Department should employ consultants to advise on changing the colour of Post Office vehicles in the interest of road safety.  This is something on which we are actively engaged at present and I have looked at suggested new colours to make the vehicles more attractive and more &ldquo;see-able&rdquo; if you could use the word. The new image which we will shortly have of post office vehicles and of such things as letter-boxes will be a brighter <Col N="219" /> one, if an image can be created through paint.</P>
    <P>It was rather appropriate that somebody should have suggested that some type of reflective band should be issued to postmen.  This is something which engaged the attention of a number of people, particularly in regard to the Department of Education when the new times were brought in.  Postmen are out earlier than most people and it is proposed to issue a yellow or an orange coloured cape to replace the existing black cape.  In addition, the Department are considering issuing reflective armbands to foot postmen. This is not something which is to be considered for any length of time; they will be issued for what we might call the next dark season, as far as delivering post is concerned.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to cover the general trend of the discussion up to now as far as possible and, naturally, I have kept away from the bulk of the discussion which centred around Telefís Éireann and telephone development. Those are subjects which the Minister will be covering in his reply. I should like to take the opportunity, while not being able to take the credit for it, in relation to the kind words which have been expressed from all sides about the efficiency, courtesy and overall conduct of the post office staff, of expressing my satisfaction at hearing this, on behalf of the staff in my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to see the Minister looking calm and serene.  It was rather fortunate that he was absent some time ago when a reference was made to something which has a depressing effect on the Minister. I hope that as a result he will retain his calmness.  All aspects of the debate have been covered in greater detail this year than in any other year.  The Parliamentary Secretary has replied to the debate in so far as services other than the broadcasting services are concerned, but I should like to mention the biggest factor in the Department's service and that is the postman.  The Parliamentary Secretary a short time ago referred to <Col N="220" /> him as the biggest factor in the service. The postman I have in mind is the unestablished postman and the auxiliary postman.  Now is the time to grant to these men what almost all other workers in public employment have been granted for a long time and that is a pension scheme.</P>
      <P>I have been a Member of this House for 18 years and in every annual debate on this Estimate the question of pensions for auxiliary and unestablished postmen has been referred to.  Always from the Minister of the day suggestions have been made, as they have been made by the Parliamentary Secretary today, to the effect that &ldquo;this is a problem we are looking into; it is a rather difficult problem and probably the less said about it at this stage the better&rdquo;.  The Parliamentary Secretary repeated that kind of platitude and said that this matter has been referred to the general council and that it would be unwise for him to say too much about it, that it would be better to leave it over.  Does he mean that we should leave it over and forget about it for another year?  If he does, then I am not satisfied with that.  Nothing has happened about this issue despite the endeavours of the unions and of others involved.</P>
      <P>As a rural Deputy, I believe that people are entitled to recognition and to pensions and the time to deal with the matter is now and not in the future.  Unfortunately for the postmen concerned there was a change of Government in 1957.  In 1956 the inter-Party Government enabled pensions to be paid to local authority workers such as road workers and were it not for the interruption in 1957 postmen and forestry workers would have been treated in a similar fashion and there would be no need for a Deputy to have to refer to this matter of pensions in 1969.  All we are looking for is the introduction of a pension scheme for these workers which would be similar to the pension scheme operating, say, for local authority road workers.  That is not unreasonable. There is a number of full-time unestablished postmen and a number of auxiliary postmen who as far as a 40-hour week is concerned could be described as being full-time workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="221" /> I am saying to Deputy Childers as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and to his Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Lalor, that this question is more important than many other questions that seemed to take up the greater part of this debate.  I have made a number of references to it over the years.  I do not like the term &ldquo;hardy annual&rdquo; which the Parliamentary Secretary used a number of times in his contribution. Possibly he was justified in using the term &ldquo;hardy annual&rdquo; but this is something that I as a rural Deputy and a Member of this House have been asked about both inside and outside the constituency I represent.  I am asking the two men in charge of the Department to ensure that this scheme is formulated and brought before this House without delay.</P>
    <P>I do not see any great difference between a man employed by a local authority on manual work and a man employed by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs on postal duties.  Is it not unfair and unjust and is it not time to wipe out this injustice?  I am appealing now and I am repeating myself on this question that, irrespective of what is happening before the so called general council or before arbitration or whatever discussions the Minister is having with the Minister for Finance, something must be done at last on this question of pensions for postmen who are not in receipt of them at present.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that the five-day week has been established.  I know the problems and difficulties confronting the Department in granting a five-day week to postmen but listening to the cross questions while the Parliamentary Secretary was speaking between himself, Deputy Dillon and Deputy Tully, I thought the obvious way out, which may be acceptable to postmen, is if we must have letters delivered six days of the week to give a bonus for the sixth day.  Are they not entitled, seeing that other workers have the benefit of a five-day week, to get an additional bonus for the sixth day?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be a five-day week then.  I thought you were looking for a genuine five-day week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all open to compromise.  I think that would be a solution to this problem. Give them an additional bonus if, as the Minister and Parliamentary Secretary believe &mdash; and incidentally I agree with them &mdash; postal services must operate six days a week.  I hope Deputy Childers will ponder on that because I shall be asking him a few questions as to what action he is taking on it.</P>
      <P>Mark you, despite reflections which the Minister has cast on me on a number of occasions, I set great value on Deputy Childers as a Minister.  I will give him credit for being a man of some ability over and above that which you find on the benches across from me.  I believe he has qualifications for the post he holds and he has qualifications for being a member of our senior executive, a member of the Government.  I want to say to him in this discussion that I am sure he will address himself to the question I have put to him on pensions for postmen who are not in receipt of them and he cannot but be forced to the conclusion that their grievance is soundly based.</P>
      <P>I am well aware that this country now is a mass of grievances.  Everybody seems to have a grievance.  All sections of the community seem to have a grievance.  I know a number of them are justifiable grievances but we all know that a number of others are not too justifiable.  Everybody knows that.  I am not trying to make an unfair case for any group or section. I judge each case on its merits and unless it has merits I do not support it.  The Minister for Finance may say that all sections and groups are looking for more and more at the moment.  We appreciate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that money does not fall from heaven, that money has to be taken from people with one hand in order to give it to them with the other. At the same time, the race now is moving at a fast pace and if a group is not forceful but is bashful or diffident about their claims, and such groups are very few, they are likely to be left <Col N="223" /> out of the race, they are likely to be forgotten.  This is the time for pressurising and, if you like, this is what I am doing here on behalf of the postmen in order to secure pensions for them because I think one must pressurise now.  The people who are pressurising seem to be winning.  I ask the Minister to address himself to this question without delay.</P>
    <P>I must confess I had not time to read the Minister's statement until a few hours ago.  I heard a great deal about it on the radio and I read something about it in the press.  I thought the poor man had made some outlandish statements but during my short time scanning his statement I must confess in fairness to him that I could not see anything outlandish.  It was his usual type of statement.  There is nothing in it to merit any great criticism. He has certain views on the broadcasting service and a Minister of State or any other man is entitled to put forward his views just as well as any other Deputy.  That does not mean we must agree with him.  I would not say there was anything radical about his views. The Minister is a man who can stand up and speak for a long time without saying too much.  That system was made use of in his statement when introducing his Estimate.</P>
    <P>I have another point of view on this broadcasting service and before I mention it I want to say that the Minister is quite entitled to make the comments he made.  He may have support for them from a number of people throughout the country.  As against that it is generally agreed by all Members of this House who have been interviewed on RTE that they were generally satisfied that they got a fair deal. I do not like mentioning names in this House but the man who mainly deals with Members of the Oireachtas.  Dr. Thornley, is a fair and impartial interviewer. He is the man mainly connected with political discussions.</P>
    <P>I realise that the Minister is showing signs of late of being a little thinskinned and on that basis I am giving him absolution for his reference to the broadcasting organisation.  It is very difficult to please the public.  No matter what programmes are broadcast, someone <Col N="224" /> is dissatisfied.  That brings me to my main point: why not provide another channel?  We would like to see what kind of programmes are broadcast in Britain.  On two or three occasions when I put down a question to the Minister I got back the usual circular from the Ceann Comhairle telling me that I was not entitled to raise this matter in the House.  I do not know why I was not entitled to raise the matter in the House and why the question was refused.  Possibly it was on the same basis as my petition to raise a matter on the Adjournment with the Minister in his role as Minister for Transport and Power last week was refused.</P>
    <P>Telefís Éireann has been in existence for some years and, generally, it can be said that it is giving a reasonably good service but we want more.  In the northern half of the country I understand that three channels are available. We in south-west Cork have only one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the province of Munster and possibly from Dublin southwards there is only one channel available.  I do not know anything about the cost of providing an additional channel, but I think we should get it and I think we should see what is happening in Britain.  I do not see why we should not have reception of British television in the southern half of the country just as in the northern half.  We want to broaden our knowledge. If we were dissatisfied with a programme on Telefís Éireann the way out of the trouble would be to turn a knob and receive a cross-Channel programme. Many of our people are in Britain.  Fianna Fáil have pushed a good few across the water.  We might hear some news that would be interesting from some of these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My view of Telefís Éireann is that it is up to any reasonable standard that we could set.  It is an infant body. There are programmes that I dislike but possibly the programmes that I dislike might be pleasing to the Minister. We must get an additional channel and <Col N="225" /> I should like to hear from the Minister when he is replying to the debate whether we will have that additional channel or not.  I want to labour this matter for a few minutes because not until this time twelve months, if we survive the election, will we get an opportunity of asking for this additional channel seeing that it is not relevant at Question Time, although I do not know in what way it is irrelevant. Some things happen here that it is very difficult to account for.</P>
    <P>I am making a plea, generally, on behalf of many people who have to make do with one channel&mdash;Telefís Éireann.  We are anxious to get additional channels, possibly, initially, one and later, if circumstances allow, two. That is our main criticism of our television service.  We must have alternatives. I am putting it to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that it is his responsibility and on him rests the obligation to tell us whether or not we are to have that service.</P>
    <P>There are a few minor matters, minor in the sense that there are no great complaints.  I must say the general public are satisfied with the postal services.  We hear very few complaints. As the Parliamentary Secretary suggested, and I think it is an accepted fact, the Department is a very important one, providing many different classifications of services.  By and large, the staffs employed by the Department are courteous and civil.  There may be an odd crank here and there, as is inevitable in an organisation which employs approximately 19,000 persons. The public are satisfied and the public are difficult to satisfy.  The Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary should be satisfied, also, on that score.</P>
    <P>In many parts of the country there is delay in providing a telephone service. According to the Minister's statement, the position appears bright but I wonder is it really as bright as it appears to be.  I hope to put that to the test in the not too distant future by again reminding the Department of applications which have been outstanding for some time and which I hope will be dealt with in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Minister <Col N="226" /> that some years ago I inquired of him or his predecessor as to the position with regard to the extension of the automatic telephone service to all parts of south-west Cork and was told that the service would be provided in some four years.  After six or seven years the service was provided in what could be termed half the area and the other half is still without the service.  When is the automatic telephone service likely to be extended to all parts of west Cork?  It is most important that west Cork should have that service in view of the fact that it is the premier tourist centre of the country.  That is a question that requires an immediate answer.  If in 1960 the Minister thought the service could be provided in 1965 what is his view about this matter in 1969?  It is essential that the automatic telephone service should be provided. People are better pleased when the automatic telephone service is available. They have more confidence.  I had better not say too much on that question because the last time that I referred to lack of confidence in some places I received letters from organisations supposedly representing some of those people whom I was alleged to have accused.</P>
    <P>The position is that, whether we like it or not, a number of people are not anxious to avail of our telephone services and this is no reflection on our staffs.  It is a statement of fact. They are doubtful about their conversations and discussions being confidential. That is an absolute fact.  We all have experience as Members of this House of people travelling long journeys to us to discuss matters that could adequately be dealt with by phone but because of lack of confidence, in most cases in my opinion wrongly, people are not availing of the service.  There is consequent loss of revenue.  The way to overcome this problem is to provide an automatic service which people regard as being absolutely confidential.  I do not know whether it is or not but that is the general feeling about it and, therefore, people use the service freely.</P>
    <P>In case I might get further letters as a result of the report of my statement <Col N="227" /> being read I want to make it quite clear, as I made it clear when I referred to this matter on a previous occasion, that I am merely expressing an opinion held by a section of the general public, a section of sufficiently significant size of warrant mention of the position in the House.  I am not aware as to whether or not in all cases there is any justification for such allegation.  I know from the situation in my own area that there is little or no justification.  We have enough to do looking after our own business without minding other people's business.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Department's work that I would like to refer to is the Post Office Savings Bank.  The Minister and his advisers have access to more information than Deputies, and they can assess better the type of people who invest money in the Post Office Savings Bank.  To my mind the people who invest money are from the lower income group, as well as youths and children, who are encouraged to open Post Office savings accounts.  If that is correct, in most cases such people would not be liable for income tax. Whilst the trend in interest rate has been upward &mdash; it has increased from 2½ per cent to 4 per cent within the past few years &mdash; I believe it should be stepped up to 5 per cent.  I am fully aware of the introduction of the 6½ per cent bonds, but the type of people who use Post Office savings accounts would be much more at home continuing to use the Post Office savings book which they hold.  In order to encourage the lower income people to put their money in the Post Office, a rate of less than 5 per cent is inadequate, particularly having regard to the fact that so many of these investors &mdash; at least the investors that I know and who I believe are typical of the investors in the country generally &mdash; are not liable for income tax.  With the high cost of money at the present time and the big dividends paid for it from private and other sources, I think the small investor should get an increased rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is the job <Col N="228" /> of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to make a case to the Minister for Finance.  It could be said that every Department must look to the Department of Finance, but it is part and parcel of the function of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to bring to the notice of the Minister for Finance, or whoever else has to be consulted, matters such as this.  That is why I raise it in this discussion.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the question of closing sub-post offices and, according to the Minister's statement, some 28 or 29 sub-post offices have been closed since 1st January, 1967.  A case could be made for closing some rural post offices where business is not too brisk, but a case could equally be made, in some instances, for keeping them open.</P>
      <P>We must bear in mind a number of factors.  The small post offices, it is true to say, are family possessions.  They are handed down from father to son and from mother to daughter.  The subpostmaster's office is a nice perk; it is something you can pass along, and there are very few jobs you can pass along to your family.  At the same time, they are giving good service, in the main, and there is a little shop attached to the post office.  The question arises then: is it fair to the family to take the little office away from them?  Is it fair to the people in the immediate neighbourhood, many of them elderly people, to ask them to travel four or five miles to the nearest town or village? There are several questions to be examined.  The matter must be examined from the social side as well, and I would ask the Minister to be slow in this policy, which seems to be gathering momentum, of closing small rural offices.  Once an office is closed there is no hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would find fault with the public relations section of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in that respect. An office was closed recently in Castletownkinnagh. People made a petition to the Minister but of little avail. Various TDs were asked to intervene. We had in mind to discuss the position with him but we did not get an opportunity.  Where people have a grievance, even though he may think <Col N="229" /> the grievance is not well-founded, there is an obligation on the Minister to listen to them or at least to listen to their representatives.  The number of occasions on which he is asked to receive a deputation is small as far as we are concerned, and I do not see why the Minister should deny us that right. I do not like this dictatorial attitude at all on the part of any Minister or any government.</P>
    <P>The Government are only over there because they won a few seats more than those of us who are over here.  If one went into more detail they are in office with a minority vote.  There is not much room for Ministers to adopt a too-dictatorial attitude.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Childers, is not as bad as another of his colleagues who seems to be a past-master in that line.  I do not like making these references but I think the Minister who must go out and get votes to get himself elected will appreciate that the rural Deputy has to get voters to elect him and that he has certain rights and obligations and that people who feel they have a grievance go to him and that he is quite entitled to have the ear of any Minister or meet any Minister or officials of his Department whether or not he is politically opposed to that Minister.  If any other system were to grow up democracy would fail.</P>
    <P>I do not want to digress from the Estimate but the matter arises to some extent in regard to deputations.  The only deputations now received, with few exceptions, are deputations from political friends.  That is a bad trend which I mention in passing.  Perhaps, in the not too distant future we shall have more to say on that subject.</P>
    <P>As regards the provision of telephone kiosks in villages, this matter has been raised on several occasions and headway has been made in providing them.  I think that all villages with populations of over 250 have been catered for but I should like to see the service extended to smaller villages.  We have a number of such villages ranging from 250 in population downwards. People who ask for this service &mdash; and I know it myself also &mdash; tell me that the big advantage in a kiosk is that you have more secrecy, more confidence <Col N="230" /> and privacy than you have in going to a post office where there is no telephone box and where you must speak in the presence of others who may listen to your conversation.  I support expenditure of public funds on the provision of such telephone kiosks in all centres of any reasonable size. Where you have a group of 15, 20 or more houses in a village, or a population from 70 upwards, telephone facilities should be provided.</P>
    <P>Another matter that I was asked to raise here is this.  In some offices which are possibly doing more business than others and where business under different headings has increased, staffs are not adequate.  I am not conversant with how staffing is arranged or how numbers are increased or reduced according to business trends but I should like the Minister to know that there is feeling that in some big offices staffs are inadequate.</P>
    <P>I conclude by repeating that the Post Office and its employees are giving the people a satisfactory service. It is very pleasing for Deputies to hear those in public employment being commended and I think that has been the case for the most part here as regards employees of the Department. It is not pleasant for any Deputy to listen to complaints, particularly if these are well-founded.  It is far preferable for people to have something cheerful and good to say about the public services because no matter what differences exist in this House on political grounds, or in personal views on different aspects of public life, we must remember that we are living in a very small country of 2.8 million people. We have several of what may now be described as medium-sized cities with a greater population than we have. We should first remember that we are Irishmen and that we owe an obligation to our country to co-operate for the general wellbeing.  It is pleasing then to find people in this service giving good value for money because it is incumbent on all of us, from Ministers down, to ensure that we give good value for the money we get also.  If that does not happen and if everyone, no matter what his avocation, does not pull his weight, bad as many <Col N="231" /> of our complaints are at present they could become much worse in the not too distant future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It was to be expected in this debate that the position of the broadcasting authority and RTE should come under discussion.  I want to say a few words in regard to what has so far been said.  Television is a powerful propaganda medium. The Television Authority was established by statute and it was by statute intended to be independent and objective and that is written into the Broadcasting Act.  In the discussions when that Act was going through the Dáil the effect of propaganda through the Broadcasting Authority was fully understood.  For that reason, under the Act, the Broadcasting Authority was given a charter of independence.</P>
      <P>It is worth bearing in mind that before the establishment of the Authority and before the Act there had been a commission appointed by the Minister to advise on the problems connected with broadcasting and the difficulties and so on.  That was a broadly-based commission, advisory in its nature, composed of people of standing, prestige and independence and, in particular, drawn from all political Parties. The commission was no private preserve of Fianna Fáil nominees&mdash;quite the contrary.  It was composed of people of standing and significance and, may I add, inevitably once that description is applied, many of them were supporters of Fine Gael.  When the Broadcasting Authority was established by statute to be independent and objective, what happened in relation to the statutory Authority?  Whatever may have been the position about the advisory commission the statutory Authority very quickly found excluded from it, when persons were appointed on political grounds, anyone who was not a political supporter of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result was that when RTE went into operation it did so under circumstances of suspicion which arose directly from the constitution of the Authority.  After that, we had a series of incidents in which, although the <Col N="232" /> administrative machine under the Authority was endeavouring to operate as the statute had designed, there was direct ministerial interference.  This led to widespread public anxiety.  It is against that background that one has to consider the Minister's observations at the opening of this debate in which he, first of all, criticises the manner in which interviews have been conducted, with particular reference to interviews with politicians and public men.  I am sure the Minister's remarks were made <i>bona fide</i> but, with the particular background in mind, such a ministerial opinion must cause one to raise at least one eyebrow.  Why is it now suggested that interviews with public men have been unfair or biased and not objective? I know this is not the same thing and I do not offer it as a parallel experience to that of a Minister, but I must say from my own experience that I have never found myself subjected to anything I considered unfair.  I frequently found myself subjected to searching inquiry; I welcomed such inquiry because that was why I was there.  I wonder what is signified by the Minister's suggestion that these interviews have not been fair and objective. I hope we are not going to produce dummy shows on television, a kind of Punch and Judy show with people acting a part, having previewed loaded questions before the start of the interview so that nothing will emerge except a dreary sameness.  If that is the kind of interview which will be regarded as proper and in accord with ministerial dignity, then it is about time we closed up shop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very dull, indeed.  While one may at times feel a bit hurt, a bit chivvied and annoyed, because one's ministerial dignity may have been ruffled a bit, it it infinitely better to put up with that as they do in Britain.  Remember &ldquo;That Was the Week That Was&rdquo;! Interviews on that show were tough and penetrating, searching and seeking for an answer, and God help the public man who tried to wriggle and avoid giving a straight answer because he <Col N="233" /> finished up filleted, and rightly so.  I do not think we have anything to fear in encouraging an objective interview.  I am certain that the canons of good sense and good manners have not been offended against, certainly not in anything I have seen or anything I have experienced.  I cannot help being suspicious of the Minister's strictures in view of the background and the history of the operation of the Television Authority since television was set up. Not that I have any complaint: I am sure those who work in Montrose are of all shades of political opinion, but their politics never appear.  I believe they have given a genuine, objective public service in discharging their duties.</P>
      <P>The Minister seemed to go on to thinking out loud and he had a few strictures in relation to the kind of news offered on RTE.  I wonder a little about this.  What is news?  I suppose the Minister and I could exchange a great many views and opinions as to what news is or should be.  Some two or three weeks ago RTE regarded the general election in the North as news. Why should they not?  It was significant in the current state of the country and its future.  The general election was fully covered in each news bulletin and in the feature operated under the new section in RTE.  It was news.  I have no doubt but that a British general election would receive the same treatment. Why should it not?</P>
      <P>I remember in December of 1965 the presidential election in France being fully reviewed and discussed by RTE. Why would it not be?  It was news.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am glad the Minister has no objection to it.  I do not see how he could have, but Deputy Lalor, his Parliamentary Secretary, is prompting him now about that to which I shall refer in a moment because Deputy Lalor, no doubt, has an uneasy conscience.  Of course, I am going to speak about our Presidential election because it was not news in this country.  Why was it not news?  Because the Telefís Éireann Authority gave an <Col N="234" /> order to the Director General of Radio Telefís Éireann that he was not to carry on any news from RTE any part of the Presidential campaign.  Why? Because there was, of course, only one candidate campaigning.  At the same time, the Director General received a direction that he was to carry any public news and very properly so, in relation to the other candidate, because he was the President of Ireland.  In the course of that campaign the President appeared often and in many different places but, from the beginning of April, 1966, to 2nd June, 1966, there was not one reference &mdash;good, bad or indifferent&mdash;on any of the news bulletins of RTE to the Presidential election campaign.  What then is news?  When I find the Minister being critical about what they are doing now I say to him to let those in authority examine their consciences.</P>
      <P>A very bad precedent was set up.  I never referred to it before.  I let it be. I let it rest.  There is no way in which it can be rectified.  I hope that never again will we have any interference with the communications that should exist in this country between events and the people.  We should not have that kind of censorship, because censorship it was.  For the record it is worth saying that the news room in Montrose, every day without fail, received a manuscript from me and, every day without fail, my information indicates, it was offered for use in the news room and, every day without fail, the direction from the Authority prevented it from being commented upon.  I do not think it will ever occur again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps, like the making of an omelette you cannot make one without breaking eggs, which is all right for the omelette but not very good for the eggs, and maybe in this regard I was one of the eggs that had to be broken in order to have an experience and, having got over it, to learn from it.  I hope that never again will we have such an abuse of our Broadcasting Authority and that, whatever the motives may have been, there will be a resolve in the future to respect the independence of the Television Authority, and to respect the good sense of those who are in <Col N="235" /> charge of the dissemination of news.  I am sure they appreciate the kind of things in which the public take an interest, the happenings among our own people and inside our own land, certainly, and the significant happenings outside it.  I would be very slow to suggest any method of censorship.</P>
    <P>I agree that at times things may be shown in too much detail, and events shown which I doubt that the people have a general interest in.  These things happen not only in a broadcasting service such as RTE but in our news-papers, and no one would suggest that there should be censorship of newspapers or newsprint.  Generally when mistakes are made there is a reaction, and a code, a standard, gradually becomes available and, indeed, becomes automatic.  It is better to leave things to develop naturally and inevitably. When we are left alone and try to be fair to one another, our standards are generally good, reasonable and fair.  If we trust the Authority which we set up by statute to do their job, without pulling at them, or hinting at them, or threatening them from time to time, it is much better in the long run, and we will have a much better service.</P>

      <P>The last speaker referred to the coverage given by RTE of the election in Northern Ireland.  I would go even further and congratulate RTE on the coverage given on that occasion, and on the very detailed information put across to the public in the 26 Counties and, also, on the coverage given to the events which led up to the general election in the North. It was very well done in the first place. The coverage given to the events of 5th October in Derry city, and to the events on the route marches, especially the events at Burntollet Bridge, was necessary.  Not only was it a news item of value, but it was necessary to bring the younger generation in the South of Ireland up to date on modern history in the north of our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relaying of the general election which was fought there, and the issues which were involved, to the viewing public in the 26 Counties was of value for many different reasons.  I think <Col N="236" /> there is not a good understanding among some of the younger generation of the position in Northern Ireland. For that reason, I certainly congratulate the RTE Authority on the work they did on that occasion, on the quality of the work, and the great benefit that came therefrom.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the Minister that telephone kiosks should be provided at our frontier posts.  Large numbers of people who travel cross-Border go through these posts, and especially the major ones, on business or on pleasure or as tourists.  When they come to the frontier they must of necessity stop there, and there should be available to them some means to communicate with people at their destination to make arrangements and so on.</P>
    <P>Sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses should all be covered by social welfare insurance, and that is not the case.  It is true to say that some of them are covered by social welfare insurance&mdash;they are permitted to affix social welfare contributions&mdash;while others are not.  The type of persons who is not, is the person who has a post office and side by side with it he runs a small business, a small shop for the sale of cigarettes, some groceries, and so on.  Usually it is a very small business but, unfortunately, at the moment the running of this business precludes him from affixing stamps which in the long run is a great loss to the sub-post-master or mistress.</P>
    <P>Another occasion when these people are precluded from the benefits of the Social Welfare Acts is, in the case of a sub-postmistress, if her husband is employed. She is not allowed to affix social welfare stamps.  The Minister would be well advised to make it a general rule that all sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses would come under the social welfare code and have social insurance stamps affixed.</P>
    <P>There is the very vexed question of auxiliary postmen.  This type of employment, which is not permanent and which in many cases is badly paid, is unsatisfactory.  Some temporary postmen have incomes as low as £4 or £5 a week.  It has been argued that they can do other work before they begin their runs, during the day or when they <Col N="237" /> have finished their runs.  It does not apply in many cases.  Above all, we have the unsatisfactory position that an auxiliary postman who has given all his life to the service of the Post Office&mdash;these men may commence work in that position as young men and go on until 70&mdash;must retire without pension in respect of long years of service to the Department.  Whichever means the Minister can adopt to remedy this sad position will have my wholehearted support.  It is not satisfactory and it should not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>In the main, I join with other speakers in telling the Minister that, generally, we are very pleased with the running of the Post Office service and with the Post Office employees.  It is a good service which gives value for money, one in which there has been vast progress during the past ten years. Admittedly, very large sums of money have been invested in the service but the return is commensurate with the investment.</P>

      <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary intervened in the debate last night he referred to the Lissadell Avenue appointment of a sub-post-master. I do not know much about the details of this appointment or of the political outlook of the people involved, but, again, today, when the Parliamentary Secretary referred to the appointment he said that at the time the applications were received one of the applicants was not a widow.  He clearly conveyed to me, however, that at the time of the appointment she was a widow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody knows, even the Parliamentary Secretary will admit it, that all appointments of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses are nearly always completely and entirely political appointments.  I should like to tell of an incident which happened in <Col N="238" /> my adopted constituency during the recent referendum.  The Minister for Education addressed a number of meetings there.  There were two post offices vacant for which sub-postmasters had to be appointed.  The Government Party were cute enough not to fill them prior to the referendum, the net result being that we found all the applicants for these post offices out trying to do a bit more than each other to secure the appointment.  That is what this type of thing is lending itself to.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said today that another Government had set up a committee to deal with this.  I take it he meant the inter-Party Government. He said the normal procedure was for that committee to submit three names. As I said to him last night and today, sincerely, it is time that this committee recommended only one person and then let the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister, whoever is in charge of the appointment, accept the one name and appoint that one person.  That would be the proper procedure if the Government are anxious to say these are not political appointments.  I and any sensible person in the House or outside who knows anything about these appointments realise that the appointing of auxiliary and part-time postmen, sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses is completely and entirely political.</P>
      <P>At the moment, in my adopted constituency, there is a vacant post office in a place called Kilglass outside Rooskey.  I would gamble a halfpenny to a hayseed that this appointment will not be made until after the next general election because there are a number of applicants and the Government Party will keep them on a string so that they can secure whatever support is going prior to the general election.</P>

      <P>Good for Fine Gael. You will have every one of these people looking for the position of sub-postmaster. Each year since I came into the House I have been critical of the telephone service in the West.  I agree it has improved tremendously during the past couple of years and has improved even in the past 12 months.  There seems to be something wrong in some particular areas.  Take people living in Carrick-on-Shannon.  If they want to ring any place in County Cavan or even Carrigallen in County Leitrim they seem to have to go through a circuit at Mullingar.  They seemingly get through from Carrick-on-Shannon to Mullingar, as far as I know, but then they go back up to Dublin and down to Cavan. The normal delay is a half an hour and, even when you do get through, I am damned if you can hear a word that is said on the phone.  I think I wrote to the Minister's Department on three different occasions during the past 12 months about this service.  Nothing has happened to rectify it.  I appeal sincerely to him to try and get this situation rectified because it is desperate at the moment.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of kiosks, last week or the week before I had two questions in, one about the erection of a telephone kiosk at Croghan, a village in County Roscommon. Up to this there was a Garda barracks there but now it is closed. This village is situated roughly five miles from Carrick-on-Shannon and four miles from Elphin.  Admittedly there are one or two private phones in the village.  I suppose the population would be in the region of 50 or 70 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, when he replied to my question, told me there was no need for a kiosk in this village.  I certainly cannot agree with him.  If a person wants to ring for a doctor at night, or even in the day time, he has to go in and ask a person with a <Col N="240" /> private phone if that person will give him permission to use it.  If the people who have the private phone do not know what to charge and if they are foolish enough to ring the exchange it will cost that person one shilling extra. This thing has gone completely daft as far as rural Ireland is concerned.</P>
    <P>I had another question about a place called Ohill Crossroads in County Leitrim which again is situated about three miles from Ohill and four miles from Keshcarrigan, a very rural spot in County Leitrim.  Those people have no phone service in that area at all.  I think I would not be unreasonable if I asked that people who live in remote parts of rural Ireland should have a telephone service brought at least within one mile of them.  If there is not any service there the obligation is on the Department to provide kiosks in the rural parts of the country.  We have only to go across the border into Northern Ireland to find plenty of kiosks available there.</P>
    <P>There is a policy operating at the moment to close Garda barracks. Gardaí have always been helpful to the public with regard to the telephone. You have the Croghan Garda Barracks closed.  Other professional people, such as dispensary doctors, always had phones but we actually have no dispensary doctors at all in rural parts of the West of Ireland.  Those people normally had a telephone.  Now the ordinary citizens are deprived of the service of those phones.  On top of that the Minister's own Department, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, is closing small rural post offices.  One would find it hard to disagree with that because, as the Minister said, they are uneconomic and, as the Parliamentary Secretary said here today, the only people who are inconvenienced are the old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>There is always the person who normally uses the telephone and he is very much inconvenienced.  If a farmer has to ring some insemination centre in the morning, he now has to get transport to take him maybe another two or three miles instead of having the telephone beside him.  The greatest grumble seems to be from the people looking for the service of the artificial insemination centres.  I fully agree with <Col N="241" /> the Parliamentary Secretary that the old age pensioner is inconvenienced as well by the closing of those small subpost offices.  He said today he is looking into the matter and there may be some way of overcoming that situation.</P>
    <P>We find in the last year that rental charges of telephones have gone up by 10/-.  We also find that a personal call has gone from one shilling to two shillings.  People who are getting a good telephone service do not grumble so much about it but people who are getting the type of service I have referred to, those people living in North Roscommon and South Leitrim, have a lot to grumble about.  As I said, it seems to be easy enough to get through quickly to Dublin, but if you have to get through to any other place, say Galway from North Roscommon or South Leitrim, or if you have to get to Cavan, the line seems to be hopeless and the delay seems to be in the region of half an hour.  I certainly think those people have a genuine grievance.</P>
    <P>Quite recently I had the experience of making a phone call from a coin box and for some unknown reason the line broke down.  I was told by the operator I would have to insert, I think, another two shillings.  Unfortunately, I had not the two shillings in my pocket.  She said I had no alternative, and if I inserted two shillings I could write in to the Department and get it refunded.  I am telling the story the way the operator told it to me.  I do not know whether she was within her rights or not.  She told me there had been a change recently.  It can be most inconvenient to people who are on the phone to find that the line breaks down through no fault of their own, but through the fault of the Department, and yet they have to find the same coins again in order to get through.  I think it is most unfair to ask those people to write in to the Department and seek a refund of the money.</P>
    <P>Again, like most other speakers, I feel auxiliary postmen have got a raw deal right down the years.  Some of them, as has been said today, have been working for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for 50 years. Some of them are retiring each year <Col N="242" /> and each month, and it is desperate to think that those people do not qualify for a pension.  The auxiliary postman, the unestablished postman, the temporary postman, or whatever the category he comes under has given a terrific service to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and to the people of this country.  He had to travel a big, rough rural area in desperate weather conditions, sometimes in snow.  On occasion he may have been provided with a bicycle but on numerous occasions he could not use it due to the weather conditions.  Those people should qualify for a pension. The Parliamentary Secretary today, when he intervened in this debate, said the matter was with the Department's General Council and he felt it was not proper for him to make any comment on it at the moment.  The number of those people has become very small and I do not think it would cost the Exchequer such a tremendous amount to qualify them for a pension.  I think that the Parliamentary Secretary's intervention will only delay this further and that, ultimately, no decision will be made.  Certainly, it is not treating these people very fairly.</P>
    <P>I remember, and as another speaker said here today, the inter-Party Government in 1956 gave pensions for the first time to county council and forestry workers.  It was a pity they did not go further and give pensions to these auxiliary postmen but, seeing that they did not do so, the obligation is on whatever Government or Party is in power to provide these people with pensions.</P>
    <P>I must congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the information that a new type of uniform is being prepared for postmen.  We all know that the old type of uniform becomes shabby in a very short time; therefore, we are glad to hear that a new type of uniform is being prepared.  I hope that this new uniform will be delivered to the postmen in the very near future.  I think I understood the Parliamentary Secretary to say that shirts are to be supplied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that it had been suggested that shirts would be supplied <Col N="243" /> with the open tunic and that the matter is being looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that this matter, too, is being looked into.  Before concluding, I should like to make a brief reference to Telefís Éireann.  I certainly would not like to think, and it would be very hard to convince me, that the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would make any effort to interfere with Telefís Éireann for political reasons.  I doubt if any official of Telefís Éireann would allow the Minister to interfere if that official felt that the interference was for political reasons.  However, be that as it may, when one remembers the coverage that was given to the Presidential Election in France, to the American Presidential Election, to the General Election in England and to the recent General Election in Northern Ireland, one is bound to ask oneself why the same amount of coverage was not given to the Presidential Election in this country a few years ago when Telefís Éireann failed completely to give any coverage whatsoever to this election.  To my mind, the reason for that was that in the Irish Presidential Election there was a one-candidate campaign.  About that time also we were celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the Easter Rising of 1916 and this particular candidate was finding himself in many places on many days and, seemingly, the Telefís Éireann cameras found themselves in the same places at the same time.  However, I believe that it was most unfair coverage as far as the candidate which this Party nominated was concerned.</P>
      <P>It is only fair that I should say in this House that on the numerous occasions I have been to Montrose the utmost courtesy and help, technically and otherwise, was given to me.  The officials were prepared to help me in any way they could and I should like to put on the record of the House that I was very pleased with the way in which I was treated there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made during this debate to the manner in which people, particularly politicians, are interviewed on television programmes.  Politicians in 1969 will have to make up their <Col N="244" /> minds, if they have not already done so, that they must take the rough with the smooth.  If there are people in politics who are not prepared to do this, it is an unfortunate situation.</P>
    <P>It has often occurred to me that if some of the proceedings of this House were televised, so that the public at large might see the amount of work done by Deputies not only in the House but at committee meetings, in meeting constituents and so on, they would have a much clearer idea of the problems facing us.  At any rate, it would do no harm and for that reason the Minister might give a thought to this.  The televising of some of the proceedings might also help towards a better attendance in the House.  In any case it is worth a trial.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, more time should be devoted to agriculture on television. I admit that a certain amount of time is devoted to it but a few more programmes on long winter nights, showing the farming community how to improve farm methods, would be of great help.  I would recommend that Telefís Éireann give a little more time to our main industry&mdash;agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to the voices of the other Deputies who, during this debate, have mentioned the desirability of a pension scheme for auxiliary postmen.  Most people nowadays if they are in any sort of a worthwhile job qualify for a pension and, therefore, I think consideration of this question regarding auxiliary postmen is long overdue. Many of these men work as many hours as the established postmen and yet, at the end of their service, they have no pension to get.  It is time that the Minister gave consideration to this problem so that something might be done to help these people, many of whom continue to work up to the age of 70.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am on the subject of auxiliary postmen I wish to say that I find in recent times, particularly in my own constituency, that some of those men become redundant because postal vans are being introduced in particular areas.  I raised questions about three postmen in Beaufort last summer.  Two vans were put on where three auxiliary <Col N="245" /> postmen were laid off.  They were men who were middle-aged, 45 to 50 years of age, and they had no hope of getting jobs at that stage of their lives.  They were smallholders and the money they were getting was helpful in rearing their families and in bringing in the necessary money for that purpose.  The extraordinary thing is that, since the van service has been established, we now find that the post takes half an hour extra.  In some areas it takes up to 1½ or two hours extra.  Those men started early in the morning and finished at 1 p.m.  People who used get their post at 1 p.m. now get it at 3 p.m.  This is a step in the wrong direction.</P>
    <P>If I remember rightly the Minister made a case at the time that there would be a saving with these vans.  I am dubious about any saving that can be established in this way.  I know enough about transport, as I deal extensively with transport in my own business, and I cannot see that two vans can be operated much cheaper than the wages of those three postmen who were getting less than £20 per week between them.  Even if there was a considerable saving, I still think it is our duty and it would be better to keep people employed here and not to bring about a position where we are keeping foreigners employed manufacturing these vans and the parts used for them, in addition to having to bring in the necessary petrol and oil to keep the vans going, thus straining further our balance of payments.  I would ask the Minister when further cases like this arise, particularly in rural areas, that he would take a very good look before he makes any changes of this kind.  It is not in the national interest.  The pay those postmen get is very necessary for them at their particular age when they are trying to keep going and rear their families.</P>
    <P>Other speakers mentioned telephone booths.  I am rather concerned with post boxes in particular areas.  It is necessary that they should be established in some outlying areas.  In the case of Dungegan, near Ballinskelligs, people have been anxious for three years to get a post box in the village. The post office in Ballinskelligs is about a mile further on.  There are quite a lot of visitors in the summer time on the <Col N="246" /> eastern side of the bay and they have to go about 1½ miles into Dungegan and a further mile into Ballinskelligs to post their letters.  I would ask the Minister to try to see that a post box is provided in this particular place.</P>
    <P>I pass now to telephone communications. We are getting quite a good service in Kerry but of late one thing is happening continuously.  We find when put through to Dublin no sooner do we get the speaker on the other end than we are cut off again.  This is costing businessmen considerable amounts in extra charges.  By the time they are reconnected they are not getting even a three-minute service out of a six-minute charge.  I do not know the reason for this but I find it happening in my own office consistently.  We have many reports from people in Tralee and Killarney about the same thing happening there.  It is something which should be examined because the charges are pretty stiff without paying for service we are not getting.</P>
    <P>Recently I have been asked by the people of Milltown to try to get the phone service there improved.  It appears that some time last year two of the lines were transferred to another area from Milltown.  It is next to impossible to get a phone call in Milltown now, particularly during the summer period.  We have an insemination station attached to Castlemaine creamery which has over 200 calls a day at the peak period.  When that is operating they practically take over the complete lines.  I would ask the Minister to look into this aspect again in Milltown and see if it can be put right.  There is a general grievance there that the people who want to get on to the insemination station cannot get on.  I am informed it has taken two days at a time to get on to the station there.</P>
    <P>In reference to Telefís Éireann, as a previous speaker has stated, when I was out at the headquarters we found the personnel there exceptionally nice and co-operative.  In justice to them, we could not say too much on their behalf.  However, there is a grave feeling throughout the country that at times things are shown which are not in keeping with our Irish Heritage or with our Irish way of life.  Many of our people resent and object to this <Col N="247" /> type of material being presented.  We saw references made by the Bishop of Galway some months ago to some programmes put on at that particular time.  Time and again there are references to things that do not go down too well and people wish that something should be done about this.  We hold a proud position in Europe, and in the world for that matter, for our clean way of life and our clean outlook on living.  We can certainly do without some of the material that is portrayed on Telefís Éireann at times.  There is not very much of it but attempts are made to inject unsuitable material into shows.</P>
    <P>Some people try to project it and they are quite aware of the feelings of our people.  It is something that cannot be accepted.  The sooner it is stopped the better for everybody concerned.  We should not try to emulate the way of life in Britain or the material projected on the British television service, or some of the material projected on the Continental service.  I would be sorry to see the day when much of that would be seen in this country.  I have a feeling that many of our people throughout the country think that attempts are being made from time to time to put unsuitable material on and that it is the thin end of the wedge. Maybe some of the people concerned with putting on these shows think it may be the material that the Ireland of the future needs.</P>
    <P>It is our duty, while we are here&mdash; those of us who are old enough to be a link with the Ireland of the past and the Ireland of today&mdash;to try to prevent this type of material from creeping into what otherwise is a very good service. By and large, we have a very good service with very good programmes.  I have seen some television programmes in Britain and on the Continent and I can safely say that from the inception of RTE, we have had very interesting programmes.  However, this crude material from Britain or from the Continent, or from wherever it comes, must be kept out of our programmes. Beyond that, I have very little to say. On the whole, the Post Office has come a long way and is doing a very good <Col N="248" /> job of work.  With the adjustment of some minor faults, and when we have the automatic service, there will be a vast improvement in the telephone service. A colossal amount of business is operated through the Post Office and, in present circumstances, it is inevitable that there should be a shortage of connections and lines.</P>
    <P>I shall be glad if the Minister will take note of the points I have made here this evening.  By and large, a very good job of work is being done throughout the whole country by this Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. S.D. Barrett Mr. S.D. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.D. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to mention a local constituency matter which I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister and that is the continued complaints from Cork city and county, and from the south generally, about the lack of some regional television station in the area. One would expect that, after seven years, Telefís Éireann would be thinking of expanding its activities on regional lines such as exist in Britain. I trust it is not entirely local pride that leads me to believe that if Telefís Éireann is beginning to think along those lines then Cork is the natural centre for a regional station.  Cork does feel rather cheated at the moment in that regard.  It feels it is not getting enough coverage.</P>
      <P>I should like to mention to the Minister the continued failure of Telefís Éireann ever to approach the International Choral Festival held in Cork City, which is a most colourful international festival.  Telefís Éireann has never approached it at any time but now it is being forced to do so by the BBC who actually are coming over this year to do a film on it.  The Minister might well look into the regional services which are to be given to the country in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very good and heartening sign to find this debate proceeding for such a long period.  It shows that Deputies are beginning to realise the real importance of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and that this is no longer an Estimate on which we can talk only about temporary postmen and various other such matters.  I <Col N="249" /> am referring, of course, to the growth of both radio and television.  Television has been with us now for some seven or eight years.  We must realise that it is the most powerful medium of mass-communication that any nation can have at its disposal.  Whilst I should resent most vociferously any interference by the Minister with Telefís Éireann for political reasons, it is of the utmost importance to the country generally, and, indeed, to Telefís Éireann, that we should come in here during the debate on the Estimate for the Department and express ourselves plainly about what we have seen and heard on Telefís Éireann. That opportunity arises only once in every 12 months, and I intend to avail of it now.  I imagine that the bright young men of Telefís Éireann would be the last to quarrel with me if I make what might be looked upon as a litany of complaints.  At the outset, I want to make it quite plain that that is not so.</P>
    <P>The young men in Telefís Éireann who are avid for good television will themselves tell you that the ordinary man leading an ordinary life is not good television but that the exceptional person who is leading the exceptional life and doing the exceptional thing or saying the exceptional thing makes good television.  Similarly, there is no point in my standing up in this House and saying that the television people are doing a wonderful job.  They are doing a wonderful job but, when I have said that, I have said everything one can say about them.  I think Telefís Éireann has an intelligent young staff who are ready to work themselves very hard when the occasion arises to do the best job possible. Having said that, one has paid the ultimate tribute to Telefís Éireann. The only reason I mention it again is to make it quite plain that, when I proceed along the lines upon which I intend to proceed, I am not embarking on a campaign of vilification of Telefís Éireann.  I want to mention some cases to which I take exception. Every Deputy who has similar examples should do likewise.</P>
    <P>I was glad that the Minister, when introducing the Estimate, invited not <Col N="250" /> alone Members of this House but the public in general to make their views and their criticisms known to Telefís Éireann.  That is a terribly important right which resides in every citizen of this country who finds he has some objection to make to something seen or heard on television.  If he has a telephone he should immediately make the protest through that medium.  If he has not a telephone, then he should write to, or in some way communicate with, Telefís Éireann, pointing out what he thinks of the programme in question.</P>
    <P>The Irish people must realise that our television service is not the property of this House, is not the property of the Minister, is not the property of the Broadcasting Authority but is the property of the people of Ireland. Therefore, it is the right of the people of Ireland to ensure that it is run along lines with which they agree.  It is very important, on an occasion such as this, that we should express ourselves as plainly as we can.  Freedom of speech is something of which Telefís Éireann is very proud.  Time and time again, some of its teams have stood up very vociferously for freedom of speech.  If it means anything, it must include criticism, where criticism is warranted. We should be sadly lacking in our duty if we did not freely express criticism of some television programmes to which we take exception.  I underline the word &ldquo;some&rdquo; because the usual run of programme on Telefís Éireann is one to which exception cannot be taken.  However, there were occasions when I took exception to a programme and when other people took exception to some programme or other and I think that that should be mentioned.</P>
    <P>On broad lines, I should like briefly to refer first to the advertising section of Telefís Éireann.  It is agreed, and Telefís Éireann know it, that Telefís Éireann have &ldquo;pinched&rdquo; much of the advertisement revenue of many newspapers, particularly of the provincial Press.  It is reckoned that they have taken at least 50 per cent of the advertising revenue of the provincial Press.  I should like to draw the attention of the Minister and the House to an unfair <Col N="251" /> aspect of this matter.  Newspapers have to meet both turnover tax and whole-sale tax &mdash; an impost of about 14 per cent of their expenditure.  It is absolutely unfair that Telefís Éireann should be able to compete with newspapers in this respect without having to pay some similar impost on their advertising revenue.</P>
    <P>Talking about advertisements, I have heard many people objecting to the continual beaming of advertisements for alcoholic liquors obviously at teenagers and particularly at female teenagers.  I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to this matter. I have always felt that Radio Telefís Éireann should take a more prominent part in familiarising the people of the north of Ireland with their brethren in the south.  I have been advocating that since the days when the inter-Party Government were in power.  I thought that the publicity given to the northern elections might possibly have been done with a view to popularising Radio Telefís Éireann in the north because otherwise it was vastly overdone and its importance was exaggerated by the amount of coverage given to it by Telefís Éireann.  Had it resulted in more viewers in the north, in Belfast and other places, viewing Telefís Éireann and learning more about us, in having got the habit during the election of looking at Telefís Éireann, then I would accept that as a reasonable explanation but I am told &mdash; and I would be glad if the Minister would advise us whether or not this is true&mdash; that by some arrangement, either with UTV or BBC, Telfís Éireann is not beamed on and cannot be received in most of the Six Counties.  I was perturbed when I heard that from a pretty reliable source.</P>
    <P>Telefís Éireann have now been operating for the last seven years and the effects of an operation such as television cannot be neutral.  The results of its being beamed into the homes of every man, woman and child for seven years must be significant both in regard to their lives and to their homes.  There cannot be any neutral outcome from this operation.  We must realise that many people who prior to <Col N="252" /> the advent of television took a reasonable interest in their newspapers now rely on Telefís Éireann for news in a package.  They rely on the service for the ten minutes or the quarter of an hour of news and at a later stage rely on some discussion programme to mould their views.  I do not know what the effect of this has been but I was glad to hear the Minister issuing a timely warning to Telefís Éireann about some of the matters which arose from time to time in the course of these programmes.</P>
    <P>We know that there has been a change in the outlook of young people growing up.  We cannot blame Telefís Éireann entirely for that but neither I imagine can we absolve them.  Anything that is constantly seen and heard by young people is bound to affect their minds.  Films, books, plays and so on, have all had an effect on the minds of young people and I feel that Telefís Éireann has done the same.  We cannot escape from the fact that this is so.  It is inevitable when the windows of the soul have television beamed on them. It is bound to affect them.  For that reason I would expect that the people running Telefís Éireann would have a keen sense of the destiny to which they are called.  There is no doubt that they can affect in a mighty way the entire outlook of the people.  I am glad, too, that the Minister advised Deputies and people generally to watch those who are in charge of the destinies of Telefís Éireann and make sure that it is operated without detriment to the people generally.</P>
    <P>I often wonder when the Minister will take a second look at the Broadcasting Authority Act.  It was introduced eight years ago when television had not even started.  At that time this House had little knowledge how television would affect the people, how it could be run, and very little knowledge about what defects the measure might contain.  Having had experience for the last seven years of the manner in which the Act operated, the Minister might look at it and see if it does not require modification or extension in various ways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. D. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not necessarily suggesting amending legislation; I am saying that the Minister should see if it is necessary to amend legislation. The manner in which the Broadcasting Authority is selected is certainly open to abuse.  I do not think that the manner in which it has been selected has given us the best Broadcasting Authority we could have.  There are distinguished people in many walks of life who would gladly serve on the Broadcasting Authority and who would serve it and the country well.  They would give more prestige to the Authority itself in the eyes of the people if they were drafted on to it.</P>
      <P>The news bulletins on Radio Telefís Éireann are largely excellent but sometimes I wonder if they are not somewhat expensive by having recourse to a round-up of European news in which we hear broadcasters from other countries simply giving us the news we have already got from news agencies such as Reuters, Associated Press and others.  I do not think they add anything to the programme but I would exclude Patrick Cosgrave in London who does an excellent job of work at that end.  I should like to say that the reaction to the Minister's speech introducing this Estimate met generally with concurrence.  It shows that the Minister has the sense of responsibility which one would expect from a Minister in this high and important office.  I do think that the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs is one of the highest and one of the most important in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Controversy we must have whereever free men congregate.  It would be a sad day for us if controversy were in any way to be stifled but I feel that on occasions there is a spurious stirring up of controversy on television programmes purely for the purpose of controversy, because it makes good television. This is something which Telefís Éireann staffs generally should consider, whether deliberately contrived controversy is a good or a bad thing. The opposite of controversy is that certainty and that tranquillity which we in Ireland have always felt about certain <Col N="254" /> matters, religious and otherwise. We have had a certainty in our faith, whatever faith we have had.  We have had a tranquillity from our way of life.  It is not good that any organisation, particularly an organisation such as Telefís Éireann, should deliberately set out to create an atmosphere of uncertainty.  It must be said that some of the programmes on Telefís Éireann have helped to contribute to the feeling of uncertainty which is notable in the country at the moment.</P>
    <P>I should hate if we were to lose that feeling of security which we have had over the years.  I know that some of the professionals would say that my view is a kind of smug, insular sort of view which belongs to what they call the establishment which is a word used to denote anybody who disagrees with those who call themselves progressives. It is an important thing that we should continually advert to our traditions, to our way of life and that we should try, in so far as we can, to maintain that without having artificially stimulated controversies which give rise to uncertainty.</P>
    <P>There are a few specific instances to which I would like to refer to which I myself objected and many of those to whom I spoke objected.  My real objection to them was that the views expressed and to which I objected were given without anybody being present on the panel to controvert these views or in any way to question them or to explain errors in these views or to explain the generality of the views expressed and to explain their mistakes. One such occasion occurs to me.  There was an English professor on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; on 3rd November last.  He remarked, as I think we could all remark, that television had accelerated a change in habits and morals in England.  I suppose in a way it is a warning to those of us here who have some responsibility for the running of television by virtue of our membership of this House, that this professor, who seemed a sensible sort of man, would come over here and would say that not by way of warning.  He simply said that television had accelerated a change in the habits and morals of the people <Col N="255" /> in England, particularly the young people.  One of the results of this acceleration, he said, was that quite a number of his unmarried lady students were coming to him in increasing numbers and excusing themselves from lectures for a fortnight as they were having a pregnancy.  He was not at all offensive in what he said or the way he said it.  He was blasé and unmoved and he expressed no views for or against it but he did put forward this state of affairs as one which should be taken as being all in the day's or the night's work as the case may be.  When people like that go on television to express such views I feel that those in charge of the panel should make sure there is somebody else in the panel to say that that is not the way of life in Ireland and to express a view as to why that is so, to express a view pointing out to the younger element who might be listening to the programme good and sufficient reasons why such situations should not be taken with equanimity.</P>
    <P>Apart from that sort of unbalanced programme where you have nobody to answer a question you can also have the slanted programme.  There was an occasion within the past 12 months when a programme was produced which comes within the category to which I refer.  It was one by John O'Donoghue and Brian Cleeve.  It was on 18th September.  I think it was part of the &ldquo;Into Europe&rdquo; series.  They progressed to Italy where they purported to examine the religious life of the people of Italy. I never saw anything quite so dreary or so fairylandish.  The first part of the religious discussion related exclusively to superstition about St. Michael appearing to a bull in some part of Italy and the second part of their religious investigation of the way of Catholic life in Italy was a most dreary series of pictures of the late Padré Pio, the stigmatist.  They did not show any of the more elevating facets of his life.  They showed him in most dreary circumstances surrounded by the most dreary old men and old women, obviously in a furious temper and hitting the old men and old <Col N="256" /> women with the belt around his middle.  Certainly there did not appear from this programme to be one good thing to be said for Catholicism in Italy.</P>
    <P>Then they went to Germany where they spent some time interviewing Dr. Hans Kung, who bitterly criticised the existing establishment of the Catholic Church.  Then they proceeded to Sweden where they showed life at its brightest and best in so far as young people are concerned, the most lively, enjoyable life.  They showed the sale of contraceptives and various other things and indicated, by the films that they took, that life in Sweden was a far better and brighter thing than life either in Italy or the Catholic portion of Germany which they visited.  They finished up by announcing that in Sweden God was dead but they never mentioned anything about the insanity or the suicides or the other matters that have arisen as a result of the denial of the existence of God by most Swedes.  I thought it was a miserably slight and inadequate investigation of the countries involved.  I think it must have made a damaging impression on the impressionable minds of young people who watched the programme.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he could find out something that I have been asking myself since last Sunday night week when nearly half an hour's programme was devoted entirely to an interview with Tariq Ali, the well known international disturber and radical socialist.  There was nobody on the programme except Tariq Ali.  He was examined by an interviewer who was in no way oppressive, in no way questioned any of his views.</P>
    <P>We were given half an hour of a programme during which Tariq Ali spent quite a lot of his time abusing what he called our bourgeois establishment and during which he expressed the view that had Jesus Christ been permitted to live he would have turned into the Che Guevara of his time, that he would have been a guerilla fighter. Certainly, half an hour's free advertisement to a person such as Tariq Ali should not be allowed unless somebody <Col N="257" /> else is on the programme to explain, to question and to controvert what he expressed.  The Minister might certainly look into this.  The sad thing about this particular programme is that it came after sports news on a Sunday night when so many young people are staying up to watch their favourite sports programme.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons I mention it here is that the views expressed by Tariq Ali are very similar to some of the views expressed by a member of the staff of RTE.  I refer the Minister to the report of a meeting of the Christian Left association known as Grille here in Dublin which was reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> on 22nd October, 1968. Mr. Seán MacReamoinn who is a member of the staff of Radio Telefís Éireann, I understand, and who had dealt with religious programmes, spoke at that meeting.  He said, according to this report:</P>
    <P>...that in this country when we were faced with the fact that we were Christians, we had wondered where our political allegiance lay.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There must be a moment in the life of every Christian who is not completely overwhelmed by the layers of Establishment cake when he asks, `Am I, as a Christian, concerned with politics?' If he believes that Christ came to change the world, then he must believe that Christ is revolution.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In Ireland a Christian must ask, `Am I a revolutionary or am I happy to go back to my tiny Christian kennel and think that it does not matter what happens?' To be a Christian you must realise that your social obligations are not to be satisfied by private good works &mdash; you must become involved in society,&rdquo; he said.</P>
    <P>There is another part of that report of the meeting of Grille to which I should like particularly to refer the Minister because it says:</P>
    <P>Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, television and theatrical producer, claimed yesterday that there were people in RTE who were being persecuted by the Special Branch.  &ldquo;I could name names,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the people <Col N="258" /> should be here, but they are so fed up with the whole thing that they would not bother their backsides to be present.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The report continues:</P>
    <P>Mr. Fitzgerald said that in Ireland the Leftist Catholics had been responsible for progress in television. He said that some of the best social material had come from the religious programmes.</P>
    <P>As an example of political influence in television, which Mr. Fitzgerald said was &ldquo;colossal&rdquo;, he mentioned the practical destruction of the programme, &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo;, and the refusal to send teams to Vietnam and Biafra.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The newsroom people are all old-fashioned Catholics who can be frightened.  Political influence is most easily executed through religion and it is the old type of religious ones who are used to an authoritarian State who are most easily influenced. You have `yes men' in charge of RTE and you get very little honesty in television.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Fitzgerald said that most educational institutions were being run by religious in this country and he described the system as &ldquo;monstrous&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not know if these are the sort of people whom the average Irish man or woman would like to see consciously or otherwise influencing the programmes on Telefís Éireann and I should like to know from the Minister &mdash; I tried to get this information from the Minister for Justice on his Estimate &mdash; if it is a fact, as stated by Mr. Fitzgerald, that Special Branch men are following members of the Radio Telefís Éireann staff because I take this view of the Special Branch that if they do follow people they do not follow them for the fun of it; they are paid by the State not to follow people whom there is no reason to follow and if we have an unstated number of people on the staff of Radio Telefís Éireann who are of such calibre or belong to such category that it is thought fit that the Special Branch should investigate their activities the Minister should tell the House exactly the type of activities that are suspected <Col N="259" /> and the type of activities that are involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister did indicate in his speech introducing the Estimate that he intended to bring some pressure to bear on Telefís Éireann in regard to the manner in which they were carrying out some of their duties.  I should like to know how he is going to do this.  The Minister cannot influence the Television Authority.  Under the Broadcasting Authority Act he has no authority in any way to interfere with Telefís Éireann except to direct them on occasions to give time for speeches by Ministers of State and the Minister should make clear to the House exactly how he purports to have any influence over Telefís Éireann whatsoever.  There is nothing in the Broadcasting Authority Act to enable the Minister to do so except, of course, section 21 which empowers the Minister to set up an advisory committee.  I should like the Minister to state to the House whether he intends to do that or not.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the dissatisfaction with the Broadcasting Authority itself generally voiced in this House the Minister should certainly take some such steps.  It is necessary that some very special steps should be taken to keep an eye on the manner in which Telefís Éireann generally is conducted. In Britain, there is the convention that broadcasting is periodically subject to inquiry by a Royal Commission and errors can then be corrected.  We have no such system here except the annual review to which we can subject the Minister on an occasion like this.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that on some occasions a number of those who interview people on Telefís Éireann have been objectionably oppressive.  I agree with those on my side of the House and in other parts of the House who say that politicians who go on Telefís Éireann to be interviewed should be ready to take the rough with the smooth.  I agree completely with that.  There is no reason whatsoever why any politician who goes to Telefís Éireann should consider that he is to be pampered or in any way treated softly because of his position but there have been occasions which most of us here could recall upon which Ministers <Col N="260" /> of State and Leaders of Parties and members of Parties have been questioned in a manner which was objectionable and I myself remember one occasion at least when I considered that one of the interviewers was being deliberately rude to a Minister of State.  I do not think that that should occur.  I am mentioning it as an exceptional case in the hope that there will be fewer and fewer exceptional cases of this nature.</P>
    <P>There is one other thing that I should like to mention and which I mentioned on the Vote for the Department of Education.  I have been very struck with the success of the &ldquo;Telefís Scoile&rdquo; programme.  It occupies only about 5 ½ hours in the week.  I suggested to the Minister for Education&mdash; and I want now to suggest to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that he should take the matter up with that Minister &mdash; that television could be greatly extended to include early university lectures.</P>
    <P>I understand that in Japan this operates very well.  It would be an excellent thing if, by the use of television, we could avoid extending, at immense cost to the country, our university premises on the gigantic scale which is foreseen.  If television develops along the lines which I foresee in this regard the vast expansion envisaged for university premises will not be necessary. Above all, it would be useful in that it would enable young men and women who are really just once removed secondary school children to remain at home during the early years of their university education and not have to be exposed to many of the disrupting and upsetting forces to which they are exposed when they come lonely and alone to cities like Dublin and Cork. It would also have the effect that the young men and young women who did the early years of their university course on television would succeed and continue their studies only if they were the very best types of students.  There would not then be the expensive dropouts which we have at the present time in our universities, because the young men and women who started their early university education through Telefís Éireann would come to their university centre on the strength of <Col N="261" /> their examination results and there would be a fair amount of culling of the useless material on the way up.</P>
    <P>I doubt if the best use is being made of modern communications in coast life saving.  The recent loss of the <i>Sea Flower</i> in Kenmare Bay gave rise to much criticism of the Minister's Department.  It was said in more places than one that, had there been radio telephones available or had the existing communication centres been properly used the lives of those who perished on that ship could have been saved.  I would be glad if the Minister, in his capacity as Minister for Transport and Power, would reopen the inquiry into the loss of the ship to see whether or not it is a fact that, due to a breakdown in communications between various agencies who were working to save the lives of the crew of the ship on that occasion, the best service was not given and as a result valuable lives were lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister did not get in, but I have been trying to get in since 4 o'clock yesterday and I do not know why I was passed over on so many occasions.</P>
      <P>One would think from the statements made by speakers here that every Member of the House was entitled to criticise or to suggest alterations in the set-up in RTE with the exception of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. The publicity given to the Minister's statement in relation to interviewing and interviewing techniques on RTE and the comments made by many Deputies are a complete distortion of the actual situation.  We, the Members of the House, have a duty to ensure that our television service is an efficient and effective one and, by our suggestions, we should endeavour to make it more efficient, if that is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A certain amount of foreign material comes on our television screens and some of the techniques applied by foreigners rub off on our own people, sometimes to our advantage, sometimes to our disadvantage. We are a distinct people and the methods used should be suitable to our society.  While I personally never had any complaints against the people <Col N="262" /> who interviewed me, I suppose we can all apply to ourselves the saying: &ldquo;If you cannot stand the heat get out of the kitchen&rdquo;, but I am sure most of our politicians are able to deal with the situation if the heat is turned on.  The type of interview conducted by Bunny Carr, Joe Fahy or Ted Nealon puts people at their ease. These interviewers put me at ease even listening to them.  Interviewers who put those being interviewed at their ease will extract more information than the quick-fire type of interviewer we have seen from time to time.  I do not condemn one type or the other, but all of us, including the Minister, are entitled to put forward our own views.  It has been stated that there were occasions when people were treated rudely.  That is quite so and must be evident to any person who listens to any of the RTE programmes.</P>
    <P>The radio programme &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; is excellent.  There should be a repeat broadcast early in the morning.  Many people who are unable to listen to this programme at night because of viewing television would welcome the opportunity of hearing this programme the following morning. This is a well-produced programme and great credit is due to Joe Fahy for the manner of its presentation.</P>
    <P>There are programmes like &ldquo;Outlook&rdquo; in which I have a very keen interest.  The &ldquo;Outlook&rdquo; programme is very effective.  On occasions it has not been handled in an altogether satisfactory way but that is only my own point of view.  Last night it dealt with the drug problem.  It did convey a message to me and, I am sure, to the many parents who saw it.  The &ldquo;Late, Late Show&rdquo;, in its present form, has outlived its usefulness and needs some alteration.  Frank Hall's programme, &ldquo;News Beat&rdquo;, is very entertaining, if one overlooks its emphasis on toilets. Generally speaking, it is a good programme which could be further developed.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Killyraggart&rdquo; type of programme is one that has done a grave injustice to Irish actors and possibly to the staff of Telefís Éireann.  We should be more selective in regard to programmes.  Mistakes <Col N="263" /> will be made and we can learn by our mistakes, but this kind of material does not go down well with the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Sensationalism seems to be one of the keynotes which seems to impress the personnel at Montrose.  Groups of people who are trying to pull down our democratic way of life seem to be able to avail of the television cameras on any occasion, and public representatives in the city are aware that certain groups of individuals endeavour to force their point of view on public representatives, the threat always being: &ldquo;We have the television cameras on our side,&rdquo; and generally they are right.</P>
    <P>I wonder have these people any influence at Montrose.  This has happened to me on many occasions.  We are aware of the situation at Sheriff Place and in other parts of the city where television cameras were in attendance some months ago when people endeavoured to impede the demolition of derelict property.  The Minister should send out the cameras to Sheriff Place today to show the public the transformation there and the accommodation now available there despite efforts to impede the work by those groups who would pull down our democratic institutions, our way of life.  I agree that there is not any reason why they should not get television coverage because there are two points of view, two sides to every story, but they get excessive coverage.  Many of the groups operating here have no interest in the welfare of the country but they seem to have the services of the television cameras at all times.  Again, I ask if they have any special influence at Montrose.</P>
    <P>There are one or two suggestions I should like to put to the Minister, particularly in relation to this city. I should like to deal especially with the development of centres, special accommodation, for aged people.  They present a distinct problem.  They are accommodated in large groups, 70 to 80, in these centres, and I suggest that in conjunction with the local authority, the Post Office could provide an effective network of early warning by the installation of some simple type of apparatus which would connect <Col N="264" /> these aged people with the social workers and the police so that these people, living on their own, would be able to contact the authorities in cases of blackguardism or vandalism, in this vulnerable section.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that in accommodating these people in these centres we are keeping them out of public institutions and are in that way saving a lot of cost.  I suggest that this cost could be diverted to the provision of a type of communications network like I have mentioned which would keep them in easy touch with social workers and with the police in cases of necessity &mdash; in cases of vandalism or break-ins or in cases of sickness.  I ask the Minister to examine that.  I know there may be complications but I do not think there are.</P>
    <P>I wish to say a few words about telephone kiosks at this stage.  I consider the present type of kiosk to be like a pigeon loft which defaces many areas.  Many of the areas in the city now being developed are the result of large scale planning, yet we still see this monstrosity all over the place.  In each such highly developed area the kiosks should be specially designed to fit into the architecture.  I am sure the Post Office have the necessary planners to design kiosks to suit individual areas.  Most of the present kiosks stick out like sore thumbs in these areas. This monotony of design should be got rid of and I ask the Minister to consider it.</P>
    <P>On the same subject, I wish to deplore the vandalism that takes place in regard to these kiosks.  The kiosks are necessary sometimes for the protection of life and property but when one of the structures is damaged by vandals it should be re-erected as soon as possible in a suitable location nearby, where it will be safer from vandalism.  I know an area in which a kiosk was removed 12 to 18 months before it was provided again and in the meantime fires occurred and ambulances were needed in the area. People had to walk a long distance to the nearest kiosk to call for help. In these cases of vandalism, it could happen that the family of the person <Col N="265" /> responsible for the destruction might be in need of the service at some time.</P>
    <P>There are various services provided by the Post Office which are not adequately advertised.  There are, for instance, telephone attachments for the assistance of the hard of hearing about which very few people know.  I was not aware of it until I read a booklet recently.  It is available at a cost of only 2s 6d a quarter and it enables the hard of hearing to hear conversations on the telephone.  I am sure the Post Office have other services which would be of equal benefit and I suggest that they should be better advertised.</P>
    <P>Another service which the Post Office could usefully provide are home safes on the same lines as those provided by the Post Office Savings Bank and the ESB.  These could be kept in the home and could be taken to the counter and opened.  Such a service would be availed of gratefully by a number of people and I ask the Minister to consider its provision.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the Jacobs TV Award.  This firm deserve great credit for trying to raise the standard and quality of RTE productions.  It means that the personnel of Telefís Éireann are striving to reach higher standards in order to get one of these awards. This might be regarded by some as a type of advertising, but I think it is a desirable type and it is one which could be imitated with advantage.  Jacobs deserve every credit.</P>
    <P>With regard to advertising, detergent advertising is, I think undesirable.  Fantastic claims are made.  I believe advertisements should stay close to reality. There should be a fair assessment of the qualities of the product advertised. There is very little difference between detergents.  Some of the advertising is to be deplored, especially the kind of advertising depicting the typical English council house with the product being put across by some English actress.  Our own people could do the job quite well. That is an aspect into which there should be some examination made. Even if Telefís Éireann extract more money from these advertisements, it is we who pay in the last analysis because we pay for our television service and we also pay for a dearer product as a <Col N="266" /> result of more expensive advertising.</P>
    <P>There is still large-scale interference in some areas due to private workshops or, in some cases, to hospitals.  I would appeal to the Minister to ensure that suppressors are fitted to eliminate such interference.</P>
    <P>Every effort should be made to ensure that Irish-manufactured goods are used in Departments of State.  We have the engineers and the technicians and we can manufacture the goods. There will be every co-operation from both employers and workers in the development of any new project which will give additional employment.</P>
    <P>Once again, I want to say I was thoroughly disappointed with the system of selection.  Deputies can walk in here and sit for two, three or four minutes and they will be called on while others who sat here from four o'clock yesterday are passed over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a most interesting debate.  First of all, I want to thank Deputies, on behalf of myself and my Parliamentary Secretary, for the very kind remarks they made about us personally.  I should also like to express my appreciation of the very considerable praise given to the many thousands of people who work in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. The praise offered of their courtesy and attention to duty has been a delightful experience.  The criticism offered has been extremely constructive and helpful. Criticism, of course, there must be of a Department which is in a constant state of growth and which employs many thousands of people, a Department which has to face all kinds of problems from one year to another.  I very much appreciate what Deputies have said in regard to the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barrett asked in what capacity I could say anything to Telefís Éireann.  It should be obvious.  As Minister with powers of general supervision under the Act over Radio Telefís Éireann, I act for the Government and, as the Board has to have the confidence both of the Government and of the people in general, it is quite possible for me to comment on programmes and on the development of Radio Telefís Éireann, just as Deputies <Col N="267" /> have commented here in the House. Indeed, the concensus of opinion on the part of responsible Deputies and responsible people in the country as a whole, together with my own views, should enable Radio Telefís Éireann to gain a good idea of the progress they are making and of the criticism they must experience from time to time.  I have an absolute right to make approaches to the Board of Radio Telefís Éireann on the general development of the television service which is, as Deputy Barrett said, so important in the life of the community.</P>
    <P>With the exception of what I said about interviewing, hardly a Deputy questioned the rest of my observations on Radio Telefís Éireann.  Nobody could take seriously those Deputies who pretended to believe I intended to muzzle Radio Telefís Éireann because it was I who gave Radio Telefís Éireann its freedom.  I believe television and radio have the right to discuss every problem in a constructive and challenging way.  I have always said that and my observations on the Estimate were made deliberately with the intention of giving the public my views about certain matters in relation to which I think Radio Telefís Éireann needs to take care.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I want to make it clear that I was not referring to the interviewing of politicians, or other people, in the sense that I thought it was wrong to interview them challengingly and to ask them penetrating questions.  I made the statement because it was perfectly obvious from what people on both sides of the House had said to me that a habit had been instituted in RTE of rude interviewing, and I mean rude interviewing.  This has now stopped.  I wanted to get consent from everyone.  I do not want to have the Frost type of interviewing in this country.  It is totally unsuited to our needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>A Fine Gael Deputy interpreted what I said exactly correctly when he said: &ldquo;If the Minister means the David Frost kind of interview, <Col N="268" /> then I agree.&rdquo; I hope I have made that clear to all those who will be reading this debate.  I delight in challenging questions by interviewers, and I quite agree that Members of the Dáil have got to face up to challenging questions. They have to face up to penetrating questions.  It is a matter for obvious commonsense as to the extent to which any Deputy or any Minister should be given some idea in advance of the kind of questions he will be asked.  If it is on general matters of politics or things in his Department about which he should know everything then he does not need to be given some idea in advance of the kind of question he will be asked.</P>
      <P>If it is a matter that relates to very detailed operations in a big Department or questions on some topic that has not come his way for some time, whether it be a study of policy or implications then, as in the case of the BBC, it is only right and proper that RTE should give the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary in advance at least some heading so that he would be able to reply on matter of great detail where he would need to get his facts straight.  Everyone knows it is a matter of commonsense.  Otherwise, I certainly believe in the kind of debate where no one is given any intimation in advance of the kind of questions he will be asked because it makes for good interviewing and should interest the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want next simply to say what I have already said before that, under no circumstances, would the RTE Authority deliberately alter programmes so as to benefit the Party of the Government in office.  That would be a ridiculous concept.  They could not get staff to do it in one direction or the other, in a small country where everyone almost knows everyone else's business.  The idea that I would give a secret direction to the RTE Board and that they would suddenly start directing the whole process of radio/television programmes on matters of public interest in the Fianna Fáil direction is ludicrous.  Incidentally, if that did begin to happen, there is no surer way by which we could lose a general election or a by-election, or lose our entire reputation, than if it became <Col N="269" /> known as a fact that we were trying to manipulate the RTE service for our own use.  I hope everyone understands that.  I do not think we should do it from the point of view of principle, and it certainly would not pay us to do it.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need say very much more.  If I were to mention particularly Deputy Dillon's speech and Deputy Barrett's speech as giving one point of view about television, and the speeches of a number of other Deputies who spoke in a broad way, and if we were to take a broad consensus of what has been said about television in the House during this debate, and eliminate the obvious political window-dressing which, I suppose, is inevitable, fairly good advice has been given to the Board of RTE as to how they should proceed.  That is why I feel satisfied that, having made that statement and come to the House, on the whole, a great deal of what I said has been accepted.  This is obvious from the fact that most people did not comment on it in an antagonistic way, except those who wanted to try to suggest in some way or another that I was becoming, in the words of the lady on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;, something akin to Goebbels.  Incidentally, I thought that comment was ludicrously ridiculous. However, if she chooses to say it I cannot stop it.  It introduced an element of fantasy into the whole debate in so far as anybody wanted to quote it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The only Deputy who really went to town on it was Deputy L'Estrange.  I will not say any more.  I am very glad that Deputies spoke of a certain tendency which is inevitable in any communications organisation to occasionally sensationalise events because they know that the more sensational they can make them the greater the kick the viewers will get from them. That is one of the things I mentioned in my speech.  I said there should be balanced discussion, balanced argument and constructive solutions.  One cannot get them if there is an overwhelmingly sensational approach to the various problems we have to face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" /> One Deputy suggested a radio university. That is a long-term project.  I am doing all I can to see that radio plays its full part in education.  Another Deputy suggested the development of civic education.  There are features broadcast which are useful from the point of view of teaching civics.  I hope that will develop further, too.</P>
    <P>About half the programme, from one point of view, is serious.  If you take into account various items, including serious drama, about half the programme is serious.  If you use the word &ldquo;serious&rdquo; in a more strict and limited sense, about one quarter of the programme is serious.  Over half the programme is now home-produced, and that compares very well with a number of other television services abroad.  A Deputy asked questions on that.</P>
    <P>I should say that I agree with some Deputies that some of the imported canned American programmes are rather awful.  Equally some are very funny.  There has been quite a marked improvement in the character of the canned programmes used by RTE in the past year and a half or two years, and I hope the standard will go up.  I should add that the cost of producing drama at home is tremendous as compared with importing canned drama. Of course, they have to take account of their financial position.  Even the great BBC with its immense resources, and spending about five times as much as we do per hour for each programme, has to make use of foreign canned material in order to fill up their programmes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne for a brief moment dragged in a little notice that was passed within the press department of RTE which suggested that there would be a muzzling of debate on the referendum whereas, of course, this was entirely a misunderstanding.  The intention of the notice was that, as there was going to be a very long campaign, they could not overburden the ten minutes or quarter of an hour of news at the beginning of the campaign, by reporting a very large number of speeches in which there would be inevitably repetitive material.  Of <Col N="271" /> course, there was no intention on my part, or on the part of anyone, to prevent discussion on the referendum or to prevent speeches being reported. I think a very good job was done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell raised the question of televising the Dáil proceedings and said he was against it.  I am not going to encourage it and I have no further comment to make.  I do not think that under our circumstances it would be a good thing at the moment, but other people may think differently.  I will not encourage it myself.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies asked why an increase in the licence fee may be necessary. Of course, there has been inflation in this country, as everyone knows, for a number of years and the cost of the programmes has increased inevitably. There has been a levelling off in set growth.  There is a deficit in sound radio.  The fees have been unchanged since 1963.  The television fee is equal to less than a halfpenny per programme hour and I think it is one of the cheapest forms of entertainment in the world.  However, no decision has been made about increasing the fee.</P>
    <P>I should mention that I hope we will have another campaign for collecting licence fees from pirates, from people who do not pay.  It really is a fact that a wonderful machine will arrive&mdash; there is some delay&mdash;which will detect infallibly television sets which are operating.  That will help us to collect more licence fees from those who up to now have escaped attention.  It should increase the income of RTE but, as I have said, no decision has been made about an increase in the licence fee.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to TV advertising of liquor.  The manner in which it is advertised is a matter for the Authority to decide, but no hard liquor is advertised and I think for the moment that is a reasonable compromise.  Only beers and wines are advertised on television. Plenty of soft drinks are advertised as well.  I do not think I could interfere in that matter at present.</P>
    <P>Somebody asked me whether we could give up advertising altogether on television.  The licence fee would have <Col N="272" /> to be increased to about £12 if there was absolutely no advertising on Telefís Éireann.  The fee would have to go up to £12 instead of £5 and that would be too much to ask people to pay, so we must have advertising.</P>
    <P>There was very little criticism of programmes in the Irish language.  I should like to mention that a great deal has been done to improve programmes in the Irish language and the House might like to know that in feature and current affairs programmes the estimated Irish language content at a recent date was 20 per cent.  That is considerable progress.  There is a great deal of Irish language content right through the programmes and I think having it introduced in various different types of programme is being praised by those who have a modern attitude towards the development of the language.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan complained about television reception in County Galway.  We hope to have a new transposer erected near Clifden before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett mentioned the 14 per cent tax on advertising and the transfer of advertising from newspapers to RTE.  I believe the Minister for Finance is receiving a deputation on that subject.  I think that is all I need to say on RTE.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased at the way my remarks were received as a whole and once again I can give an absolute assurance to the people who for windowdressing reasons allege that I intend to muzzle RTE.  The debate shows that a great deal of what I said was understood and accepted by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell asked me about the personnel status and the basic organisation of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  This is still under examination and I think it will be looked at by the Devlin Commission.  It is a very complex matter.  The question of whether it would be wise to make of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs a State corporation is immensely complex &mdash; there are so many people employed, so many issues to <Col N="273" /> consider that the Devlin Commission may have something to say about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. O'Connell said we do not seem to have a proper development plan for the telephone service.  We have a plan ranging over a five-year period. It takes about five years to design an automatic exchange system, to order the equipment, to have it delivered and put into commission.  But we do have a very definite plan in that respect.  Deputy Harte asked about the possible re-routing of the telephone traffic from Donegal to London via the Six Counties.  We find that this is not practicable.  Direct dialling from Donegal town, Lifford and Letterkenny into the British system through Belfast would be very difficult and the internal trunk network in the Six Counties would not be able to cope with such a diversion of traffic from Donegal.  So we have to continue putting the traffic through Dublin.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte also asked about the hours of service at exchanges.  Ninety-eight per cent of all telephone subscribers have a continuous service.  The extra cost of providing a 24-hour attendance at small exchanges would be out of all proportion to the likely revenue for the calls made.  However, the position is fairly satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised a question in regard to the ugly appearance of overhead wiring and of median wiring and telephone poles adjacent to housing estates.  It is beyond us financially to bring telephone wires underground through existing housing schemes which were built without ducts being provided. In new housing estates where ducts are provided in advance we can do it and we have been arranging for underground lead-ins in estates where telephone density is highest.  We are not only providing ducts along the roads but also leading into the houses and this should help to reduce the extent to which we shall have overhead wiring which, I agree, can be ugly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon commented on the state of the telephone service in the constituency which both of us represent. There have been a great number of additional circuits provided in the county and I believe the service should be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Deputies asked many questions <Col N="274" /> about the advance rental requirements for long line connections in rural districts.  We have reduced the advance rental payable in certain cases because I felt it was excessive.  With the increases in basic rental charges, I felt it was essential to make concessions.  In the cities and some provincial towns where the installation is within three miles of the exchange, there is one year advance rental; where it is more than three miles there is a three-year advance rental.  In the case of other exchanges, where the installation is within one mile, the advance rental is one year, where it is one to two miles, it is two years and over two miles the advance rental is three years.  The five-year term is applied where the cost of installation is totally abnormal.  Those advance rental payments are not so severe as they were before the increases in the telephone charges.</P>

      <P>I have had difficulty myself.  It is being examined.  Deputy James Tully complained about the sale of advertising space in the new classified directory being handled by a commercial concern.  The firm who did this are experts and we had to make use of a commercial concern with the special qualifications and expertise necessary for this type of work.  The firm have been able to produce classified directories in other countries and our decision in this respect was reasonable in the circumstances.  We had a few complaints about some of the sales staff of this company who, it was said, misled subscribers in regard to the classified directory.  The matter was taken up with the firm <Col N="275" /> and Deputy Tully can be satisfied there will be no misunderstanding in the future because his complaint was insignificant.</P>
      <P>Telephone kiosks were mentioned.  I can tell Deputy Tully and other Deputies who made inquiries that they are disinfected daily.  Deputy Fitzpatrick asked so many questions about Cavan post office and exchange that I am glad to tell him &mdash; he said there were great difficulties over this&mdash;that tenders for the building were invited and today is the latest date for the receipt of the tenders for the new Cavan post office. Deputy Dockrell referred to the quality of the telephone service.  I want to make it clear to the House, although everybody spoke very praisingly about the telephone service, that we still have a great deal to do to reduce the number of subscriber dialling faults and the officers of the Department are engaged in a re-organisation of the maintenance side of the Department, making use of the latest techniques.  We have reduced very greatly the percentage of faulty dialling which takes place throughout the whole exchange system within the last two years.  We have not yet got it down to the low percentage I would like to see it at in comparison with, for example, Sweden but we are making progress and I want to make it clear we take very seriously the need to reduce the extent of faulty dialling that can be found in places and at certain times.</P>

      <P>I am very glad the Deputy says that.  We have made a very great effort and this effort is still being made by the officers who have <Col N="276" /> to deal with installation and construction work and they have managed to divert a sufficient number of staff at all levels in order to deal with that because there is nothing more infuriating than a high percentage of faulty dialling.  There were a number of observations made about the development of kiosks throughout the country.  The kiosk system is expanding. Virtually all towns with a population of 200 or more have at least one kiosk and many smaller centres now have a kiosk.  We very rarely have complaints that in an emergency there is a lack of communication in any rural area.  I have heard hardly any complaint whatever of life being in danger through that.  The kiosk system is gradually extending but we do not want to involve ourselves in very heavy and excessive costs through installing kiosks where they will not be economic. Incidentally, we are having a survey made at the present time on the whole kiosk position.</P>
      <P>Deputy Geoghegan complained about the telephone service in the Clifden area.  This has really been a headache for us.  I am glad to tell him that a contract will be placed shortly for aerial coaxial cable from Galway to Clifden.  The present carrier system is subject to frequent interference due to weather in the area.  I think there will be an improvement there and Deputy Geoghegan, who had numerous complaints to make, can be satisfied about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Crinion complained about the new permanent issue of stamps.  I think they are quite superb.  They represent very beautiful Celtic ornaments and manuscripts.  They are most unusual as compared with those of any other country.  A Deputy suggested we should have beauty spots.  We have had pictures of beautiful places in Ireland but in a space the size of a stamp it is very difficult to portray any scene which would look exclusively Irish because of the size of the stamp, the difficulty of getting the ambience, the colour and the light and the shade right in order that one could be quite certain that it was Ireland and of course, one could have a round tower or an old tenth century HibernoRomanesque <Col N="277" /> church or a Gallus oratory.  One could have that on the size of a stamp which would look unique.  Otherwise it is very difficult to get individuality into Irish scenic stamps.  I think I have answered most of the questions.  In regard to any questions which have not been answered, I will take note of what the Deputies have said.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been done for some years past, I have circulated a statement of vital statistics and of major health building projects.  Deputies will note from it that in 1967 there were fewer births than in 1966.  From 1961 to 1964, <Col N="279" /> when a peak figure of 64,072 was reached, the number of births was increasing each year.  In 1965 the figure dropped to 63,525; in 1966 there was a further drop to 62,215.  Last year's figure was 61,307.  I do not think we should read too much into this trend.  As I have said, 1964 was a peak year.  However, the figures are worth studying and, in fact, this study is proceeding in my Department.  Another noteworthy feature of the vital statistics is that in 1967 deaths were over 3,700 fewer than in 1966.  There is no single feature of overall significance which led to this decline.  However, the mild winter and the absence of an influenza epidemic were undoubtedly contributing factors.  One noteworthy individual decline in mortality was in respiratory tuberculosis, deaths from which declined from 308 in 1966 to 213 in 1967.  I am happy to see a resumption in the downward trend in this area.  There had been a slight increase in the figure as between 1965 and 1966.</P>
    <P>The original provision for the year 1968-69 came to a total of £24,462,000 and has already been voted.  The Supplementary Estimate now before the House amounts to £1,300,010. This includes a sum of £1,080,000 to supplement the finances available to the Hospitals Trust Fund to meet revenue deficits of voluntary hospitals, £220,000 required under Subhead G in respect of grants towards additional expenditure by health authorities in the current year and a token sum of £10 under Subhead A to enable discussion to take place on the main Estimate which has already been agreed to.</P>
    <P>I propose in the first place to explain the Supplementary Estimate.  The additional requirements of £220,000 under Subhead G arise from increased expenditure by health authorities as compared with their original estimates for items other than increases in salaries and wages.  Increased expenditure on salaries and wages due to the eleventh round is not included in this figure; provision arising from additional expenditure by health authorities in the current year in that respect was included in the global Vote <Col N="280" /> for remuneration agreed to on 12th December, 1968.  The sum of £220,000 arises mainly from the increase as from the 1st August, 1968, in the allowances for disabled persons and the infectious diseases maintenance allowances in accordance with the announcement made in the last budget.</P>
    <P>The main item in the Supplementary Estimate is a Grant-in-Aid to the Hospitals Trust Fund to supplement the moneys available to meet revenue deficits of voluntary hospitals.  Despite an increase as from the 1st April, 1968 in the capitation rates payable by health authorities for Health Act patients treated in voluntary hospitals, the revenue deficits of these hospitals are running at a level which far outstrips the resources available to meet them.</P>
    <P>Costs in voluntary hospitals have greatly increased in recent years.  This is due to a variety of reasons&mdash;including shorter hours and improved conditions for staffs, the introduction of block training for nurses, and very substantial increases in remuneration costs due to rounds of salary and wage adjustments.  There is only a small balance in the Fund at present and £1,080,000 will be required to meet commitments arising up to the end of the financial year.</P>
    <P>I have made arrangements to have the estimates of voluntary hospitals for 1969 examined critically with a view to reducing costs to the minimum consistent with providing a satisfactory standard of service.  I also propose from the 1st April next, to increase the capitation rates payable by health authorities for services in these hospitals and thereby to bring the rates nearer to what it would cost health authorities to provide the services in their own hospitals instead of sending patients to the voluntary hospitals. Even with the increased capitation rates, the accounts of many of the voluntary hospitals will continue to show a deficit.  These revenue deficits will continue to be met by grants from the Hospitals Trust Fund and the Fund will again need a fairly substantial supplement in 1969/70 from the Exchequer. I will have more to say about this matter when introducing my estimate for next year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="281" /> I would like now to turn to the overall expenditure on health services. The health services for the current year were originally estimated to cost £41,050,000, which represents an increase of about three million nine hundred thousand pounds on the figures for last year.  Some £800,000 of this increase arises from an adjustment of the capitation rates payable by local health authorities to voluntary hospitals as from 1st April, 1968.  Staffing costs continue to be the most significant factor in health expenditure.  These costs show an increase of the order of £1 million as compared with last year. The increase results from an improvement in standards by the appointment of additional staff, particularly in mental hospitals, and increased remuneration.</P>
    <P>During the last few years expenditure on drugs and medicines provided in the health services, both at dispensaries and in hospitals, has shown a very substantial increase.  This year it is estimated that it will again increase and this time by about £150,000 of which £100,000 will be in respect of medicines supplied at dispensaries. Increased usage of drugs is a feature of modern medicine; and since drug therapy and allied preventive medicine practices have undoubtedly helped to keep people out of hospital, have increased bed turnover and have made possible quicker return of patients to their normal life, they have contributed to a more economical use of the services and have been of some significance to the national economy.  Therefore we must balance our dislike of increased cost in this area by realisation of these beneficial aspects.</P>
    <P>I might also mention, at this point, that there was a considerable expansion in the scheme under which health authorities supply medicines to persons outside the lower income group.  This scheme is intended to benefit persons in the middle and higher income groups on whom the cost of medicine imposes an undue hardship.  In 1967 health authorities spent £61,000 on supplying medicines in over 5,000 such cases. This expenditure on the scheme increased by 75 per cent over the previous year and the number of people assisted <Col N="282" /> showed a rise of almost 50 per cent. More up-to-date figures are not yet available.</P>
    <P>In July, 1967, I introduced a scheme for the free supply to diabetics, irrespective of income, of the normal range of insulin preparations, other drugs and items needed for the treatment and control of their condition.  The scheme is working satisfactorily and on the 31st September last, 4,985 persons were availing themselves of it.  The figure does not include diabetics receiving free drugs and other medicinal requirements as members of the lower income group.</P>
    <P>The maximum weekly allowance was increased as from 1st August, 1967 by 5/- per week for an adult and 10/- per week for an adult with an adult dependant. A further increase of 7/6d. per week for an adult and of 15/- per week for an adult with an adult dependant came into effect from 1st August, 1968. As from that date the maximum allowance for each dependent child was also increased by 2/6d. per week.</P>
    <P>The higher rates of allowances, hitherto payable only in the County Boroughs of Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Waterford, are payable since 1st August, 1967, to recipients living in the Borough of Dún Laoghaire and in any other urban area with a population exceeding 7,000 persons.</P>
    <P>These 1967 changes are estimated to cost £6,200 extra this year.  The 1968 changes are estimated to cost an extra £16,000 during the current financial year and £24,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>An interesting point is that, while the amount paid in allowances during the year ended 31st March, 1968, which amounted to £196,654 increased by £5,450 as compared with the previous year, the number &mdash; 1,442 &mdash; in receipt of such allowances on 31st March, 1968, was 119 lower than the number in receipt of allowances at the corresponding date in 1967, mainly due to the decreased incidence of tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>As from 1st August, 1967, the maximum rates payable were increased by 5/- a week to £2 12s 6d per week in the case of a person without means, and in all other cases to £2 7s 6d per <Col N="283" /> week.  A further increase of 7/6d per week in the maximum rate of allowance, effective from 1st August, 1968, brought the rate to £3 and £2 15s per week respectively.</P>
    <P>Since August, 1967, the payment of an allowance may be continued by a health authority for the period up to eight weeks while a recipient received institutional services.  Previously, payment was suspended while the disabled person was maintained in a hospital or institution.  The new provision is intended to offset the hardship which could arise if a disabled person who had to enter hospital for a short period had to meet continuing commitments such as rent.  The number of recipients of disabled persons allowances on 31st March, 1968, was 21,445 as against 20,210 on the same date in 1967.  The total cost of allowances for the year ended 31st March, 1968, was £2,288,685, roughly £380,000 more than the expenditure in the previous year.  It is estimated that the revised provisions operating from 1st August, 1967, will cost an extra £100,000 this year and that the 1968 increase will cost an extra £285,000 approximately in the current financial year and about £430,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of patients in the additional accommodation provided in homes for mentally handicapped children and additional expenditure on services catering for old people are expected to cost health authorities £200,000 more this year than last year. I will be dealing with these services in somewhat more detail later on.  An estimated increase of £130,000 on mother and child services arises largely from the payment of increased fees to doctors providing maternity care.  The appointment of more dentists and district nurses is estimated to cost an additional £100,000.  Food costs in local authority institutions including mental hospitals are estimated to increase by £200,000 and the cost of repairs and maintenance by £150,000.  Specialist services show an estimated increase of £100,000 and superannuation for hospital and other staffs is estimated to increase by £150,000 The balance of the increase in expenditure arises under a <Col N="284" /> variety of headings and spread over the full range of services &mdash; including ambulance services, administrative costs, replacement of furniture, equipment and appliances.</P>
    <P>The latest estimate of expenditure by health authorities in the current year is £43,040,000, an increase of £1,990,000 on the original estimate.  In dealing with the provision in the supplementary estimate I have explained how the increased costs arose in the current year.</P>
    <P>I now come to the explanation of the basis upon which grants to health authorities are being provided in the current year.  At this stage I would like to make the point, which seems to be missed by quite a lot of people who complain about the cost of health services, that these costs have to be borne by the community.  The Minister for Health is criticised because he does not relieve the rates to a greater extent than has been found possible this year. In reply to this criticism I would point out that the percentage extra assistance given to the rates over the statutory 50/50 division of cost varies from four per cent to eight per cent for individual health authorities, averaging roughly six per cent over the whole country. When one is dealing with a total cost figure of the order of £43,000,000 I think that Deputies on all sides will accept that a percentage of six per cent represents a very sizeable additional contribution from the Exchequer. Again I would remind Deputies that what the Exchequer pays must, of course, be raised from the people just as money contributed from the rates also must be raised.  The only justification for a transfer of responsibility for any portion of the cost of the health services from the rates to the Exchequer is that general taxation is a more equitable way of raising money than by increasing local rates; but the fact remains that the total cost must be met by the public.</P>
    <P>The question of the arrangements to be made for financing health expenditure in the year 1969/70 is at present being urgently considered.  As Deputies are, no doubt, aware I have had strong representations that I should try to provide further relief for the rates in <Col N="285" /> respect of increases in costs next year. All I can say at this stage is that the existing proportion of each health authority's expenditure which is being met from the Exchequer will not be reduced.</P>
    <P>Rising costs require us to make the most effective economic use possible of health services and to see that the full resources of preventive medicine should, as far as possible, be brought to our people and availed of by them. Effective preventive services lessen the demand on the curative services.  In many branches of medicine, attention is now being directed to the early diagnosis of disease so as to limit disability. I referred briefly in my Estimates speech for 1967-68 to the Phenylketonuria Service.  I want to take this particular development as illustrative of the new screening services in preventive medicine and to show you how valuable a contribution they can make.</P>
    <P>Phenylketonuria is a condition in new-born infants which may result in severe mental handicap if the condition is not diagnosed and treated.  A special service aimed at screening all new-born infants was initiated by my Department in February, 1966 and was offered without charge to all doctors and to all maternity hospitals and homes.  A minute blood sample is taken from the newly-born infant and tested.  When the condition is found to exist treatment can be successful in most cases, particularly when commenced early. Treatment involves a special diet which can be quite expensive and I have asked health authorities to look sympathetically at all requests for assistance towards the provision of such a diet.</P>
    <P>The tests commenced in February, 1966 and from that time up to 31st December last, 82 per cent of all infants born in the country were screened for this condition.  The figure for last year was 91 per cent, a good response, but I hope that it will be improved on in the future.  That the scheme is a useful one is demonstrated by the fact that so far it has turned up 37 cases of this condition.  Most of those would not have been detected in time were it not for this service.  They would have represented an economic loss to, or an economic burden on the community <Col N="286" /> apart altogether from the tragedy to the children themselves and their families which, of course, is a far more important consideration.</P>
    <P>I commented last year on the considerable under-use of some of the preventive services.  I am happy now to report that the public seem to be developing an increasing appreciation of the value of these services, although there is still some way to go before the situation can be described as satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to diphtheria immunisation has improved somewhat. In each of the years 1966 and 1967 63 per cent of pre-school children were immunised against the disease as against 49 per cent in 1965 and 56 per cent in 1964.  While the percentages for 1966 and 1967 are the highest for the past seven years, they still fall short of the desired target figure of 70 per cent.  Therefore, I would again exhort health authorities to intensify their efforts to bring home to parents that suffering, or even death, of their children from diphtheria can be prevented if they will co-operate by having their children immunised.  The immunisation service is free of charge from health authorities and is easily obtained.</P>
    <P>The number of persons who came forward for X-ray under the mass X-ray service in 1968 was 365,884. This was a slight drop on the 1967 position when 387,815 persons were X-rayed.  This drop was probably caused by the restrictions on movement to prevent a foot and mouth epidemic here.  But here again there is room for improvement in the response of the public.  I cannot understand why more people will not take the small amount of trouble to check their health by mass X-ray.  This service is provided practically on their doorsteps; it is free; it takes only a few minutes and its benefits are self-evident.</P>
    <P>I referred in speaking on the 1967/68 Estimate to the good response to the oral polio vaccination scheme introduced by my Department in 1965. No case of the disease was notified in 1967, but two were reported in 1968 and so far this year, there have been seven cases.  This must surely make everyone realise that the disease <Col N="287" /> is still one to be reckoned with.  Those who have not been immunised are particularly vulnerable.  I cannot too strongly impress on parents their grave responsibility to ensure that their children receive protection.  The services again are available free of charge through the health authorities.  All that is needed is the interest and co-operation of the public.</P>
    <P>We have sought, by the wide distribution of the free booklet entitled <i>A Summary of the Health Services</i> and by other means to increase public awareness of health services.  I have found it surprising how many people in spite of constant publicity remain not fully aware of their entitlement to these services and I have urged health authorities to set up information offices, identified as such by advertisement in the public press.  The public, too, must play their part.  People unfortunately have a tendency to wait until illness strikes before seeking information about their eligibility and later still before making a claim.  It is often then too late and the health authority will not, quite reasonably, always entertain a claim for retrospective assistance.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of the control of drugs.  At the end of 1967, the National Drugs Advisory Board commenced monitoring drugs so as to keep a check on their toxicity and possible adverse effects.  This means that drugs being introduced in this country for the first time are now, with the general co-operation of the pharmaceutical industry, subjected to close scrutiny by the Board.</P>
    <P>The Board has also made arrangements for collecting and assessing reports on adverse reactions to drugs already in use, which are submitted to it by doctors, dentists and hospitals throughout the country.  The Board will, in turn, supply any necessary information or advice to the medical and dental professions arising out of the pooling of data made available in this way and from other sources. I feel that the Board deserves the fullest support in this important work and I know that the members of the medical, dental and allied professions can be counted on to co-operate fully in this valuable work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> Apart from the safety angle, there are problems connected with distribution in the broadest sense.  There are many complex matters to be considered under this general heading, notably the question of quality control. I would assure the House that this question is receiving the closest attention in my Department and I propose to seek the approval of the Government to the introduction at an early date of legislation to deal with these questions of the safety and quality control of medical preparations.  I am at present engaged in consulting interested parties on my suggested legislation. Whilst our basic aim in endeavouring to achieve a comprehensive and up-to-date system of control must be to safeguard the health of the community, it is worth remembering that such a system is necessary and desirable if we are to adapt ourselves to conditions of free trade in the Europe of the future.  To compete effectively in the Europe of today the pharmaceutical industry here must inform itself of and participate in, the developments in the manufacturing, wholesaling and marketing end of the industry there and be aware of and conform to the up-to-date controls imposed in these countries.  To this extent we are already partners in a uniting Europe and I have directed my Department to maintain the closest liaison with the pharmaceutical industry, with other Government Departments concerned and with the international bodies concerned in this field.</P>
    <P>I also propose to take powers to deal with the problem of drug abuse&mdash; for example, making the unauthorised possession of certain drugs an offence. Such powers have, in fact, been included as a part of the draft legislation on safety and quality control to which I have referred earlier.  I have, as Deputies know, set up a working party to advise me on certain aspects of drug abuse.  It has commenced its work and I look forward to its report in due course.  It is important that we take the correct measures in dealing with the problem to guard against any explosive increase in the misuse of drugs, as has happened elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I have taken steps to bring under the controls provided for in the Dangerous <Col N="289" /> Drugs Act, 1934, certain synthetic narcotics which did not hitherto come within the scope of the Act.  This will be effected by Government Order.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the 1967-68 Estimates, I said that the recommendations submitted by the Poisons Council regarding a comprehensive code for controlling the distribution, etc. of poisons were being examined.  A first draft of regulations has been prepared and sent to the council for their comments. Needless to say, other interested bodies must be consulted when the council have commented.  I should say also that in formulating these draft comprehensive controls certain minor amendments were found to be necessary in the Poisons Act, 1961, to give effect fully to them and I propose to avail myself of the opportunity presented by the contemplated legislation on quality and safety control to make these changes.  In the meantime, existing controls have been maintained and are being enforced.</P>
    <P>During last year, I made regulations under the Poisons Act, 1961, declaring paraquat to be a poison.  The regulations confine the retail sale of this substance to pharmacists and to certain other sellers already licensed to sell agricultural poisons.  In addition, they forbid the sale unless the poison is in the manufacturer's original container, and unless the word &ldquo;Poison&rdquo; is legibly written on the container together with a warning notice that the contents should not be taken, should be kept out of the reach of children and should not be repacked from the container, and that the container should be destroyed when empty.  This substance has been responsible for a number of deaths in recent years.  Nevertheless, its efficacy as a herbicide is such that its ready availability to the farming community is necessary.  However, if the controls now imposed are rigorously adhered to by all concerned the dangers associated with it should be removed.</P>
    <P>In this regard also, I would appeal to the general public to treat all these poisonous substances with extreme care.  No matter how comprehensive the controls over the sale, labelling, etc., are, once a poison arrives in a home, it is only the head and other senior members of the household who <Col N="290" /> can ensure that it is stored in a safe place away from children and that all precautions are taken in its handling. If you are doubtful about any substance, do not take a chance.  Above all, nobody, for any reason, should decant a poison from the original container into a lemonade bottle or such like container.</P>
    <P>In regard to community care of the aged, while, in the past, there was widespread agreement that old people should not have to go into county homes or other institutions unless this course seemed unavoidable, it is only in the last few years that local communities have begun to organise supporting activities such as meals on wheels, old folks' clubs, chiropody and visiting services to help old people to stay in their own homes.  This growing public interest is most heartening and it is most encouraging to observe the pace at which local groups are being formed to help the aged, the varying methods of approach in each area and the variety of services provided.  I am in complete sympathy with the desire of local communities to shoulder responsibility for organising this kind of social service.  They need have no fear of a take-over bid by the State.  On the contrary, they can look with confidence to my support.  Wherever a soundly-based community body exists, I should prefer, as a matter of principle, to entrust it with responsibility for domiciliary services for the aged.</P>
    <P>I have recently introduced a new scheme which is designed to give a fillip to the development of community social services in general and specifically to increase substantially the financial assistance given by health authorities to voluntary bodies which care for the aged in the community.  I have encouraged and authorised health authorities to give grants within a total of £50,000 in the current year and £75,000 next year towards the running costs of voluntary bodies providing community services for the care of the aged.  The annual level of grants towards current expenditure is about £13,000 at present, so that the new scheme will represent a big increase in aid to voluntary bodies.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme, each health authority is being allocated an amount proportional to the total number of <Col N="291" /> persons aged 65 and over living in its functional area.  The scheme has several important innovations &mdash; for instance, within the limits of the allocation the prior sanction of the Department will not be required and this will enable health authorities to act speedily in making grants to local bodies; the health authorities are being encouraged to have an experimental approach in evolving the community service best suited to the needs of old people in their particular areas; they will be free to support social services which in a narrow context might not be considered as health services but which do, in fact, make direct and real contribution to the health and well-being of the old people.  This scheme, taken as a whole, gives to the local health authorities the capability, the responsibility, and the scope for initiative in developing community services for its aged.</P>
    <P>One particular class of old persons, namely, those living alone, has been singled out for priority attention under the new scheme.  There are 35,000 old people living alone and they are likely to be at greater risk and in greater need than old people living with relatives.  The district nurses spend much of their time visiting old persons living alone but the help of the community is needed if many of them are to continue to live happily in the community.  It should surely be the ambition of every civilised community to ensure, through local social services and local good neighbourliness, that old people on their own no longer live in dread of becoming ill or helpless and unable to contact anyone.</P>
    <P>While health authorities have been given no rigid guidelines under the scheme as to the way in which the services for the aged should develop, I have brought to the attention of all of them that in some areas a broadly based community council, co-ordinating and augmenting the activities of voluntary organisations, has evolved.  I see great advantages in such community councils since they draw on the knowledge and ability of the various agencies in the social field and they appeal to all sections of the local community. Health authorities should take active steps to encourage their formation where they do not exist.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="292" /> There is at the present time a growing pressure for the appointment of social workers in the community to deal with a wide range of social problems which are outside the scope of any existing State service.  There is particular need for this type of service in rapidly changing urban areas.  A number of health authorities have appointed social workers to deal, for example, with the organisation of services for old people, or to work closely with a voluntary body in the development of social services for a particular area.  In addition, some voluntary bodies &mdash; for example in Kilkenny&mdash; have themselves employed social workers and the health authority may contribute indirectly, by means of a grant, towards the cost of their salary. I see a real danger that the emerging social worker service may not harmonise efficiently with the existing medical and social services of local authorities.  Care must be taken to eliminate competition, duplication and undesirable overlapping.</P>
    <P>It is very important that all who work in the social services &mdash; health authority staffs, voluntary social workers, charitable and religious organisations&mdash;work in harmony and co-ordinate their activities so that their collective efforts will have the maximum impact in the community.  There need be no question of &ldquo;take-over bids&rdquo;&mdash;the attitude should be one of anxiety to combine and not to compete, in doing good for our not-sofortunate brothers and sisters in the community and to deploy resources in the most advantageous way.</P>
    <P>While on this subject, I should like to say how sorry I am that the Queen's Institute of District Nursing decided to discontinue their nursing activities including their training scheme.  Most of us know of the valuable contribution made by them in the past and I want to pay tribute to their work and to their nurses who gave such devoted service.  Every effort was made by my Department and by health authorities over many years to encourage this nursing service to continue and grants of an increasingly generous nature were made available <Col N="293" /> from public funds.  However, the decision to discontinue was regrettably taken by the Institute itself.  I am heartened by the fact that many district nursing organisations have decided to carry on independent of the Queen's Institute and that the Lady Dudley Nursing Scheme will also continue. They can count on my continued practical support &mdash; financial and otherwise.</P>
    <P>I should say, too, that nurses employed by district nursing associations which have discontinued their activities are being appointed as public health nurses by the local health authorities concerned provided they are suitably qualified.  I should also say that it gives me considerable pleasure to be able to tell the House that a superannuation scheme for nurses in the voluntary hospital service has been introduced with effect from the 1st January last, which provides benefits comparable to those enjoyed by local authority staffs.  The scheme which is open to permanent wholetime hospital, para-medical, technical and administrative staffs, will also cater for nurses employed by district nursing associations.</P>
    <P>While the development of community services for the care of the aged is a primary objective in our planning, we must at the same time continue our efforts to provide effective institutional services for those old people who cannot remain at home.  In the development of such services, assessment and diagnostic centres will be the cornerstone.  In a fully developed service patients for whom long-stay care may be necessary would be referred in the first instance for assessment and diagnosis at a fully equipped centre.  When a patient's condition has been thoroughly checked any necessary medical care would then be given.  Where a further period of care is required or intensive rehabilitation services are needed, the patient would be referred to accommodation specially designed for this purpose.  If, despite intensive therapy, it becomes clear that the patient could not effectively care for himself in his own home surroundings or be supported to live in the community with the assistance <Col N="294" /> of relatives and the aid of community care services, then he would be referred to suitable long-stay accommodation.  Such a concept cannot be brought into full effect immediately. Some of the organisational changes necessary will be affected by the decisions to be taken on the pattern for hospital and specialist services in the future.</P>
    <P>Variations to suit local conditions will be necessary.  For example, in more populous areas attendance at day-hospitals, backed by efficient domiciliary services might be feasible and apart from keeping the old person looked after satisfactorily, this method would considerably ease the strain on the institutional services.  Furthermore, the institutional services cannot be planned in isolation.  There must be effective co-ordination of all services designed to care for the aged, from housing to hospitals, and of all the agencies, whether public or voluntary, that play a part.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, it is essential to improve the institutional services for the care of the aged.  It is hoped as far as possible to develop the long-stay hospital units in as close association as possible with acute hospitals.  The long-stay units will be adequately staffed and equipped to deal with the rehabilitation or care of patients.  Planning is proceeding with the aim of providing long-stay units on the sites of the county hospitals at Tullamore, Nenagh and Cavan.  Proposals on the same lines are under consideration for Kilkenny.  This approach represents a major departure from the older concept of re-planning the old county homes completely on existing sites.  In addition it is intended that further diversification will take place through the provision of welfare homes for the aged in suitable centres away from the existing county home centres.  However, flexibility must be the keynote.  In some areas, for example, at Longford, it will be already advantageous to avail of the improved services already provided for long-stay sick patients.  I propose, however, that in such instances the accommodation to be made available in the future for the aged who need accommodation of a welfare type will not only be domestic <Col N="295" /> in character but that some provision will also be made for married couples and for some other suitable persons in sef-contained units where they can continue to live in some degree of independence. In other areas, for example, County Clare and County Roscommon, some accommodation for people needing care for social rather than medical reasons is to be provided at the main county centre and the balance is being planned for other towns&mdash;namely, Kilrush and Boyle.  I expect that work will commence on the residential homes at Kilrush and Boyle in the present year.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made on the schemes for the replacement of outmoded accommodation in county homes.  Over the past few years new or reconstructed accommodation has been provided for about 900 patients at Mountmellick, Stranorlar, Longford, Castleblayney, Clonakilty, Ennis and Trim.  Schemes in progress will provide places for about 1,250 patients at Stranorlar, Killarney, Carrick-onShannon, Castleblayney, Clonakilty, Castlebar, Roscommon and Athy. A special scheme to provide about 70 places for homeless persons is in progress at Usher's Island, Dublin. A scheme for accommodation for about 120 persons at Regina Coeli Hostel, Dublin, will be commenced shortly.  The total expenditure since 1966 to date on county home improvement schemes already completed or in progress is £2.8 million approximately. The amount required to complete the works in progress for which tenders have been invited or sanctioned is estimated at about £1.7 million.</P>
    <P>I am happy to be able to report that the population of our mental hospitals fell by 16.5 per cent in the period 1958-67, and that further decreases are anticipated.  A greater proportion of the mentally ill nowadays are old people showing symptoms of senility, confusion and disturbance.  Psychiatric treatment can relieve these symptoms in old people but, to make the best use of the psychiatric care available, it will be necessary to avoid an imbalance developing in our hospitals with psychogeriatric patients taking up an undue amount of time of psychiatrists <Col N="296" /> and nurses.  I think that it will be necessary for our mental hospital authorities to be more critical of applications made for the admission of old people for psychiatric care and treatment and to try to ensure that because old people are admitted for treatment they are not, by reason of age and its symptoms alone, going to remain inpatients for the rest of their lives. Unless the number of aged persons in our district mental hospitals can be kept at reasonably low level the most effective use of our psychiatric services will just not be possible.</P>
    <P>While the population of our district mental hospitals has fallen, there were nevertheless 16,732 patients in such hospitals on 31st December, 1967.  This figure is too high and we must strive to reduce it.  I hope that the greater development of community mental health services will help further to reduce the number of persons in psychiatric hospitals.  A good community mental health service requires adequate out-patient clinic facilities, suitable arrangements for domiciliary visiting, a sufficiency of day hospitals and hostels and a significant involvement of general medical practitioners, public health nurses, social workers generally, voluntary bodies and the public at large in the problem of those who are psychiatrically ill.  I hope that the provision of further psychiatric units at general hospitals will help to accelerate acceptance of the idea that psychiatric illness is not one to be hidden away or to be ashamed of and that early treatment can achieve excellent results.</P>
    <P>The attendance at out-patient psychiatric clinics continues to rise.  In 1960 the number of patients attending them was 6,174.  In 1967 it was 28,405. The standard of service given, the frequency of clinics and the accepttance by the community of this service have been responsible to a large extent for the reduction in the number of in-patients in mental institutions.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest pressures I have experienced since becoming Minister for Health has been for hospital accommodation for mentally ill children. Accommodation for such children, including autistic children, is provided <Col N="297" /> at St. Loman's Hospital, Ballyowen, County Dublin.  This is fully taken up. A further unit of 24 beds is nearing completion at Beaumont in Dublin. In addition, I have approved of another unit of 20 beds at Stillorgan and planning of this unit has already commenced.  I have also given approval to the provision of accommodation for some 20 children in Cork under the auspices of the Cork Polio and After Care Association and preliminary planning of this project is in progress. I have arranged that these projects be pushed ahead with all possible speed and, in so far as lies within my power, there will be no avoidable delay in getting them into operation.</P>
    <P>Psychiatric disturbances and delinquency in adolescents are matters which have been receiving some publicity recently.  In regard to Dublin, I am pleased to say that work is proceeding on the adaptation of a building at St. Brendan's Hospital in which special care will be available for disturbed adolescents.  The Dublin Health Authority have proposed, and I have agreed, that a post of clinical director be created with responsibility for forensic psychiatry.  This is the first step, I hope, towards a linking of the services provided in the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, with the services of the Dublin Health Authority, and this link should enable an improved service to be provided for the majority of psychiatric patients, including delinquent disturbed adolescents, who come to the notice of the courts, and who need to be treated in a setting where the necessary high level of security can be attained.</P>
    <P>Two new acute psychiatric units have been provided at Clonmel and Castlebar and I have approved of others at Galway, Limerick and Letterkenny. The units are beside the regional or county hospital as the case may be at these centres and will function in association with them.  Accommodation no longer required for tuberculosis patients at St. Stephen's Hospital, Cork, will be used for acute psychiatric treatment and long-stay care.  Proposals for the establishment of other acute treatment centres are under active consideration. In order to eliminate planning delays to the maximum extent <Col N="298" /> possible, standard schedules of accommodation and outline plans have been drawn up in my Department for the guidance of health authorities providing such centres.  The same is also being done in connection with the planning of industrial therapy units.</P>
    <P>Apart from what I have mentioned, the main activity on the mental hospital building side, at present, is in the up-grading of existing institutions.  The total estimated cost of schemes in progress and in planning is about £4.2 million.  One important such scheme of which I have recently approved is the provision of 100 new beds at Kilkenny to replace unsuitable accommodation there.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to report continued progress in the services for the mentally handicapped.  At the end of 1968 there were 3,981 places in the special residential centres as compared with 3,760 at the end of 1967.  Over the past four years 880 additional places have been provided at these centres and in addition a number of health authorities have opened small temporary units for the care of severely handicapped children.</P>
    <P>An important development has been the growth in the numbers being dealt with satisfactorily on a non-residential basis.  The numbers attending special day-schools and day-centres or attending residential centres on a day basis increased from 1,430 at the end of 1967 to approximately 1,800 at the end of 1968.  At the end of 1964 the number in receipt of services on a non-residential basis was only 632 and this three-fold increase over the four years gives some idea of the rapid expansion of special day-schools and day-centres.</P>
    <P>We have still a fair distance to go before we can regard the services for the mentally handicapped as having reached a satisfactory level but the foregoing figures indicate that steady progress is being made.</P>
    <P>Considerable further developments are planned, both in regard to special residential care and day-care.  In all, we hope to provide about 800 extra residential places over the next two to three years.  These, added to the 880 places provided over the past four <Col N="299" /> years, will represent a total increase of about 55 per cent in a period of seven years.</P>
    <P>The improvement of the public dental services has been hampered, for many years, by difficulties in recruiting and retaining wholetime dental staff.  In an effort to improve the recruitment position the conditions of service of these staffs were improved with effect from 1st January, 1968. Wholetime dental officers may now work two dental sessions per week outside normal working hours in health authority clinics, for which they would be paid the approved sessional rate. In addition, satisfactory experience outside the public service before appointment to that service, is now allowed to rank for increment purposes.  These concessions applied to serving officers as well as to newly-appointed officers.</P>
    <P>Following these improvements in conditions of service, recent competitions held by the Local Appointments Commissioners have been much more successful than formerly in obtaining candidates for public dental officer posts.  There are some areas, however, where it is still very difficult to obtain the services of wholetime dental staff.  The health authorities concerned and the Local Appointments Commissioners are continuing their efforts to fill vacant posts in these areas.  To some extent the shortage of wholetime dentists in these areas is being met by the employment of private dentists on a sessional basis.</P>
    <P>The total population now receiving fluoridated water exceeds 1,100,000. The fluoridation programme is being pressed ahead as quickly as possible and, when completed within the next two years, the total served by fluoridated supplies will exceed 1,500,000 people.</P>
    <P>The possibility of extending the use of fluorides in the prevention of dental decay is being examined.  This procedure would be very beneficial for rural school children in those areas which will not have a fluoridated water supply.  Pilot schemes of fluoride mouth-rinsing have already been commenced in six areas, to determine the best method of proceeding.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="300" /> In recent times there has been a growing appreciation of the need to reshape our general hospital services to fit them to discharge their function more effectively in terms of current and future medical needs.  The need for a radical re-organisation is generally recognised by those involved and the problem is to define the pattern most appropriate to our situation.  A combination of developments in the field of hospital medicine has sparked off this rethinking.  Broadly these are: increasing specialisation combined with the need for greater teamwork to deal with particular conditions; the development of more sophisticated and complex equipment, the heavy capital cost of which can be justified only if it is fully utilised; and the need to improve consultant staffing ratios to cope with the steadily-growing volume of demand for hospital care.  All of these developments point to the inescapable conclusion that a significant concentration of general hospital in-patient services, in larger units than have met the needs of the past, is essential if we are to provide, within our resources, a fully effective service for our people.  This does not apply to consultant out-patient services. Indeed, I would hope to see some expansion of these facilities because it is only by the association of good modern out-patient diagnostic and treatment services with acute in-patient diagnostic and treatment services, that the most economical and effective services can be provided.</P>
    <P>Early in 1967, the Irish Medical Association and the Medical Union engaged in a series of discussions with officers of my Department as a result of which it transpired that there was a substantial measure of agreement about changes necessary in the structure of the health authority general hospital service.  The discussions, however, did not cover the voluntary hospitals, which by reason of their teaching function and the extent of their patient complement must be considered the senior partner in the partnership.  Accordingly, in November, 1967, I set up a consultative council, composed of consultants in both the health authority and voluntary hospital services, to advise on the re-organisation of the general <Col N="301" /> hospital services as a whole.  This body's report was presented to me just over six months later.  When one considers the wide area which had to be covered, the complex nature of the many problems to be investigated and the exceedingly heavy demands on their time, the members of the council set a headline for all advisory bodies in presenting so comprehensive a report in such a short time.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay public tribute here to every member of the council. Many of their meetings were held at night and throughout whole week-ends. Many of the members over the years had developed firm allegiances to particular medical schools and to particular hospitals; yet their recommendations show no trace of any bias.  Their unanimity, indeed, is a clear indication that our present organisation could not much longer suvive and that radical changes are necessary.</P>
    <P>The report sets out the general principles which should guide the future development of our hospital services, and goes on to spell out in some detail the manner in which these principles might be implemented.  Probably the most pressing demands for improvements and re-organisation arise in the Dublin area, where the present large number of relatively small, independent hospitals, many of them old, unsatisfactory buildings, makes it difficult to adopt a co-ordinated approach.  Since I received the report of the consultative council I have written to the hospital authorities concerned in Dublin, suggesting the formation of committees representing these authorities and their staffs, to examine and recommend on the manner in which re-organisation might be brought about.  A considerable amount of time has been given by the hospital groups on each side of the Liffey to the study of this problem and while definite conclusions have not yet emerged, I am hopeful that this point will be reached within a few months.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the council's report, which may cause some concern in different parts of the country, is the change of function of some county hospitals which would arise out of the necessary concentration of acute hospital <Col N="302" /> services.  I must emphasise in relation to this point that what is at issue is a change of function and not a discontinuance of hospital activity.  In most cases this change of function will develop gradually and will necessarily take a period of years.  Furthermore, it will be accompanied by the development and improvement of specialist out-patient services at the sites of all these hospitals.  The main effect of the changes will be, therefore, that consultant services on an out-patient basis will be more conveniently available to the public than at present and that, where in-patient treatment is required for a serious condition, it will be provided under the best possible conditions of buildings, staffing and equipment and with the backing of properly developed ancillary services such as pathology and radiology.</P>
    <P>The construction of the new St. Vincent's Hospital at Elm Park, Dublin &mdash; a general teaching hospital of some 450 beds &mdash; is probably our largest general hospital project in recent years. Some of the buildings are now being occupied by staff and others are virtually completed.  In a major undertaking of this kind, of course, it will be some time yet before the complete new hospital is fully equipped and functioning.</P>
    <P>The planning of the new Regional General Teaching Hospital for Cork is proceeding and the indications are that it should be possible to invite tenders for the work in the spring of 1971. Works of improvement are in progress at the County Hospitals in Wexford and Tralee, St. Kevin's Hospital, Dublin and the District Hospital, Ballina.  A major extension is nearing completion at Sligo County Hospital. This will increase the capacity of the hospital by about 100 beds and includes provision for specialised departments. A staff home is being provided at the County Hospital, Nenagh.</P>
    <P>Capital expenditure on hospitals during 1968/69 is expected to be about £3? million.  This programme will be financed (a) from the Hospitals Trust Fund &mdash; to the extent of about £2 million including a grant-in-aid from the Exchequer of £1 million, as shown in the Estimate &mdash; and (b) from the Local Loans Fund and other sources &mdash; about <Col N="303" /> £1? million.  The statement, which I have already circulated to Deputies, lists the major building projects which were completed since March, 1967, those which were in progress and those which were approved in principle and which were being planned during the period.</P>
    <P>On the question of capital expenditure on hospitals generally, I feel I must again appeal to all hospital authorities, who propose seeking grants from my Department for capital projects, to endeavour to restrict their proposals to absolute essentials and to ensure that, when such proposals proceed to the detailed planning stage, every effort is made to achieve the desired results with the maximum economy.  The implementation of the recommendations of the Consultative Council on the General Hospital Services, to which I have already referred, will require very substantial capital expenditure over the next 10-15 years, most of which would be additional to the normal hospital capital programme.  Further capital expenditure will be involved in implementing the recommendations of the Commissions of Inquiry on Mental Illness and on Mental Handicap.</P>
    <P>A possible future programme of this magnitude, therefore, will create serious financing problems, and will restrict to a considerable extent the availability of moneys for other schemes, however important they may appear to the promoting authorities concerned.  It goes without saying, of course, that capital grants from the Hospitals Trust Fund will not be forthcoming for works undertaken or commitments entered into without my prior approval. It would also be grossly unfair to hospital authorities who adhere to the procedures governing the allocation of grants from the Hospitals Trust Fund if others were to be given grants to cover the cost of projects undertaken without regard to those procedures.</P>
    <P>In September, 1967 at the invitation of the Government, the Annual Meeting of the European Region of the World Health Organisation was held in Dublin.  The meeting went very smoothly and added a happy chapter in our continued co-operation with the international organisations such as the <Col N="304" /> World Health Organisation and the Council of Europe.  Our association with these organisations, to whose work we contribute and by whose efforts we benefit, is of considerable assistance to us in our acquisition of experience and knowledge to fit us for an ever-expanding role in the brotherhood of nations.</P>
    <P>In this statement introducing the Estimate, I do not propose to cover the general lines of future policy on the administration, financing and development of the health services.  The House will shortly have an opportunity to discuss these on the Health Bill, so I have accordingly thought it fitting that on this occasion, my report should be largely concerned with an account of the operation of the services as they are now.  The Estimates with which we are dealing concern the present services.  There are, of course, many points on which changes will be proposed.  I expect to explain these to the House in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Vote be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo; I should like to express my thanks to the Minister for his very comprehensive statement.  May I, because I do not wish to continue in a carping mood, open by expressing disappointment that an assurance which I believe was given last year, although I have not the actual report before me, has not been kept?  I did complain that it was unreasonable to expect a Member of the House while the Minister is speaking to absorb information in relation to vital statistics and capital programmes contained in a nine-page document.  I think the Minister will appreciate that that is asking a Member of the House either to appear to be discourteous to the Minister by not listening to what he is saying or not reading the Minister's memorandum or else it renders the task of a Deputy virtually impossible.  It means that the Deputy opening for the Opposition has not got an opportunity of considering the memorandum the Minister issues before he rises to comment upon the Minister's statement, which in part is based upon the very memorandum which the Deputy has not got an opportunity to read.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="305" /> I think the Minister is aware that some Ministers &mdash; the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs &mdash; circulate memorandum to Deputies some days in advance of the actual debate. Considering that this Health Estimate is pending for many days it ought to have been possible to circulate the memorandum to Deputies.  Perhaps that has been overlooked or perhaps I am wrong in my recollection that an assurance was given, but I would appreciate if the Minister would ensure that this reasonable request is granted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly give the Deputy that undertaking.  If it had occurred to me, I could have let the Deputy have the memoranda.  I will see that it will not happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure if it had occurred to me to ask for it the Minister and his officers would have made the memorandum available, because it does not contain Budget secrets which, by being disclosed, could cause consternation or alarm or give opportunities of profit to people.  I am grateful to the Minister for his assurance that we can look forward to this facility in future.</P>
      <P>We are extremely sorry in the Fine Gael benches that the Minister has not, in the course of his opening statement on the introduction of this vast Estimate, given any indication to the hard-pressed people of Ireland of some relief in the rates, which are asked to bear an excessive share of the cost of health services.  It is totally wrong to use rates as a form of financing 50 per cent of the health services.  The Minister says the State's contribution is between 54 and 58 per cent, but the reality is that, when all these services provided by health authorities are taken into account, the State's contribution is less than 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister was speaking I was endeavouring to locate a reference I have to indicate that in the largest health authority area in the country, Dublin, the State's contribution is significantly less than 50 per cent. Unfortunately, I was not able to work out my percentages because I found some figures only in the concluding <Col N="306" /> sentence of the Minister's statement, but I shall give the figures to the Minister so that he will see there is justification for what I say, that the State's contribution is not of the proportion the Minister believes it to be when all the medical and health services or quasi-medical services are taken into account.  I appear to have lost my statistics again but I shall come back to it before I conclude.</P>
    <P>It is easy enough to speak of maintaining the State's contribution at over 50 per cent when you deliberately exclude services which ought to be paid for by the State but which are now provided primarily for humanitarian reasons and have the effect of keeping elderly people particularly, handicapped and disabled people, out of costly institutions.  If local authorities and health authorities did not give the subsidies they are giving by way of domiciliary care, domiciliary nursing and financial support to incapable people at home, we would have a far greater clamour for admissions to institutions, and stays in institutions would be much longer than they are.  It is because the State is failing to give the necessary support in this area that the Minister can claim the State is making a larger contribution than it is, in fact, making.</P>
    <P>It is now over three years since the Government published a White Paper at the taxpayers' expense stating that the Government accepted that rates were not the proper form for the financing of health services and in which an undertaking was given that future development of the health services would not to any extent be paid for out of rates.  Over three years ago the Government undertook to prevent future increases in our rates attributable to health services, to maintain the contribution from rates towards health services at the figure which operated in 1965-66.  This undertaking has been disgracefully and immorally dishonoured&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to an extent which means that in the pending financial year ratepayers will be called upon to pay <Col N="307" /> anything from 8s. to 12s. in the £ more rates for health services than they paid three years ago &mdash; notwithstanding the Government's declaration that rates were not an appropriate form of raising this finance; notwithstanding the Government's undertaking not to ask people to pay that pending the completion by the Government of its examination of potential systems for financing the development of the health services.</P>
      <P>This is what is leading people to protest.  This is what is causing people to turn, not to Parliament, not to local authorities, but to the streets to protest at what they feel is the serious failure of their society to distribute justice to them.  People are justified in complaining about the excessively high contribution which the ratepayers are asked to pay towards health services in the coming financial year.  Fine Gael believe that it is wrong to be financing health services to this extent out of local taxation.  It is a system which cannot be defended.  Therefore, pending the introduction of a comprehensive modern health service based upon insurance contributions, a Fine Gael Government would transfer 75 per cent of the total cost of general and TB hospitals to the national Exchequer instead of levying as at present 50 per cent of the cost on the Exchequer and 50 per cent on the local authorities.  The effect of this reasonable measure, which Fine Gael believe to be the least that ought to be done, would be to reduce the contribution to health services from the rates by one-fifth.  That would mean a reduction in the rate demand for the coming financial year in all rating authorities of between 6s. and 9s. in the £.  This must be done.  Fine Gael will not say &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; to the Minister for Health or the Government if they do anything less than that in this coming financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever the Government may do, it will come too late.  We believe it is very wrong indeed to call upon health authorities to prepare their estimates in the autumn of the preceding year, to require health authorities to pass them to local authorities so that they in turn may comment upon them, and then to require that estimates be adopted and that demands be made on <Col N="308" /> rating authorities long in advance of any declaration by the Government of the assistance which it is prepared to give towards the financing of the health services.</P>
    <P>This is grossly irresponsible, hopelessly inefficient.  This is not the kind of planning and administration that we must have if Ireland is to survive in the highly competitive age in which we live. The Government should act in the same way as it expects private enterprise to act, with the same degree of efficiency and the same amount of forethought and planning and budgetary forecasting. The least we can expect from the Minister for Health is that, in each year before the estimates are prepared, the Government would give an indication of what would be available from the Exchequer towards the financing of health services.  We certainly think that, whatever about indications of that kind, Ministers for Health should give plenty of advance warning to health authorities of the statutory demands which are to be made upon them such as capitation rates for voluntary hospitals.  There has been some improvement this year in this respect, I am glad to say, although we are sorry that any extra demands were made at all.  At least we received some more information than we had last year and certainly at a time when it was possible to make provision for them in the preparation of estimates.</P>
    <P>There was a time in relation to health services when it was not a question of whether services would be provided or not but a question of how to pay for them, but now we have had a development in the last month where not only is the system of providing services being argued about but we are also being asked by the Minister to bring about substantial reductions in the services we are getting.</P>

      <P>The fact that they function at all is due less to the ingenuity and skill of the people operating them than to the goodness of God.  In such an atmosphere you cannot cause any reductions in estimates, substantial or otherwise, without cutting back the services. It is deplorable and a very sad reflection on the Government that they should be driven to such desperate straits as to insist upon substantial reductions in services which are accepted as being inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister tells us now that there was an indication that services were not to be reduced.  The Minister knows well that reductions could not be made without reductions in the services.  Knowing that, or assuming that he should have known it, he should not have written the letter.</P>
      <P>The truth is that most local authorities cannot make reductions.  They pared the estimates down to the very last possible penny in the closing months of 1968 and, rather than having estimates which are inflated and higher than necessary, most health authorities know now that the estimates which they prepared are grossly insufficient, particularly so after the Minister has made further statutory demands upon them which will increase their budgets to such an extent that they will be in deficit before the end of the current financial year. In such a situation, to talk of reductions is to ask for impossibilities without calling for reductions in the health services themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as we in Fine Gael are concerned, <Col N="310" /> in every health authority throughout the country we shall refuse to make any reductions because our complaint about expenditure on health is not the size of it, but that it is being charged to the wrong people and that a minority are being unfairly asked to pay for services from which most of them are excluded, a situation which is most unjust and which cannot, by any canon, be justified.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael plan for health services has been published for many years.  There is no need for me to detail it.  It has been debated frequently in the House; it has been presented to a Select Committee of the House and it has been available for public consumption. Within the last week, we had the Government adopting a report which was steered by Mr. Peter Kaim-Caudle, who is the expert in social matters, and I think it is significant that he has said that the Fine Gael criticism of the present system of health services is &mdash; and I quote from his book <i>Social Policy in the Irish Republic</i>&mdash;&ldquo;well founded and moderate.&rdquo; He says its proposals to reorganise the services are practical and well suited to Irish conditions. That was written three years ago.  Three years ago the Government accepted that they were financing the health services in the wrong way.  Three years ago they undertook not to use that wrong way to any greater extent in future.  What have we?  Still nothing in the nature of progress or change except the oft-repeated and now utterly disbelieved promise of the Minister to do something about it in the near future.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister can accuse me of being churlish when I say I cannot accept the declarations he makes here today that he is going to do something about it in the near future because he has said that so often.  He said it to the Ard Fheis in 1968 and his predecessor said it so often and it has been so dishonoured that we cannot accept it as having any validity, particularly at a time when we know that this Government is on its last legs.  It is a dying, ineffectual Government with no possibility of implementing any health legislation, even <Col N="311" /> if they were to introduce it now.  Even if the empty, shallow, oft-repeated and oft-broken promises were to be tackled, there would be no possibility of implementing the legislative proposals contained in the Bill, not that that would be any problem so far as the Minister's Party were concerned.  They acted similarly in 1953 when they left power without providing the means to implement the 1953 Health Act.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Minister would not behave in the same mean and suspicious fashion as did the Government of 1953, but I cannot see how he can, save by a miracle, now do otherwise.  He is, therefore, on the horns of a dilemma: either he continues in the pattern of the last three years to make promises, which he never fulfils, or he produces legislative proposals irresponsibly, without any hope or expectation that he will ever see the fulfilment of them or, indeed, that this Oireachtas will ever enact them because, even if a Bill were now to be introduced and even if it were to receive the goodwill of all Parties here and in the Seanad, there is little prospect of it being enacted by the Oireachtas before the Government go out of office.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to turn one section of our community against another, but it is important, I think, when we consider the method of financing the health services, that we should bear in mind how unfairly ratepayers and rent payers are being treated in urban areas.  There was a time when a ratepayer was a person of property and of independent means but today the ratepayer is everybody in the community who is the head of a household.  Even though he may not be the owner of the property, if he is the rated occupier he is required to pay the landlord's rates and the landlord makes sure that he passes on the burden of the rates on to the tenant. The Rent Restrictions Act, the Landlord and Tenant Acts, the Common Law, the ordinary practice of the free market, all these ensure that the landlords pass on all increases in rates on to rent payers.  Therefore, in any urban area &mdash; that is to say, any area governed by town commissioners or an urban district council &mdash; the people are required <Col N="312" /> to pay the full health levy while in rural areas, where there is exemption in respect of holdings under a rateable valuation of £20, the vast majority are not making any contribution at all in the form of rates towards health services.  In urban areas the ratepayer may be called upon to pay from 50 per cent to 55 per cent of the cost of the health services operated by health authorities while in areas outside most people are free.  The situation exists in which in rural Ireland the State is, in fact, paying over 80 per cent of the cost of the health services while in urban areas, and that means the little town with town commissioners, the State is paying no more than 55 per cent on average of what it accepts as health services.  But, in reality, it is paying no more than 45 per cent of the total expenses of the local health authority.</P>
    <P>This is discriminatory.  This is not impartial administration.  We do not for one moment begrudge the assistance given in rural areas where rates are concerned; goodness knows, most of the people who were paying rates in rural areas were paying them on their means of production, on one of the most important weapons in the creation of national wealth, and it was entirely wrong that they should have been called upon to pay such an excessive amount from the means they had for providing a livelihood for themselves, food for the community as a whole and valuable exports.  Despite all that, it is still unfair that we should have a situation in which one section of the community should be called upon to pay as much as 30 per cent more to health services.  If there is to be relief given, then I believe the time has now come for the Government to give real support and real subsidies in a very dramatic way towards health costs in urban communities.  The burden is virtually beyond the capacity of many to bear and the recently announced legislation, designed to allow local authorities to give a remission of rates to people of small incomes, is not a sufficient solution to the problem, particularly when that legislation provides that any remission so given must then be charged against other ratepayers within that local authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" /> It would be different if the legislation provided, as it does in Britain, that the State will make good the remission. That is not what is proposed here and the result, therefore, will be that any assistance given to people with low incomes can only be given by imposing their burden on their neighbours who, under some statutory provision or administrative rule, would be considered to be better off.  That would not be the cure for the principal injustice of paying for health services out of rates and that is the injustice whereby one-seventh of the community are asked to pay for services available, subject to a means test, to the whole community. That is all the more wrong when in many households, as we know, the member with the least to spend on his own personal pleasure &mdash; the bread-winner, the father &mdash; is the tenant.  He is the person who has the least luxury, the least easy living, as compared with other members of the household.  It is entirely wrong to continue to operate a system in which teenagers with handsome incomes, which they can spend primarily on pleasure, make no contribution towards health services and the rent payer and ratepayer is asked to pay for services for people who are deemed by law to be less well off than he himself may be.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest obligations that modern society has to consider is the new poor, the coming to the relief of those whom modern society is making poor, the people who are finding that their effort to provide themselves and their families with homes and all that homes connote is reaching beyond their capacity.  There are many families now so burdened with the cost of rates that food and clothing suffer.  That is entirely wrong when over one-third of the total rate cost is in relation to health services, health services from which most of them are excluded.</P>
    <P>Some 60 per cent, or more, of the increases in health charges in recent years is attributable to better conditions of service for medical, nursing and labouring staff in our institutions.  We all welcome the improvement in their standards and the removal of many of the onerous hardships under which they previously worked.  As a community, we must be prepared to pay good <Col N="314" /> incomes and to observe fair conditions of employment for doctors and nurses, and everyone working in the medical field.  Reasonable working conditions, good remuneration and adequate rewards are essential to the satisfaction of men in any occupation, and medicine is no exception even if it is a vocation which demands, as it does, higher standards and a greater degree of dedication than many other activities.</P>
    <P>It was, therefore, with some considerable disappointment that we learned recently that the Minister proposes to the medical profession, in relation to proposals which he has in mind for the re-organisation of the dispensary service, terms which would pay a doctor at what is called a basic rate for all services provided by him up to 11 p.m. and a special rate for after hour duty would come into operation after 11 o'clock only.  There is no other section of the community which is asked to work up to 11 o'clock at night, and over weekends, at basic rates.  I would metaphorically twist the Minister's arm to offer fairer terms to the medical profession.  Admittedly, doctors go out at 11 o'clock at night and much later.  Indeed, my own family doctor usually puts me last on his list of calls, which often means that the doorbell rings after midnight, and the door is not shut again until many hours later.</P>
    <P>It is unreasonable that the medical profession should be called upon to work such impossible hours.  That they have done it in the past has been due to the goodness of their Creator that has enabled them to keep going under conditions which anyone else would find insufferable.  Some years ago I was in the large city of Ballyfermot &mdash; in which the people are by statutory definition members of the working class people, or they would not be housed there and living there &mdash; when it was announced that the medical profession were going to ask for higher rates of pay for services performed after 6 p.m., a higher rate after 8 p.m., a higher rate after 10 p.m. and a higher rate after midnight.  Loud indignation was voiced at this outrageous proposal by the medical profession, and I was called upon as a public representative together with others who were there <Col N="315" /> to resist this because a person could not be blamed, and should not be taxed exorbitantly, for getting sick at a late hour of the night.</P>
    <P>I said then, and I say now, that doctors are entitled to be paid at a higher rate in respect of services performed by them at hours which are considered by ordinary people to be beyond the usual hours of work.  I argued that those members of the working class assembled in that hall&mdash; most of them were trade unionists&mdash; would not work those doctors' hours themselves without looking for bonus payments.  They agreed that that was so.  We in Fine Gael have argued for years that the answer to that is to introduce a system of national health based on the insurance principle so that a person would pay a small contribution every week while working and when they had an income so that, when their income was cut, or substantially reduced, or gone altogether, and when they were in need of medical attention, they would be able to command the best of medical attention at any hour of the day or night, and the community would pay the appropriate rate to the doctor for providing the service at whatever hour of the day or night it was provided.  I believe my audience accepted the basic fairness of my remarks that night which I now repeat, because they are the Fine Gael policy.  This is the only practical way in which we can give the medical and nursing professions what they deserve &mdash; the best of remuneration for the best of service and, at the same time, give the people the best of service with the least hardship.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us on other occasions that a survey which was conducted on behalf of his Department indicated that the average cost per household for medical care was 5/- per week.  The Minister and the Government and the Government White Paper have argued that this statistic indicates that medical care does not cause hardship to most people.  That is printed in extra heavy black print in the White Paper.  It is repeated in the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development, published last week.  The Minister repeated it again only a couple <Col N="316" /> of weeks ago when discussing the Fine Gael health motion.  That is Fianna Fáil thinking, that medical care does not cause hardship for most people.</P>
    <P>We see this statistic of 5/- a week as indicating the average cost per household for medical care, as proof not of what the Government are assuming but of the wisdom of the Fine Gael health approach because it indicates that a contribution of 5/- a week in respect of every household in the land would pay for the medical care which is needed by all the families in the land.  If that 5/- were borne by the employer, and the State, and the worker, the burden falling on any one of the contributors would be small indeed, and there would certainly be far less pain, worry, hardship and loss regularly suffered by those families and those individuals who suffer illness or handicap of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>This 5/- per household may appear to be a small figure, but there might be nine families which would not pay 5/-at all, and the tenth family would be paying £2 10s because it might be only one in every ten families in any street which would have medical costs to meet in any year.  This £2 10s to that family would be a real hardship, a real burden, and a real cause of anxiety. This indicates the utter foolishness of the approach of the Minister and his colleagues on the whole question of health.  Instead of accepting that the proper thing is to spread the burden so that no one suffers hardship, they spread the hardship because of a notional statistic of 5/- per family.  The thing to do is to spread the cost.  If you spread the cost you remove the anxiety.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement the Minister acknowledged that he is amazed at the degree of ignorance in our community about entitlement to health services.  I share the Minister's disappointment that people are not aware of many of the services to which they are entitled under the present inadequate and unsatisfactory health services we have.  I am sure Deputy Kyne will support me in Waterford and that Deputy O'Hara from Mayo will support me when I say that in many health authorities a significant part of the increase in the cost of the health services <Col N="317" /> in recent years has been due to an increase in knowledge on the part of people of their entitlement to health services.</P>
    <P>We have more people coming in now making demands on the health services because they are gradually becoming aware of what they are entitled to. The increase in the number of domiciliary workers, of social workers, the increase in home nursing, in the number of voluntary groups caring for the aged, the going out among the public of many good sisters and other religious who, in olden days, kept to their convents and monasteries, have meant that people are now becoming aware of the entitlement they have and they are making calls upon the health services and the health services are very properly, to the best of their ability, answering those calls.  This, certainly, in the domiciliary end of health costs, as far as I can calculate, means an increase of between 10 to 15 per cent per annum due entirely to an increase in knowledge.</P>
    <P>This should alarm us.  We should feel worried and ashamed that for so long we have had, and still have, pools of untouched poverty, groups in our community that are living in unrelieved, unacknowledged and unknown misery. These cases are plentiful even if scattered. These are the cases in which people through neglect, lack of communication with neighbours, through malnutrition, and through decay have become disinterested, careless about themselves and have become ignorant. These are the people we must seek out and we cannot say our society is just and Christian if we leave the ignorant, the ill and the disabled aside because they do not know their rights.</P>
    <P>It is vitally necessary that we seek these people out and come to their aid. Again and again old people, disabled people, mentally deficient people cross the thresholds of our institutions and are examined and found to be undernourished through neglect.  It is found that they are in this state unnecessarily; that there were available, even under the unsatisfactory services we have, financial supports and other forms of assistance and nursing which they could have received but they did not know anything about them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="318" /> The tragedy is that the State has not yet accepted its full measure of responsibility towards these people. I am glad that the Minister &mdash; here I wish to pay tribute to him for his contribution in this area &mdash; has initiated a scheme whereby substantial sums will be made available by the Exchequer to health authorities to provide the necessary care outside of institutions for these people who would never go into institutions if properly looked after outside.  Particularly in urban areas, there is now considerable pressure from the community, from voluntary bodies and from local authority members themselves for the creation of old folks clubs and the provision of chiropody services and other services of that kind.  The Dublin Health Authority find that in an area where they have an old folks club operating, either through some voluntary institution or under the direct control of the health authority, the number of admissions of old people from such an area into old folks institutions is substantially reduced.</P>

In the winter months every year from November to March and April there was always a tremendous, sudden rise in the graph of entries of old people into old folks institutions in Dublin.  This year notwithstanding the very hard weather in February, the rise was not as dramatic as in other years.  We attribute this primarily to the great increase in the care of old people which was instituted for humanitarian reasons but which has conferred immense economic and financial benefit on the health authority, the ratepayer and the State because the number admitted to institutions has been significanly cut.</P>
      <P>We must get a realisation on the Minister's part and that of his advisers that it is better to spend £3 on a person to keep him out of an institution even if that is £3 added to what is now given to him.</P>

      <P>It is better to spend that than to spend £7 or £8 or £20 looking after the same person in an institution. We know the Minister is carrying on a battle with the Department of Finance to get State recognition of the importance of this approach.  We can only hope that sooner rather than later the Department, if not motivated by humanitarian reasons, will at least see the wisdom of giving even greater encouragement to the care of people in their own homes outside of costly institutions because it is only by so doing that we shall be able to grapple with this problem which will otherwise continue to grow.  This is something that needs to be tackled irrespective of the source from which we are to finance our health services in the future.  It is no easy thing, we realise, to plan health services to meet the needs of modern society and we think we should be spending more money on social research and should not be leaving everything to a kind of hit and miss attitude.</P>
      <P>In an urban area like our capital city, the last 10 years particularly have seen the creation of a new problem caused by the separation of mature children from their aged parents.  In the days of the old tenements, which, thank God, are gone, if the granny lived upstairs her children probably lived, if not downstairs, in the same street or the same parish.  They were all near at hand so that when the young mother was having another child, granny was available, if not to assist at the birth, at least to look after the young children while mother was away in the maternity hospital.  When granny was sick the daughter or son or somebody else was near at hand and able to attend the granny without leaving the grandchildren bereft of parental supervision and assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, here we ordain that granny must live in Crumlin and her children, when housed, must live in Ballymun, eight or ten miles separated by an urban snarl which takes up to two hours to get through.  We are creating new social problems.  We are by that kind of activity driving into institutions both granny, the grandchildren and mother probably as well who has not got the assistance of her mother and <Col N="320" /> in many cases is suffering from what is now called nerves.  In olden days people did not suffer so much from nerves because the family were closer together but this problem is a growing one and is beginning to have a significant reaction in some areas of hospitalisation in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There was a time when, for instance, children, who suffered from gastro-enteritis, came mainly from that section of the community who are classified as being in the lower-income group&mdash; people whose standards of hygiene, perhaps, would not be as high as better educated people, people who lived in overcrowded, insanitary conditions, through no fault of their own.  In recent times that trend has been reversed and entrants to the fever hospitals mainly for gastro-enteritis are related not so much to insanitary conditions, overcrowding, or to people said to be from the lower classes as, and significantly so, to families far removed from relations and friends they can contact. The public administrator, remote in the corridors of bureaucracy, does not realise how much one's neighbour is a stranger in the city.  Often the last person you can call on is the person living next door.  People who are reared in an environment different from that of the urban areas would find that kind of thing difficult to understand.  Unfortunately, it is only too true and people in urban areas often have to travel for miles to get the kind of help which at one time was available simply by shouting upstairs or shouting downstairs or sending a child down the street to bring some sister, brother or grandparent to lend a hand in time of need.</P>
    <P>There ought to be a closer relationship between our health authorities and our housing authorities so that this kind of difficulty can be avoided.  We must cease regarding how we can answer housing needs by putting families into so many cubic feet, no matter where the cubic feet happen to be.  That is what we are doing and that is having a reaction, which is now only beginning, which could snowball into requiring costly institutions and medical services as a substitute for family care and family contributions which can be provided in a more unified and a close <Col N="321" /> knit society than that which is certainly developing in our urban areas.</P>
    <P>One debasing aspect of our present health services, which again the Minister has acknowledged in his opening statement, is the obligation on people to prove their entitlement.  Services are available to people not as a right but on proof of inadequacy of income, on proof of suffering from some serious, substantial, chronic and continual disease.  Those are things which pain people to have to prove.  People who are habitually poor and who have never known better will find it easier to operate under such a system than somebody who has known better days and who on account of illness finds that the burden is becoming too costly to bear.  The Minister has acknowledged in his opening statement, and quite rightly so, that many people who need to be assisted are not aware of their rights until an emergency arises. Then when they seek to prove their entitlement they immediately arouse suspicion in the minds of their investigators as to why they did not apply earlier.  The health services we have encourage the kind of ward healing which His Lordship the Most Reverend Dr. Harty, Lord Bishop of Killaloe, had to speak about at the weekend.</P>
    <P>We have a system in relation to health services which is unique in western Europe, a system which encourages, in fact, in some cases obliges, people to seek the assistance of public representatives in order to obtain medical services and particularly at a time of financial squeeze, such as we now have in relation to health services, the good administrators are now inclined to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to people who are looking for medical card assistance.  In fact, the practice is, in many cases almost automatically, unless the case is a <i>prima facie</i> one for giving help to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; and people who are rejected in such a manner then tend to come to their public representatives to get advice or in most cases to see if the public representatives can do better than the applicant in person.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of system which leads people to believe that rights are not available unless they are processed by a TD, that services are <Col N="322" /> denied to them unless a TD or a county councillor applies for them.  In truth, what usually happens when a public representative is called in to assist the applicant is that the public representative deals more sympathetically with the applicant than the official who probably received a letter which only told a small fraction of the story.  The unfortunate applicant has to give the family circumstances, indicate the illness from which he is suffering or from which his relations suffer.  I am quite certain that public representatives have often been shocked to discover the near poverty and destitution of people who have gone to them.  This is caused by their paying for medical care for which they need never have paid.  This means in most cases that the public representative simply advises a person as to the kind of information that ought to be given to the health authority.  He is able to assist the person making the case and the public representative's function is often to present a better case than the applicant himself by giving fuller information. All that should not be necessary.  We believe there is some validity in what the Bishop of Killaloe said that it is wrong to continue a system which leads people to believe their rights are not available to them unless their application is processed by a public representative.</P>

      <P>I am not going to analyse and discuss the complete statement of his Lordship.  I do not believe it would be helpful.  I believe a considerable amount of it was not in accordance with the fact but he was complaining as he saw it as an ordinary individual.  He was giving his impression of the effect which the operation of the system had on the outside world.  If you continue to operate a health service which requires people to invoke the aid of public representatives, it is not unreasonable for people to see it in the light in which His Lordship saw it last weekend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my duty to raise this matter on the Adjournment, even if it may cause some inconvenience, but we must bear in mind our responsibilities in this matter.</P>
      <P>I am very closely related to the people concerned in this dispute and, for the Minister's benefit, I wish to let him know briefly of the hundreds of people who are directly involved in the lay-off in this industry which is completely monopolised and of the indirect connections that were involved in the industry.  Bearing these things in mind, it is about time something was done or that a full detailed investigation was held by the Minister, particularly because of the hardships involved on account of the lockout of these workers.  Eleven men were involved who had no connection whatsoever with the dispute in question but because the chief of the firm in question was a member of this octopus organisation &mdash; the FUE &mdash; and because he was closely connected with it, these people were involved.</P>
      <P>That is unjust and unfair; in fact, it is inhuman and I would go so far as to say that it is bordering on illegality.  These men got seven days protective notice and when the seven days were up they had to get out; naturally, their fellow-workers, skilled and unskilled, had a duty to respect the livelihoods of these men and, consequently, they put a picket on the premises of Cement Ltd, in Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were firms engaged in this dispute who were in keen competition with overseas industries and who were trying to export and who had orders and obligations outside of this country also.  Because of the closure of certain industries in this country, advantage was taken of the wholesale dumping which was carried on to the detriment of some of our local industries but Cement Ltd knew that no matter what happened they would not lose custom because they had no competition and they took advantage of this fact to help to crush the demands which have been now acceded to. They also took advantage of the position <Col N="324" /> to ridicule Ministers and the Labour Court as we saw in this morning's papers.</P>
    <P>I do not know what service the FUE is giving to this country because one cannot possibly legislate nationally for any particular industry.  These things must be done locally but Cement Ltd took advantage of this and held the country up to ransom.  Were it not for the fact that we had sensible people in the city of Limerick, organised craftsmen, who were prepared to take their time and who were not in any way rushed into making decisions, this strike would have continued.  However, because of the goodwill and the commonsense of the people, sanity prevailed, as the Minister had requested that it should, and pickets were withdrawn from Sunday night.</P>
    <P>The FUE and Cement Ltd have refused on many occasions to negotiate with these men but the men bore this with patience and intelligence and they did not rush into any rash decision. They met this afternoon and, while a final decision has not been reached, it is expected that such will be reached some time tonight.  At the moment, the matter is being discussed in Limerick, the men having gone there tonight from Dublin.</P>
    <P>The case I wish to put to the Minister is that these things should not be allowed to continue and people who have a monopoly in any particular line ought not to put a lock on their gates, as it were, in so far as the workers are concerned.  In view of the hardship that has been caused to the workers, skilled and unskilled, in this industry, I am asking the Minister to have a full and detailed inquiry into the action of this firm with particular reference to compensation to these men for the loss of work involved.  If the Minister will assure me that he will set up an inquiry and if he will institute a full and detailed investigation with particular reference to Cement Limited and the action of the management there, I will be happy and the people concerned in Limerick will be happy because we know that our case is right, we know that there has been victimisation of these people and that they had not hand, act or part in this <Col N="325" /> dispute.  There are bigger things involved. If the Minister does this now, not alone will he be setting a headline for others but he will bring to heel the certain employers, whom he mentioned here last week in his speech, that they should show responsibility to their workers and that they should treat their workers as human beings like themselves, with their own domestic lives and all the troubles that go with them.  By doing what I am suggesting he will show the country at large that never again will we have a repetition of what happened in Limerick and Drogheda.</P>

      <P>The information I have on the case is that the factory concerned employs 65 maintenance craftsmen and all except 11 of those are covered by a house agreement.  This remaining 11 are not covered by the house agreement for various reasons, such as the fact that they are not long enough in employment and not established.  At the outbreak of the maintenance strike the 11 men not covered by the house agreement were given one week's protective notice and were let go from their employment on Friday, 7th February. Work continued at the factory on the 8th and 9th February and on Monday, 10th February the maintenance workers, who are, in fact, covered by the house agreement, did not report for work and pickets were placed on the factory.  This resulted, excluding the clerical workers, in a work force of 416 people being out of work.  The FUE maintain that the severance of the 11 maintenance men was part of the general maintenance strike and its implications. The union side maintain this was a separate issue.  They maintain that the dismissals were a separate issue.  The picketing continued throughout the strike and it was continued to <Col N="326" /> be treated as part of the general maintenance strike by the FUE.  I understand that letters to the various unions repeated in writing that when the strike was fixed and the pickets withdrawn the craftsmen would be reemployed immediately.</P>
      <P>This morning my information was that the general workers resumed work at midnight, 10th-11th March, and the following morning, after the lifting of the pickets, the company contacted the 11 maintenance workers to say that work was available for them and five of them were working this morning with the other maintenance workers. It seems to me that everybody is back apart from anyone who may be sick or not otherwise available.  The FUE, representing the company, is having meetings with the unions at present.</P>
      <P>This is one of the many irrational and unorthodox causes of hardship.  I do not know whether everyone has a full idea of the total hardship caused by the various effects of the maintenance strike.  I think, too, that it was regarded as a free-for-all battle and those who regarded it as such made full use of the &ldquo;free&rdquo; part of the idea. I am satisfied that to investigate any one area would not give a balanced view.  I have decided that the whole maintenance dispute should be the subject of a searching inquiry which would have to be comprehensive and cover all areas involved.  I hope to set it up to-morrow or after and I do it with the intention of exposing to everybody concerned the ill-effects of the abuses of freedom in this type of free-for-all behaviour.  The only balanced way is to examine the whole situation comprehensively. Perhaps then we may gain something from such an examination. I have hopes that we will.</P>
