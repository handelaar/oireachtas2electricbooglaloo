    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (2).</P>
      <P>Section 9 is the one which makes provision for the introduction of a ten shilling piece and for the elimination of the ten shilling note.  It was suggested by Deputy Briscoe on the Second Stage that the ten shilling note should be retained and I should like to support this through this amendment and to have some discussion on this point in the House.  We know from the introduction of the ten shilling coin arising out of the 1916 celebrations that a ten shilling coin is not readily acceptable in this country.  There may, of course, have been particular reasons why the introduction of the coin at that time and of the particular coin was less successful than might have been the case otherwise.  The coin, although attractive in appearance, had certain characteristics not associated in the public mind with a coin and indeed perhaps it had been designed to look more like a medal.  It certainly did look rather like a medal.  This may have contributed to the fact that they were not much used.  However, think I am right in saying to the Minister concerned with this that a very large portion of the total number were not in fact issued and had to be melted down.  We have this evidence of public reaction to the ten shilling coin issued in those circumstances.</P>
      <P>Knowing that is the case, while I would not necessarily object to the introduction of a ten shilling coin to supplement the ten shilling note as a further experiment&mdash;a coin perhaps designed so that it would be more likely to receive public acceptance&mdash;I feel that to proceed to eliminate the ten shilling note as proposed here is something that we ought not to do without further experiment.  We do know that there is a public reaction against a ten shilling coin and at this point in time a clear public preference of a very definite character for the ten shilling note.  I do not consider that it is our function to impose a pattern of currency on the public different from that which they require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="795" /> On the Second Stage the Minister suggested that his justification for the introduction of the ten shilling coin&mdash; although not of course his justification for eliminating the ten shilling note&mdash; was that this coin would be useful for various kinds of coin-operated machines. He was clearly in some difficulty when pressed from this side of the House to state what kind of machines would take these coins because most of the things which are now sold through coin-operated machines are things, the total value of which is less than ten shillings.  While, of course, with the inflation of money values we will no doubt see a move towards the point where a packet of cigarettes will cost ten shillings, this is unlikely to happen in the near future, we hope. In fact, it is difficult to see what kind of products the ten shilling coin will be used for in coin-operated machines in the near future on any extensive scale. It seems that that particular argument is a very weak one.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that ten shilling notes are relatively expensive. It would be useful for the purpose of this debate, if he told us something about the relative cost of ten shilling notes and ten shilling coins and made at least some attempt at an economic justification for the procedure outlined. Even if there is some saving involved, I am by no means certain that we should proceed to do this at the expense of eliminating the ten shilling note. Accordingly, I should like the Minister to reconsider this decision.  I should also like to ask him to consider whether it might not be more to the point to consider moving towards a five shilling coin rather than a ten shilling coin.  However, that is another matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear the Minister's views on this and to hear what is the exact economic justification for his decision and how he justifies it in the light of public reaction to the ten shilling coin that was introduced three years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I find that I have no option but to oppose this amendment. I should like to explain to the House <Col N="796" /> that, in my view and in the view of practically everybody concerned in an expert or specialised way with this problem, the arguments in favour of a ten shilling coin as against a ten shilling note are overwhelming.</P>
      <P>The first point I want to make is that it would be, I think, very undesirable to have a ten shilling note and a ten shilling coin.  It is very bad monetary practice to have a note and a coin of the same denomination.  It leads to all sorts of difficulties and inconvenience. The overwhelming response from the general public and from trade and commercial organisations was in favour of a coin rather than a ten shilling note. Therefore, if we decide, as I think we must in all rationality, that we should not have two, then the only remaining decision we have to make is whether we have a coin or a note.  The response in favour of the coin was almost overwhelming.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should begin with the question of machines.  There is no doubt that from the point of view of the trader the coin has all the advantages. It can be used much more effectively and efficiently in cash registers and all the trend these days is towards vending machines and towards a more and more sophisticated type of vending machine.  In many countries today it is possible to get meals costing ten shillings and more out of these vending machines, and we can anticipate that this type of machine will increase.  Even if the particular item which the machine dispenses does not cost ten shillings these modern machines are all geared to give change; so that, if the article costs four shillings or five shillings, the ten shilling coin is still very useful because one can put in a ten shilling coin and the machine dispenses the article in question and gives one change of one's ten shillings. From that point of view it is very likely indeed that there will be more and more machines which will be suited to the use of a ten shilling coin and for which a ten shilling note, of course, would be completely useless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point is that from the point of view of familiarisation of the general public with the new decimalisation coinage there is considerable advantage <Col N="797" /> in having a ten shilling coin. You will have your £1 note as your principal unit but then below the value of a £ all your new pence denominations will be in the form of coins if you adopt a 50p or ten shilling coin as distinct from a note.  From that point of view there is also an advantage in having a coin.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the question of expense and this is a very formidable factor.  The ten shilling coin, or 50p coin as it will be, lasts approximately 50 years, and even then the metal in the coin is recoverable and can be used again.  The ten shilling note has an average life of about five months and, when one bears in mind that there are about 6½ million ten shilling notes in circulation in this country at the moment, this means that about 14 million new ten shilling notes must be issued every year, and of course the old ones must be withdrawn. I have not readily available the precise figure as to what the cost of that is.  I have asked to be supplied with it and I may be able to give it to the Deputy before the debate concludes. Anyway, it is a formidable factor.  All in all the arguments point conclusively, as I say, in favour of a 50 new pence coin as distinct from a ten shilling note or a 50 new pence note.</P>
    <P>There is another factor.  As I said, it is bad monetary practice to have in circulation at any given moment a coin and a note of the same denomination. It does not take any great imagination to visualise the difficulties which a situation like that brings about.  If that sort of thing is bad in normal circumstances, or is inconvenient in normal circumstances, it is particularly to be avoided in a situation where you are changing over from one system of coinage to another.  The ordinary man in the street and the general public have enough changes to contend with in the change-over, without the additional difficulty of having two separate things of the same value, in other words, a coin and a note of the same denomination.</P>
    <P>I am not at all deterred by the experience we had with regard to the 1916 commemorative coin because I do not think the general public ever accepted it as a coin.  It was so clearly <Col N="798" /> commemorative that it was never really looked upon by the general public as anything but a medal or a commemorative token.  I do not think that need influence us in this particular regard. These, a Cheann Comhairle, are the arguments which compel me to oppose this amendment and I ask the House to reject it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the Minister's point in not wanting to have a ten shilling note and a ten shilling coin but he said it would be easier to segregate the money in a cash register.  I disagree completely.  It would be far better to have a ten shilling note than to have another coin to be added to the coins already in the register.  This would be far handier and 100 per cent of the retailers would tell the Minister this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not said so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Any of them with any experience will tell the Minister this.  There is no doubt that this is what they would prefer.  At the moment they would prefer to get a ten shilling note than to get more coins because it can be segregated and the set-up of the machine is laid out accordingly.</P>
      <P>The Minister also mentioned that 10s machines are used for food.  In the case of any I have seen in England or on the Continent they would not be for 10/- coins; they would be for money of the same value.  They are on a smaller basis.  They are used with a sandwich tray.  The occasional establishment has tried out dearer machines and they have not worked.  I should like to see the Minister himself going into the Shelbourne or somewhere else and putting 10s into a box to get a meal from it.  He also mentions the case where you put in a coin to get change but these change-giving machines are so costly they would never be used except in a gambling saloon.  It would not pay anybody to install them except in a gambling saloon or something of that type.  I do not think these answers can be accepted at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Belton has considerable experience of the retail trade and is entitled to his views.  All I <Col N="799" /> can say is that what he puts forward as his view of these matters is not borne out by the organisations representing the different trades and commercial interests. Of course, he is totally wrong about the suggestion that the 10s coin &mdash;from now on I must, I think, refer to it as the 50 new pence coin, since we must all begin thinking in these new terms&mdash;will not be used because this coin will almost certainly come into very extensive use in machines of all sorts.  I am ignoring Deputy Fitz-Gerald's suggestion that continual erosion of the value of money will bring it into even more extensive use than we visualise at present.</P>
      <P>I was thinking, when Deputy Belton was speaking, of places like the RDS, racecourses and many other places to which the general public have access and where entrance fees and other things cost in the region of 10s and where coin machines will be introduced more and more extensively in future.  I am quite certain, and I am fortified in this by expert opinion, that both in commerce and in trading, in shops and public houses and elsewhere, cash machines of a new, advanced, sophisticated type will use this coin to a very considerable extent and more and more vending machines and machines of the admission type will also use it.  On the ground of usability, apart from any others I have mentioned.  I think that the arguments are very much in favour of a coin.  From some calculations I was doing a very rough estimate of the cost of the ten shilling note at the moment is in the region of £80,000 to £100,000 per year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am all on the Minister's side in this matter, but for a long time during the discussion the Minister evaded the issue.  He did come to it eventually when he spoke about the erosion of the value of money. Already, this new 10s coin is worth somewhere between what a 2s piece or florin and a half-crown was worth before the war.  Nobody felt that these were enormously big coins.  When the memorial coin came out many felt we were not accustomed to a 10s coin, a sizeable coin, quite apart from the reason which the Minister gave and with which I also agree.  The truth is&mdash; and the Minister knows it as well as I do&mdash;that, whatever merit or demerit may have been in the thought that went into this Bill, there was certainly provision for the future in regard to what will happen to the value of money. If it continues to go at the rate it is going for the past 12 months, in no time at all the new 10s coin will be only the equivalent of 1s before the war.  Even before the war, a young lad felt happier with a tip of 2s rather than 1s.  He did not feel he was a half&mdash;millionaire if he got a 2s piece.</P>
      <P>On the whole, I am with the Minister. To be fair, he did eventually advert to the real reason, but in <i>pianissimo.</i> He did not want to over-emphasise it.  We really have no option in the matter.  I do not think there is much in the Minister's point that it does not serve to have a coin and a note of the same value circulating together. I do not travel abroad very much but one does meet them everywhere&mdash;notes and coins of the same value.  On the whole, for simplicity, there is much to be said for the Minister's point of view.  Certainly, looking to the future&mdash;which the party of reality is always doing&mdash;I am all in favour of the Minister's view on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put <Col N="801" /> a couple of points to the Minister arising out of his reply.  First, he mentioned that many organisations favoured this.  Would he tell the House which of the leading industrial and distributive organisations either favoured the introduction of the 10s coin or favoured also adopting the 10s note?  I do not think we can just take it from the Minister that all sorts of bodies are in favour of it.  We should be told which bodies are in favour (a) of producing a coin and (b) of also dropping the 10s note.  Perhaps he would give us a list of bodies like RGDATA, light industries and so on, bodies that are primarily concerned with this matter, and tell us what their views were.  Secondly, I should like him to tell us something about experience elsewhere.  It is my impression that in most other countries notes are used for units of currency of purchasing power much less than ten shillings and that we and Britain may be rather out of line in this respect in our practice. Would he tell us something about the position in other countries?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister in which countries in Europe a comparable situation exists where coins are substituted for notes of up to the equivalent value of our 10s.  I should like to know from him where, in fact, the largest coin is in circulation and where there is a coin larger than the equivalent of our half crown.  He has told us that what is proposed here is in line with practice elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what I said.  I said that, although it was bad monetary practice, it exists in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the proposal that we shall have no paper unit to the purchasing power of less than the equivalent of the £ in this <Col N="802" /> country and that coins will run up to the value of 10s or 11s.  I say that is not the case elsewhere and I should like the Minister to tell us what the practice is in relation to such countries as France, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Italy.  What is the value, in equivalent terms, of the smallest note at present in those countries, at the current exchange rates?  We need that information.  The Minister said it is bad monertary practice to have the two units of currency side by side&mdash;paper and coin&mdash; that it would lead to all sorts of inconvenience. Later on he said this would be aggravated by certain other matters.  &ldquo;Bad monetary practice&rdquo; is a very impressive phrase, but what does it mean.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I press the Minister for an explanation of what he means by &ldquo;bad monetary practice&rdquo;.  Perhaps also the Minister would list for us the sorts of inconveniences that would arise. I cannot see them.  It has been said that it would be a bad thing if the changeover to coin from note coincided with the change in currency.  Of course, we are familiar with noties at the moment and what the Minister is proposing to do is to substitute for existing coins a new coin of the same value in certain cases but with a different denomination.  The change to the equivalent of the 2s piece will not create any problems for us but it would be very helpful in the changeover if during the period of the changeover we kept the orange-coloured 10s note as being equivalent to the 50 pence piece. The familiar orange-coloured note would link our minds with the 50 new pence.  My suggestion is that, although you would have the coin as well, you would still keep the old paper 10s note.  Otherwise the change will be difficult for people to take.  I should like the Minister's comment on that.</P>

      <P>The question of vending machines has been dealt with adequately by Deputy Belton.  I smiled a little at the Minister's comments in this matter&mdash;at the thought that places where coins are mostly in circulation are at rececourses, the RDS and so forth.  The Minister may have occasion to visit such places.</P>

      <P>I gave up going to race meetings 20 years ago because, having no car, I got wet and I lost money, a very unpleasant experience. My point here is that our coinage should be related to the ordinary needs of ordinary people&mdash;the people who do not go to the RDS except, perhaps, once a year to the Spring Show or the Horse Show, and who do not go to racecourses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the Minister's reference to racecourses is an irrelevancy and a red herring.  On the question of the erosion of money values, though I sympathise with Dr. O'Donovan's views, this is a continuous process which has become more rapid in the last couple of years.  However, on average it takes from 18 to 20 years for the value of money to be halved.  I was fortunate enough to get married when the cost of living index was initiated in 1947 and it does not require any great mathematical calculation for me to estimate the decline in the value of money.  The index was then 100 and it is now 210. At the present rate of inflation, it takes from 18 to 20 years for the value of money to halve.  Therefore, for the 10s to reach the value of half a crown would take 30 years.  Therefore, though I sympathise with Dr. O'Donovan, what we must consider is the value of money now, not in a generation hence.  Perhaps I am being <Col N="804" /> hopeful in thanking that the Government may be able to slow down the rate of money erosion because in the past few years they have let it get out of control.</P>
      <P>There is another matter which we must consider while dealing with the question of simultaneous use of notes and coins.  We cannot dismiss the reaction there has been to the 10s coin during the past couple of years.  It may be said that it was because it resembled a medal, but if it had the merit the Minister attributes to it, it would have been more widely used. The emphatic rejection of it should be considered here.</P>

      <P>In this matter, it is not so much my opinion that its important. Rather is it the expert evidence which has been gathered together by those whose responsibility it is to study these matters.  As I said earlier, the overwhelming opinion both of monetary experts and those engaged in trade and commerce is in favour of the coin.  I have been asked to indicate from what source this opinion derives in the main. Perhaps I should, first of all, satisfy Deputy Paddy Belton by telling him that the two main bodies in the public house trade&mdash;the Irish Vintners Federation and the Irish Grocers and Vintners Association&mdash;are in favour of the coin.  Other large bodies such as the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and the Council of the Federation of Trade Associations, are also in favour. Not alone are the Federation of Trade Associations in favour of a coin but they have assured us that their inquiries indicate clearly that the whole distributive trade strongly favour a coin rather than a note.  I should qualify that by saying that they did not say all the trade were in favour but that the distributive trade associations definitely were.  There is no argument as to what the trade wants.  People engaged in commerce and industry want a coin.  They are sensible, practical people.  With all due respect, Deputy FitzGerald is rather like a small pinkeen trying to swim against the great flowing river of public opinion.</P>

      <P>I do not want to keep on saying where 10s coins would be used.  It does not require much imagination to see where things are going in this matter.  The use of coins in vending machines, cash register machines and so on will be coming more and more into public use.  Very recently I remember seeing about a pump where petrol was dispensed on the basis of a coin vending machine, and, of course a 10s coin would be quite useful in a case like that.  Deputy FitzGerald and I could keep swopping debating points, but the technical expert opinion is in favour of a coin, the trade associations are in favour of a coin, I am in favour of a coin, and I think that ends it.</P>

      <P>The Minister is now talking about a coin versus a note, whereas this dilemma is one which he is forcing on the House, not us.  We are not proposing that you must choose one or the other.  The representations he has told us about appear, if I understood him correctly, to relate to a false dilemma: &ldquo;Look, boys, you can have a coin or a note.  You cannot have both.  Which will you have?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It is quite possible I made a mistake, but I do not think so.  What I put down was an amendment to delete subsection (2) which says: &ldquo;Upon the issue under this Act of coins having a denomination of fifty new pence, the Central Bank shall cease to issue under section 45 (1) of the Currency Act, 1927, legal tender notes having a denomination of 10s.&rdquo; I have said nothing against coins at all in the amendment.  I have made certain arguments here to probe the issue, but fundamentally the amendment we are discussing is one to drop the 10s note.</P>

      <P>That is a great help. The Minister is, therefore, not going to give us very long to enjoy having both. We are talking about the decision to have no more 10s notes.  That is what the amendment is about.  I am sorry if the debate has gone on to a different subject altogether on the other side of the House.  That is not my fault.  I made my position clear from the beginning. What we are talking about is whether the note should be kept and it is relevant to that to say whether we think the coin will be a success.  Let us decide to keep the 10s note for an experimental period; if the public change over to the Minister's coin all will be well, and if the note shows sings of going out of use and the people prefer the coin, then after an appropriate time in the future the note can be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I want this House not to require that, upon the introduction of the 50 new pence coin, the 10s note shall then be withdrawn.  I do not see why we must drop the 10s note immediately the coin is introduced, and nothing the Minister says convinces me of this.  He said it is bad monetary practice.  I asked him what is bad monetary practice, and he has not answered.  He said all sorts of inconvenience would result from the continued issue of the 10s note for a period following the introduction of the coin. I asked him that what sort of inconvenience and he has not named one.  I do not understand why the Minister is against the 10s note.  Surely in any coinage system it should be possible for people to have a choice; to continue to issue the note for a period of months.  If it is seen that the coin is preferred then the note can be withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment simply deletes the requirement that the Minister must withdraw the 10s note immediately upon the issue of the coin.  I would be quite prepared, if the Minister would prefer an alternative amendment, to change the wording of his subsection to read that &ldquo;the Central Bank may withdraw the 10s note subsequent to the issue of the coin&rdquo; and leave it open to them to have an experimental period.  All I want is to ensure that they would not be prevented from issuing a 10s note for an experimental period after the coin has been introduced.  I think the Deputy will agree that that is a reasonable proposal.</P>

I would like the Minister to tell us in what way is it bad monetary policy to have both for a period and why he thinks this would aggravate the change. It seems to me it would facilitate it.  I also want the cost of the two.  The ten shilling notes are costing us £80,000 a year.  What would the coins cost averaged over a period of years?  It may be less, but let us not condemn without knowing what the coins will cost.  What is the initial cost of the coins and what is estimated to be the annual cost of issuing thereafter?  Presumably someone has made an estimate. I can hardly believe that the Central Bank and the Department of Finance have made this change in policy without finding out whether it would cost more or less.  I would ask the Minister to give us that estimate of cost and explain to us the bad monetary practice involved in having for a period the ten shilling note as well as the ten shilling coin.</P>

      <P>There should, I think, be an option open to the Central Bank in this Regard, but I am equally conscious that the annual depreciation in money runs roughly around 3.2 per cent since 1956 and, bearing that in mind, one can appreciate the concern of the Minister to ensure that money values and money barter reforms remain in their true balanced value for the future and, indeed, bearing in mind that the particular measure introduced by the Minister is one that will not come in for a considerable time ahead, I think the approach on his part is, by and large, sensible and reasonable.  Nevertheless, in the transition period, during which there can be a certain amount of public anxiety at the withdrawal of the ten shilling note, there should, I think, be a period of gradual transition and, accordingly, I support the amendment of the Bill in the manner suggested by Deputy FitzGerald.</P>

I believe from all the advise available to me and from the expert information to which I have access that it is not a good thing, even in normal circumstances, to have a note and a coin of the same denomination. I further think that in the circumstances of the changeover to decimal currency we must try to keep the problems with which the public mind will be confronted down to a minimum and, for both these reasons, I think the right thing to do is, early on, at the beginning of next year, to bring in the 50 new pence coin and, as quickly as possible, substitute it for the 10s note and, indeed, so far as we can, to have the 10s note completely replaced by the 50 new pence coin before the changeover begins.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a point on this which is relevant to the amendment I have on section 3.  This section says that, in addition to the shares held by him in Aerlínte by virtue of section 2 of the Act of 1966, the Minister for Finance may subscribe for further shares of any class of Aerlínte to an amount not exceeding £10 million. I was in doubt, faced with this, as to whether the Minister had, in fact, the right to subscribe for preference shares in Aerlínte under this and I put down an amendment to section 3 designed, in fact, to substitute for section 3, to ensure that the Minister would have this power and to require him to use it in relation to this additional £5 million which he is providing for under section 3.  If, of course, section 2 does entitle him to subscribe for preference shares, then I would have or should have adopted, perhaps, a different method of amending the Bill.  Therefore, before going any further, I should like to know where we stand on section 2, what is the position about the issue of preference shares under the existing legislation about Aerlínte and under its Articles of Association and the Companies Act?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not quite finished my sentence&mdash;by way of shares in the company or by way of loan to the company or by way of grant to the company.  For all other State companies these methods have been regarded as providing adequate flexibility. I am not clear as to why we have to append this new contradiction in terms, &ldquo;non-repayable loan&rdquo;. When I questioned the Minister on Second Stage the answers he gave conveyed to me that what he wanted to do was to provide money to the company on terms which are akin to those of preference shares.  The only way in which, so far as I can see it&mdash;the Minister can enlighten me if I am wrong&mdash;the proposals in section 3 would differ from preference shares is that the interest rate on preference shares is fixed at the time the shares are issued and that preferential interest rate is payable&mdash;it can of course be passed over if the resources are not there for the purpose&mdash;but it is payable, if payable at all, if the money is available at all, at the prearranged rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 seems to envisage that the interest rate could be varied by the Minister from time to time.  This I regard as clearly objectionable.  This is neither one thing nor the other.  To lend money on the basis that you get interest at a rate that you fix from time to time gives the Minister power to change the whole financial position of the company arbitrarily.  It is wrong <Col N="819" /> that any State company should be put in that position.  It is wrong that the Exchequer should be put in that relationship to a State company.  The relations between the Exchequer and the State company should be clearly laid down and defined by the Oireachtas. The Oireachtas should be clear that when money is being issued it is being issued either as ordinary share capital, risk capital, taking its chance whether it gets its share or not, or as preference shares knowing that this entitles it to a certain rate of interest if the money is available and to that full rate or, in the case of a grant, to a grant, or fixed interest-bearing stock.</P>
    <P>I do not see why one should introduce this kind of insecurity&mdash;you could hardly call it security &mdash;&ldquo;insecurity&rdquo; would be a better word for it&mdash;insecurity involved for the company, in which the Minister arbitrarily decides in any year what rate of interest he wants.  That is not fair to the company and it is not fair to the Exchequer.  It is not necessary.  What the Minister wants is to ensure that he will have a better chance of getting some return here than on his ordinary shares.  He wants to be in a position, as I understood it on Second Stage, that in regard to this £5 million it will be in the ordinary way remunerated at the ordinary rate of interest.  The way to do that is to fix the rate of interest now which is thought to be appropriate and he will receive that rate of interest thereafter unless the affairs of the company are such that they will have to pass over the preference dividends or pay a lesser amount in a given year. If the Minister wants to assure his position further he can issue cumulative preference shares so that, if there are arrears of preference dividends, they could be caught up with later.  This would achieve his objective without introducing a new mechanism which is awkward and which is, I think, objectionable, objectionable in its uncertainty, objectionable because of the fact that it introduces an unnecessary complication into the whole system.</P>
    <P>For that reason, on this section, I should like to discuss this matter <Col N="820" /> further because it may well be that the right answer is simply to give the Minister power in this section to subscribe for further shares at a sum not exceeding £15 million.  If, within that power given by the Oireachtas, the Minister decides that some shares shall be preference shares at a certain rate of interest, he is entitled to do so and section 3 would then become superfluous at that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if I would have risen to speak at all this morning, despite the Minister's remarks about me the last day when I had left the House.  If I had known that he was going to say something about me I would have remained.  I am sorry for the discourtesy.  I am not going to follow Deputy FitzGerald with his combinations of various forms of top logic and mathematical interlocutions of cumulative preference shares and so on.  I said a very simple thing the last day and I will read it out.  I took from the Minister's brief the following sentence:</P>
      <P>The proposed further State investment in the equity of the company will not be provided as subsidy or grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I then went on to say that it would be just as well if that sentence had been left out.  There is no difference between putting £10 million capital into this company and giving it a grant.  There is no effective difference.  Then the Minister proceeded to read the Riot Act to me and said that I was Victorian in my outlook and all the rest of it.  I would suggest that it is the Minister who is being Victorian in his outlook.  The fact is that, if the Minister had said &ldquo;We will give a grant or a non-repayable loan,&rdquo; this word that does not appeal to Deputy FitzGerald&mdash;I am not precious about words in this sense; if it passes the draftsman, it will do me&mdash;I would not have minded.  I would not have minded if the Minister had said that he would give the whole £15 million to the company in the one way.  What I objected to, really, was the pretence in the Minister's own brief&mdash;I am quoting it to him this morning and I think I have him on top of a nail&mdash; the pretence in the Minister's own brief <Col N="821" /> that there was a difference between taking up ten million £1 ordinary shares&mdash;if I might become logical for a moment&mdash;in this company and giving it a grant of £10 million.  Personally, I think there is no difference.</P>
    <P>I know this company reasonably well.  Although I did not work in it, like Deputy FitzGerald, I did work on it for a number of years because it was part of my duty in the Department of Finance to work on it.  So, I know the background of this company reasonably well&mdash;perhaps not quite the kind of detail that Deputy FitzGerald knows about it &mdash; but I do know the principle on which it was set up, and so on.  The Minister will appreciate from what I said that I was quite in favour of this company getting £15 million.  Perhaps ten or 15 years ago I would have said, &ldquo;This is an awful lot of money&rdquo; but in a year where we have a £500 million Budget, £15 million is a modest enough sum. It is the £71 million that concerned me, the Minister will remember.  I do think my remark was justified.  I do think that it does not make any difference. Deputy FitzGerald's amendment introduces a further complication for this company which has no reality, if he is talking about preference shares. There is no hope whatever in the foreseeable future of the State ever receiving one penny from any kind of loan it will give to this company, regardless of what the Minister may say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the simpler the approach we use towards these matters the better.  I would not have minded if the purpose had been to give a straightforward £15 million to this company but it was this phrase in the Minister's speech this morning that forced me into making the remarks I have made.  This does not make me Victorian, rather it makes the Minister Victorian because he is putting forward the view that shares in the company are worth something. The Minister is pretending that the shares are what shares normally are, marketable security, but of course they are not a marketable security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, I have no objection to the company getting £15 million but <Col N="822" /> if we are to start putting in preference shares as well, all we are doing is adding another line of print to the balance sheet at the end of the year.  I know, of course, that this company borrow money from abroad and that they have been successful in obtaining considerable moneys.</P>

      <P>This discussion is more relevant to Deputy FitzGerald's amendment on the next section and we are possibly only anticipating the debate we shall have on the Deputy's amendment.  Fundamentally, what is involved here is that the State wishes to be secured more strongly in regard to one-third of the capital advanced and we believe that the most flexible way in which this can be done is by the device adopted under section 3 which leaves it absolutely open in regard to the Exchequer.  There will be a repayment in regard to the loan capital to be advanced and there will be a repayment on revenue.  This is the strong point.</P>

      <P>Before section 3 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance may, on the recommendation of the Minister for Transport and Power, take up preference shares issued by Aerlínte to an amount not exceeding five million pounds.</P>
      <P>(Acceptance of this amendment involves the deletion of section 3 of the Bill.)</P>
      <P>I am concerned with the Minister's remarks on section 2 which suggest that the purpose of section 3 is to ensure that there will be a return on this amount of capital whereas, in fact, the introduction of section 3 has the opposite effect.  Had he left the situation as it was in section 2 and just informed the House of his intention to issue part of the £15 million as preference shares with a fixed interest rate, he would be receiving that interest unless the company were in very bad shape but in introducing this new type of insecurity in section 3&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The position of a State body should not be such that it can be varied at the whim of the Minister.  I should have thought that Deputy O'Donovan would have supported me even though he may not be enthusiastic about preference shares, for some reason that I do not understand, but I had hoped that he would have agreed with me that State companies should be protected from Ministerial intervention <Col N="824" /> that could affect the shape of their profit and loss account.  They should be entitled to run their own affairs on the basis that they would know their liabilities in advance.  I am not aware of any precedent for this procedure.  I did mention on Second Stage the situation that has developed in Nítrigin Éireann but it is slightly different in character and is, perhaps, even more objectionable.  I agree, of course, that State companies should know where they stand and that they should be subject to supervision by the Minister as regards their policy but within certain limits.</P>

I must say that the State companies of which I had experience showed no reluctance on their part towards the Exchequer.

      <P>This is the whole purpose of the exercise.  It is designed to secure a definite interest.  At the <Col N="825" /> same time, it is within a flexible framework and will ensure, as regards one-third of the money advanced by the State, that the Exchequer is guaranteed a dividend.  This is what is done.  It is a safeguard so far as the State is concerned. Deputy Dr. FitzGerald said this might start an undesirable precedent. The boards of the air companies concerned, Aer Lingus and Aerlínte, are fully behind it and support it fully.  It has been examined in consultation between my Department and the boards involved.  They think it is a reasonable balance and a reasonable way to achieve the investment required. There would be a balance between the loan capital and equity investment which we would hope to achieve on, roughly, a fifty-fifty basis.  We want to ensure that there is this balance within the capital structure of the companies and that within that structure there is a reasonable way, from the State's point of view, of achieving a return, and this is the device adopted.</P>
      <P>I am surprised at Deputy Dr. FitzGerald being ultra-conservative or concerned about traditional methods of doing this particular operation.  Surely sections 2 and 3 both ensure that there will be complete flexibility in regard to the various devices which can be adopted?  I am much more in agreement with Deputy Dr. O'Donovan here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are thinking ahead whereas Deputy Dr. FitzGerald is thinking with a hidebound conception. Let us have a flexible arrangement in regard to raising capital so long as the broad objectives are achieved. We have to get a proper capital structure for the air companies to ensure that we have a capital structure to enable our air companies to raise the finance necessary for the massive investment which will be required in the 1970s and 1980s.  That is the first purpose. The second purpose is that in the interim period&mdash;and it is an interim period in regard to the finance involved &mdash;we wish to ensure that the State gets a reasonable guarantee in regard to the return on moneys advanced.  This does not preclude an equity return.  It does <Col N="826" /> not preclude a return on equity investment either.  I would disagree with Deputy Dr. O'Donovan here.  I could see a dividend resulting from the equity investment in the future.  This is our hope.  We would at least guarantee that a percentage or a proportion of one-third of the investment would give a definite dividend by reason of this device under section 3, or whatever other device may be adopted.  Leave it open to us to do so.</P>
      <P>This is a commercial growth enterprise and Deputy Dr. O'Donovan is being Victorian in his conception here in that he does not envisage any State return arising from our substantial investment.  Our investment in the air companies will be much more substantial in the future.  These companies have proved to be a dynamic growth industry financed by the State and well remunerated.  It should be the sort of industry to be encouraged by socialists as people who believe in State involvement, I want to see this industry doubling and trebling itself in the years ahead.  It has shown itself to be highly remunerative in the narrow sense and totally remunerative in the broader sense of revenue intake in respect of services rendered to the tourist industry itself.  This industry has proved remunerative in the broad sense of an analysis of its benefit to the nation as a whole as well as in the narrow commercial sense.  So far as the State is concerned in regard to this and any further investment that may be involved, this group of air companies have shown themselves remunerative.  They will be more remunerative in the future.  They are dynamic growth State enterprises of which we can be proud.  We should not quibble about details in regard to investment.  It is really a question a rose by any other name in regard to what sort of device we adopt.  Let us leave it flexible so that we can adopt any sort of device so long as the State interest is retained.</P>

      <P>I agree with the amendments.  It would be better to describe them as preference shares rather than leave the matter loosely as it is.  I also think that, under certain conditions, the preference shares <Col N="827" /> should be repayable.  Section 3 states that the money shall not be repayable. That is bad practice.  Under certain circumstances, if Aerlínte or the other air company became liquid and the Government needed capital moneys, it would be quite right to call upon Aer Lingus to pay back any moneys they could afford to pay back.  It is only right that the actual interest on dividends on the preference shares should be stated in the Bill.  It should be specified, and eight per cent would be a fair return in the commercial sense.  I should like to ask the Minister what the conditions would be in respect of the financing of Aer Lingus if we joined the EEC.  Would the present practice of not getting interest or dividends from Aer Lingus or Aerlínte be allowed to continue?  I do not think we could subsidise the air companies as we have been doing up to now.</P>

      <P>That is over-simplification. Although the Rome Treaty excludes air and sea transport from its transport chapter or title, with the Irish, British, Danish and Norwegian membership it is the intention and expectation that they would be included. The provision in regard to State companies would then apply here. That could be a problem in the future. It is not a pressing, urgent one now because, as the Minister says, other air companies are in even worse condition. I would not rule it out completely.  In regard to railways, already the EEC transport policy is beginning to be brought to the point of applying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with some of what the Minister has been saying in reply to Deputy Dr. O'Donovan.  The fact is that this particular company has been earning a return on its share capital of ten to 15 per cent.  Admittedly, in later years this capital structure has become very unbalanced.  A high proportion of it is loaned capital and you are not getting a very fair picture of its earning power if you relate its profits only to the share capital which is too small a proportion of the total, but even if one allows for that and throws in the loan capital it is still earning a significant return on the capital invested in it.  It seems to me that to say that there is no prospect of ever getting a return from the money now to be invested is to be unduly pessimistic.  On this I agree with the Minister rather than with Deputy Dr. O'Donovan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come back to the main point, this amendment, I am struck by the way the Minister ties himself up in knots&mdash;he may be unconscious of this and that would even make it more striking&mdash;by talking on one hand of the immense value of this procedure as being completely flexible and on the other hand that you would ensure a definite return.  It cannot do both at once, and the one thing it does not do is ensure a definite return.  The purpose of section 3 is not to ensure a definite return.  The purpose of my amendment is to ensure a definite return of X per cent, whatever is fixed on the preference shares at the time they are issued.  The Minister has avoided that device and has proposed a system under section 3 which provides an indefinite return, a return which is not fixed and may be <Col N="829" /> varied by the Minister from time to time as he thinks fit.  It is absurd to claim on the one hand that this device is flexible, which is perfectly true, and at the same time that it involves a definite return.  It is, in fact, a device that is too flexible.  The Minister said that the boards of Aerlínte and Aer Lingus&mdash;I am not quite clear how the board of Aer Lingus is concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are interlocking, as the Deputy knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>But they are not the same boards.  They have a different composition and I do not see what the board of Aer Lingus have to do with it.  The board of Aerlínte is the relevant one and from what the Minister said I gather it is wholeheartedly behind this proposal.  This does not surprise me.  The board of Aerlínte could well be taking a short-term view and not having regard to its longer term interests or, indeed, to the public interest.  State boards often do take a narrow view.  From the short-term viewpoint of the Aerlínte board they could benefit from this because instead of being burdened by, say, 6 per cent per annum to be paid every year they would have money available to them on which interest would be payable as the Minister determines.</P>
      <P>It would be much easier and would be much less noticeable if in any year they went to the Minister and said: &ldquo;You asked us for 6 per cent last year but this year things are not so good.  Would you cut it back to 3 per cent?&rdquo; This is done by ministerial order quietly and there would be no need, I think, even to lay the order before the House.  I am open to correction on that.  That would be much less noticeable than having to pass the preference dividend.  I can quite see the Aerlínte board taking a short-term view and preferring to put themselves at the mercy of the Minister in this matter rather than have a definite obligation to take interest on the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that would be wrong but it would not surprise me if they took that view.  I think in the longer term their interest lies in having a relationship, an arm's length relationship with the Minister and his Department, a relationship <Col N="830" /> in which it is quite clear to everybody what the financial relationship is between them and in which the Minister does not have power to influence the company's accounts by arbitrary action with regard to the interest he requires to be paid.  While I am disappointed that the board of Aerlínte have taken this line I am not completely surprised because there is is this danger of boards of State companies, particularly when under financial pressure, taking an unduly short-term view of their own interests.</P>
    <P>There is certainly the danger that they do not have regard to the public interest which lies with preserving the autonomy of State enterprises subject to overall ministerial Parliamentary control of their policy, but not intervention in day to day affairs.  There is nothing more day to day than annual accounts, if one can speak of something annual as being day to day, because they are part of the ordinary running affairs of the company, their annual accounts and what money they make year after year.  This is not something in which the Minister should be able to interfere every year at his discretion but it should be a matter for the autonomy of the company.  The more I think about this the more concerned I am.</P>
    <P>When I made the point originally I did so because it struck me as odd that the Minister had proceeded in this way. The full impact of it did not strike me and it was only during this debate I began to realise how very serious this precedent is and how it could easily become a device for very much greater ministerial and Departmental control over the State companies.  I know from my experience of State companies, and Deputy Dr. O'Donovan knows it from the other side&mdash;and, perhaps, sees it differently&mdash;how much intervention there is already and how much of a pure theory it is that the Minister is the person concerned with these State companies.  The practice at day to day level is that the civil servants and the management of the company are in constant contact with constant warfare between them; perhaps, that is too strong a term but constant conflict over various issues, give and take, horse-trading and bargaining. <Col N="831" /> If this gets a bit out of hand and one side or the other becomes irate and is not winning out sufficiently the Minister is called in, in a sense, to arbitrate.</P>
    <P>That is the practical position and the theory that it is the Minister who is dealing with them and that the civil servants are acting merely as his agents is, as the Minister knows, a lot of nonsense.</P>
    <P>Most of the time the Minister does not know what the civil servants are doing and only finds out when something goes wrong and they come to him.  I know that from my day to day dealings personally with officials of the Department during my period in the air companies.  That relationship is already a disturbing one.  The degree of bureaucratic intervention and control is disturbing.  The State companies must accept this to a considerable degree because they are already excessively dependent for various favours and discretionary matters upon the Civil Service and the Department. There must be give and take.  Very often they must agree to things which the civil servants have no power to require them to do but they must agree because otherwise they would lose the goodwill of the Civil Service in relation to some other matter where the civil servants could advise the Minister against them.  Fear of that means that the State companies must toe the line.</P>
    <P>On the whole, this difficult relationship is one in which a balance is maintained because ultimately the State company has autonomy and could assert itself and, therefore, the civil servants are limited in the extent of their intervention.  At the same time, they have considerable power.  That power is always exercised for what they see as the public interest or public good. It would be unfortunate if they did not have some power because, as I said, these bodies very often take an unduly narrow view of the public interest. There must be a balance of interest in this way.  But what I fear is that in this instance if this power is given the balance between the two would be pushed far too much to one side and <Col N="832" /> that, although the board of Aerlínte may not appreciate this now, they are putting their head in a noose with this and putting themselves into a position where for the first time, by a stroke of a pen, the civil servants advising the Minister can affect the shape of their profit and loss account.</P>
    <P>This will give an additional bargaining power to the Civil Service which I think will unbalance the relationship which is already a very delicate one between the two and which already, I think&mdash;this is a personal view which is obviously open to disagreement&mdash;is if anything too much on the Civil Service side&mdash;not too much too much, but a little too much.  If we now give this discretionary power to the Minister I think the whole position of State bodies would ultimately be in danger. I speak from some experience, although from a particular viewpoint on that.  I can see that Deputy Dr. O'Donovan, who has had just as much experience as I have of the Department but from a different angle, may view it differently and may advise the Minister differently on this subject.  I am concerned but I feel that this is a precedent of some importance, one which might have passed through without much notice but for the fact that it struck me as an oddity in the first instance and it is only from hearing the debate here that I have come to appreciate the seriousness of what is here proposed.  I, therefore, urge the Minister that both with a view to getting a simpler and more clear cut position and securing a definite return, if that is what he wants, he should revert to the preference share arrangement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This is surely the proper balance to maintain <i>vis-á-vis</i> a State company <i>vis-á-vis</i> any form of investment envisaged. Furthermore, this has been done after complete consultation with the boards concerned and this is the proper way to go about it so as to ensure that our air companies have a capital structure in the 1970s that will enable them to raise the massive investment that will be required by them in the aviation world into which we are going.</P>

      <P>The 1966 Air Companies Act limited the guarantee on borrowing to £5 million for Aer Lingus and £6 million for Aerlínte. The 1967 Air Companies Act increased the Aerlínte limit to £18 million.  This increase is related to the purchase of <Col N="834" /> the two jumbo jets.  The companies themselves advised me, and we have gone into it and investigated it, that a combined limit for the two companies instead of individual limits gives greater flexibility for financial transactions and we are interlocking the two companies so that the overall increase from £23 million to £50 million results in a much bigger re-equipment programme for the two companies.  The whole purpose of this section is to ensure closer interlocking between the two companies and to raise the financial limits that were circumscribed heretofore.</P>

      <P>Under the 1966 Act, section 4, the Minister for Finance is authorised to make repayable advances up to £1 million to Aer Lingus or Aerlínte.  The repayable advance involved meeting repayment of principal as well as interest.  The section of the Bill we are discussing deals with the capital requirements of the air companies until 1972-73.  There are <Col N="835" /> provided for in section 2 shares and section 3 non-repayable advances.  In other words, we are removing the limit again, coming back to what Deputy FitzGerald advocated some time ago, removing the limit that was there under the previous Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Dublin Gas Order 1969, proposed to be made by the Minister for Transport and Power and laid in draft before Dáil Éireann on 25th June, 1969 under subsection (4) of section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, be approved.</P>
      <P>Gas undertakings generally operate under special Acts which authorise them to manufacture and distribute gas in certain specific areas.  Modifications to these special Acts required by the undertakings from time to time are made under section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920 which enables me to make by order the required modifications.  Before an order of this kind is made it has to be laid in draft before both Houses of the Oireachtas. The Houses of the Oireachtas may, by resolution, approve the draft order in the form submitted or may approve it with modifications or additions.  When such approval is given I may make the order in the form in which it has been approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1954 an order was made which gave the Alliance and Dublin Consumers' <Col N="838" /> Gas Company power to appoint either the Chief Engineer, the General Manager or the Secretary of the Company as a director of the company.  The General Manager is now on the Board of Directors but the company wish to have the power to appoint the Chief Engineer and the Secretary as directors also.  These officers hold divisional responsibility in the company's organisation and the company feel that, to give them stronger status, it is desirable that they should be permitted to be on the board.  The order now laid in draft before the House will give the company the necessary authority to make these appointments whenever they see fit to do so.</P>
    <P>Notice of the proposed order was published by the company in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in a daily newspaper. Copies of the draft order were sent to the public and local authorities concerned. No objection to the proposed order was received.  I am satisfied as to the need for the order and that there is nothing in it repugnant to the public interest.  I, therefore, recommend the order for the approval of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner) (for the Minister for Lands)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This is a short Bill relatively free from technical complexities and it should not cause any great difficulties for the House.  The Bill has three purposes which I propose to discuss individually to facilitate consideration by Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first purpose as provided for in section 1 is to make a further increase in the total amount of land bonds which may be created and issued by the Minister for Finance for the purpose of making advances and paying purchase moneys in respect of land taken over by the Land Commission for the purposes of the land settlement programme.  Deputies will be aware that we have had similar increases on two occasions since the original limit of £10 million was imposed by section 6 (1) of the Land Bond Act, 1934.  That <Col N="839" /> limit of £10 million was increased to £15 million by section 7, Land Act, 1953, and to £25 million by section 2, Land Bond Act, 1964.</P>
    <P>Land bonds required to make advances and to meet the cost of land taken over by the Land Commission are created by the Minister for Finance, usually on an annual basis, as they are required by the Land Commission. The latest order made by the Minister for Finance on 23rd June, 1969, creating a series of £100,000 land bonds has brought the total amount created under various land bond orders to £25 million, that is the total amount currently authorised by statute.  It is, therefore, necessary to provide legislative authority for the creation of a further series.  Having regard to experience over the last few years, it is desirable on this occasion to provide authority for the creation of a further series of bonds amounting to £15 million.  It is reckoned that such an amount should provide sufficient bonds for a period of about seven years.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that land prices continue to rise and maintenance of the land settlement programme, even at its existing level, would necessitate an expanded supply of land bonds.  But this is only part of the increase required.  The Government, as announced in the <i>Third Programme: Economic and Social Expansion</i>, is committed to an intensification and acceleration of the work of land acquisition and division, especially in small farming areas.  I know there will be general sympathy with the work of improving the lot of small farmers by providing them with sufficient additional land to put them on a viable basis and I believe the House would not wish to see this work delayed in any way because of lack of land bonds.</P>
    <P>I could remind the House, in fact, that the Land Bond Act, 1964, which increased the previous limit by £10 million, proved non-contentious and got a speedy passage in both Houses. Apart from land purchased or acquired for land bonds the Land Commission are buying an increasing area of land each year for cash.  Deputies will be aware that the Land Act, 1965, removed <Col N="840" /> the restrictive application of section 27 of the Land Act, 1950, and as a consequence purchases for cash may now be made by the Land Commision for all the purposes of the Land Acts.  For the current year, a record sum of £600,000 has been provided for these purchases, representing an increase of no less than £170,000 over the amount provided last year. In the case of cash also it will be our desire to provide a constantly increasing supply of money so that the Government's policy of speeding up the work of land reform can be implemented as announced in the Third Programme.</P>
    <P>The second purpose of the Bill, as provided for in section 2, is to simplify the land bond system by changing existing and future land bonds from numbered bonds in three denominations to unnumbered bonds in £1 units. Under the existing system, land bonds have heretofore been issued in numbered denominations of £100, £10 and £1 and these denominations once registered cannot be subdivided.  This system is now becoming very cumbersome and is giving rise to difficulties such as:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  On transfer forms the numbers of all bonds or groups of bonds for transfer must be shown, and this can involve considerable work for stockbrokers, solicitors and banks acting as agents for land bond holders.</P>
    <P>(ii)  It is often impossible for a holder to divide a land bond holding as the holder may wish.  For instance a holding of £1,000 in land bonds made up of ten £100 bonds cannot be equally divided into three or four equal parts.</P>
    <P>(iii)  It is difficult for trustees to acquire a particular amount of bonds owing to a scarcity of £1 or £10 bonds available.</P>
    <P>By changing the bonds into unnumbered bonds of £1 units these difficulties will be removed.  The proposed change has been welcomed by the committees of the various Stock Exchanges in which dealings in land bonds take place.</P>
    <P>The third purpose of the Bill, as provided for in section 3, is to authorise the transfer of registers of land bonds <Col N="841" /> from Chase &amp; Bank of Ireland (International) Limited to the Bank of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Since the inception of the land bond system the registers have been kept by the former National City Bank, which since 1926 was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank of Ireland.  Since the re-organisation of the bank by the acquisition by the Chase Manhattan Bank of New York of 50 per cent of the Share Capital the character and type of work being performed by the bank makes it inappropriate that the work of registration of land bonds should be performed by it.  This work is accordingly being transferred to the head office of the Bank of Ireland, where the registers of most other Government Stocks are kept.</P>
    <P>This Bill will authorise the provision of funds in the form of land bonds to enable the Land Commission to press ahead with the land reform programme and will also simplify the clerical procedures for registering and transferring the bonds.  I can commend it to the House on this basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrigidHoganOHiggins" hpid="Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that this Bill is simple, but any Bill that deals with land, though it may be simple, is very contentious. On reading through the Bill one finds that there does not seem to be a lot in it.  I welcome the increase in the amount of money being made available to the Land Commission because this, I hope, will speed up land division in the various areas.  This matter of land division has been a very contentious point indeed down the years.</P>
      <P>The big objection, the big &ldquo;crib,&rdquo; if you like, about land bonds is that anybody selling his farm to the Land Commission says he does not want land bonds.  The reason for that is that people cannot sell land bonds at par and if they want to sell immediately in order to be able to purchase another farm, they cannot get the transfer sufficiently quickly.  On the whole, in practice it is found that when one sells lands bonds one loses money.  I do not know what the quotation for them is today but a short time ago they were well down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is impossible to explain to a farmer&mdash;and many farmers come to us on this matter &mdash; that he will get only £91 for every £100 he has in land bonds.  He thinks that is most unfair.  His idea is that if the Land Commission want his land badly enough they should give cash.  That is reasonable, particularly in the case of compulsory acquisition.  People whose land has been acquired compulsorily should be treated more kindly than those who offer their land to the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>Another question I should like to put to the Minister is whether land bonds are acceptable in lieu of death duties.  They should be so acceptable, and at their face value, not at their Stock Exchange rate.  Section 2 is an improvement because all denominations will be the same in future and the disparity in the past has been tricky and a source of inconvenience.  I think section 3 is simply a tidying-up section, if I understand the Minister correctly. This section will make for a speeding up of matters in both the Land Commission and the banks.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to think seriously about the whole system of payment by land bonds.  It is the one thing that is holding up the sale, acquisition and division of land.  I know many people who would sell willingly for cash but who would think twice before selling for land bonds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the increase in the number of land bonds for the purpose of the acquisition of land because it is very necessary to expedite the work of the Land Commission.  I ask the Minister to give particular consideration to the case of people who offer land for public auction and who, having sold it at public auction, find the Land Commission entering the land and proceeding to acquire it despite the fact that it has been sold already by public auction.  The vendor often has entered into prior commitments, financial and otherwise, on the strength of the sale and in the expectation of the sale being completed in 28 days. I ask the Minister to provide that such people be paid in cash rather than in land bonds in order that they may <Col N="843" /> honour the commitments they have entered into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not here when the Minister began his speech and therefore I do not know if he indicated what the percentage will be on the new land bonds.  I have been informed that it will be nine per cent.  If Government bonds have to come on the market at such a high rate of interest there is something wrong.  There is something wrong if the bonds are not acceptable on the ordinary free market.  That is the case.</P>
      <P>I concur with Deputy Hogan O'Higgins.  She spoke of the problem of trying to dispose of land bonds quickly, an almost impossible task. What is happening is that people are selling farms with the idea of getting a better type of farm &mdash; perhaps the areas in which they live are not suitable. They sell farms with the idea of purchasing other farms and when they offer the old farms to the Land Commission they have in view other farms which they would prefer.  In the first instance, they cannot dispose of their land bonds because they are not stable. I know of many instances of people who sell farms but who cannot get a transfer of the land bonds.  They are told that the bonds are there and that they are payable at a certain rate of interest.  That is no use to these people, they want cash in order to be able to pay for their new farms.  I have known cases in which people have had to employ counsel to bring their cases before the courts to try and get transfers.  It has happened in Wexford on numerous occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity that when the Minister was bringing in this Bill he did not introduce a provision which would to some extent alleviate the high charge on land.  There is a very high charge on land in the eastern part of the country. I believe we have been subsidising the west&mdash;I am not quite sure&mdash; for a great many years, uncomplainingly because we are good-natured people in the east.  A lot of people who sold farms and were offered bonds found that when the Land Commission took over the land to distribute it <Col N="844" /> the rate of interest was very high.  I know that high charges fall back on the Land Commission but the rate on land is so high that people are refusing this land.  There has been a suggestion that the refusal rate is only one per cent.  It may be that people are not refusing land in the first instances.  It is only when they discover what they are being charged that they reject it.  Land is being accepted but it is not being retained.  There are innumerable people in my constituency who are not prepared to accept land at the present rate.  It should have been possible for the Minister to introduce in a Bill such as this some method whereby the heavy charge on land of £8 an acre could be subsidised and thus brought down to a lower level.</P>
    <P>As I have said earlier, we in the east are good-natured people and we have been subsidising the people in the west for years and they get it.  Surely much cheaper than we get it.  Surely the Minister can do something whereby the charge on land could be reduced. I do not know whether that entails bringing in an extra Bill or not, but the fact remains that land bonds are not doing what they were intended to do.  As the Minister stated, the purcpose of this Bill is to acquire and divide more land.  That is practically the sole purpose of this Bill, and the Minister requires more money for that purpose.  I have tried to point out the snags in regard to this very laudable policy of taking over and dividing land. There is no reason why on the Committee Stage of this Bill the Minister should not introduce some amendments to meet the points I have raised.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister also to deal with the interminable delays in paying for land.  If anybody else buys a farm he pay a deposit and when the farm is finally taken over all the money is paid over.  In the case of land bonds there is no deposit paid.  We are told the bonds are deposited in the name of the individual and one of the land commissioners or somebody like that.  The person has the right to draw the rate of interest but even when the farm is finally transferred to him, he does not get the land bonds.  Could the Minister explain to the House why <Col N="845" /> he does not get the land bonds.  If the bonds are freely available to the Government for the purpose of purchasing land why should they hold on to them? Why do they not hand them over immediately?  I am sure that is a problem which is not peculiar to Wexford but which exists in other constituencies as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended on the Committee Stage to raise the first question Deputy Esmonde asked but perhaps it would save time if I join with him in asking at what rate it is proposed to issue these bonds now?  As I understand it, the original 1934 Act has a specific provision in it that the value of the bonds is to remain at or near par for some reasonable time after they are issued.  The trouble is that when a farm is taken over the person does not get possession of the bonds and therefore you cannot sell them and very often their value goes down and down.</P>
      <P>As regards the rate of interest, I noticed that last week in London some of the prime companies in Britain were paying 9? per cent for money for one year and getting only about £99 15s, so that rate is roughly ten per cent. When this Land Bond Act of 1934 was passed the original bonds were issued at 4½ per cent and there were bonds issued at as low as 3½ per cent. In fact, if I might make so bold as to advise the Minister, you have got away from this system through what was done by the second inter-Party Government, by the purchase of land for cash when they had put in that small tentative sum of £50,000 a year which in the present year is nearly £1 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the schemozzle that is going on in the money market in recent years, why not drop this system altogether and pay for such land as is taken over?  Of course this is a method of creating a bit of credit for the State. Personally I am no great lover of land division.  I do not think it has achieved its objectives, for various reasons.  For example, the farm that was regarded as an economic holding in the 'thirties has long since ceased to be an economic holding in the eyes of most people.  By now the Department of <Col N="846" /> Lands must certainly have handled nearly all the land in this country at least once, and certain parts of it not once but twice or three times.  This reminds me of the fact that the Romans divided the whole of the land of Italy in a period of six years.  I think it was in the Act of 1881 that we started this but certainly we started in a big way under the 1923 Act.  There may be technical reasons for sticking to this system but it is time for the Department of Lands, if they are going to continue land division, to go over entirely to that subhead in the vote for the Department of Lands where the payments are made in cash.</P>
    <P>The Department of Lands being an extremely careful, legal Department are going to issue these bonds so that they will be at or near par subsequent to issue, but that really means 9 or 10 per cent which is completely out of line with what was originally intended in this connection.  It might be no harm if the Minister considered whether this system should not be abandoned altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy O'Donovan's suggestion, and the suggestion that was made by other speakers on this side of the House, that it would probably be better to pay for land in cash instead of in land bonds.  I know from my own experience of meeting people that there is a great deal of dissatisfaction about being paid in land bonds for land.  I should like to quote two letters from recent editions of a Sunday newspaper which will bear out the point we are making.  The first letter is from the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 6th July, 1969:</P>
      <P>My intention was to sell in the ordinary way and I had instructed my auctioneer accordingly.  But the Land Commission moved in, started normal negotiations with prospective buyers and after some cheeseparing haggling, they gave £18,000&mdash;in Land Bonds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even before the Bonds were put in my name their price had fallen. Today they are quoted at 68 approx. I have £12,000 Bonds left to provide an income, that is, £720 p.a. (less income tax).  Occasional demands require that I cash Bonds with, of <Col N="847" /> course, a corresponding reduction in income.  But for every £136 cash I need I must cash £200 Bonds... my £12,000 Bonds are worth £8,160, a loss of £3,840 (and a prospect of even greater loss) When will this stark dishonesty cease?</P>
    <P>The Land Commission claim that they give market value.  They do, nominally.  Had I been left free to sell I would have got £17,500 in cash. (That was in fact an offer until knowledge of Land Commission intrusion became known.)</P>
    <P>I quote another letter from the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 13th July, 1969, which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>My lands were also purchased by the Land Commission for Bonds which had fallen in price before being put into my name.  If I require to sell at the present time each £100 bond is worth only £67 10s.  As bonds paid for many estates are held by elderly people or by several members of one family&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>This is important&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;I would suggest that the Minister for Finance be requested, as a concession to those who have lost so much of their capital, to allow land bonds, at their face value, to be accepted in payment of death duties, as is the case of National Loan Stock.</P>
    <P>This point was made earlier in the debate by Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins.  These letters support the suggestion made earlier by Deputy O'Donovan and by Fine Gael speakers. In particular, we should bear in mind the fact that many people who are paid in land bonds are people who have been, by the sale of their lands, deprived of any means of livelihood because they have no other skill which would enable them to earn money.  The amount of money they get for their land is, therefore, of vital importance to them.  Those who sell land in this way should be able to maintain a reasonable standard of living, a standard of living not too much below that which they enjoyed before they sold <Col N="848" /> their land.  The present system of land bonds is causing uncertainty, to say nothing of the very considerable drop in the standard of living of many of those affected.  I suggest the Minister should in future consider paying cash.</P>
    <P>In relation to land purchase, the Land Commission in many cases adopts a &ldquo;dog in the manger&rdquo; attitude.  I heard of a case recently &mdash; I have not got the details with me at the moment &mdash;in which a person was going forward to sell land by public auction. The Land Commission wrote to him and told him they wanted the land and he was not to go ahead with the sale by auction, even though he had had an offer and the whole thing was well advanced.  Yet, while they refused to let him sell to anybody else, they would not buy the land themselves. They kept him hanging.  He could not sell to anyone else and they refused to take up the land.  This is probably happening fairly widely.  This is very unjust.  Those who want to sell land should be allowed to do so, provided the sale of the land does not in any way militate against the national interest.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the very laudable provision in the 1965 Act whereby the Land Commission was empowered to buy up land held by elderly people and to provide pensions for them out of the purchase money so that the land could be transferred to younger people.  This is a very sensible proposal because it ensures the maximum use is made of the land.  The only thing about which I am worried is the number of people who have been so far provided with pensions and the number of young people who have been acquired land.  I understand the number in both instances is exceptionally low.  I have heard a figure of one or two.  That may be wrong, but I do not think there are very many.  Since this is an excellent provision the Minister should investigate the position to find out why advantage is not being taken of it and why it is not being operated as effectively and as widely as it should be in the national interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Some provisions in this Bill are quite good.  The Land <Col N="849" /> Commission has a very important function. Every year 12,000 to 15,000 people leave the land.  If the work of the Land Commission were accelerated I believe this drift from the land would be checked.  It is tragic to see it continue and we may in the future look back with regret because we did nothing to prevent this situation.  Every farm the Land Commission divide helps to keep people on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons why the Land Commission have not succeeded as they should in having enough land available to divide amongst those who want land and who are anxious to engage in agriculture is because sufficient people are not coming forward offering land to the Land Commission and the reason why they are not doing so is because they are paid in land bonds.  In today's paper I see that the eight per cent land bonds are quoted at 91 and the 7½ per cent land bonds are quoted at 83¼.  That is the reason why people are reluctant to sell land to the Land Commission.  If the Minister, as a private individual, were to purchase a farm and, in six years time, try to pay £91 for every £100 there would be such a public outcry that anyone attempting this exercise would be immediately defeated.  Apparently the Land Commission can get away with it.  This practice should be stopped. Those who sell land to the Land Commission because they want to retire from farming and who are paid in land bonds find that their capital is considerably reduced in time.  The same situation obtains if they wish to buy a farm again; their capital has depreciated.  I cannot see any reason why the Land Commission should not pay cash.  Perhaps, the Minister would explain why the Land Commission cannot do so when he comes to reply. There is a great deal of criticism of the present practice.  There may be valid reasons for the practice.  I should like to know what they are so that I, in turn, can explain the position fully to people who are interested.  This is an urgent matter.  Cash should be paid for land, and only cash.  I believe that many more people will come forward to the Land Commission when they have farms to sell instead of, as at present, avoiding the Land Commission and <Col N="850" /> trying to sell their land anywhere or in any way other than to the Land Commission.  The Land Commission are in a position to help Irish agriculture in a very big way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Deputies for their very constructive approach to this Bill and for their acceptance of it.  The objective of all of us, especially of those from rural Ireland who understand the problems, is to speed up the development of small farms to an economic size.</P>
      <P>The principal matter raised in the course of the debate was in relation to the bonds and the value of bonds. First of all let me say that, as I mentioned in my introductory statement, we are paying a very considerable amount in cash for land at the present time.  The amount has increased from about £20,000 to £600,000.  It is not just feasible at the moment to change over entirely to cash because there are so many other demands on the Exchequer.  There are demands for more money for agriculture, health, education, social welfare and so on and therefore it is not possible at the present time to change over entirely from bonds to cash but, as Deputies can see from the information I have given in relation to the amount of cash that is being paid at the present time, we are proceeding in that direction.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was Deputy O'Donovan who asked the question what interest rate would accrue to the new land bond issue.  Of course, that is not a matter for me; it is a matter for the Minister for Finance. The Deputy was correct in saying that under section 4 (3) of the Land Bond Act 1934, the rate of interest fixed for land bonds by the Minister must be such as to ensure that the value of the bonds is to remain at or near par.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a fact that in the most recent issue the value of the bond fell pretty <Col N="851" /> soon after it was created but I am sure Deputies are aware that there has been a crisis throughout the world in relation to interest rates and we could not hope to come free from that situation. I think it was Deputy Bruton who mentioned that he read some letters in relation to the fall in the value of a particular bond.  He must know that if the person concerned had been paid cash at that time and had invested the money in fixed interest rate securities the same thing would have happened because of the inflationary situation that we find ourselves in, not only in this country but throughout the world.  I am told that in America at the present time the lending rate has reached a phenomenal height.</P>
    <P>Another matter that was raised here was as to why the bonds are not paid out immediately.  Of course, the problem here is almost invariably a matter of getting title.  We do our best on our side to get people fixed up as soon as possible but it does not always depend on us.  Sometimes, for one reason or another, there may be a certain amount of laxity in connection with it but I can assure the Deputies that as soon as title is cleared the bonds are paid.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde raised the point that the rent charged in the west or in the congested areas is lower than in the eastern section of the country.  What we have to do here also is to try to use the money we have in the best possible way and to favour those who are in the greatest need and it is pretty obvious that in the west of Ireland, where there are so many small farms, it is necessary to do something more than is being done on the east coast.  Apart from that, there is also the fact that along the east coast it is, generally speaking, very much easier to get other types of employment than it is in the west.  For these reasons, we have to concern ourselves more with the west than with the east coast in relation to rents.</P>
    <P>I think it was the same Deputy who said that we had reached a point where people were refusing to take the land because of the rent being charged and <Col N="852" /> said that this had reached pretty high proportions.  My information is that it is not yet a very serious problem but, of course, we keep this matter under constant review.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to the pension scheme and said he believed it was an excellent scheme, which indeed it is, from the point of view of getting old people to hand over their farms for the relief of congestion; but he suggested that, unfortunately, we have not got very many applications to date.  We have got a fair number but not anything like what we would like to get.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>How many?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>To be honest, I could not tell the Deputy at the moment but I have these figures and could get them.  They are not nearly what we would like them to be.  There are two factors involved here.  One is that the people concerned, old people, are not as a rule anxious to change their mode of life.  They are not as a rule anxious to give up the land on which they have lived all their lives and it takes a very considerable amount of convincing to get them to agree to it.  A second thing is that we may find it necessary to give a better incentive. This whole question, I can tell the Deputy, is being re-examined by the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>The main point that was raised was the matter of cash payments and I have pointed out that we have gone to considerable length in increasing the amount of money available for cash payments when this year we are paying out £600,000 and this is, to put it in perspective, an increase of £170,000 on last year.  That shows that we are concerning ourselves with this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made the <Col N="853" /> point, and it was a valid one to some extent, that most security prices have fallen and that land bonds had fallen also and that they had something in common with others.  I would be interested to know whether, in fact, land bonds have fallen more rapidly than the average security.  I would be inclined to think that probably land bonds have fallen slightly more than the average security has over a given period.</P>
      <P>Another question I should like to ask is, what criteria are used by the Minister in deciding whether or not a particular person will be paid in land bonds or in cash and, also, is there much publicity given through the various media in relation to this scheme to provide pensions for old persons whose land is bought up by the Land Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the value of land bonds, I am afraid I have not the information to make comparisons but all over the world in recent years this has been the regular experience.</P>
      <P>With regard to the way in which we decide whether to pay in cash or in bonds, in the case of all compulsory acquisitions, payment is made in bonds but in the case of voluntary acquisition this can be either in bonds or cash. We endeavour to ensure, in so far as is possible, that the smaller vendor receives cash.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 10, before &ldquo;Senate&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;existing&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to cover the problem created for the Senate of National University of Ireland by the fact that procedure for initiating an election has not yet taken place while, at the same time, permitting the Senate to be renewed for an indefinite period.  There is some confusion here.  Perhaps I contributed to it myself by being inexplicit and not sufficiently informed.  The position is that it is legally possible in theory for the NUI Senate at this stage to initiate the procedure for election but in practice they would not feel able to undertake an election now because there is not sufficient time to initiate the procedure.  When I put this to the Minister the other day, I was thinking in terms of an actual legal time limit having run out&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I understood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>But I had an unclear understanding of the problem and my lack of clarity was, of course, communicated to the Minister.  The position is that the legal time limit has not been passed but that the Senate was informed at its meeting in April that, unless at that stage they took a decision to initiate then the proceedings necessary for an election, it would not be possible to do so.  It is to cope with the problem that arises from this that my amendment is designed &mdash; a problem that could arise by having let time run out and not having the necessary arrangements made with regard to the preparation of envelopes, printing and so on.  At the <Col N="855" /> same time, the amendment, if accepted, would prevent the present Senate continuing in existence for more than three months beyond its ordinary term of office.</P>
      <P>This is desirable for the reasons I stated on Second Stage.  These reasons were contradicted in part by some of the other speakers, notably by Deputy O'Kennedy.  The suggestion was even made that by referring to the possible dangers of the erosion of moral authority of the university bodies, I was in some way encouraging disorder.  I wish to make it quite clear that this is far from being the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister does.  I have been very concerned with this problem in one of our colleges and I have been deeply involved in trying to ensure that the ordinary life of the university is not disrupted. I would readily accept that the functions of the Senate of the NUI are so much less directly related to the life of the college and that the erosion of its authority is of much lesser importance than in the case of the Governing Body.  I do not wish to exaggerate the problem but there was a serious problem in the case of the Governing Body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past few months it has been possible for people in the college who were dissatisfied with the conditions to make the case that the fact that the Governing Body had been renewed at their own request by Government order deprived them of moral authority to govern the college effeclively. I readily agree that the problem is less with regard to the Senate than with regards the Governing Body. Nonetheless, it is a mistake to renew it longer than may be necessary to get over any practical problems of holding an election that may exist at this stage. It is for that reason that I put down this amendment and even at this stage I should like the Minister to reconsider the position.  When the proposal was put to the Minister that the Senate should be renewed in this way, he was, perhaps, unaware that the Governing Body was about to decide to have an election.  The Governing Body, whose <Col N="856" /> chairman is president of UCD and a member of the Senate, apparently, unanimously made this decision and the Minister and the Department might have taken a different view with regard to the Senate had they been aware at the time that the Governing Body would take this line.</P>
    <P>It is clear that at least some of those who took the decision to request the Bill took a different view later on when the Governing Body question arose and it seems possible that some or all of those who requested this Bill might have a different view at this point of time.  Certainly, I should like to hear a justification from anybody who voted for initiating this Bill while deciding not to remove the Governing Body.  It would appear that there has been a change of mind.  I do not think that anybody will attempt to justify extending the Senate and not extending the Governing Body &mdash; the fact is that the same people took different decisions at different times.</P>
    <P>There has been a change in the position since the Minister was first approached on this Bill.  The decision to seek the extension was made last January and during those six months some highly significant events have occurred.  Some of the people who voted unanimously to extend the life of the Senate have now voted against the extension of the life of the Governing Body.  Part of the Bill in its present form gives power to extend the life of the Senate for a year.  This is something which may no longer be desirable and it may not be wanted by all the people who sought it in the first instance.  This is a change of which the Minister should take cognisance. If this Bill goes through and the life of the Senate is renewed it could contribute to disorder.  It is likely to create a lesser problem than would have been the case had the Governing Body decided to renew itself for a further year. It is undesirable that any body in the university should be in a position of having sought its renewal and should be in a position to continue in office with the same personnel who were elected five years ago.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy corrected me on a legal point and I accept this correction as he is a practising barrister and <Col N="857" /> I am a non-practising one.  I made some reference to a Senate which had been extended as being one which would no longer be in the position of having been elected by due process of law that it would not be illegal.  If we in this House decide to extend the life of the Senate it would of course be legal.  My terminology was inaccurate in speaking on this point.  I was trying to convey, not that anybody could claim that a body which had been renewed by this House would lack legal authority, but that a body which was in the position of having sought this extension and of having sought to avoid an election would have diminished its moral authority.  It is not a question of the legality of the position if this House extended the life of the Senate.  That concept of moral authority being undermined by a request for extension is a simple principle, and I can assure the Minister there are many university students who understand that concept and who would be unhappy about working with a body which had sought and secured a renewal of its life and a renewal of office at a time when its own subordinate body had seen the light and agreed to hold and election.</P>
    <P>I would look for some justification from the Minister for the different approach adopted by the Senate to that adopted by the Governing Body. I accept that the Senate acted in good faith and did what they thought was right last January.  It was decided several months ago not to seek renewal in the case of the Governing Body.  The Minister should tell us why, when the Governing Body of UCD made that decision, the Senate has to be extended.  The argument used for extending the life of the Senate seems to me to be a dubious one. There seems to be a suggestion that if there was an election it would prejudice the reorganisation of the university system.  I cannot see this at all. The holding of an election would be the normal thing to do.  The abnormality which needs justification is the decision to extend the body.  It is obvious that the holding of an election requires justification.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is preparing to press <Col N="858" /> ahead with the proposal of the 6th July for a merger, the holding of an election does not prejudice the position at all.  It would merely be an admission that the proposed reorganisation will not be complete in time for a new election system to be in operation before this election is due.  The Minister has no intention of coming before the House with this reorganisation until the autumn.  He cannot introduce the measure until early November.  Even if he came up with such legislation and had got merger proposals from the Higher Education Authority on that point, which he will not have, that decision could not go through in time to have a new body in existence and the new Senate of the new universities elected until after the present Senate ceases to exist.  The present Senate will cease to exist on the 31st October.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot initiate the legislation until after the Senate goes out of existence.  Even if the merger proposals were not held up, even if proposals were published immediately and everyone decided they liked them, many months would elapse after the termination of the life of the Senate before new bodies would be in existence.  It would take over a year to have all the necessary arrangements made.  When one is faced with that reality it is unwise to extend the life of a body knowing that this extension is not to be for a matter of weeks or months, but for many months and perhaps for over a year.  Even if the Minister does not accept my contention that the merger is now seriously prejudiced, and if he is unaware of the consultations which have taken place and of the direction in which things are going, not only in the universities, he ought still to recognise that there is no prospect of the reorganisation being through in time to avoid a position where the present Senate would have to be kept in existence for one year or more.</P>
    <P>When the minimum period of the life of the new Senate is as long as one year there is no case for the extension of the life of the existing Senate.  The extension should not be for so long. In proceeding with this Bill the Minister <Col N="859" /> would not be prejudicing his merger proposal.  He would merely be acknowledging that it would take many months to look into all the points and to arrive at the point where we would have a new university and new university bodies.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy's arguments are not really valid against the points I have made.  I would readily concede that, if the Bill should merely give the Senate the power to extend itself for a few months in order to have a legal election, it would be highly prejudicial not to have one, but the Minister is aware that the Senate is a body which has power to co-opt members and to appoint members to the governing bodies of the colleges.  It is contended in the colleges, and not merely by the students but by the staff in authority, that this power of co-option might provide an answer to certain problems in the near future and prior to any general reorganisation of the university structure.</P>
    <P>There is a recognition that some student representation is now a matter of urgency.  Indeed, representation of junior staff is a matter of urgency also. They are excluded from these bodies unless they can get somebody outside to elect them.  They need representation also.  It is recognised in the university that it is going to take time to get all this reorganisation through.  We are going to be faced for the next academic year with having to work within the framework of the existing structure.  We have to apply some ingenuity to the problem of securing that, even within those structures, we become a little more representative and make some concessions to the legitimate demands of the junior staff and students for some representation on those bodies, from which they are totally excluded.  The mechanism by which that could actually be done, contemplated by the university authorities themselves at this point in time, is the power of co-option on those bodies.  Of course, so long as the bodies are in existence there are members there who have been co-opted but the power of co-option cannot be exercised until some of them are persuaded <Col N="860" /> to resign.  The possibility of using this power to give representation on a small scale to the junior staff and the students can only be exercised if there is an election.  We are now in the position where there is a body, which has been properly appointed, whose membership would, perhaps, reflect more accurately current thinking in regard to university problems than a body elected five years ago.  Such a body then has the opportunity of exercising this power of co-option to appoint representatives of the students and the junior staff to the body concerned.

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have indicated that at the beginning.  Extending the life of the existing bodies effectively means for the foreseeable future, at least for a year or more, that there is no prospect of the junior staff, who constitute two-thirds of the staff of the college, 70 per cent of the total staff in our college and a somewhat smaller percentage but still a very substantial proportion in the other colleges, and the students having any representation on the Senate of the National University of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must surely realise how difficult it is at this point to persist in a situation in which no representation exists.  It will be difficult enough to persuade the junior staff and the students that the exercise of the power <Col N="861" /> of co-option is in their favour in regard to their representation on this and other bodies as it does not appear to represent any adequate concession over this period.  I do not look forward to the task of trying to persuade people, who are at this stage extremely unhappy with their total exclusion from having any decision in the present running of their college, to accept such a limited concession for what could be quite a long period of time but I certainly will try to do so. But to tell them that the possibility of having representation on the Senate of the National University of Ireland has been dropped by an unnecessary decision to extend the life of the existing Senate and ask them in those circumstances not to press their demands and not to agitate further will be extremely difficult.  In fact, it will be virtually impossible.</P>
    <P>I have some experience of this.  I have had over the last few months the experience of trying to persuade people that they should adopt constitutional means of seeking reform, that they should work under the existing system so long as it is there and seek to change it by constitutional means and that they should not beat their heads against a wall by demanding things which cannot be done at this point in time.  The only way in which the events of February and March of this year in University College, Dublin, were brought to a happy ending was by holding out to the students the prospect that the existing system could be modified in a way which would solve the situation but to take a gratuitous action, which is totally unnecessary, will close off that possibility as far as the students are concerned and will make it less likely in their view that the appointments to the Governing Body of University College by the Senate will provide additional representation of this kind.  This will create a very difficult situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister will appreciate, quite apart from the question of co-option to the Senate itself, that the Senate has power of appointment with regard to the governing bodies of the colleges. It is hoped in our college, and I am sure in the other colleges, that the new Governing Body which will be elected <Col N="862" /> in the autumn of this year and will take office in the early part of next year, will exercise their power of co-option in regard to representation in a situation in which 70 per cent of the staff and 100 per cent of the students have no representation whatever.  It would be our hope also that the Senate of the National University would exercise their appointment to the Governing Body, would not follow the normal convention which has been followed hitherto by appointing people whose names are suggested by the president of the college, which is what has happened in practice for a long time past, but that they would exercise this power in such a manner as to provide further representation for those people in the college, who are almost totally unrepresented at present.</P>
    <P>It seems unlikely that this power will be exercised in this way if the Senate, which will be called on to exercise this power of appointment to the Governing Body of UCD, is the present Senate, the Senate which have already by their actions five years ago shown that they are not prepared to depart from the existing convention and will exercise this power of appointment in accordance with the proposals of the president of the college concerned with a view to appointing people whom they wish to see appointed.  We know that this Senate, although an alternative proposal was put to them at the relative meeting five years ago, rejected the proposal and followed the convention established by the three colleges, the horse-trading convention, under which the authority of each college of the Senate supported the authority of the college in question in exercising the power of appointment in a manner which suits them.</P>
    <P>We know the Senate have done that. We, therefore, have good reason to believe they are likely to do the same thing again.  To extend the life of the Senate which have shown they have exercised their power in this way so that they will have an opportunity of doing the same thing again next January or February is utterly wrong. If the election was held in the ordinary way we could have a Senate which would be much more likely to want to exercise this power in a manner designed <Col N="863" /> to secure representation for the unrepresented bodies than the present body which is likely again to do something which will create unnecessary problems and difficulties.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that the Minister has been aware of all those problems.  It is, perhaps, asking too much even of a Minister who has been in office for a good while to know about the intricacies not only of the legal position of our colleges but also the conventions under which they are likely to operate, but to expect a Minister, as recently appointed as the present Minister, to understand those conventions, and to know how they have been exercised in the past, is, perhaps, asking too much.  I must not be unfair to the Minister in suggesting he ought to have known of those facts.  I put them to him now so that he will know the position and can check the veracity of what I have said.  He should not persist with this measure where we will be in the position that the new Governing Body of UCD will have their Senate appointments made by the existing Senate and the possibility that they will now use the election in the same manner as they did the last time is something which we should try to avoid if at all possible.</P>
    <P>It is for those reasons, which, perhaps, I did not explain in detail on Second Reading, as I was a bit hesitant to take up too much of the time of the House, as I thought if I summarised the position I would get my points across, that I have now explained the position more fully, because it seems necessary to do so.  I am concerned we do not in this Bill do anything more than the minimum necessary to facilitate the National University of Ireland in carrying out the proper legal procedures in which they now find difficulty in doing so and the possibility of not having them left there for too long.  I am hopeful that the Senate themselves would now reconsider their decision to seek a renewal at this point in time in view of the position of the Governing Body of the Senate.  I believe the Senate were meeting this morning but I do not know whether this is so or not. It is for those reasons I press the <Col N="864" /> amendments with the Minister and ask him to give them consideration.</P>
    <P>I would also ask, although this, perhaps, would come in on the section, to make it clear what, in fact, is the effect of the Bill?  Am I right in thinking that the Bill in its present form not alone allows the present Senate to be renewed for 12 months but allows it to be renewed indefinitely for 12 month periods thereafter at their request? Perhaps, the Minister might explain that also when replying.</P>

      <P>I think I fully appreciate what the Deputy had in mind in relation to the first amendment.  I can assure him that I do not foresee any circumstances, other than those existing at present, which would call for an extension of the life of the present membership of the Senate.  I did find it necessary, however, when I got this amendment, to see what the legal position would be in relation to it.  I am informed that it could possibly be misleading. I am advised that the Senate is always in existence.  In those particular circumstances, perhaps, it really does not mean anything.  Therefore, I think we could leave it out.  I think I know what the Deputy meant. That is why I replied in this way to say that I do not contemplate any circumstances, other than existing ones, whereby there would be an extension of life given to the membership of the Senate.</P>

I thought that if the principle in it was acceptable we might devise, between us, a formula.

      <P>I appreciate that the Minister's criticism of my amendment is probably a fair one but I am not happy with the assurance.  The Minister will recall that in about 1940 the Act was introduced to enable the Government to extend the life of the Governing Body of UCD.  Now, my <Col N="866" /> historical researches do not extend to the detailed reasons for that but I have been informed that it was related in some way to the war-time conditions then prevailing which would have made postal elections &mdash; I suppose, overseas&mdash; difficult.  That power was introduced for that purpose and quite possibly, for all I know, it was used two years ago in totally different circumstances.  I do not think we could proceed by way of ministerial assurance.  I should prefer, in the light of the Minister's criticism of my amendment, to propose &mdash; perhaps on Report Stage &mdash; a better amendment which would achieve my objective by some phrase such as &ldquo;...the term of office of the members of the Senate of the National University of Ireland elected on (whatever was the appropriate date) ...&rdquo; which would make it clear that it applies to this Senate.  I think that would get over the difficulty which the Minister very properly sees in the word &ldquo;existing&rdquo; and perhaps he would study that and accept it?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have made it clear, on my Second Reading speech, that I feel that the life of the Senate should be extended so as to give us the opportunity of bringing in the omnibus legislation.  The Deputy has referred to the Governing Body and compared it with the Senate.  He has suggested that because the Governing Body is holding elections he can see no reason why the Senate should not do likewise.  However, the Senate, as the Deputy is aware, comprises representatives of all the colleges whereas the Governing Body of UCD is concerned only with that particular college.  Therefore, what the Governing Body of UCD might decide to do need not necessarily be a <Col N="867" /> headline for the Senate.  In fact, the representatives of the other colleges might have a completely different viewpoint on this.  In any case, while it is a fact that the Senate requested, about last January, that this measure be adopted, I think, as the Deputy said, they have not, since then, suggested that they were not going ahead with this request.</P>
      <P>I feel, also, that holding elections at this particular time on a structure which seems to satisfy nobody would only give the impression that we were putting the whole legislation on the long finger.  The Deputy says that there is no reason for not holding the election. I feel that there is no particular reason why the election should be on a structure which has roundly been condemned by himself, if I might say so, and does not appear to satisfy anybody. Therefore, the passage of a relatively short space of time cannot make all the differences that the Deputy has enunciated here in his speech.  Therefore, I do not feel that I should accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister now, and I think on the Second Stage, made this reference to its being necessary&mdash; to facilitate the reorganisation of the new university system, or something like this.  I do not see that it in any way facilitates it.  It has no effect on it, one way or another, in fact.  The other point he made is perhaps one with some psychological bearing in that he argued that if we hold the election this might give people an impression that this present structure is to be maintained and it might in some way reflect on the likelihood of the merger going through.  I can see some point in that. I can understand, perhaps, that that is why the Government have accepted this request from the Senate &mdash; the feeling that it would get over that difficulty because of doubts cast on the merger.  The Minister probably knows what is going on in that respect.  I can see a certain Government sensitivity on that issue.  I do think that that is rather an inadequate reason for doing something for which there are other reasons against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does seem to me that the onus of <Col N="868" /> proof in any democratic system lies on those who advocate that an election should not be held at the time it is normally due.  I do not have to prove that it should be held: it is for the Minister to give reasons &mdash; and pretty cogent reasons &mdash; for modifying the democratic structure of the university and for preventing an election from being held which would give us a more representative body.  I have given what I think are reasonably strong reasons for feeling that there should be an election &mdash; reasons which are not only theoretical on democratic grounds but which are practical as well because we have these problems of securing representation of certain interests on the bodies governing the university and its colleges.  The desirability of doing this is clear, I think, and is accepted by everybody.  The urgency of doing it should also be clear in view of the events of the past few months.  I have given those reasons and they, together with the basic theoretical argument in favour of the working of the democratic system rather than its being operated in this way, should be sufficient unless the Minister produces cogent reasons to the contrary.  The only reason he has really given is that it might in some way suggest that the merger was not going to go through.  That kind of politico-psychological argument seems to me quite inadequate in the face of the realities of the situation.  I do not think the Minister has discharged the onus of proof in relation to his proposed legislation.  Accordingly, I think my amendment should be accepted.  I should like the Minister to consider it still further.</P>

      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to deal with Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="876" /> While I appreciate and share the Deputy's concern about housing estates which have not been properly completed and which, because of this, have not yet been taken in charge by the planning authorities concerned, I do not feel that the setting up of an inquiry as suggested by the Deputy would serve much purpose.  The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, went as far as it could in enabling planning authorities to apply the enforcement powers in the Act to cases where estates were developed on the basis of permissions granted under the Planning Act of 1934.  It has, however, become increasingly clear that these enforcement powers are not going to provide a solution in cases where, for example, the terms of the original permission were vague or imprecise or where the developers have died or gone out of business.  I have been pressing the planning authorities concerned to take whatever other action is open to them to clear up the residue of these older cases and I intend to continue to do so. As regards Dublin County Council, I have been informed that they have settled on a fixed programme which should result in the clearance of practically all the older cases in a comparatively short time.  In the Dún Laoghaire area, the problem does not appear to be quite so formidable but I intend to call for special reports on all outstanding cases there.</P>
    <P>The powers conferred by the 1963 Act should be effective in preventing a recurrence of the problem of unfinished estates in the future.  As regards the older type of case which I mentioned earlier, I intend to keep the position under review to see what further action is necessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The port authority are subject to planning control in the normal way except for certain works <Col N="877" /> authorised by a harbour works order made by the Minister for Transport and Power under the Harbours Act, 1946, and some other minor harbour works for which exemptions were provided in the Exempted Development Regulations made by me under the 1963 Act.</P>
      <P>It was, however, brought to my notice some time ago that a building development at North Wall extension was undertaken without planning permission and I was informed that permission was not sought because of some legal doubt as to the applicability of the Act to certain reclaimed areas in the vicinity of the port.  If such a doubt exists, it will be necessary to promote amending legislation to deal with it; in the normal way, the amendment would be incorporated in the next general Local Government Bill.</P>
      <P>The overall position about development in Dublin port has been considered recently by the Government and it was decided, <i>inter alia,</i> to seek an assurance from the board that they, or their lessees or assignees, would not seek to take advantage again of a legal technicality to circumvent the requirements of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, in the matter of obtaining planning permission for building development or other unexempted forms of development. I am informed that this assurance has been sought and obtained by the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>

If there was a possibility of having only one, the remedial legislation should have been introduced before the expiration of the term of appointment of one of the existing taxing masters.  As of now, there is a mandatory and inescapable obligation to have two taxing masters.  Will the <Col N="881" /> Minister further have regard to the fact that not only is there a mandatory obligation to have two taxing masters, but that each taxing master must consult with the other and that, while there is only one, it is impossible for him to consult with someone who does not exist?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 19 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>As I wished to make early contact with the Governments of the Six and with the EEC Commission, I had discussions with the Belgian Foreign Minister, M. Pierre Harmel, M. Jean Rey, President of the Commission and Signor Eduardo Martino, Commissioner in charge of External Relations, and with Dr. Joseph Luns, Netherlands Foreign Minister and current Chairman of the Council of the EEC.  I also had discussions with Mr. Stewart, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all my discussions I reiterated Ireland's continuing deep interest in membership of the EEC at the earliest opportunity.  I expressed concern at the suggestion which had been voiced in certain quarters that enlargement of the community should be approached by stages and that Britain should be admitted first, leaving the position of the other three applicants for settlement at a later stage.  I explained the serious consequences this would have for the Irish economy and emphasised our <Col N="883" /> desire that our negotiations should commence simultaneously with those of Britain, and that our accession to the Communities should take place at the same time as that of Britain.</P>
    <P>From all my discussions I received the general impression that the possibility of enlargement of the communities has again become a live issue and that a decision on the question of opening negotiations might be taken within the coming six months.</P>
    <P>I received assurances of support for our application from all the EEC personalities to whom I spoke and, as for the question of enlargement to Seven first, I found no evidence of official support for this.</P>
    <P>I subsequently had conversations yesterday in Dublin with Mr. Jahn, State Secretary in the Federal German Foreign Ministry.  He assured me of full German support for our position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask was the Minister surprised to read in this morning's newspapers the views attributed to the Monet group on the question of a community of seven States?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not surprised.  The suggestion has been raised in certain quarters and I was aware that Monsieur Monet was keen on a community of seven.  My meetings with the Foreign Ministers was worthwhile because I was able to make it quite clear that we did not accept the idea of a community of seven in any way &mdash; that it would be very serious for our economy if Britain were admitted at an earlier stage than we were.  I found strong support from the Belgian Foreign Minister and the German representative.  I pointed out that our stand now is what it was in 1967 &mdash; that we felt there should be negotiations for the four applicant States at the same time.  I explained to Dr. Luns what the Irish people want and he said that he would make it clear to all his colleagues &mdash; he is meeting Monsieur Schumann tomorrow and there is a meeting of the Commission later in the month &mdash; that they should look after our interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Our position has not changed under the Treaty of Rome and under our agreement to undertake the obligations involved in that. The Minister for Finance dealt with the question of defence before his visit to Europe with the Taoiseach in 1967, and he was able to approach the other people in the community in the knowledge that this House passed the motion unanimously before the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach went.  This is on record.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask a second and final supplementary.  To assist the Minister, I wish to point out that it had been hoped that our entry to the EEC would proceed simultaneously with tariff reductions under the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain.  In view of the fact that we are to have substantial reductions of these tariffs by mid-1970, when they can have a growing and biting impact on Irish industry, are we not to have an indication when we will enter the EEC? Will the Ministers for External Affairs and Finance get together and spell out the implications&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Although there is a belief that there is a change of attitude in Europe &mdash; there is slight optimism that the next six months will bring about negotiations &mdash; I am not quite sure that negotiations will take place in that time.  Although we have had a white paper, I think there is a case for a re-statement of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the <Col N="886" /> statement in regard to the Monet Committee, will the Minister state his attitude to Irish representation on that body so as to ensure that this type of misunderstanding will not arise again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Because we are committed to join Europe, I think the Irish voice should be heard in any influential place that affects our application. I have said before that membership of the Monet Committee is by invitation to all the individual political parties and trade unions of the countries concerned. I can speak for my party when I say that we should like to be represented in any body with an influential voice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance why the Revenue Commissioners, with reference to a letter received by them enclosing a tax reserve certificate and a cheque in payment of income tax, acknowledged in writing receipt of the cheque but not the certificate; why the Revenue Commissioners say that it takes up to a month to acknowledge payments by way of tax reserve certificates; and when the Revenue Commissioners will reform their methods of receipting all payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a cheque and a tax reserve certificate are received in payment of income tax, the cheque is dealt with in the cash office and normally a formal receipt for the amount of the cheque is issued within a day.  The tax reserve certificate has necessarily to be processed in a separate clerical section and an acknowledgment of its receipt is issued within a further day.  A formal receipt for the amount of the tax being paid by tax reserve certificate is issued at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tax reserve certificates have to be forwarded to the Central Bank for encashment and calculation of interest; and the amount has to be remitted to the Revenue Commissioners for preparation and issue of formal receipts for the actual payments.  This procedure takes on the average about 14 days to complete.  In the circumstances, and in view of the fact that an acknowledgment <Col N="887" /> of the receipt of the tax reserve certificate has already issued, the time taken to issue the formal receipt is not regarded as excessive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister have arrangements made so that the acknowledgment of the tax reserve certificate goes out with the receipt for the cheque?  If there is a lapse, as there has been on many occasions, of several days, between the acknowledgment of the receipt of the cheque and the acknowledgment of the receipt of the tax reserve certificate, doubts and misunderstandings do arise, and I am sure the Minister, as an accountant, will appreciate that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy has in mind estates which did not exceed £5,000 net in value and which, consequently, were not liable to duty. No precise information is available as to the number of such cases but it is thought to be in the region of 10,000 per year.  The cost of processing cases of this kind is not available, but it can be said that, in general, they occupy very little official time.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the number of changes in Estate Duty Office forms in the last <Col N="889" /> three years; the number and rank of people engaged on redrafting forms; the purpose which it is hoped to serve by the changes; how many more changes are planned; and why no provision was made in the new forms for recording the reference numbers of the persons presenting such forms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The answers to the Deputy's questions, taken in the order in which they are set out, are as follows:</P>
      <P>1.  The size of the forms for Inland Revenue affidavits and Inland Revenue accounts has been reduced to foolscap size.</P>
      <P>To cater for small estates in single-leaf, a simple form of Inland Revenue affidavit has been introduced.</P>
      <P>The fastening of multi-leaved forms has been altered to facilitate solicitors in having typecopies made.</P>
      <P>So far as possible legacy duty and succession duty accounts have been amalgamated so as to reduce the number of forms in use.  The lay-out of forms has, so far as practicable, been simplified.</P>
      <P>The process of amalgamating forms and of getting rid of obsolete ones necessitated the renumbering of all forms.  A list giving a description of the forms and their new numbers is available in the Estate Duty Branch.</P>
      <P>2.  The task of reviewing forms, and where necessary redrafting them, is a minor part of the duties of a senior examiner.  Apart from incidental typing no other staff is involved.</P>
      <P>3.  The reduction in size and the alteration in the fastening of multiple-leaved forms are designed to facilitate solicitors as regards type-copying, photocopying and filing.  The reduction in the number of forms in use will reduce the stock of forms they need to carry.</P>
      <P>4.  No further immediate changes are in contemplation but the question is one which is under constant review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="890" /> 5.  All correspondence, forms, headed note-paper, query sheets and similar matter (except the present stock of acknowledgment cards) carry a space for the solicitor's reference number.</P>
    <P>Forms of Inland Revenue affidavit and account when first lodged are, in practice, accompanied by a covering letter which shows the solicitor's reference number.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In referring to the outlook for 1969 in my Budget Speech on 7th May last, I pointed out that the balance of payments deficit was likely to be about £55 million, or £40 to £45 million if one excludes imports of aircraft which will be financed in the first instance by foreign borrowing. Two further sets of monthly trade figures have become available since that statement and these accord with this forecast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present situation is not such as in my view to warrant remedial action. As I indicated at budget time, the expected deficit, although exceptionally large, must be seen against the background of such factors as our strong external reserve position, the likelihood of a continuing capital inflow and the upsurge in investment.  If, however, <Col N="892" /> developments took place in the coming months which seemed likely to raise the balance of payments deficit much above £55 million, a different situation would arise which could call for corrective measures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he considers it in the national interest to introduce a capital gains tax where land required for essential social purposes is sold on a speculative basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be in the national interest to introduce such a tax because the tax would, in the long run, be passed on to the purchaser and the end result would be to increase the cost of land for essential social purposes.</P>
      <P>Attempts by other countries to impose a tax in the form of levies have not been particularly successful in keeping down the price of building land and they have given rise to many anomalies in practice.  We tried, in the Finance Act, 1965, to charge to income tax the profits arising from land or building development but this proved to be unworkable in practice and gave rise to unintended and unforeseen tax liabilities.  It became necessary last year to restrict its application to profits arising from a business of dealing in or developing land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="894" /> On general principles, a levy on capital gains should extend to gains on the realisation of capital assets of any description, including land.  The Commission on Income Taxation examined this question and concluded that the grave disadvantages associated with a capital gains tax left them no option but to recommend that it should not be introduced.</P>
    <P>The most effective way of countering speculation in scarce building land is to increase the available supply and to encourage local authorities to acquire a pool of land well in advance of requirements.  An adequate supply of such land would greatly reduce the scope for profitable speculation.  This is the course the Government have been following and which they propose to pursue further in accordance with the policy set out in the White Paper &ldquo;Housing in the Seventies&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware of the unavailability of land for social purposes and surely he is equally aware that it is now well over ten years since the Commission on Income Taxation recommended there was no necessity for such a tax.  In the interval there must have been changes involving the national interest.  Conscious of the considerable public interest in this matter, and of the fact that a land development tax has been introduced in Britain, surely his Department might usefully consider setting up a committee, departmental or inter-departmental, to examine this question and report&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in view of the fact that speculators can make tax gains from land in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good deal involved in this.  We are watching the situation very closely and, without being unduly critical I would say that the results of the working of the Land Commission in Britain have not been satisfactory by any means and that certainly does not seem to be the ideal way of dealing with this matter.  I believe, and the Government have been <Col N="895" /> following a policy based on this belief, that the right way to eliminate speculation in land and to ensure that the price of land for building and other essential social purposes is kept at a tolerable level is by making more land available.  By the way, I think there is a great deal of misconception about speculation in land in the form of persons buying land and selling that land again at a profit.  The extent to which this is happening is grossly exaggerated.  What we need is not just land, but more serviced land, and we have in each of the last three years given Dublin Corporation £1 million over and above their normal allocation to enable them to buy land.  We have also encouraged them by making money available to them to service these lands.</P>
      <P>Ultimately, I believe that is the best way of dealing with this problem.  The solution is to make a great deal more serviced land available for builders so that they can build houses.  The Minister for Local Government has been encouraging local authorities to look well ahead and even to go outside their own boundaries to buy land well in advance of their needs so that they can buy it at a reasonable price and have it available when required.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief. Where land is purchased and subsequently a local authority adds massive servicing to the land and this becomes known and anticipated by those purchasing the land, does there not arise in the national interest a situation in which some form of registration or <Col N="896" /> some surveillance by the Revenue Commissioners will be necessary to ensure that certain people will not benefit by such investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any problem there.  Where a person buys land and sells it again that would almost certainly attract liability to normal income tax and there would be no need to have a capital gains tax in such a case.  Certainly, if a person did that twice in succession, he could be shown to be carrying on a business of dealing in land; and, even if it were only one isolated transaction, where a person bought land and did nothing else with it except sell it again at a profit, an assessment could be raised in such a case under the ordinary income tax law.</P>

      <P>The general question of industrial financing, of which the establishment of a private development bank is but one aspect, has been the subject of discussion with the International Finance Corporation and Irish financial interests.  The whole question is still under consideration but the view being formed is that it would be preferable to proceed by way of a loose type of consortium as the best means of mobilising capital for industry.  This alternative is being explored with the various financial interests concerned, including the IFC., and I am hopeful that improved arrangements for industrial financing will emerge.</P>

      <P>When the school was built in 1963 a regional water supply scheme was under consideration but it was necessary to provide a temporary supply from a nearby river pending developments regarding the regional scheme.  In fact, the regional scheme did not mature.  The temporary supply gave trouble due to siltation in the river and in 1967 a grant was sanctioned to enable the manager to provide a new water supply by sinking a well on the site at an estimated cost of £500.  The well was sunk in August, 1968, at a cost of £250. About that time it was learned that a group water scheme for the area was proposed, but it was not clear when the supply would be available.  In the event it was sanctioned in November, 1968. The school is under the control of the manager.  At no time has he suggested that the group scheme should be used to service the school.  The matter was discussed with the manager within the past few days by officials of the Department of Education and of the Office of Public Works but the manager confirms that he will not join the group scheme.</P>

The position is that the well is sunk; the house for the pump is built but the pump is not yet installed.  The amount spent already is £422 and the further cost, when completed, will be £184, making a total of £606.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 46 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from Dublin Port and Docks Board that the oil pollution referred to was caused by an accidental spillage from a storage tank at one of the oil companies' depots on 1st July, 1969.  Some of the oil flowed into the waters of the harbour and steps were immediately taken by the board's fire protection inspectors and engineering <Col N="904" /> staff to clear up the spillage.  The contamination was cleared by the evening of that day with the exception of a small area which later appeared and was dispersed on the 3rd July.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Port and Docks Board have in force approved bye-laws regulating the discharging, loading, handling, storage and distribution of petroleum at the Port of Dublin.  Contravention of the bye-laws is an offence for which a person on conviction is liable to a fine not exceeding £10.  In addition, the Oil Pollution of the Sea Act, 1956, makes it an offence to discharge oil into the sea.  A person committing such an offence is liable to a fine not exceeding £5,000.</P>
    <P>My predecessor set up a working party to advise on what measures should be taken to deal with serious oil pollution affecting Irish territorial and adjoining seas and beaches.  The report of the group has just been submitted to me and I shall have to consider its findings before deciding what further measures should be taken both to guard against oil pollution and to clear up any pollution that might occur.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister definitely established the firm that was responsible for this oil pollution and can he say if those owners of boats in the area who are put to considerable expense in repairing and repainting their boats will receive compensation from the firm responsible for this oil pollution?</P>

They made contact straight away with the Dublin Port and Docks Board and the matter was cleared up, as I have stated.  Any civil matter concerning legal liability or otherwise is entirely a matter for the person concerned and the company.</P>

But there was a further scum revealed on 3rd July, two days afterwards, and that was cleared as well.  It is a matter for legal settlement between anybody who may feel prejudiced and the company concerned.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Dublin Port and Docks Board that they arranged with Dublin Corporation to construct an embankment stage by stage in advance of filling in by the corporation in the area in question.  As part of this arrangement it was agreed with the corporation that as and when the corporation tipping extended past the end of the embankment the board would face the filling with dry filling.  The board state that the necessity to carry out this facing work has not yet arisen as the line of corporation filling has not yet reached the end of the embankment.</P>
      <P>In view, however, of the uncertainty which appears to have arisen in the matter, I propose to seek the corporation's observations with a view to resolving the problem.</P>

      <P>No mechanically propelled vessel may carry more than twelve passengers regardless of whether it is plying for hire or not, unless it holds a valid passenger certificate issued under the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Acts.  Vessels required to hold such certificates must be surveyed annually by a surveyor of my Department.  A passenger certificate <Col N="912" /> issued on the basis of such a survey stipulates the number of persons, crew and passengers which the vessel may carry, the limits within which it may ply, and the weather and other conditions in which the vessel may carry passengers.  The passenger certificate must be displayed in a conspicuous position on board the vessel.  The Garda Síochána who are responsible for enforcing the law in this matter are notified of the issue of all such passenger certificates.  Any breach of the requirements of the passenger certificate renders the owner and the master of the vessel liable to prosecution and, on conviction, to heavy penalties. Thirty-one passenger certificates are currently in force.</P>
      <P>Attention is directed regularly by my Department to the safety obligations of owners and masters of passenger vessels including vessels carrying not more than twelve passengers and sea angling vessels, in regard to the carriage of passengers, by the issue of marine notices and circulars.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1962 the then Taoiseach gave an undertaking to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions regarding the setting up of a working party to consider how, without conflicting with the Supreme Court judgment referred to, a trade union might have the right to <Col N="913" /> take action, including picketing, to enforce union membership.  The working party was duly set up.  He later gave an undertaking to officers of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to submit the report of the working party to the Government and ask for approval in principle to give effect to it and to so inform congress.  This undertaking was honoured.  My predecessor explained in 1966 that it was the intention that the proposed legislation would be taken at the same time as the Industrial Relations Bill and the Trade Union Bill.</P>
      <P>However, apart from the question of whether legislation in this matter would conflict with the Constitution, the position about picketing has changed substantially since the undertakings referred to were given.  Trade union leaders themselves have been expressing serious concern about the manner in which the picket weapon is now being abused. In my view, legislation to extend the protection of picketing would not be justified in present circumstances and I agree with my predecessor that action on the proposed Bill should be deferred.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister advise the House as to what extent the position has very considerably changed as he alleges which would warrant the withdrawal of a particular undertaking given?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree that the passage of time has revealed a number of weaknesses in the picketing system and the members of the ICTU themselves were the first to agree that it would be wrong to deal with one particular aspect in isolation and leave other more important aspects out.  If the ICTU were willing, I would be prepared to have a full-scale review of the whole question of the law relating to picketing with them and employer bodies with a view to getting agreement on what should be the proper line to take.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister say what the point would be in doing this in view of the fact that an undertaking <Col N="914" /> given on two occasions by the Taoiseach and by his predecessor on at least one occasion, perhaps in good faith, has not been honoured by the Government?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as I can see, the undertaking given by the former Taoiseach was honoured in so far as it was possible to do so; but it is not good enough to try and blame the Government for a breach of faith when the actual passage of time reveals a number of things which would make it wise not to proceed rapidly with the fulfilment of any promise or any undertaking given at that time.

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

Is it not the case that the export of those goods has been growing as a result of the agreement by about £1½ million per annum and which had been static at a very negligible figure before it?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 72-73 together.  I take it that both questions refer primarily to the reduction of protection under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware we have undertaken, in accordance with the terms of the FTAA, to eliminate protective duties and quantitative restrictions on industrial products from the UK by progressive reductions over the period up to July 1975.</P>
      <P>It is expected that increased export opportunities, the more attractive climate for industrial investment, and the improved efficiency of Irish industry, will offset the effect of increased competition in the home market.</P>
      <P>The operation of the agreement as it affects industry is, however, kept under constant review in my Department. Special difficulties which may arise for individual industries are, of course, examined, if they occur, with a view to seeking an appropriate solution, as provided for in the Agreement, as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the distributive trade of the country is becoming more and more foreign controlled, resulting in a vast increase in the amount of foreign goods on sale; and if he will take steps to counteract this dangerous trend which <Col N="924" /> constitutes a serious threat to home producers and to employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to retain a sense of proportion when looking at the question of foreign control in the distributive sector.  The most authoritative estimate we have is that of the NIEC, which estimated in January, 1968, that some 6 per cent of retail trade was handled by firms owned and controlled outside the country.  Such information as is available to me suggests that, of total sales, the proportion of Irish goods sold by foreign-owned stores is not much lower than the proportion sold by Irish-owned stores.  The present degree of foreign ownership, therefore, can hardly be regarded as constituting a serious threat to home producers and to employment.  Nevertheless, I am conscious of the possible dangers to our economy inherent in a concentration of foreign ownership in certain trades in certain areas and the possibility that a relatively few takeovers in some sectors might radically alter the position and in the possibility that, with falling levels of protection, the buying policies of foreign-owned concerns may be changed to our detriment. Therefore, as I have previously announced, I am keeping the position under review, and will be prepared to take action swiftly if at any time it appears to be called for.  The circumstances calling for action, and international and other constraints on action, which may vary from time to time, have to be taken into account and I would not wish at this stage to say what form the corrective measures are likely to take.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a variety of State aids and incentives of which Irish distributors are availing themselves in order to become more efficient and competitive in business.  Under the scheme of Technical Assistance Grants operated by my Department, grants of up to 50 per cent of the cost are made available towards providing consultancy services for distributors on a collective basis and towards visits abroad by representatives of the distributive trades to study aspects of distribution.  Grants of the same proportion are available from An Chomhairle Oiliúna towards the attendance of managerial and supervisory personnel at training courses and seminars.  The Industrial Credit Company provides loans to suitable applicants for the acquisition, extension and renovation of business premises. The Irish National Productivity Committee operates an advisory service for the distributive trades and organises and promotes training courses for shop assistants and apprentices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the smaller trader is helped in these ways to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of his operations, he is also entitled to expect reasonable protection against possible misuse of the economic power of dominant enterprises, with large financial resources, whether Irish or foreign controlled, leading to unfair trading practices. Legislation to amend the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, which I intend to introduce during the next <Col N="926" /> session of the Dáil, contains provisions which, I trust, will improve the machinery of the Fair Trade Commission in dealing with complaints of unfair trading practices.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if the Government has made any decision in regard to the conclusion of the Buchanan Report that the pursuit of existing industrial policies would reduce the population of this country seventeen years hence by 140,000 below the level that could be attained by a policy of developing growth centres throughout the country, and that 121,100 of this avoidable loss of population would occur in the western half of the country; and, if so, on what expert advice it has made such a decision; and if he is prepared to elaborate on the statements already made by him in regard to the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, on 19th May, 1969, indicated that the Buchanan consultants' growth centres recommendations should further be <Col N="928" /> studied in the light of regional development generally.  This study is still proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister reject the suggestion in the Buchanan Report that the adoption of its policies would increase the population by 140,000 over the level that would otherwise be attained and that 121,000 of this would be in the west of Ireland? If he accepts this contention, why is he in any doubt about accepting the report, in view of the obvious desirability of accelerating the growth of the population in the western part of the country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already indicated, on some occasions publicly, not only is the study to which I have referred going on but it is my personal belief that some of the bases on which the recommendations of the report were made do not now apply or that the effect of the growth pattern envisaged by the consultants is not, in fact, what is taking place in the country at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is.  It was part of the consultants' report that it was proposed to develop growth centres to accelerate growth.  Is the Minister suggesting that what is happening now is different from what they said would happen if their recommendations were accepted?  Is he saying that that is a reason for not accepting the recommendations?  It sounds completely nonsensical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am suggesting is that recommendations were made in the belief that the growth pattern in the future would be of a certain kind.  They did not envisage what, in fact, is happening in the country today.  If they had done so, they might &mdash; I am not saying they would &mdash; have arrived at a different conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that what has happened in a matter of months since the report was completed &mdash; less than a year &mdash; is of such a character as to invalidate their assessment of what would happen over the next 17 years &mdash; because that would be highly improbable?</P>

      <P>Both the recommendations involved and the altered pattern that has now emerged are both of vital concern to the future of this country. To dismiss the change in the pattern as being of no account or as being of minor account would be to make a very grave mistake both on an economic and a social basis.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in the statement issued by the Government on 19th May, 1969, it was decided that the recommendations about growth centres in the Buchanan Report should be further considered in the context of proposals for regional development generally.  This consideration is proceeding and according as it is necessary I will convey my views to the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Industrial Development Authority must surely be aware of any changes in the recent characteristics of growth patterns in the country and in view of the fact that the Minister has indicated that such changes have occurred, surely it should now be possible for the Minister to give a firm indication of his personal attitude to this particular report as he seems to be at variance with the Government in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the Deputy may be under a misapprehension. I presume he has read the Government statement in regard to the Buchanan Report.  If he has done so, he will have noted that it set out the regions into which the country is being divided for the purpose of industrial development.  It also set out the fact that the IDA was setting up units in each of these regions and specifying the kind of work that would be done in them.  I want to assure the House that, of course, the decision of <Col N="931" /> the Government is at present being implemented by the IDA.  The consideration of the recommendation of the Buchanan Report about the major national growth centres in no way interferes with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us whether he is, in fact, reviewing the position in the light of developments since the report was prepared? Can he tell us whether he will consult with the Buchanan team themselves in regard to these changes?  It is highly desirable that any fresh assessment, based on fresh information, should have the benefit of their expert advice.  There should be no doubts in anybody's mind as to the motivation for any change in policy. It would carry great weight, I think the Minister would agree, if, in fact, any modification in policy announced by him were known to have the support of the consultants themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may rest assured that in the further study to which I have referred the Government will have regard to all relevant information and consideration.  I would repeat something which I have had occasion to say here before: the Deputy will be aware of it because he referred to it while he was in the other House.  It is that, whatever recommendations we may get from Buchanan or elsewhere the ultimate decision in these matters, particularly in such an important matter as this, will be the Government's and the responsibility will be the Government's.  The question as to whether the decision made conforms to the recommendation of the report of Buchanan or of anybody else is, in my view, only one minor matter.  The ultimate decision is that of the Government and the responsibility is on the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that if the Government's decision in its modified form had the support of the consultants, if they accepted it &mdash; if it was known that the <Col N="932" /> consultants accepted it &mdash; if it was known that in fact, the assumption on which they had worked had been modified and that this justified the Government in changing the decision &mdash; that fact would make the Government's decision that much more acceptable to everybody and would carry that much more weight?</P>

      <P>A committee was set up in March, 1968 to examine, when requested by me, the problems arising for an industry in a situation of falling tariffs where the rates of tariff on the finished product and raw materials appear not to be in correct relationship and to make recommendations to me on the courses of action calculated to provide the best solution having regard to all the interests involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four cases&mdash;all in the textile field&mdash; were referred to the committee and reports have been received, the most recent one within the last two weeks. One of the principal recommendations made in the first three reports could not be acted upon, without the agreement of the British authorities, as it represented a departure from the terms of the Anglo/Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  Protracted negotiations have taken place with the British authorities but efforts to secure acceptance of the Irish proposals have not <Col N="933" /> so far been successful and I am considering what further action should be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>My attitude towards the acquisition and development of land and other property by non-Irish companies is related to the circumstances of the case, and in particular the purposes of the acquisition.  Where, for instance, the purpose is the establishment of a new industry or the worthwhile development of an existing one, the acquisition will ordinarily be welcome. Where, however, it represented no more than the take-over of an existing industry which had been in Irish ownership, or a venture in the field of distribution, I would not normally favour it.  As I have said in reply to an earlier question, I am keeping the position under review and will be prepared to take action swiftly if at any time it appears to be called for. Land and property acquisitions for other reasons, such as for building or agricultural purposes, are not of course, the concern of my Department.</P>

Córas Tráchtála are very pleased with the reaction of Irish exporters to these new incentives and the number of inquiries regarding markets other than Britain, in particular France and Germany, has increased substantially.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 91 and 92 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basis upon which facilities are granted to motor assembly firms to import fully assembled motor vehicles is the scheme agreed with the manufacturers and assemblers of British vehicles designed to ensure the continuation of the assembly industry on a long term basis which was introduced at the end of 1967.  The arrangements provide that, in general, imports of <Col N="940" /> motor vehicles are to be channelled through registered importer assemblers who undertook to maintain a certain scale of assembly.  Subject to this, and provided his imports do not prejudice the maintenance of his level of assembly, an importer-assembler of British vehicles may import fully built up vehicles.</P>
    <P>Corresponding facilities are afforded to assemblers of vehicles of third country manufacture where the firms concerned have given satisfactory assurances about continued assembly.</P>
    <P>The Motor Vehicles (Registration of Importers) Act, 1968, which came into operation on 22nd August, 1968, provides the statutory framework for the import channelling arrangements.</P>
    <P>The number of new motor cars imported fully assembled in 1968 was 5,067.  The number for the five months ended 31st May, 1969 was 3,188.  Import figures for June are not yet available. It would not be in accordance with practice to disclose the business of individual firms by giving the number of licences issued to each registered importer.</P>

      <P>There could be no question of lack of proper communication in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>The alternative arrangements in regard to the examination timetabled for Wednesday, 18th June, namely, that these examinations would be held on the following Saturday, 21st June, were published in the form of an official advertisement in all four daily newspapers on Wednesday, 18th June. In the advertisement it was confirmed that examinations on Thursday, 19th and Friday, 20th would be held as timetabled.  Similar information was broadcast by RTE in several news bulletins on 17th and 18th June.  The superintendents at all the examination centres were separately notified.</P>
      <P>I am having all cases of pupils who missed sitting for certain subjects examined with a view to determining what steps might be taken in relation to them.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister particularly to look into the case of a small number of girls in Rathcoole Vocational School who were not allowed to do the examination in the vocational school as there were no examinations there and they had to go to Naas.  They went all the way to Naas to find out if certain papers were being taken and they were told that there would be nothing until Saturday. I think two subjects that were important to them were taken in the meantime.</P>

      <P>Under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968, all candidates who reach the prescribed standard at the leaving certificate examination and who satisfy the means requirements are eligible for a grant if they enter a university or other institution of higher education.  In 1968, 1225 grants were awarded.  In addition 102 scholarships were awarded under schemes administered directly by the Department.</P>
      <P>Of the total of 17,536 full-time university students 11.7 per cent held scholarships or grants in 1968-69 payable out of public funds.  This percentage will reach about 40 when the grants scheme becomes fully operative.</P>

Applications <Col N="953" /> for release from parents or relatives were returned to their families.  Some circumstances had improved or where the terms of committal were such as to were investigated and where the home allow no other course, these children boys were sent to godparents, who had requested this step, and others were placed in employment.  At the end of June the Christian Brothers advised my Department that they would retain a limited number of boys in Artane until the completion of their period of committal in order to continue their education; the remainder were transferred to other schools.  In these latter cases school managers are keeping in touch with godparents and the boys will be sent to them on holidays where so desired.</P>

      <P>With a view to obviating any hardship which the introduction of European Standard Time might have caused to pupils my predecessor advised primary school managers in October last that they were free to postpone school opening for an hour.</P>
      <P>Post-primary school authorities were free to do likewise.  The arrangement of school time-tables is a matter for each individual manager.  Reflectory arm bands were issued to pupils by the Safety First Association.</P>
      <P>In fact, very few complaints in relation to hardship were received in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that this was raised in the House repeatedly during the last session and that, in fact, there was evidence of very severe hardship?  Is he also not aware that it was the convenience of others rather than the pupils that was considered when the question of the hours of school opening was decided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say I am aware of that.  I know it was discussed in the House but, my information is that letters complaining about the starting hour received in my Department were: three from public bodies, one from a school, two from private individuals.  My Department have not had any others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not pay any heed to the discussions which take place here on important matters such as this?  Is he not aware that the issue of the arm bands was given to a voluntary organisation which nearly killed itself trying to issue those arm bands and was unable to meet the demand?  If this is to continue, will the Minister ensure that immediately after the school holidays somebody will be instructed to issue armbands for the coming season when they will be needed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>We would have had more complaints from parents if this problem existed.  We have not got them. <Col N="955" /> I saw an interview on television with parents whose children had the option of travelling in the dark in the morning or in the dark in the evening.  The parents seemed to have been in favour of having their children travel in the dark in the morning because drivers seemed to be more careful in the morning than in the evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the total number of outstanding telephone applications in the State; and the number of outstanding applications in the Dún Laoghaire and the Dublin exchange areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 10,330 applications for telephones outstanding at present including 180 in Dún Laoghaire exchange area and 4,625 in the other Dublin exchange areas.  Arrangements are in hands to provide service for 3,420 of the applicants, including 100 from Dún Laoghaire exchange area and 1,435 from the other Dublin exchange areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>While appreciating the fact the Minister is only newly appointed, may I ask if he would accept that there is widespread dissatisfaction among the 10,000 people waiting for telephones.  While admittedly 3,000 will be obtaining service <Col N="963" /> within an unspecified period, it is inexcusable that for many years now no effective measures have been taken to eliminate this excessive backlog.  Would the Minister ensure that the question of this loss of revenue to the State and the reflection on the State's efficiency in providing service will be dealt with as a matter of urgency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no State where there is not some type of waiting list. There has been a record installation of new telephones in the past two years. In 1967, there were 19,125 telephones installed, which was an increase of over 20 per cent on the previous year; and again, in 1968, there was an increase of 21,669, which means an increase of 13 per cent.  During the current year this level of installation will be further increased.  There is a five months' backlog and, while I agree a waiting list of 10,000 is a bit much, quite considerable progress has been made and the demands keep growing every day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>There was unfortunately abnormal delay because pressure of work arising from the revision of telephone charges coincided with an acute shortage of clerical assistants.  As a result, telephone accounts work generally went into arrears.  The vacancies have now been filled and there should be a substantial improvement in the position when the new staff have been fully trained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

      <P>In view of the increasing importance of our television and radio services, the tremendous focus of public attention and public opinion on the operation of these services, and particularly the growing <Col N="967" /> commercialisation of these services with their appropriate financial repercussions, would the Minister not reconsider how best to review the role of State finances in these services.  It is unsatisfactory to discuss a matter of such a complex nature in an Estimate debate in the House when one must deal with many other aspects of the Minister's Department.

    <P>
      <Col N="968" /> To ask the Minister for Health if, having regard to the deterioration in medical laboratory services in Dublin hospitals consequent on the extension of the dispute as from next Monday involving medical laboratory technologists, he will now personally investigate the position and receive a deputation as requested by the Medical Laboratory Technologists Association and state what special steps will be taken to avoid risk or injury to people requiring medical laboratory services.</P>

      <P>I received this morning a deputation consisting of representatives of the Workers' Union of Ireland and of the Medical Laboratory Technologists' Association, which is affiliated to that union.</P>
      <P>I stressed my very serious concern about the risk to life which would result from the continuance of the present strike of technicians in certain hospitals and from the threatened extension of the strike to other hospitals and institutions from Monday next.</P>
      <P>Following a very full exchange of views, I asked the union and the association to accept a suggestion which I made to them.  The suggestion was that the technicians would resume normal services in the hospitals immediately; that they would accept the Labour Court recommendations as an interim settlement; and that the entire question of a job analysis and assessment of the services of the grades concerned would be examined urgently under the auspices of the Labour Court by an arbitrator, to be agreed, who would be assisted by competent assessors, on the basis of agreed terms of reference, the arbitrator's findings to take full account of all the circumstances, including the date on which the claim was made in 1968.</P>
      <P>I am glad to be able to inform the House that my suggestion has been accepted by the union and the association and that work will be resumed shortly.</P>
