    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the annual average rate of new jobs created over the years 1965 to date; the present average annual rate of increase; and when it is expected that full employment will be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Between April, 1965 and April, 1968 &mdash; the latest date for which information is available&mdash;the average number of new jobs created annually was nearly 8,000.</P>
      <P>Approximately 11,000 new jobs were created in the year ended April, 1968 and the indications are that this annual rate of increase is being exceeded at the moment.</P>
      <P>As regards the latter part of the question, the National Industrial Economic Council in its Full Employment Report posed the main problems which would arise in seeking full employment by 1981.  The Third Programme for Economic and Social Development, 1969-72, was drawn up against the background of the council's report and is a step on the road to full employment.  The programme seeks to achieve the highest growth rates for sectoral and national output and employment that the economy can sustain over the period 1969-72 without endangering further progress.  It also seeks to effect those changes in the economy that will enable faster growth to be achieved in the period after 1972.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach would agree that 1981 is a fairly leisurely progress towards full employment. His predecessor, Mr. Seán Lemass, said he was prepared to have his economic policies judged by their capacity to create employment.  Does the Taoiseach agree that that is a fair criterion?  Furthermore, after 12 years of Fianna Fáil policy, would the Taoiseach agree, in relation to this criterion, that their economic policies have failed or succeeded?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>One has to take account of economic exigencies that are not always foreseen.  There was an occasional setback in our growth of employment in 1965-66 which has now successfully been overcome.  Employment in industrial activity is increasing now at a reasonably satisfactory rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not give the net increase.  There was an overall decline in jobs up to 1967.  Since then, there was a net plus of over 2,000 in total employment, that is, the number of new industrial jobs exceeded the decline in agricultural employment by that amount.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but it was very satisfactory having regard to the fact that, up to quite recently, we were not able to keep up with the decline in <Col N="263" /> employment on the land.  Now, we are doing it and exceeding it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the total number of insured workers; and (a) the number and (b) the percentage of these who are unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of currently insured persons, derived from the number of social insurance cards exchanged, was estimated at 665,989 in the latest insurance year.  The total number of insured persons on the live register was 48,920 at mid-June, 1969. In using these figures as a measure of unemployment, it is necessary to exclude persons in agriculture, fishing and private domestic service because many of these are only marginally in the employee category and because the numbers recorded are affected by recent changes in the coverage of the live register.  The number of insured persons, excluding these categories, was estimated at 563,893 in the latest insurance year and the corresponding live register figure for mid-June, 1969, was 32,043.  The percentage unemployed, derived from these figures, was 5.7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that 5.7 is the second highest in ten western European countries in relation to unemployment figures and that it is directly due to the failure of the Fianna Fáil Party's policies over the past 12 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures quoted <Col N="264" /> by the Deputy in reference to other countries are not comparable inasmuch as in other countries they do not include people employed on the land, smallholders, and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

      <P>Radio Telefís Éireann have already commenced the phasing out of cigarette advertising on their media and <Col N="265" /> have set the date 1st April, 1971, as the date on which such advertising will cease.</P>
      <P>I do not feel that I would be justified in seeking to compel the discontinuance of press advertising.  The Deputy will be aware of the policy of my predecessors to avoid, as far as possible, the exercise of compulsion and I feel that this is the correct policy.  He will be aware, too, I am sure, of the agreement of the cigarette manufacturers to comply with a code of standards for advertising which limits considerably the effectiveness of such advertising.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Minister can discontinue, if he wishes, the policy of refraining from compulsory prohibition of advertisements of what is now recognised to be a dangerous drug?  There are many precedents for doing this.  Why cannot the Minister accept those precedents in relation to cigarette smoking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy moved a private Tobacco Bill in 1964 or 1965.  There was a long debate in which the Deputy gave all his views on this matter and showed his intense concern with this problem.  At the end the Second Reading was defeated by a large majority of the House.  It is impossible for me to argue on this occasion, in the course of a reply to a Parliamentary question, all the elements that enter into this but the main point is that we do advertising among school children; we show films to school children and RTE have taken this action.  Beyond that the Government believe that this should be a question of voluntary restraint particularly having regard to the fact that the incidence of lung <Col N="266" /> cancer depends to a considerable degree on the number of cigarettes consumed over a given period as the Deputy knows.</P>

      <P>The statistics sought by the Deputy are not readily available and in some areas the original papers have been disposed of.  Where the records are available, extensive research into all refusals of medical cards would be necessary in order to select the classes of persons specified in the questions.</P>
      <P>All health authorities grant medical cards automatically, on application, to widows or aged persons with the full non-contributory pension.  The great majority of authorities, including Dublin, do so even where a reduced non-contributory pension is involved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of dentures under the health services for eligible persons in the area concerned must be considered in relation to the provision of dental services generally by the local health authority.  Such services are provided in the area by three whole-time dental officers, supplemented by a number of private dentists employed on a part-time or sessional basis by the health authority. In common with other health authorities, the Wexford County Council is utilising its available dental resources, in personnel and funds, on the provision of services mainly for children because, in the long term, they will stand to benefit most from dental treatment. In these circumstances, the council is in a position to provide dentures only on a limited priority basis for persons in the lower income group.  Until the dental services for children are brought up to a reasonably satisfactory level, it will not be feasible for the council to provide dentures for all eligible applicants.</P>
      <P>Dental services in County Wexford have improved in recent years by the employment of additional personnel and the health authority is continuing its efforts to maintain that improvement.</P>

      <P>It is a fact that a great deal of development is still required and has to be regarded in connection with other medical priorities. The Deputy is fully aware of the position.  The position has been explained to the House on a great number of occasions.  There is the difficulty of securing dentists.  On a recent date the Minister arranged for an improvement in the conditions applying to the appointment of dentists which has resulted in an increase in the number of dentists for serving local authorities on a full-time and a part-time basis.  I shall follow the work of my predecessor in trying to see what further improvements can be effected in this very important service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the considerable interest being shown by the people of Wexford in the future of their hospital services.  I would like to emphasise that my Department and I share this interest and the natural desire of the Wexford people that hospital facilities of the highest standard should be available to them.  Discussions have taken place between my predecessor as Minister for Health and the health authority and also with representatives of the unofficial group who are taking an interest in this problem.  A very full exchange of views took place at these meetings. General agreement has been reached on the need for a new hospital in Wexford and the first section of this hospital&mdash;a new maternity unit&mdash;is already being planned.  This unit will be provided urgently.  I understand that it is hoped to invite tenders by the end of November.</P>
      <P>I accept the need to improve the acute hospital services, surgical and other, available to the Wexford people. I am not at present in a position to say specifically how this should be done. It is a problem requiring further careful consideration.  I am glad, however, that the provision of a maternity unit on which we can agree is to proceed urgently and I think it will be agreed that this is a right priority.</P>

In my position as newly appointed Minister for Health it would be entirely wrong for me to make any comment on the ultimate implications of the Fitzgerald Report which my predecessor did accept in principle and then made the promise that he would examine the position in every area to see how far local needs could be met in relation to the inevitable concentration of specialist medicine in certain regional centres.</P>

      <P>Presumably the Deputy is referring to the former fever hospital at Belmullet.  My Department has been in correspondence recently with the Mayo County Council regarding the possibility of using this institution for the care of geriatric patients. At present one half of the building is devoted to medical uses, i.e. dispensary and dental and other clinics.  The other half of the building is being used by the assistant county engineer and as a temporary courthouse on one day each month.  I understand from the county council that the vacation of the premises by the existing users is not feasible pending the erection of new local authority buildings.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan) (for the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries)</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in the White Paper published when the Free Trade Area Agreement was signed, the main direct agricultural benefits to Ireland from the agreement relate to improved access to the British market and to participation in the British price support system.  As regards improved access, total agricultural exports to the UK increased from £88.2 million in 1965 to £126.5 million in 1968.  Among these were butter which went up from £6.4 million to £8.8 million and cheese which increased from £2.1 million to £5.6 million.  As regards participation in the British price support system the value of exports of the commodities affected (i.e. store cattle, sheep and lambs and carcase beef and lamb) increased from £42.2 million in 1965 to £72.7 million in 1968.</P>
      <P>The lower levels of exports which could only have been achieved under various heads on the hypothetical basis indicated by the Deputy would not, of course, be capable of realistic computation.</P>

      <P>The level of the common guide price for cattle in the EEC is about twothirds higher than the Irish price level in 1968, while the common target price for milk in the EEC is more than 50 per cent above our average 1968 price for creamery milk.  In the cases of wheat and sugar beet, our guaranteed prices are slightly higher than the EEC prices while our support price for feeding barley is about 20 per cent below that of the community.  There is no common target price in the EEC for pigs.  The average 1968 price here was slightly above the level at which intervention purchases would have been made in the community.</P>
      <P>There are no common target or guide prices in the EEC for poultry or eggs and as yet there is no common organisation of the market there for sheep, oats or potatoes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 together.  These questions relate to matters arising under the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development and I will deal with them in the order in which they have been put down.</P>
      <P>The scheme of grants for the modernisation of bacon factories, which was introduced under the Programme for Economic Expansion in 1958, was for the execution of muchneeded improvement works in a longestablished industry, the plant and equipment in much of which badly required modernisation.  Grants were confined to replacement and improvement of existing plant and equipment and to such necessary additional facilities as refrigeration, without involving an increase&mdash;other than incidental&mdash;to a factory's existing capacity to handle pigs, but it was, of course, inevitable that the modernised layout and facilities achieved under the scheme should have led to some measure of increased throughput capacity.  The problem of excess capacity has not, however, been aggravated as the level of pig supplies has increased substantially in the meantime and further increased production is being aimed at.</P>
      <P>The members of the group which has been examining the practical aspects of centralised purchasing of pigs are two representatives each of the Pigs and Bacon Commission and the Irish Bacon Curers' Society, both of which bodies had submitted outline proposals in the matter, and officers of my Department. I am not in a position to say when the examination will be concluded or what action I will take in the matter.  I would, however, refer the Deputy to the comments I made on the question of centralised purchasing when introducing the Estimate for my Department on 10th December last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy misrepresents the Government's milk production policy in the Third Programme by suggesting that they propose to hold down production to a particular level.  What the relevant <Col N="277" /> paragraphs of chapter 5 of the Third Programme said were&mdash;</P>
    <P>Paragraph 23:&mdash;&ldquo;The aim in beef/milk production policy will be to place increasing emphasis on beef production, especially by larger farmers with suitable holdings, thereby moderating the rate of growth in commercial milk production&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 45:&mdash;&ldquo;In addition to increasing the supply of beef, one of the aims of the Beef Cattle Incentive Scheme referred to in the section on Cattle and Beef, is to provide a reasonable counter-attraction to commercial milk production thereby restraining the rate of increase in the quantities of milk becoming available for processing&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 47:&mdash;&ldquo;In examining the scope for moderating the rate of increase in State support for milk, consideration will be given to the possibility of extending the phased system of price support so as to channel a larger share of State support to the traditional supplier who is less well able to meet increasing costs than the large scale commercial producer&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The approach to the question of setting out detailed statistical targets for agriculture was governed by that adopted for all sectors of the economy as set out in paragraph 23 of the introductory chapter of the programme. The Deputy, of course, is aware that in chapter 5 of the programme the trends envisaged for individual commodities are outlined.  I do not accept that the achievement of the agricultural objectives of the programme will be adversely affected by the omission of statistical targets for individual products. Farmers are obviously responding whole-heartedly to the Government's efforts to stimulate agricultural development as was strikingly illustrated by performance in 1968 when the agricultural growth rate reached the substantial figure of six per cent.</P>
    <P>Draft heads of legislation on agricultural co-operative societies, prepared in my Department, have been furnished to the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, Ltd. for preliminary examination.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="278" /> The additional accommodation referred to in paragraph 94 of chapter 5 of the programme is planned to be provided over the three years up to 1972. Already, the authorities of one secondary college have undertaken to inaugurate next September a residential one-year course in agriculture similar to the course being followed at the existing agricultural colleges.  Statistics are not available in respect of the number of students from agricultural colleges and university graduates in agriculture who return to farming in a permanent capacity.  I would point out that, in addition to the residential colleges, farm training for young men entering agriculture will be provided at the farm training centres referred to in paragraph 95 of chapter 5 of the programme.</P>
    <P>The group which carried out the studies referred to in paragraph 17 of chapter 5 of the programme has completed its task and its recommendations are now under consideration by the Government.  As well as officials of the Departments of Agriculture and Fisheries and Finance, among them a senior agricultural economist, the group included an economist from the Economic and Social Research Institute. In addition, the group had the advice of an economic consultant from one of the universities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;about moderating the growth of milk production and providing a reasonable counter-attraction. I should like to ask the Minister, in the light of the proposals to moderate the growth of production and restrain an increase in the quantity of milk, what is in fact the target for milk, and by how much the growth of milk production is to be restrained and moderated under Government policy? I think we are entitled to an answer to that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, with regard to the question of the agricultural target referred to in Question No. 16 I should like to know why the targets have been suppressed. They were contained in the <Col N="280" /> Second Programme.  Why have they been dropped, and can we be given any indication as to how in fact the Government propose to reach these targets, and can the farmers interested in particular policies be given any indication as to what the Government's plans are, if the Government have any plans?</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to Question No. 18, am I to understand from the Minister that he does not know the proportion of people entering agriculture with appropriate training and, if not, can he take any steps to find out?  This is something one would expect any government to want to know and want to find out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole object of the Government's policy in regard to cattle and beef production and milk production is obviously to achieve a balance between beef and milk production. That is the objective here.  In regard to individual targets, I do not think we should tie ourselves down in this respect to specifics, that the right thing to do is to provide the incentives and stimulants.  Obviously the incentives and stimulants provided by the Government in the agricultural sphere have been highly successful over the past two years in particular.  I will take up the question of getting more accurate figures with my colleague in regard to the people who qualify with agricultural degrees and the proportion going into farming.  At the moment I have not got the figure.  I will take the matter up with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I ask the Minister if the reason for the suppression of the targets was not perhaps that every target except the milk target was missed in the Second Programme, and that that target has now been modified so as to reduce the growth in milk output to ensure that there is not an increase in milk output in the period ahead?</P>

      <P>No.  The attitude in this matter, as has been borne out by events in the EEC and indeed throughout the world, has been to moderate milk production and achieve <Col N="281" /> a reasonable balance between beef and milk production.  Our policies in the past few months have been geared towards achieving this.</P>

The Minister will be aware that I have adverted to this matter in this House on many occasions.  A positive promise was made prior to the General Election of 1965 by his predecessor, the then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Haughey, that this processing plant would be established without delay and that it would give employment. Nothing tangible has been done since. In the circumstances would the new Minister bend his energies towards honouring the promise made to the people of Tipperary town where there is an exceptionally high incidence of unemployment and emigration, and provide this much needed industry without further delay?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to internal migration, the trends on which the need for about 1,000 dwellings a year on account of internal migration are based are derived from censuses and returns by local authorities, who were asked to <Col N="288" /> take into account information derived from local inspections, trends in applications for houses, needs arising from industrialisation, etc.  An allowance is made in the White Paper estimate for duplication with needs arising from other causes.</P>
      <P>The estimate of the increase in the number of married couples living in the country&mdash;which is not the same as the increase in the number of marriages to which the Deputy refers&mdash;is based on a series of population projections by the Central Statistics Office described in appendix D of the Third Programme for Economic Expansion.</P>
      <P>The estimate of an effective need of about 10,000 dwellings for persons in the 24,600 households approximately comprising more than one family unit is based on the assumption, supported by the rate of application for dower house grants, that the effective need for separate accommodation for households engaged in agriculture is small and that more than one out of every two of the families in the remaining households would require separate accommodation.</P>
      <P>The basic data for the estimate of about 15,000 families living in severely overcrowded dwellings with not more than four rooms are local authority returns, the interim results of the census of population 1966, as published in the June, 1968, issue of the <i>Irish Statistical Bulletin</i>, with an allowance for duplication as between needs included under other heads and for houses provided since the census was taken for persons living in overcrowded conditions.</P>
      <P>Most of the overcrowded dwellings with four or more rooms are privately owned.  A decision to extend is, therefore, a matter for the individual occupier or owner.  In view of this no separate estimate was made of the period within which extensions would be carried out or of the cost.  In recent years about 10,000 dwellings a year have been substantially reconstructed with State aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I may say that the aggregate forecasts of housing output arrived at in the White Paper are supported by a number of other independent and expert assessments of which <Col N="289" /> I am aware, including that at paragraph 518 of the Buchanan Report.</P>

As it is not evident from the White Paper how the figures in it are arrived at, I should be grateful if the Minister would furnish the information.  As regards Question No. 30, is the Minister not aware from his own White Paper that the local authority assessments on which he has at least partially based the calculations dealt with in Question No. 30 have, in fact, uniformly underestimated the demand, as it is clear from the White Paper itself, and is he wise, therefore, in placing reliance on these estimates?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether any steps are going to be taken to accelerate the process of clearing the housing backlog which has been shown by the White Paper on housing in the seventies to be likely to take 15 years at the present rate of progress; and whether in view of the fact that the White Paper refers to a period of ten to 15 years for the elimination of accumulated needs it is not intended to accelerate the housing programme so as to clear this backlog in less than ten years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government what steps he proposes to take to raise the rate of local authority house-building completions from the figure of about 4,500 at which it stood last year, and at which he proposed to hold it this year, with a view to at least attaining the figure of 8,000 local authority houses built in 1950 by the inter-party Government <Col N="290" /> at a time when national output and resources were 40 per cent lower than today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>In the eight years to 1968-69, the number of houses built annually has gone up by almost 120 per cent.  The recent White Paper projected a further increase of approximately 30 per cent by about 1975, at an estimated annual cost of £75 million at 1968 prices, in addition to a further £17½ million or so a year in subsidies met from central and local taxation.  The White Paper outlines the steps which the Government intend to take to encourage the number of houses built annually to rise to this level as they have risen each year, with one exception, during the past eight years, instead of slumping annually after a sudden surge, as they did during most of the 1950s.  The projections in the paper are based on the need not only to eliminate bad housing already in existence but to meet future needs as they arise&mdash;without at the same time disrupting the building industry by sudden booms and slumps. I should emphasise that there are degrees of unfitness and overcrowding and that, as the White Paper indicates, a ten or 15 year programme does not imply that a person living in poor accommodation will have to wait ten to 15 years for rehousing.</P>
      <P>With regard to Question No. 31, I I do not see the point of selecting, as a target for local authority housing, output in a particular year in the past when war-time deficiencies were being made up and the level of private building was about half of what it has been in recent years, particularly when people are now better able than they were then to buy their own houses.  The increase in total output projected in the White Paper will meet the needs of many persons who would in the past have sought local authority houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, the 80,000 or so houses provided by local authorities since about the time to which the Deputy refers greatly increases their capability for dealing with applicants who would <Col N="291" /> normally qualify for one of their houses.</P>
    <P>In general, I would refer the Deputy to the statement in the White Paper that in the event that needs require a level of building about 1975 above the projections in the paper the projections will not be regarded as limiting the level of building and that in so far as the economy can afford it any higher level of building required will be aimed at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened with care to the Minister's monotone, am I to take from it that there is no intention to reduce the period in which this waiting list is to be cleared to less than ten years, that there is no intention to increase the number of local authority houses being built, and that the position will not be reviewed until 1975?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government what plans there are for the provision of housing in the Ringsend-Irishtown and South Dock Wards of Dublin in view of the fact that these areas are very remote from any of the new housing areas around the city outskirts and in view of the urgent need for housing in these areas especially for workers whose employment is in these areas, many of whom are on shift work and for whom no public transport is available to bring them to and from work if they move to the outskirts of the city.</P>

In areas immediately adjoining the ward they are providing 14 flats by conversion of existing houses, and have prepared plans for another 72 flats.  They also have work well advanced on a scheme <Col N="292" /> of 168 flats within a half mile of the boundary of the ward, and have submitted tender proposals for six houses at Irishtown.</P>
      <P>No details are available in my Department at present of other proposals which may be in formulation by the housing authority for these areas.  It is, of course, a matter for the housing authority, in the first instance, to initiate any such proposals.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if the ballot paper used in the recent general election carried an identification number on its back; if the counterfoil from which it was removed had a corresponding number; and if the number of the voter to whom the ballot paper was given was written on this counterfoil; if he is satisfied that this procedure does not throw doubt on the secrecy of the ballot; and what happens to the ballot papers and the counterfoils after the election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The elector's number is entered by the presiding officer on the counterfoil which bears the same serial number as that on the back of the ballot paper.  This does not, however, endanger the secrecy of the ballot because there is an elaborate statutory procedure which provides that the counterfoil and ballot paper are not subsequently brought together.  The ballot papers and counterfoils are retained in separate sealed packets under strict security by the Clerk of the Dáil for 12 months and are then destroyed. They cannot be inspected except by order of the Dáil of High Court and then only subject to certain safeguards regarding the secrecy of the ballot.</P>

    <P>On balance, the Committee feels that the deterrent effect of the present practice is a valuable safeguard against widespread personation and other corrupt practices at elections and that it should not be sacrificed to allay a suspicion which is, in fact, groundless.

    <P>The Constitution reserves to Irish citizens the right to vote at Dáil and Presidential elections and referenda.  A citizen of the USA, or of any other country, who also holds Irish citizenship <Col N="300" /> would, therefore, be entitled to have his name entered in the normal way on the register of electors and to vote at such elections.  There is no citizenship requirement for entitlement to vote at local elections.</P>
    <P>The loss of citizenship of other countries by persons voting at elections here would be a matter for the authorities of the countries concerned.  I understand, however, that a citizen of the USA who votes at elections in this country does not lose his American citizenship on that account.

    <Title>Post Office (Amendment) Bill, 1969    [Seanad]:    Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to make three desirable changes in Post Office legislation.  Briefly, these are (1) to enable free postage facilities to be authorised, (2) to transfer to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs certain regulation-making powers now vested in the Minister for Finance and (3) to give greater freedom in the handling of mail other than letter mail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Power to enable free postage facilities to be authorised is sought in section 2 (1) (c).  This is required primarily to enable packets containing literature and articles specially adapted for the use of the blind to be accepted free of postage.  Our present rates for such packets are, and for many years have been, nominal in both the inland and foreign post.  They range from 1/2d to 2½d according to weight up to 15 lbs. In recent years, following acceptance of the principle of free postage for these packets in the Universal Postal Union Convention, most other countries have abolished their charges.  We would have done so earlier but that our rates were already nominal and legislation would be required to drop them altogether.  We understand that the requirement of affixing stamps and accounting for them is now more costly in time and inconvenience for the associations devoted to the welfare of the blind than the small cost of postage.  In any event I am now proposing in this Bill to take power to <Col N="312" /> abolish these rates by regulation to be issued immediately after the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>The power sought will be available if ever required to grant free postage facilities for other classes of packets by statutory regulations laid before the Oireachtas.  I should like to make it clear that this enabling provision will be used very sparingly, if at all.  It is possible, however, that the members of the Universal Postal Union might agree to provide free postage facilities on a world wide basis in other cases and in this kind of situation it should not be necessary to have to introduce further legislation to enable my Department to follow suit.</P>
    <P>The second change proposed in the Bill is the transfer of certain regulation-making powers from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Statutory regulations made under the Post Office Act, 1908, must at present be executed by the Minister for Finance, as the successor of the Treasury.  The Minister for Finance and myself agree that such regulations, being of a technical character and primarily the concern of the Post Office, should be made by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance where charges, fees or financial matters are involved.  Sub-sections (1) (a) and (2) of section 2, and section 3 of the Bill provide the necessary authority for this change.</P>
    <P>The third change proposed is contained in section 4.  It is to remove a statutory requirement relating to the treatment of what is generally known as second-class mail and so permit greater flexibility in mail-handling arrangements.  At present the position is that if the despatch or delivery of letters is likely to be delayed by the treatment at the same time of printed papers, samples and postcards, the Post Office may hold over those items until the despatch or delivery next following that by which they would ordinarily be sent.  The deferable mail consists mostly of circulars, bills, etc., posted at reduced rates.  The Post Office <Col N="313" /> in this country has over the years observed this statutory requirement as far as practicable.  In Britain, it was dropped by amendment of the 1908 Act many years ago.  A similar statutory requirement does not exist, so far as we are aware, in any other country.</P>
    <P>The Post Office is now faced with problems that did not exist to anything like the same extent even a few years ago.  These problems arise from the steady increase, year by year, in the volume of mail posted, the trend towards a shorter working week and more congenial hours for the staff, the more pronounced &ldquo;peaking&rdquo; of postal traffic and the difficult road traffic conditions in the cities that impede the speedy collection, transmission and delivery of mail.  A stage has now been reached where, in order to ensure as far as practicable that letters are despatched and delivered in due course, greater freedom in the treatment of mail posted at reduced rates is necessary. Accordingly, section 4 proposes to remove the present restriction on the power to defer the treatment of such mail until the next despatch or delivery only and so enable the Post Office to deal with it at off-peak periods.</P>
    <P>At present the great bulk of firstand second-class mail is delivered in the morning.  Under more balanced delivery and staffing arrangements in Dublin and the largest centres the morning delivery or deliveries might consist mostly of letters and newspapers, the afternoon delivery of letters received in the meantime and of other mail.  The amendment proposed is particularly necessary at the present time so as to enable delivery patterns to be rationalised in the light of the reduction in working hours being introduced at present for postmen and to enable a five-day working week to be granted to them, on whatever basis may finally be settled.  The form the rationalisation will take is not yet clear.  No decisions have been taken yet on future policy and if any major changes are to be made adequate advance notice will be given for full public discussion.  I should like to repeat that the removal of the statutory restriction in question will simply place the Irish Post Office in the same position legally in this <Col N="314" /> regard as other Post Office administrations. It is, therefore, in no sense an unreasonable proposal.</P>
    <P>In brief, the intention of the Bill is to give the Department in a number of matters the greater flexibility demanded by modern conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the Opposition are concerned and in so far as this Bill provides free postage for the blind, we certainly welcome it but there is one aspect of the Bill in which the Minister is not being fair to the House and that is that free postage facilities can be granted to other individuals or classes and the Minister is taking power in the Bill to make these facilities available but he has not informed us as to the type of people or classes of people that he envisages should be entitled to free postage.  Perhaps, if he would give us some inkling as to who or what they are it might facilitate us in considering the Bill.</P>
      <P>I have noted that when the Bill was before the Seanad Senator Eamonn Rooney said in relation to it that it seemed obvious that the Minister was taking power to make facilities available at a later stage to other classes and not merely to blind persons and the Minister's comment was: &ldquo;That is so&rdquo;.  Who are these people?  Who are these mysterious people who will benefit by free postage under this Bill? Would it be some political party which immediately before an election might by ministerial order procure the same facilities as are now being spelled out in the Bill for the blind?  If the Minister has in mind individuals or parties, let us know who they are and let us discuss them.  I am certain that the Minister did not write that into the Bill without some reason or other for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We always looked forward to the Finance Bill debate to discover when new additional taxation was being imposed but in recent years we have had very many mini budgets and this Bill provides for a further mini budget because in this Bill the Minister is taking from the Minister for Finance power to increase postage on parcels, or else I misconceive the Minister's intentions under the Bill.  It is quite evident, from my reading of the Bill, <Col N="315" /> that the Minister is now taking power to fix the rates for postal packets, as section 2 says.  Is this another method of getting round a mini budget?  Is this another method of imposing additional taxation on the citizens other than the annual or, as we now expect, biannual budgets &mdash; the spring and autumn budgets? Is this an in-between budget which we are going to have?  If so, tell us about it and tell us what the proposal of the Minister is.</P>
    <P>I notice that the greater part of the Bill and of the Minister's speech deals with the five-day week and the necessity for staggering deliveries of certain postal packets.  While we all sympathise with the five-day week, it might be possible, say, at peak periods to employ staff, or even to employ staff by way of overtime, to deal expenditiously with postal packets and mail.  Is it a false economy or is it an economy at all that is proposed to be practised under the Bill?  Is it an economy which will make for expedition or is it an economy which should not be effected?  I should be glad to have the Minister's views on it.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about hazards of traffic in the city of Dublin being one of the causes of delay in delivering mail.  I appreciate his difficulty in that. I came across a case recently in the country where the driver of a mail van was prosecuted for exceeding the speed limit when he was endeavouring to make a connection with the principal mail to Dublin.  I had to argue for the defence the old, old saying that His Majesty's mail must not be interfered with in any way.  At one time it was high treason to impede in any way the free passage of His Majesty's mail throughout the realm.  Now we have no longer got His Majesty but we have a very worthy substitute in the Minister and is there any provision in this Bill or any provision in the Road Traffic Act which would enable certain exemptions to be given to mail car drivers who are endeavouring to deliver the mail on schedule?  This is something the Minister should look into.  I do not wish to compare them in any way but there are exemptions in the case of ambulances and other <Col N="316" /> such vehicles on mercy missions.  The Minister should look into this matter and see if something could be done &mdash; I would not say in the city of Dublin &mdash; but certainly in rural Ireland, when it is essential that mail out of small post offices should catch the mail delivery from the headoffices to the various destinations.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing to see some provision made for these unfortunate people, the blind.  I do not know whether many of our blind citizens can afford to take advantage of the free postage.  I do not know how many of them are capable of reading or writing, through Braille or otherwise.  I am afraid that it is a very small percentage indeed and that the number who will seek to take advantage of this facility will be small whereas, on the other hand, if it is envisaged that some of the institutions and organisations catering for the blind should have free postage, I certainly would agree with that very much indeed.  Otherwise, if we are catering for individuals, the number who will benefit under this Bill will be very limited.</P>
    <P>I would not like to impute any ulterior motives to the Minister but I wonder if he would assure us that the blind are not a cover for some other classes who may procure free postage on some future occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally, the Labour Party welcome the intent of this Bill.  We feel that it will give further strength to the rationalisation of the postal services generally and certainly will benefit the staffs employed and the people generally, in the handling of mail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, however, a number of aspects that I should like to query and on which I would seek clarification from the Minister.  Rather like the previous Deputy, I think the Minister has been less than explicit in indicating the exempted category or categories in his introductory statement.  Certainly, he should be more specific in terms of exemptions intended.  While, admittedly, he has said that this enabling provision to give free postage to other classes, and so on, would be used very sparingly, nevertheless, as this is of <Col N="317" /> major public importance, he should give further information to the House on this matter.  That is the initial reservation of our party while, nevertheless, we welcome very much the special provision for organisations devoted to the welfare of the blind.</P>
    <P>Our second point on the Bill is to seek from the Minister some general assurance in relation to the transfer of certain regulating powers from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  While admitting that this is of a somewhat technical character, nevertheless we would seek to ensure that if there are going to be major changes in the national charges, certainly this should be a particular prerogative of the Minister for Finance himself, budgetary-wise.  The postal charges are now a major social, industrial and general charge in the community.  We would not envisage substantial major amendments coming in without the general involvement of the House.  In that regard, perhaps the Minister will enlighten us further.</P>
    <P>I welcome, by and large, the statutory requirement relating to the treatment of second-class mail.  I have no doubt that second-class mail will still get its normal priority but I think that, through rationalisation and the giving of greater freedom to the postal authorities in the handling of second-class mail, this will lead to a number of factors.  The first rather important factor, and very important for the men directly concerned, is that it will undoubtedly get rid of the continual complaints, of which the Minister and his Department are only too well aware, that the sorters, supervisory staffs, inspection staffs, and so on, and the postmen themselves have had continuous late afternoon working.  I should certainly welcome this provision and would seek from the Minister some placing on record that it is not sufficient to pass this particular Bill.  We must ensure that, in fact, there will result from it a measurable improvement in the general conditions of employment, as implied in his statement, of the postal staffs themselves.  Certainly, this is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>There is a further point that I should like to make in relation to the statement <Col N="318" /> by the Minister in his speech that greater freedom in the treatment of mail posted at reduced rates is necessary, and so on.  While, admittedly, we are not giving a major concession to the Department for the treatment of second-class mail, it might well be wise that some form of periodic checking would be introduced to ensure that, while second-class mail may have a delivery delay of a day or two days, it would not, at extreme peak periods, result in extreme delay.  Again, this is a factor where complaints are liable to arise.  While I am personally quite satisfied, and my party are satisfied, that the general efficiency of our postal services is of as high a calibre as any other Government service or Statesponsored service, nevertheless, with the tremendous growth in mail in this country &mdash; for example, I am quite sure that, in Dublin, it is going up by from three to five per cent per annum in terms of growth &mdash; the substantial changes in the conditions of employment of staff must be married into the continued efficiency of this service.</P>
    <P>These are the principal points which our party would wish to make at this point.  Perhaps the Minister might inform us more explicitly, before the afternoon is out, of the changes he intends on some of the sections he introduced. By and large, we welcome the Bill. We have no doubt that it will lead to more effective postal services; to better conditions of employment for the staffs themselves and to acceptance by the public that they will continue to receive a service that, notwithstanding all the difficulties of the postal service we have had over the years, will certainly be on a par with and, in many cases, vastly superior to those I have experienced in many other countries in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the Minister is being rather naíve in relation to this Bill.  We are told at the outset that it is for the purpose of introducing free postal services, whenever they are required.  Then we are told that it is primarily introduced for the purpose of giving the blind the opportunity of having a free postal service.  I would be in full agreement with what Deputy P. O'Donnell said <Col N="319" /> about the Minister not giving us any real indication as to how this method will be applied.  If we give a free postal service &mdash; I, personally, would not be against a free postal service to the blind: I think they are entitled to it&mdash; the Minister should give us some idea of how this scheme will operate.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to postal services and to the fact that what is designated as second-class mail should be segregated from the ordinary mail to enable what would be considered first-class mail to get through quickly.  I am mindful of the fact that it is not so very long ago since the British Government introduced something on similar lines; they have a first-class and a second-class mail service.  Prior to that, the British postal services seemed to be most eminently satisfactory.  Ever since then, however, they have been anything but satisfactory as far as they are related to this country.  Heretofore, letters which ordinarily came here in two or three days from London now take up to four or five days to come here.  It seems to me that if we are to have a first-class and a second-class mail we shall have a good deal of sorting to do and that we shall throw extra work on the postal authorities.  Will we get any better end result from it?  The Minister also said that it would be a question of the delivery of first-class mail by the first post and second-class mail by the second or later post.  As far as we are concerned in County Wexford &mdash; I do not know if it obtains elsewhere &mdash; we have only one post in the day.  Not so long ago, the second post was abolished altogether.  Since then, we have had the one post in the day so that anything posted in Dublin prior to 4 p.m. or anything posted prior to 4 p.m. in our own rural areas in Wexford would reach its destination the following morning by the first post.  Of course, good intentions are wonderful things, particularly when we are dealing with State services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot help feeling that, as far as the ordinary post operates here in Ireland in all parts of the country, if present arrangements are replaced by some new system, we shall have the same unbalanced situation as we have in <Col N="320" /> regard to cross-Channel postage to this country.  While the intentions may be good &mdash; the intentions of State Departments always are good &mdash; they do not always work out according to plan. Left as it is, there does not seem to be any undue delay in postal deliveries here.  The present system is operating well.  Possibly only confusion will be added to it.  As I said, the Minister is being rather naive in relation to the situation generally.  When he is replying, perhaps he will be able to clarify these doubts that exist in my mind.  He is also being rather naïve about the five-day week.  I have known for some time that the postal employees have been looking for a five-day week.  We are all well aware of that fact.  No one can gainsay the fact that once you introduce the five-day working week&mdash; particularly when you introduce it, shall we say, at higher civil service level so that the civil service offices are closed on Saturday &mdash; it is only natural that the lower grades will look for the same benefits.</P>
    <P>Here again, the Minister has not given us any indication of what the end result will be.  Do I take it that the post which had been dealt with on Friday will be received on Saturday morning and that there will be no other delivery until the following Tuesday?  Perhaps quite a number of Deputies would welcome this but we must consider the effect it would have on industry.  The wheels of industry must be kept going and we must not have a hiatus on Monday which is an important day in industrial life.  These are matters the Minister should clear up.</P>
    <P>I have found that Ministers come into this House with a brief and introduce a Bill and that there are many things to be cleared up.  We get up and express our opinions.  Sometimes they are listened to and sometimes they are not.  In this case, perhaps, the Minister in his reply would deal with the points I have raised and also the points raised by other Deputies because we are all considerably in the dark as to the meaning of this Bill.</P>
    <P>At present it is possible for a Minister to raise the postal rate without coming in here with legislation.  I distinctly remember the ordinary postal <Col N="321" /> rate being increased purely by ministerial order.  It seems to me that the Minister under this Bill will have the opportunity of doing the same with packet postal rates.  This is dished up to us in an attractive style.  It says that the Minister also has the right to reduce packet rates.  We are not all quite as gullible as that.  We know perfectly well there will be no reduction in packet rates but what the Minister is looking for is permission to increase packet rates.  Will the Minister have the same power in relation to packet postage as he has at present for other postage of increasing it by ministerial order without any legislation?  If that is so, we would have to oppose this Bill as it would mean that the Minister, by Ministerial order, could put extra taxation on the already overtaxed Irish nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I see this as an attempt to take further taxation without bringing the matter to the Dáil.  Of course, I would be very much opposed to this.  The Minister should not have this power.  It should be a budgetary consideration and should be brought before the House and we should vote on it: I do not see why we should have included in this the question of the free postage facilities for the blind. We are all very much in favour of this and I feel this was only lumped in with this Bill to fool us.  We are again following Britain on this question of second-class mail but we have not got the same problems as they have in Britain and it is wrong for the Minister to suggest that we have.  In fact, second-class mail already exists in this country; it is delivered in the second post.  This is an attempt to compel us to use first-class mail.  If we want to ensure early delivery we will have to use this first-class postage.  There is no demand for this.  The second-class post has not reached such proportions that the Post Office cannot cope with it. The Minister has not given us proof that the demand is there.  He is simply following Britain where they have a completely different problem.  I see this as an attempt to get extra money from the people.  It will create tremendous problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will have to pay an extra charge <Col N="322" /> for first-class post for every letter and we will have to ensure that &ldquo;first-class mail&rdquo; is written on every letter, otherwise, we have no assurance that it will be delivered on time.  This will create problems.  The Minister has not told us how long it will take to deliver second-class mail.  It may take a week or longer.  I should like to know what he proposes or what his intentions are in this Bill.  I oppose it for these reasons.  He has not stated that he will grant a five-day week to Post Office workers.  If he said that I would certainly agree with this section.  I do not think there is a need for a Saturday morning delivery at all because most business houses are closed on Saturday. The Minister could readily dispense with the Saturday morning delivery but he has not promised a five-day week to Post Office workers.  I do not think the introduction of second-class mail will solve any problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to say except to suggest to the Minister that there is a possibility here that he might be taking on powers which, perhaps, he might not misuse&mdash;I understand he is a very reasonable person&mdash;but which a subsequent Minister might find it possible to misuse.  It should be possible for him to be more specific about the free postage facilities.  Everybody would agree they should be provided for the category he mentioned, the blind, but is this free postage facility to be provided for a certain group, say, the socially dependent group?  If that is so I am sure the Minister would get every support from all parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Minister's speech he used the word &ldquo;primarily&rdquo;.  He said this was required &ldquo;primarily&rdquo;<i>et cetera</i> for packets to be adapted for the use of the blind.  The word &ldquo;primarily&rdquo; is a slightly frightening one in a speech by a Minister because it could be that he is attempting to conceal something, his secondary purpose, and his secondary purpose could possibly be, as Deputy Dr. O'Connell said, that we are heading towards this idea of having a first- and second-class mail and that he is taking powers in sections 2 and 4 which would allow him to change the rates and to designate second-class mail.  It <Col N="323" /> seems to me that it would be possible to introduce a scheme of first- and second-class mail with higher and lower rates for these respectively.  I do not think that is something which should be tolerated without frank debate on its merits.  The general process of increasing postal rates should, as other Deputies have said, be restricted to a decision by the Minister, or preferably by the Minister for Finance at Budget time or any other time at which he decides to change these rates in order to increase Exchequer income. It should be something which we would be in a position to debate as such an issue, that is, an increase in indirect taxation.  There has been so much of this general trend away from direct and towards indirect taxation, that is placing the burden of raising funds for various social services on the white collar worker and the manual worker rather than on the very wealthy person, that any possibility of this kind of thing developing must be watched very carefully by us here.  We would like an assurance from the Minister in this regard that this legislation cannot possibly be used by him to increase postal charges without reference to the Dáil and having a discussion on it here.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of the approach to the five-day week and the improvement of working conditions of postal workers, everybody welcomes the improvement because in many cases conditions were extremely bad.  I understand they are improving.  But I think the attitude is wrong.  If we are giving a five-day week, shorter hours and better working conditions, the proper approach is to increase staff and continue to provide the same service. As Deputy O'Connell said, many of these so-called items of second-class mail contain business letters of one kind or another which are important to the people who send them and it seems to be wrong to slow down or reduce the efficiency of the service simply because you happen to be improving conditions of employment.  I do not see why it should be taken out on the service.</P>
    <P>By all means improve conditions of service but maintain the quality of the service provided by the Post Office <Col N="324" /> generally.  Why does the Minister not take that approach rather than this spinning jenny sort of refusal to recognise that because of trade union pressure and one thing or another these improvements in staff conditions had to be made?  They should not be made at the expense of reducing the quality of the service by the Post Office particularly as many people are not happy about the quality of service provided at present.  Any suggestion that there should be reduction in efficiency is one that I would personally deprecate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am naturally very pleased that the Bill on the whole should have met with so much approval in the House.  This was something I expected on the basis of the fact that it was bringing free postal services in respect of correspondence for the blind.  This was something that would naturally be welcomed on all sides.  I am a little worried about the various conclusions that have been drawn by some speakers as to what is behind the Bill because I think some Members have reached conclusions which are not in any way justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell mentioned&mdash;I give him credit that he did so with a sort of glint in his eye&mdash;that he felt that the power the Minister was taking might result in enabling him to give particular postal facilities to certain sections that could, I suppose, be adequately described as the non-handicapped except that they might be members of a particular political Party. There is no such intention in this Bill. If Deputies have studied carefully the wording of my statement or read the text of it&mdash;I note that Deputy Dr. Browne did have the opportunity before speaking of going through my speech; this was pretty evident&mdash;they would know that I spelled out that the powers sought did enable me to provide this service to other classes; that initially it was being provided for the blind and that it was to other classes of that kind it could be extended.  The real reason in leaving it open is to enable me, if it is eventually decided by agreement with the Universal Postal Union to extend it to other classes, to do so without having to come back to the Dáil to introduce <Col N="325" /> further legislation to provide such a facility.</P>
    <P>As regards the allegation made by most of the speakers, and taken, possibly, from Deputy O'Donnell's initial remarks, that it is a type of enabling legislation to facilitate the introduction of a further mini-Budget, the position is, in this regard, that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has always had power to increase postal and telephone rates without coming to the Dáil.  He still has this power and there is nothing in the Bill to give him further power in this regard.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs are expected to meet their commitments and be able to pay for themselves.  This is why towards the end of last year we had to increase postal charges&mdash;to enable the Department to pay their way.</P>
    <P>This brings me to Deputy Dr. Browne's reference to improved conditions for employees.  He said we should not take it out on the users of the service&mdash;or possibly the reverse: if we have to improve conditions for the staff we should not try to blame the staff for a curtailment of service.  I think that was the way he put it.  The whole idea behind this enabling legislation, the change I am seeking in this Bill to enable me to delay service to the type of packets that I want to delay, circulars and bills and packets of this kind, is to further rationalisation in the sorting and delivery of letters. The present position is that roughly 85 per cent of mail is dealt with in the first post and the remainder in the second post.  We would get a far better balance if we could hold the open letters and printed matter for an afternoon post and be able to deal with what I term first-class mail on the early post.</P>
    <P>In that regard I should like to refer to the comparison with what has already been done in the United Kingdom. This legislation has no connection with what has been done over there.  This is not the creation of a new standard or a distinction between one type of first-class mail and another.  The position in the United Kingdom is that you had two different types of first-class mail introduced.  Here, we have two different charges: we have the <Col N="326" /> straightforward sixpenny post and the open post or fourpenny post, what we conveniently describe as second-class mail.  At the moment we have peak periods.  Over 50 per cent of the mail posted in Dublin in any one day over a given period is posted between 4 o'clock and 6 o'clock in the afternoon. That brings 50 per cent of our mail into the sorting offices in that period.  Between 4 o'clock and 7.30 p.m., 50 per cent of the sorting of the mail in the city of Dublin must be dealt with.  It is in order to rationalise this and to plan it out in such a way that we can give better attention to our first-class mail that I am seeking the power I am seeking in this legislation.</P>
    <P>There is really no foundation for the implications that have been drawn in connection with these two classes of mail to which a lot of reference has been made.  In regard to Deputy O'Donnell's court case, let me say that we are trying to plan and regulate the collections in such a way that none of our drivers will of necessity have to exceed the speed limit in order to meet a deadline.  I would hope that the mail van drivers would start a bit earlier so that they would not have to break the speed limit.  I know it is urgent that we should get our mail delivered.  We have a time schedule which enables our drivers to get from one place to another in a given time without having of necessity to break the speed limit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the specific case about which the Deputy was speaking.  Deputy Desmond also welcomed the Bill and like most other speakers he was rather worried about this implication.  I want to assure the House that there is nothing in this measure which has any black side. There is nothing in any shape or form in it which I am trying to hide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Esmonde who mentioned the question of the two posts, the morning and afternoon delivery.  It does not affect his area because there is only one post.  The main problem as outlined in my introductory remarks is in the city of <Col N="327" /> Dublin, due to various traffic problems and the general congestion which takes place.  There is no reason for believing that these arrangements cannot improve what he says he has experience of, and there is certainly no reason to believe that there is any possibility or any danger or any likelihood of a disimprovement in that service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde also said that in my statement there was no straightforward outlining of a decision with regard to the introduction of the five-day week for postmen.  This was covered in my remarks because I said that the form of rationalisation in regard to the five-day week was not quite clear and that no decision had yet been taken.  I was interested to hear Deputy Dr. O'Connell spelling out quite clearly that there was no necessity for a Saturday delivery.  Let me say that as of now I do not agree with him.  One aspect of the whole postal service which I must look carefully into is the question of the five-day week and the possibility of having a staggered five-day week.  I do not think we are ready to accept the non-delivery of mail or the non-attention to mail on Saturdays and Sundays.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have endeavoured to cover most of the points raised.  There is nothing secret behind this.  It is quite clearly in the open.  We want to provide this service for the blind.  The cost of the service will not be enormous.  The present charges of between ½d and 2½d are nominal.  We are not conferring any great benefit.  We are transferring a function.  Any increase in charges must <Col N="328" /> go to the Minister for Finance for approval so there is not any question of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs taking over a sort of budgetary power.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond said there has been an increase in mail.  There has been an overall increase of 24 per cent in the past ten years.  There is this extra pressure, and this is to enable us to try to deal with it without being hogtied, as it were, by a regulation which has been there since 1908.  I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  In my Budget speech on 23rd April, 1968, I announced the Government's decision to change to decimal currency on the basis of the £, new penny system with effect from 15th February, 1971.  As I mentioned on that occasion the weight of opinion had clearly come out in favour of this system and the Government, after full consideration, decided to adopt it as being the most convenient and practicable. Britain will adopt the same system on the same date.  On 12th June, 1968, the House agreed to a Supplementary Estimate for expenses of the Irish Decimal Currency Board which I set up to facilitate the changeover to the new currency system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Bill is the first of two which will be needed to give effect to the decision I have mentioned.  It provides for the introduction of the new decimal system and coinage and for the discontinuance of the present shillings-and-pence system in due course.  As indicated in the explanatory memorandum which I have circulated, a second Bill later this year will deal with other matters of detail.  These are matters such as the conversion of bank balances, the effect of the change on <Col N="330" /> hire purchase and other contracts and legal tender arrangements during the changeover period beginning on 15th February, 1971.  The Decimal Currency Board is at present studying the matters that need to be dealt with in the second Bill, in consultation with the interests concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputies will also see from the explanatory memorandum that most of the provisions in the Bill are technical provisions in relation to coinage.  These follow the lines of provisions contained in the Coinage Act, 1950, which will be repealed.  I shall comment briefly on some of the main new provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 2 establishes the relationship between the £ and the new penny. The new penny will be equal in value to one-hundredth part of a £.  Thus one new penny will equal 2.4 of our present pence, 5 new pence will equal 1s and so on.  Section 3 authorises the issue of the new coins.  As already announced it has been decided to issue six decimal coins.  These are the</P>

    <P>The 50, 10 and 5 new penny coins will be cupro-nickel and the other three will be bronze.  The new bronze coins will be lighter and easier to handle than the present bronze coins.  The Bill does not prescribe details of the designs for the new coins.  It is the practice for the Minister for Finance to do this by regulations.  I announced the designs for the new coins a few months ago. Copies of an illustrated leaflet showing the design decided upon are available in the Library.</P>
    <P>The legal tender limits set out in section 8 of the Bill are higher than those for the present coins.  The 50 new penny coin will be legal tender for payment of amounts up to £10.  This is appropriate in view of the high value of the coin&mdash;10s in present currency. The limits for the other coins are also being increased to bring them into line with present-day conditions.  The 5 new penny and 10 new penny coins will be <Col N="331" /> legal tender for amounts up to £5 while existing silver coins are legal tender for only £2.  The legal tender limit for bronze decimal coins will be 20 new pence&mdash;4 shillings in present currency&mdash;as against 1/- for the present copper coins.</P>
    <P>The Decimal Currency Board has recommended that some of the new coins should be issued in advance of 15th February, 1971 so that people can become accustomed to them before the changeover date.  Sections 9 and 10 of the Bill would allow the Central Bank to issue the 5, 10 and 50 new penny coins in this way.  These coins have exact equivalent values in £sd and can be used in these values until 15th February, 1971.  Subject to the enactment of the legislation the Central Bank plans to start the issue of 5 new penny and 10 new penny coins this autumn and to put the 50 new penny coin into circulation early next year.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that section 16 of the Bill empowers the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make regulations prescribing how certain payments involving a halfpenny are to be varied when the ½d coin is demonetised on and from 1st August, 1969.  The payments concerned are small premiums under industrial life assurance policies and payments under friendly society contracts.  A large number of such payments involve an odd ½d.  It is necessary to have a statutory provision to prescribe how these contractual payments are to be adapted to the new situation.  Section 16 will enable the Minister for Industry and Commerce to ensure that the total amount payable over a period will be maintained constant in each case.</P>
    <P>Information about the business and other preparations needed for the change to decimal currency has been published by the Decimal Currency Board over the period since its establishment. Copies of bulletins issued some months ago are available in the Library.  Up to the present the board has been placing most emphasis on publicity measures to persuade the business sector to get preparations made in good time&mdash;in particular to ensure that accounting and other machines will be capable of decimal <Col N="332" /> working.  In general the response by businesses appears to be satisfactory. In this year's Budget I announced some special tax concessions in respect of decimalised machinery including a provision to allow &ldquo;free depreciation&rdquo; for new machinery purchased for decimalisation.</P>
    <P>Preparations by the Post Office, the Department of Education, the other Departments, and the public sector generally are proceeding.  The detailed instruction of the general public about the use of decimal coinage will be effected through an intensive campaign in the autumn of 1970.  Thus it will be fresh in people's minds when Decimal Day arrives on 15th February, 1971.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I hope that any businessman who has been tardy about preparing for decimal currency will be stimulated by the passage of this Bill to take early action.  The advantages to be obtained from the decimal system are well worth achieving and it is in everybody's interest that the changeover should go through smoothly and quickly.  Timely preparations will ensure that this objective is achieved.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might also mention at this stage a question which has presented itself to the minds of some Deputies, as to why this is called the Decimal Currency (No. 2) Bill.  The reason for that is that the first piece of decimal currency legislation, the Decimal Currency Bill, 1969, was introduced on the 16th April, 1969, and the Dáil was dissolved before the text was circulated. We must, therefore, call this legislation the Decimal Currency (No. 2) Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to say.  The actual publicity arrangements undertaken for the Government by the Decimal Currency Board cost perhaps £200,000.  What it will cost the community as a whole is very difficult to measure.  An estimate of between £2 million and £3 million was made by a working party, but I would not place a great deal of reliance on such an estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Bill which the Minister has introduced we are dealing <Col N="333" /> with a proposal to alter our present currency, and I suppose one can accept that in relation to developments internationally and in Europe in particular, some step along those lines is probably unavoidable.  Having said that, one, nevertheless, must look with some doubt on the manner in which this is being done.  It appears to me that here, as so often in the past, we are merely doing exactly as the British have done; we are adopting the same system as they have already adopted.  It may be that that is again a thing which could not be avoided, but I should like to see it argued and reasoned out.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated in his statement the general outlines of what the Bill proposes.  It proposes to set up a new coinage: 50 new pence value 10s; ten new pence value 2s; five new pence value 1s; two new pence value 4.8 pence; one new penny value 2.4 pence and ½ new penny value 1.2 pence.  I should like to know from the Minister has there been any study or appreciation of the effect this turnover will have on our present price system and, accordingly, on the cost of living.  There will be no sixpence and none of the usual units to which we have been accustomed.  It does appear, therefore, that there must be an effect on prices. The Minister and the board will, I think, have considered this aspect and I should like the Minister to give some indication to the House as to what the impact is likely to be.  I hope he will be able to say the change will not have a large impact, but some information on this aspect should be given.</P>
      <P>While it is not strictly relevant to the Bill, but since it has been referred to by the Minister, I should like to express some doubt about the suggested design of the new coins.  Upon what basis was this design selected?  It does not appear to be in accordance with the practice up to this.  There has been some public reaction against the suggested design.  I do not know whether the Minister is committed to this design or whether there can be any further re-examination of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, I welcome the introduction by the Government of this alien system of mensuration.  I should like to echo the note of perturbation <Col N="334" /> voiced by Deputy O'Higgins. The opportunity will certainly be used to adjust prices slightly upwards. Where a decision arises shopkeepers will inevitably give it to their own advantage and against the interests of their customers.  This is something to which public reference must be made at an early stage; it is something for which the public must be prepared.  I do not mean they must be prepared for rising prices; I mean they must be prepared to struggle against that price rise which is not inevitable.</P>
      <P>I notice that the Minister used this occasion to hope that any businessmen who had been tardy about preparing for decimal currency will be stimulated into preparation now by the passage of this Bill.  I want to take this opportunity to put in a plea for another section of the community, namely, schoolchildren. I know it is not directly relevant to the Department of Finance but it is relevant to decimal currency. In this country as, indeed, in Britain we have debauched many generations of schoolchildren by the use of a ridiculous and antiquated system of money.  We have convinced at least 100 years of schoolchildren, long after a better system was in widespread use elsewhere, that mathematics was something very difficult, except for the select few.  This heresy was fostered because children were forced to multiply and divide, and generally fiddle about with sums in pounds, shillings and pence, in an extremely dull and boring way.  I use this occasion now to beg not alone businessmen but also teachers and those responsible for education to ensure that this murder machine, grinding the minds of our children into pulp, is instantly halted and they are no longer required to carry out these ridiculous manipulations of antiquated currencies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing at all against the decimal system, but I have everything against this Bill and I should like now to speak personally against it.  The Minister will be aware that, when it was proposed to introduce decimal currency in Britain, the proposal was successful only because the party whips were applied.  That was the way in which the decimal currency legislation was pushed through against, I might say, the wishes of a very large <Col N="335" /> proportion of the British public and against, possibly, the wishes of the majority in the British Parliament.  The measure was pushed through because of some extraordinary mystical belief in the importance of preserving the position of sterling.  The British heavy pound was to be preserved regardless of whether it was, in fact, a proper unit of currency for modern use.</P>
      <P>The measure was pushed through in Britain for reasons which have nothing to do with us.  We do not have any concern with the prestige of sterling.  We are concerned with its strength, but the mystical aspects need not concern us so much and there was no need for us to follow the British in this respect. Unfortunately, we have fallen into the habit of following Britain, even when there are far better examples elsewhere. A recent illustration of this was the Standard Time Bill.  The Minister came into the Seanad and had the effrontery to tell us there that every country in Europe was adopting the same time and we had to fall into line.  I pointed out to the Minister that if he were as avid a reader of <i>Cooke's</i> continental timetable as I was he would know that Italy had introduced a different time, without in any way disrupting the European Economic Community or posing any impossible problems except, perhaps, for railway workers.  The Minister did not know that and, not knowing it, he was telling us that we had to do the same as Britain.  He did not seem to know either that this country, when it was an integral part of the United Kingdom, had its own time. Had he consulted the 1910 <i>Bradshaw,</i> recently reissued, he would have noticed the data given there with regard to the timetable relating to steamer services between Ireland and Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet, now that we are an independent country, we must be identical with Britain in every respect.  In fact, we had a separate currency with a separate value and, throughout the entire period of the Union, a different time. There is no reason why we should not have a different currency, if it suits us.  The fact is that, throughout Europe, and fairly generally throughout the world, except in some ex-British <Col N="336" /> colonies, which have not fully thrown off their British shackles, the unit of currency is something in the range of two to three and, in some cases, four shillings.  There is good reason for this.  The reason was borne in on me very forcefully last year when, on holiday in France, I had occasion to purchase various goods. When I went to buy a bottle of Perrier, being personally of abstemious taste&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Imagine buying Perrier in France.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitGerald Dr. FitGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I noticed the price ranged from 58 to 64 centimes. The price varied according to the shop and I noticed that French shoppers bought their Perrier in the 58 centimes shop and not in the 64 centimes shop. The appropriate unit which enables price competition to be maintained is the existing five.  The Minister will tell us no doubt that the farthing has been an unworkable coin, has been rejected and has gone out of circulation.  That is perfectly true.  The farthing, of course, is not a unit; it is a vulgar fraction of a unit and not even that common vulgar fraction of one halfpenny, the half unit, but a quarter unit which is something people do not accept.  The experience elsewhere is that, in order to get accurate pricing and in order to ensure value for money, differentiation in pricing of the order of one farthing in the purchasing power of money is required and that purchasing power unit should be a unit and not a fraction.  That has been the experience throughout virtually all of Europe.  There is no reason why we should differ in this respect.  I refuse to believe that the Irish or the British are so careless in their shopping that they do not care if they spend four times the amount people in France and other countries spend when they are shopping. The Government had the matter put to them by, for example, the Federation of Irish Industries, which is not exactly a revolutionary body and, when it puts forward a view of this kind, you can be certain that a lot of thought has gone into it and that it is unlikely to disrupt the economy or lead to serious economic problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed, and perhaps <Col N="337" /> I have been misinformed, that the view of the Federation was given considerable weight by the Government and it has even been said that the Government, or the Minister perhaps, before going to the Government, was persuaded of the validity of their view on the grounds I have put forward but that when it came to making a decision the intervention of the Irish Banks Standing Committee changed his mind.  It has been said that they told the Minister that it was impossible and that nothing must break closeness of the link with sterling.</P>
    <P>They went so far as to say that anything which involved putting in a decimal point into the £ when relating our £ with the British £ would complicate matters and foreign exchange control would be necessary for all our transactions with Britain.  If, in fact, the committee made this statement I cannot help feeling that there is something wrong with the way they do business.  If the Minister was so persuaded, it clearly goes to show that this Government are excessively under the influence of the bankers.  When the weight of opinion here was clearly against the proposal to go along with Britain and when there was the advantage of having a unit of appropriate size for the purposes of commerce, trading and shopping, clearly the Government should not have been persuaded to adopt a proposal contrary to our interest merely because of the argument put forward by the banks.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a mistake, not because it decimalises currency, which I accept&mdash; although I am not sure that the problem of vulgar fractions and points and so on are the main source of torture for our children and I could name others. Simplification does not merely mean following in every respect what Britain does and adopting their heavy £ is economically and socially disadvantageous. It will introduce into our system of commerce, trade and shopping a currency which is quite inappropriate and it means that the smallest unit will be the equivalent of 2.4d. today.  The Government, recognising that this unit was too big and that the system was undesirable, have been forced to bastardise the decimal system by introducing the half unit.  This, of course, <Col N="338" /> destroys much of the full value of the decimal system because the halfpenny comes back in again.  Having got rid of our vulgar fractions, which was the purpose of this exercise apparently, they are to be reintroduced because the unit the Government have chosen is the penny which is so large&mdash;2.4d&mdash;that even the Government can see that such a unit for shopping purposes is far too big, and even for ordinary purposes.  It is going to introduce an inflation in prices and disrupt our economic system.  They have been forced to damage the very system they are introducing by introducing a half unit.  This half unit will be the equivalent of 1.2d today and to have that as a unit by which one differentiates one price from another, a unit which is five times as large as the similar units which exist in most European countries, is to introduce a completely unacceptable and undesirable system of currency.</P>
    <P>It is true, of course, that at the rate at which money is losing its value due to the present Government, especially in the last two years when prices have risen by an average of five per cent per annum, and if that process continues&mdash; if the Government remain in power for such a length of time, which we think unlikely, and hope will not happen&mdash; the value of the penny will be so reduced that this unit will become the appropriate unit.  I am prepared to believe that 25 years of Fianna Fáil rule will justify this Bill; but if we pass this Bill we should not have to advocate the passage of 25 years to justify it.  Therefore, I am opposed to this Bill in its present form.  It is a serious mistake. It is a pity it was not fully debated, and here I think the fault lies with the Opposition and with myself in that regard.  The Opposition could have been more active in this regard.  It is all right to blame the Government for things but the Opposition must be active.  I must confess that I did not actively oppose this at the time when it was going through because it started in the Lower House and the damage was done before it reached the Upper House.</P>
    <P>Another point is that the design of our coins has caused concern <Col N="339" /> among everybody concerned with the aesthetics of our coins.  One of the great things to the credit of the first Government was the way in which they handled this problem of coinage.  The Minister did not simply take a design which was sent to him, decide that he liked it and show it to the Civil Service and say: &ldquo;That is it.&rdquo;  The Government of the day set up a committee of distinguished personnel, including W.B. Yeats, to look into the matter of designs from all parts of the world.  They decided on a design which has been very appropriate to this agricultural country and which has been admired enormously.</P>
    <P>Now we have introduced a different kind of design and every second coin will be different in character.  It is a matter of opinion&mdash;and I am not in a position to give an opinion because I do not value my aesthetical opinion to that extent&mdash;whether it is a good or bad design; but I do not like it and I feel that combining two such different designs in a single series is going to damage the unity and the prestige of our coinage and the prestige of our country.  I think it is deplorable and I would ask the Minister to reconsider his decision.  He should either have our coinage designed from scratch in a single series, adopt the procedure adopted by the first Government, or see if it might be possible to design new coins in the idiom of the existing set of coins.  The better thing might be to have a new set.  It may be that the position has gone too far, that the Minister's <i>ad hoc</i> decision has now been processed to the point of no return and that he now has to stick with this mixed up coinage.  Even if we have to have this for a period I would appeal to the Minister to set aside his own views, which may be of more value than mine, and to set up a similar system to that of the first Government to have a new design which will do credit to the country.</P>
    <P>For many years we were unfortunate in our postage stamps.  Their design may have seemed appropriate at the time it was introduced but it never seemed to me to be particularly pleasing aesthetically.  Certainly it has been <Col N="340" /> inappropriate for the last 30 or 40 years.  However, we did have a good coinage.  The Minister should reconsider this matter, if it has not gone too far, to ensure that we have a decent coinage.  He should set up an appropriate committee with appropriate qualifications to recommend a design for a permanent coinage which would do us credit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be inclined to agree with Deputy FitzGerald in regard to having two different coins.  I, personally, think a mistake has been made by the Minister or his advisers in not following either one design or the other. After all, practically every country has its own distinctive design and we had such a design.  We now seem to have changed it, for some extraordinary reason.  I am not claiming to be an expert on this matter but I do feel that the changing of the design is a mistake. Therefore, the Minister, if he can now, should have another look at it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister had not to change the design.  He did not have to change from animals to something else, and that is what he did.  Incidentally, may I comment, as I did on the last occasion, that I was very surprised that the Minister dropped the design of the horse.  I thought he was the one Minister who would have retained the horse on the coinage.  As it was the half dollar, it may have been difficult to have retained it but in a few years time it would have been accepted under a new value.  I feel that a mistake has been made there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="341" /> It is wrong to suggest that this discussion now is the end of the decimal coinage discussion because this is only the Second Reading of the Bill and if we feel strongly enough about it there is no reason why we should not have many a long hour's discussion on the floor of this House in regard to the ultimate designs and the other matters affected by the Bill.</P>
    <P>In passing, I should like to ask the Minister if he is aware that at present pennies, which are not very much used except for certain things, are disappearing completely and that some organisations find it almost impossible to get pennies, that no further pennies are being issued by the banks and there is likely to be a very grave shortage of pennies before the decimal coinage comes into operation.  This will have the same effect as came about when the farthing and the halfpenny disappeared.  When that happened the person selling something in a shop always got the advantage because he said he would arrange to make up whatever the odd coin was the next time and the next time never came.  We are now reaching the stage where pennies will be treated in the same way.  The Minister should do something about it because it will be a long time before the decimal currency will be in general distribution and if pennies disappear now very considerable upset will be caused.  The Minister should take cognisance of the fact that pennies are becoming terribly scarce.</P>
    <P>I quite agree with Deputy FitzGerald and the other people who referred to the value of the coin of lowest value in the new coinage because it might be very convenient for a Minister for Finance to be able to say that the least amount by which he can increase taxation is a half new penny, which is 1.2 of the present pence.  Even the 0.2d, added up, will add considerably to the additional prices which we know will occur as a result of the budgets in years to come.  Possibly, the 10/basis may not have been the correct one.  Most certainly, the smallest half new penny, value 1.2d, is not very realistic.  It simply means&mdash;and the Minister must accept this&mdash;an increase in the cost of living to those who buy <Col N="342" /> in small quantities.  Again and again in the House we have heard people who do not seem to accept the fact that there are still people who are able to pay only for half pounds of this and quarter pounds of that.  Up to now such people have been able to save halfpennies and pennies which they find useful at the end of the week in balancing their budgets. Under the new system that will not be possible and, therefore, it does mean an increase in their cost of living. For that reason, if for no other, the Minister should make some effort to have a smaller value coin than the new halfpenny.</P>
    <P>Most of the provisions in the Bill as published are matters which have to be dealt with and can be dealt with on Committee Stage but I do not think that the Minister is being realistic when he talks about the cost of the change-over from the present currency to decimal currency.  I do not think he is realistic when he talks about the change-over as far as industry is concerned. I am quite sure he will find that the amount of money involved is much greater and that it will be difficult to get people to change until the change is forced on them.  I do know that small firms, in particular, will think, not twice, but half a dozen times, before they spend money changing over until they have to do so.</P>
    <P>I was listening the other day to a Minister talking about smokeless zones and about how quickly smokeless zones could be brought about and about what happened in other countries where millions of pounds were being spent in order to achieve this objective. I think the Minister has the same attitude of mind here.  He is talking now of a change-over at the expense of the people who will be making the change and that, ultimately, is at the expense of the person who is trading with those people.  The holding out of an income tax concession will not encourage anybody.  This is a matter which will have to be dealt with in a much more serious way by the Minister for Finance than has been the case up to the present.  The Minister seems to imagine that all he has to do is to have this Bill passed and to publish <Col N="343" /> the fact that the decimal coinage is here or will be here within two years and that everyone will rush around to put their house in order. He must realise, if he stops to think, that that is not the case and that, in fact, it will be extremely difficult to get business in general in this country to accept that it was necessary to do it at all.</P>
    <P>I quite agree that this is something which had to come about.  There is no use in suggesting that we should stay here in isolation while everybody was changing over to decimal currency or using decimal currency.  Deputy Keating was perfectly correct when he said that our children, particularly the smaller children, are having far more difficulty in mastering figures because of the fact that we have not used that system which is adopted elsewhere.  At the same time, I honestly believe that there will have to be a very big effort made to sell the new system and a new effort will have to be made by everybody concerned.  The Minister will probably tell me now that that big effort is being made, that we have been talking about it for quite some time. The suggestion which was introduced quite some time ago here and the copies of the coins issued to Deputies in the last Dáil are, to my mind, about all that has been done.  If the timetable referred to here is to be achieved, the matter will have to be tackled in a far more determined manner.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me again appeal to the Minister to have a look at the designs on the new coins and decide that a mixture of design is spoiling our series of coins.  I repeat that the half new penny will mean extra cost for people who will have very small incomes and who, therefore, will be buying in small quantities.</P>

      <P>Instead of denigrating the idea that we should tie our coinage to the same system as that which operates in Britain it might be well to remember that probably 75 per cent of our tourists come from Britain and that probably upwards of the same percentage, approximately, of our trade is conducted with Britain.  Therefore, it seems only natural that we should try to keep our new coinage in line with what they are doing over there.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that we have expressed our individuality in the new designs. Deputy FitzGerald does not particularly like the designs.  He is entitled to his opinion.  Personally, I like them very much.  I think they are magnificent. I hope the majority of the people will agree with my view that they are nice designs.  The best of all our other designs have been retained.  The new 5d piece has the same design as that on the back of our present shilling and the salmon on our present 2/- piece will be on the new 10d piece.  The woodcock on our farthing, which is going out of circulation, will appear on the new 50d piece, which is also of a very attractive shape.  Our present pennies and halfpennies are very heavy. I notice the Minister has not made any mention of paper notes.  I presume that the 10/- note and the £1 note will remain more or less the same.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I begin with the matter which Deputy Briscoe spoke about, and some other Deputies, too? I could, perhaps, recall to the House an incident that took place during the Renaissance in Italy.  A famous painter executed a brilliant masterpiece and, seeking to have it acclaimed by the populace, put it on display in the public square and asked that any member of the public who disliked a particular feature of the painting would paint it with a black mark.  The next day he discovered that the whole painting had been obliterated.  Undaunted, however, he returned to the fray and painted the work again, put it on exhibition and asked the general public to put a black mark on any particular feature of the painting that particularly pleased them.  To his satisfaction, he found the next day that, again, the whole painting had been completely blacked out.  The point of the story, I think, is that it is very difficult to get unanimity from the public on anything in which individual taste is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="346" /> I think Deputy FitzGerald picked a rather unhappy argument when he talked about the original coinage and the way that particular operation was carried out and how satisfactory it was. The person primarily responsible for the designs of the original coinage was Percy Metcalfe.  I am very pleased to be able to tell Deputy FitzGerald that I have a letter from no less a personage than Percy Metcalfe acclaiming the beauty of our new designs and expressing his satisfaction and appreciation of them.  As far as we possibly could, and for the purpose of continuity, we preserved every existing design.  I am sure Deputies are not overlooking the fact that the obverse side of the new coins will be exactly the same as the obverse side of the old coins.  Where we could, we kept&mdash;and it was possible to do so&mdash;the designs on the old coinage and carried them forward to the new coinage, as Deputy Briscoe pointed out.  Only where we were forced by circumstances to adopt new designs did we do so.  The exigencies of the situation required that we change the design on certain of the coins.  Faced with that necessity, we chose what in our view were the best suggestions put to us.  A committee established by the Central Bank examined the whole problem.  I think a competition held by the Central Bank had not a very successful outcome.  The situation is that these designs were recommended to me by the Central Bank for my approval.  My role in the matter was confined to an enthusiastic acceptance of a recommendation put forward by the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Finally, in connection with designs, so anxious were we to preserve continuity and to hold on to as many of the old coinage designs as we could that, in the new ten shilling coin, we brought back the woodcock design from the outgoing farthing.  We could do that because the farthing is going out of circulation.  However, we could not do that with the horse design because it would be confused with the existing half-crown.  Therefore, far from seeking to change for change's sake, we went to considerable lengths to try to hold on to as many of the original designs as we could.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="347" /> I consider the designs of our original coins quite wonderful.  Perhaps of their time they are the best in the world. Mind you, other countries now have come along with some very fine designs also.  However, I want to point out that when these original designs were being introduced there was furious controversy about them and I understand that the country was practically evenly divided at the time for and against.  We have received very little public reaction to the designs we are putting forward on this occasion and, indeed, in so far as we are getting public reaction, informed public reaction, it has been, to a considerable extent, favourable.</P>
    <P>Somebody made the point about keeping the ten shilling note.  This was also carefully considered but the arguments in favour of a 10/- coin are quite overwhelming.  The decision again in this respect was taken after the most mature consideration and a great deal of consultation.  The arguments for a 10/- coin instead of a 10/note are to my mind quite incontrovertible.</P>

      <P>Deputy FitzGerald was, I think, the only one who questioned the £ new penny system <i>ab initio</i> as it were.  I do not know about that.  First of all, I want to say that we do not slavishly follow Britain for the sake of following Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no particular advantage in doing something just for the sake of being different.  I published a booklet in June, 1967, on this whole question of the new system and I invited views from the general public. We got a very good response to that booklet.  The overwhelming response was in favour of the £ new penny, new halfpenny system.  From recollection I think Deputy FitzGerald is probably right when he says that the FII opted for a different system but I think they were alone in opting for that system. Whatever advantage there might be in opting for a system that the Cana-dians, Australians, New Zealanders or South Africans have opted for, that is the 10/- system, I could not see any merit at all in the florin system.  It does not seem to me to have any advantages. It seems to have many disadvantages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what system we adopted it would have disadvantages and we finally selected, after weighing all the <Col N="349" /> views put before us, what in our view was the system that had most advantages and least disadvantages and the fact that that involved doing the same as Britain did was, as far as we are concerned, totally coincidental but undoubtedly one of the factors that weighed with us was the convenience, for many purposes, of having the same system as will operate in Britain and in the Six Counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If it weighed how was it merely coincidental?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the sort of little smart alecky trick I am not concerned even to answer.  I am trying to explain how we came to the decision to do this and the decision was dic-tated to us by the overwhelming public reaction in favour of this new system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Any sensible person must realise that there are very considerable advantages in having the same system as obtains in Britain. Some people undoubtedly might have preferred if Britain had opted for a different system.  Perhaps, many people would have preferred if Britain had opted for the 10/- system.  Perhaps, if they had done that we might have taken a different decision, but I want to make the point that in all these matters we try to decide what is in the best interests of this country and of the Irish people and we follow that course. At the present time we are pursuing financial and economic policies which are totally different from those being pursued in Britain and it is just a silly and foolish kind of criticism to try to suggest that for some reason of weak-ness or weak-mindedness we slavishly follow Britain for the sake of following Britain.  The simple truth of the matter is we do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully seemed to think that we were not being active enough in getting the public and getting the business community alerted to the necessity to prepare for the change-over.  We have been doing a great deal in my opinion.  The Irish Decimal Currency Board have been very active and receiving a great deal of co-operation <Col N="350" /> from business organisations.  I feel that at this stage the preparations are pro-ceeding as satisfactorily as we would expect them to.  One must proceed in this business of the change-over along a carefully defined path.  The programme must be very carefully plotted and things must be done in sequence. The right time to really alert the general public to the impending change-over is undoubtedly the autumn of 1970.  Between now and then various steps should be taken at particular times and these steps, so far, have been taken so far as they were necessary.  We will continue to take them between now and the change-over date.  One could make the mistake of doing some things too soon and I feel that the Decimal Currency Board have mapped out a very sensible programme and are pro-ceeding at a satisfactory pace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There is, I understand, a temporary shortage of pennies, despite the fact that there is actually £400,000 worth of pennies in circulation.  The Central Bank regard this shortage as temporary.  It is due to a sudden upsurge in demand, the kind of thing that happens from time to time, but they expect, within a very short space of time, to be able to make adequate supplies of pennies available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at the moment but they are starting to do so now. There is quite a volume of pennies in circulation at present, £400,000 worth. Naturally, one aspect of this matter which is of vital concern to Deputies and the general public is the question of prices.  There is no reason at all why <Col N="351" /> he change-over should adversely affect price levels in any way.  I suppose, inevitably, there will be some rounding up of prices but there should also be rounding down.  Experience in other countries and, notably, in two countries which we have studied very carefully and in which we have many contacts, New Zealand and Australia, has been, on the whole, very satisfactory.</P>
      <P>There is always the factor of competition and the general public must and will be alerted to the necessity of being on guard against any excessive increase in prices.  We feel that by planning properly and intelligently, and with the requisite amount of publicity, we can carry through the operation without the general public suffering in any way by manipulation of prices by anybody.  In addition to the factors I have mentioned of competition and public awareness, we shall have in reserve statutory powers to deal with any attempt to exploit the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have said I have said.  There will be statutory powers in reserve to deal with any attempted exploitation of the general public but, personally, I believe the two most important factors in the situation are public opinion and awareness and competition.  As Deputy Tully has said, we can come to the various details and have further discussion on them on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dealt with most of the points raised by Deputies in the debate, but I should like to say again that the designs were selected by the Central Bank, approved by me, in the hope that they would find general acceptance aesthetically.  I should, perhaps, have mentioned one factor in regard to the designs which Deputies have not ad-verted to.  Some Deputies criticised the idea of a mixed coinage.  The coinage will be in two separate parts, as it were. There will be the cupro-nickel coins and the bronze coins.  Both of these, regarded as entities, have complete integrity. In other words, the designs <Col N="352" /> on each of the three coins in the two separate categories are the same.  In regard to the cupro-nickel coins Deputies will note that by bringing back the woodcock in that category we have the animal, the fish and the bird.  Looked at as a group it has integrity of design. The bronze coins can be looked at as a group and they also have integrity or continuity of design.  At the same time we have preserved intact the obverse designs from the original coins that we had.  On the whole, I think we have made good, wise, sensible, practical decisions in this matter and that we have taken the right aesthetic decisions also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In that connection it is important to try to keep the number of changes to the minimum.  This whole operation imposes considerable strain on the general public, particularly on older people.  We should have as few upsets or changes as possible for the present.  Until the operation is well and truly and successfully carried out we would not consider changing the design of the pound.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to increase the share capital of Min Fhéir (1959) Teo.  from £200,000 to £350,000 to enable the company to carry out its functions including, in particular, the manufacture of grass meal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Grass Meal (Production) (Amendment) Act, 1959, under which Min Fhéir (1959) Teo. was established, fixed the share capital of the company at £200,000 all of which has been issued.  The figure of £200,000 was based on a recommendation of the committee on the Glenamoy grass meal project.  The committee estimated that the project would involve capital expenditure of £164,113 and recommended <Col N="354" /> that £195,000 should be made available to the company, of which £165,000 would be for development purposes and £30,000 for working capital.  In the event, the actual expenditure on development work amounted to £191,000, that is, an excess expenditure of £27,000 approximately. The excess expenditure was due to increased costs between 1957-58 when the estimates were prepared and 1962-63 when the works were carried out and to some unforeseen expenditure for example on staff housing, culverts, outfalls and fire-fighting equipment.  The increase of £27,000 on development works reduced the com-pany's working capital to £9,000.</P>
    <P>The company commenced production in 1964 and output of grass meal rose from 914 tons in the first year of operation to 1,800 tons in 1968-69.  The level which the committee considered necessary for economic operation, however, was 2,000 to 2,500 tons a year. The reduced output was due to insuffi-ciency of funds to meet the costs of full grassland development and the provision of adequate drying and storage facilities coupled with difficult marketing conditions in recent years.</P>
    <P>The company has tentative plans for expansion involving the extension of the existing drying and storage facilities and the bringing into production of a further area of land held by it.  It re-quires an immediate injection of £50,000, however, to restore its working capital position.  It is proposed to continue production at an annual rate of 1,500 to 1,600 tons for the present, but the company is engaged in a survey of the production and marketing situation with a view to a decision, as early as possible, to increase production to the economic level of 2,500 tons per annum.  Included in these studies will be the question of going in for the production of new lines: the production of grass cubes or grass biscuits suit-able for inclusion in coarse dairy rations.</P>
    <P>The secondary purpose of the Bill is to enable the company to make short-term borrowing.  Under existing legis-lation the company may, under certain conditions, borrow money by means of debentures.  The pattern of the industry <Col N="355" /> is that stocks of grass meal build up during the production season&mdash;May to September&mdash;each year.  Sales are negli-gible until the autumn and reach their peak in the spring.  The company must have sufficient working capital to finance stocks at the highest point.  The normal commercial method of financing is by temporary bank borrowing.</P>
    <P>The provision of additional capital is essential if the company is to continue in business.  The survival of the company is a matter of vital social and economic importance to the Glenamoy area of County Mayo.  The direct staff employed by the company aver-ages 26 per year.  In addition, local smallholders are employed with their equipment for the cultivation, cutting and transporting of grass to the drying plant.  Wages paid in the locality in recent years exceeded £13,000 per annum.  In view of the difficulty of at-tracting new industry to remote parts of the West, it is necessary to foster and develop the industry already there. I, therefore, recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This project of producing grass meal in Mayo has had a very chequered past, a past which was coloured by some quite vicious political battles in this House, a past which, perhaps, it would be better to forget.  At the moment there are certain things which are not in the Minister's extremely short speech, which must be examined.  The first is that the direct staff employment is 26 people.  I observe from a study of the reports that lie in the Library of the House that the number of 26 has been a constant figure with no variation for years. Therefore, I take it that there was a direction that the number employed should remain the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the local smallholders carry grass to the drying plant is certainly a help but the number employed is 26.  Of course, such work as we talk about would be extremely seasonal and quite small.  The importance of the project may have been to some extent exaggerated by the Minister, but I want to say from this side of the House, and according to anyone I have <Col N="356" /> spoken to, that there is no desire to harm this company in any way because as the Minister pointed out, it is extremely difficult to attract industry to this type of area.</P>
    <P>However, it is important to point out just how much money has been involved in this project.  We now have a suggested figure of a £150,000 increase on capital of £200,000, making £350,000.  A large portion of this, as can be seen from the reports in the Dáil Library, was spent on development work on the bogs.  An end result which would have been satisfactory to this House and to everyone in the country, would have been if this development work had resulted in a trading profit, a net trading profit rather than a gross profit before payment of wages and expenses.  Unfortunately, such has not been the case.</P>
    <P>I observe in the report for the year 1967 that it is stated that &ldquo;it is quite clear that the project cannot be brought to an economic level until additional plant and machinery is in-stalled and production brought to the 2,000/2,500 ton level envisaged by the committee on the Glenamoy grass meal project.&rdquo;  Then we find that the net loss in that year was a figure of £12 0s. 1d. per ton, or a net loss of £12,857.  I want to emphasise that this sort of loss&mdash;all the losses I can find total up to something in or around £25,000 or £30,000&mdash;is treated in these accounts as a trading loss.  It takes no account at all of what they call their development account.  You can have a profit and loss account in an ordinary business, a trading account and a balance sheet.  I suppose this development account which has been referred to could be referred to as capital expenditure in a balance sheet.</P>
    <P>The purpose of capital expenditure is to produce a good trading position that can move a gross profit in the trading account to the profit and loss account.  They bear all the expenses of an ordinary business and produce a net profit after depreciation has been taken into account against that net profit.</P>
    <P>The year 1967 was a bad year for the production of grass because it was so dry.  Therefore, let us not be unfair. <Col N="357" /> In the year 1967, apart from the vast sum of some hundreds of thousands of pounds spent on development work there was a loss of £10 per week per employee.  It is unpleasant to have to say that in this House but let us face it, the truth must be spoken.  There was a loss of £10 per week per employee. It would appear, in fact, that if any other project in the area had been used that loss would be smaller.  Let us be fair because in 1966 which was not a dry year the loss&mdash;again not taking into account the vast sum of hundreds of thousands of pounds on development &mdash;was £248 per year per employee or about £5 a week.  In 1965 it was about the same&mdash;£237 per employee.</P>
    <P>This brings us to consider whether there is great wisdom in what the Minister is doing.  This Bill was produced just before the Dáil broke up before the election.  It could not possibly have been reached.  No doubt the Minister was pressed for time to consider all the matters under his control, and no doubt the Cabinet were pressed for time, but it is certainly a coincidence of some note that the Bill was circu-lated a couple of days before the Dáil broke up and that, under the normal statutory procedure, a motion had to be moved in pursuance of Standing Order No. 106 to reactivate the Bill without going through the whole paraphernalia again.</P>
    <P>However, there are certain things we must also consider.  Let me say that on this side of the House there is no desire to affect jobs in any way.  In proof of this I want to remind the House of what was done previously and which nobody can refute.  When it was found the previous company was incurring serious losses in 1956 and when it was put into voluntary liquidation, each one of the employees there was found employment as good as he had in the research project that was set up there at Glenamoy, research into what could be done in this area of Ireland on blanket bog and on hill-sides, in the application of lime, the improvement of grasslands and the ex-pansion of forestry.  Not one family in that area lost a job.</P>
    <P>Then in 1959 the grass meal project was reactivated.  The market for grass meal must now be examined.  There <Col N="358" /> has been failure in the export of grass meal across the seas.  There has been success in the export of our grass meal to Northern Ireland.  The market for grass meal here has im-proved from those days when, reading the reports, we can see the figure was in the region of 8,000 tons to a figure which could now be taken as between 12,000 to 14,000 tons within the country. The market in Northern Ireland accounts for 6,000 or 7,000 tons.  Therefore, the total market available to us, unless we can crack a market in Britain, which we have not succeeded in crack-ing, or a market on the Continent, which seems unlikely, is about 20,000 tons.</P>
    <P>The commercial operators in this country are quite capable of producing 20,000 tons.  Again they have worked in complete harmony and cohesion with the people in Glenamoy, and, as far as I know, they have even helped them to market some of their produce. At the same time, if the production in Glenamoy is increased, the labour potential there will be affected very minimally and, at the same time, there will be a danger of over-production of grass meal.  At that stage it will be a question of whether or not the grass meal manufactured on the very good grasslands in the east, in Westmeath, Meath, Dublin, Wexford and other places, will stand up on quality against the grass meal from Glenamoy.  If it does, then we shall find that the surplus of grass meal which exists at this moment in Glenamoy will exist to a greater extent and we may get our-selves into serious trouble.  The salient point still is that the amount of capital expenditure incurred on the preparation of blanket bog for the production of grass has not resulted in a net profit and that the degree of employment in relation to the capital expenditure now asked for has been unsatisfactory, and that if any commercial operator was employing 26 men after spending £350,000, he would be broke.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that, when we have gone this far, we should not go all the way.  We on this side of the House will not stop the Minister going the rest of the way.  But there is something that has to be safeguarded as well, that is, that the people who are <Col N="359" /> paying rents, rates and taxes and producing grass meal commercially will not be injured by this proposition, which is only a proposition before the House.  Before this Bill passes through here and becomes an Act&mdash;and it can be done this evening if the Minister goes into great detail on it as I would ask him to do&mdash;I want the Minister to guarantee that the operation there will not be so extensive as to damage the opportunities of the commercial firms to sell their grass meal.</P>
    <P>There is another factor the Minister did not mention, that is, that up to now the north of Ireland did not produce grass meal.  The northern Government has an institution called the North of Ireland Trust and the purpose of this body is to help agriculture to develop lines that are not being done properly or that have been neglected.  One of the things that has been done up there is to restart the growing of flax. They have put money into that and, like this project, they will not get their money back very easily.  At the moment in Limavady the North of Ireland Trust, in partnership or agreement with a subsidiary of ICI, Richardsons of Belfast, are preparing to make a colossal amount of grass meal. This is something the Minister must consider very seriously.  He must explain to us why we can go blissfully ahead knowing that our market is of the order of 20,000 tons and that another Government within the confines of this island have decided to produce some thousands of tons themselves.</P>
    <P>This North of Ireland Trust is not just an institution for commercial operations.  It is an institution to give example to the farmers, to the businessmen up there, to encourage them to visit the operations of that trust and then proceed to do the same themselves. It is something like a pilot farm and if this is to continue where are we going?  Are we to find, having expended £350,000, that the 26 people in Glenamoy will have hundreds of tons of grass meal piling up in their stores and be unable to sell it?</P>
    <P>My information on this is that there are two selling organisations operating in this country.  There is the ordinary private operator trying to sell on his <Col N="360" /> own, and then there is an organisation which has its travellers and everything else, pools its production and sells.  I understand that part of the problem is that there is no selling organisation in Glenamoy.</P>
    <P>We have been asked for a sum of £350,000.  Having read the Official Report and also read the reports of the two companies that are filed in the Library, I am in a quandary to know &mdash;and I should like the Minister to tell me when he is replying&mdash;whether the figure is £450,000 or £350,000.  The first company was floated for £100,000 capital in 1953.  It was in voluntary liquidation in 1956, and then the new company was floated in 1959.  If the £100,000 for the old company is not included in the £200,000 of the new company, then the figure is £100,000 plus £200,000 plus £150,000 sought now.  If the figure for the old company was taken into account when the new company was formed, then it is only £350,000.</P>
    <P>There is no point in trying to produce the bad side of a story and not produce the other side as well.  I am fully aware that there was a scheme under the old company whereby there were to be grants given to the extent of £350,000 and that this was wiped out under the provisions of the new company, and that the matter was dealt with as a development account.  However, I should like to be told whether the figure is £450,000 or £350,000, because I was not capable of working it out myself in the time that was available to me.</P>
    <P>The question of the plant in Northern Ireland, which plant I want to assure the Minister here and now is purchased, must make the Minister feel a bit worried about the fact that so far the best market we could crack was 20,000 tons and at the present moment we have that amount available.  At the same time, there is, I understand, a big stock left unsold from last year.  Now there seems to be a suggestion that production in Glenamoy should be increased to 150,000 tons&mdash;I am sorry: 2,500 tons &mdash;and the question of difficult marketing conditions, quoted by the Minister, is one, I suggest, that did not give that because, if the commercial people can get what we call in the milling trade <Col N="361" />&ldquo;down to bare boards&rdquo;, there is no reason why a Government official cannot be just as efficient and get down to the bare boards.</P>
    <P>I want now to come to another factor.  The losses produced on paper will, in my opinion, be far greater than they really are.  From personal experience I know that one buys milling machinery at a very high figure.  One puts that machinery into one's production unit.  If it is sold subsequently secondhand the price obtained is a mere fraction of what was paid for it and the only way one can get money out of it is by running it at a profit over ten, 15 or 20 years, availing of one's depreciation allowances, which, as the Minister knows, are akin to the wear and tear allowance against income tax and, when the machinery becomes obsolete, one then has enough liquid left to go out and buy another machine. That is the only way in which to get money out of milling machinery.  That is the only way in which to get money out of grass milling machinery and out of farming machinery.</P>
    <P>The machinery for making silage is akin to the machinery for gathering grass.  I and four of my neighbours entered into a partnership; we bought a silage-making machine.  Our system is quite simple.  We borrowed money from the Agricultural Credit Corporation and we floated a bank account in the local bank.  We charge ourselves so much per acre and we pay so much into the local bank and that sum has to cover not only the cost of repair and depreciation but also the fact that this type of machinery wears out very quickly.  We are charging ourselves a levy per acre to enable us to replace the machinery in four years.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the depreciation accounts here one must conclude that the figure is around ten per cent.  That is totally inadequate in relation to any farming machinery which is worked hard because it just does not last that long.  It is not of that long-lasting quality.  There is then in this question of machinery the fact that, if one is not making a profit, and remembering that in 1967 there was a loss of £12,000, the machinery that produced that loss is worth buttons.  The ten per cent depreciation <Col N="362" /> is not like the ten per cent or 20 per cent depreciation one is allowed on a car after three years, at which stage one can sell the car at the figure the depreciation has produced. In this type of machinery one cannot do that.  The only way in which one can get one's money back&mdash;I say this as a person of some experience&mdash;is by running the machinery all the time to make a profit.  Those responsible have not succeeded in doing that in Glenamoy.</P>
    <P>Taking into consideration the fact that this development related to a blanket bog and remembering the extra loss on the machinery, then the real loss here is huge in relation to the amount of employment involved.  I could not be more sympathetic towards the people needing employment there and the Minister should rack his brains to try to produce some kind of employment there.  I am glad the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been put in charge of the Gaeltacht as well because that may provide him with some opportunity of striking out and finding a way of providing employment in these areas.  I suggest, however, that 26 people employed, plus an odd few weeks for the farmers drawing in grass, can lead to only one conclusion; something in the order of a quarter of a million has been irrevocably buried.  That is a bad performance.</P>
    <P>We have not got all the facts and figures on this side of the House.  We are not opposed to this.  This is the Minister's responsibility.  Let the people decide at a later stage&mdash;a good deal later now&mdash;whether or not the Government are right, but I suggest that there is buried here a sum of about £250,000.  Viable, and existing, is either £100,000 or £200,000, depending on what is owed at the moment; I have not had time to go into that in absolute detail but, with that sort of expenditure and that sort of employment, the result has been disastrous.  It came about because the Fianna Fáil Government felt that the decision of the inter-Party Government in 1956 to reemploy every man employed there in the research station, with good conditions and salary, and closing down the plant, was wrong.  Fianna Fáil opened <Col N="363" /> it again and now we have to look at these figures and they are far from pleasant.  They are not even pleasing to the 26 people employed because no one wants to be employed in a place that is losing money.  I suggest the Minister has extremely detailed explanations to give.  Above all, he must explain how we are going to sell the grass meal and whether or not the commercial operators, who have only this market available to them, will sell their grass meal against an increase in production in Glenamoy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust it is not out of order for me to compliment Deputy Donegan.  His contribution showed the amount of serious homework he has done.  So did his well thought out criticisms.  I find myself in the situation now that Deputy Donegan has said most of the things I intended to say and I will not take up the time of the House with repetition.  However, I want to endorse the criticisms he made and his detailed analysis of the situation.</P>
      <P>We know the size of the grass meal market here.  We know the rate at which it is growing.  We know that the possibilities of breaking into Britain are not great.  There is something else we know: the techniques for producing feedingstuffs for livestock from grass, without the use of a drying technique, by a squeezing technique or a wafer technique, are in such intensive development all over the world, together with the arrival of new machinery and new methods predicted for the fairly near future, that they could have a quite drastic effect on the profitability of existing plants.  This is a relevant consideration.  We have this extraordinary grass potential, the finest in the northern hemisphere.  On the face of it, therefore, anything that increases our expertise in regard to the processing of grass as a high quality livestock food is a national asset.  Of course, anything which provides work in the part of the country referred to, Glenamoy, is of special value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I have to say in criticism has to be taken against the declaration of the special value firstly of the location and secondly of the sort of work on <Col N="364" /> the utilisation of land.  This whole project has been going on now for 15 years in one form or another, although admittedly not in the present form which we are discussing.  I do not wish at all to damage what exists but what exists, as the Minister and everybody conversant with this situation will know, is a very shaky, ill-founded and precarious undertaking and what I have to say is with the object of an amelioration of that and not of further disimprovement.  The disimprovement is a culmination of a long period of inadequacy and mismanagement but the Minister must know that the quality of the product from Glenamoy is far from being all it might be and far from being all that the trade requires. The Minister must know of this poor reputation at present, a reputation which could be improved.  The loss is of the order of £12 a ton, according to most recent accounts, at a time when commercial undertakings in this and other countries are able to function without loss or any special aid.</P>
    <P>There is a further point which Deputy Donegan did not refer to and which he is certainly aware of.  That is that the going price for grass meal at present is of the order of £29 or £30 a ton but this company have been going around selling their product, which they found hard to shift, at a much lower price, at a price in the order of £21 a ton. This has had a destructive effect on existing commercial undertakings.  It has had the effect of halting commercial growth and diminishing the return of capital of efficient private operations. In Glenamoy there is a very admirable and magnificent enterprise in the peatlands research station of the Agricultural Institute.  It is the sort of enterprise which, if we feel despondent about the possibilities of this area, must cheer any person who goes to look at it. A most magnificent and dedicated staff are doing interesting and valuable work there on peatlands utilisation.  All sorts of products are being investigated and some of them may be commercially much more viable than the particular product in which so much money has already been sunk and into which we are now asked to sink further money. These are people of the greatest possible expertise in the utilisation of peatlands <Col N="365" /> in various ways, but it is striking that their expertise has not been called on in order to make what is at present an inefficient and ill-run organisation into an efficient and vigorous one.</P>
    <P>I think we are permitted to draw a general conclusion which is very much larger than the issue before us, the issue of another £150,000, because the operation of this firm seems to me the perfect embodiment and exemplification of the sort of semi-State enterprise into which Fianna Fáil has put so much of the nation's resources and energies. This is what people are pleased to call nationalisation; this is what nationalisation has got to be judged by at present in Ireland because that is the nationalisation people see.  If this is nationalisation, of course nobody wants it because it is inefficient and it violates the criteria of commercial responsibility and is undemocratic in relation to its employees, in relation to its control and in relation to the choice of people who run it.  It is better to have some employment than none, but it is a poor employer.  It is neither one thing nor the other; it is neither an efficient commercial undertaking nor a proper example of public ownership.  It is a sort of &ldquo;mish-mash&rdquo; that combines both systems and disrupts the functioning of ordinary commercial undertakings.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wishes to put more money into it, then he has certain responsibilities towards the nation.  He has got to see that the best possible technical advice is availed of and draw on the expertise for the utilisation of peatlands which now exists in the country.  He has also to see that the level of management is the best and that the choice of personnel at every level in the firm is dictated by competence and nothing else.  He has to see that good money is not thrown after bad money and that the money requested is not spent on what one might describe as a benefit for the local branch of Taca.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express pleasure that Deputy Colley is Minister for the Gaeltacht as well as for Industry and Commerce because his personal commitment to the well-being of the west is recognised on all sides of the House.  He is saddled with a difficult and unpleasant task in coming here to talk about events since 1959, but in fact the matter goes back further than that.  The utilisation of peatlands is an important national duty.  We have growing expertise in this field and it is very proper to expend money here where there is not a normal commercial return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our party are convinced that for social ends it is absolutely proper and at times obligatory to turn one's back on the rule of the maximum possible return on capital.  I would have no objection to the passing of this extra sum of money, even if it were commercially a totally unsatisfactory operation, provided I were certain that the social ends would be pursued with the maximum possible vigour, provided I were certain, in fact, that the whole operation at Glenamoy producing grass <Col N="367" /> meal was run with efficiency and vigour, provided I were certain that the choice of personnel and the scrutiny of their activities were subject&mdash;and I make this proviso about all the semi-State bodies&mdash;to normal democratic control, provided I were satisfied that the plant was a good employer&mdash;which it is very hard for it to be in circumstances where it is making a consistent loss&mdash;provided I were certain that the highest possible level of scientific and other skills were being utilised in its management.</P>
    <P>Up to now, I think the Minister must admit, all of the provisos I have made are, in fact, valid ones; all the questions I have raised about efficiency, democracy, quality of employment, the use of available scientific knowledge, are all valid and proper questions but, if he can satisfy us that there will be reform and that in the future all of these requirements of a proper semi-State concern will be met, then I can see no objection to the passing of this Bill because my resistance to the expenditure of extra moneys in this particular enterprise arises not from a resistance to working in that area but from the point that is I think validated over and over by consulting the balance sheets and reports that are available that this is, in fact, very inefficiently run, that the employment of various sorts in Glenamoy is nothing like as large or as effective as it could be, that it is obviously necessary in the light of the rather sticky market for grass meal&mdash;predictably sticky, and it is not going to get easier&mdash;to diversify away from that single product and it is obviously necessary to guarantee more than that number of jobs in that particular area.  But, if the Minister, in fact, is able to give satisfactory undertakings on these headings then I can see no objection to the raising of this extra capital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are being asked in this Bill to sanction the expenditure of £150,000 of the taxpayers' money. Before sanctioning such expenditure we should carefully examine what it is to be spent upon to ensure that proper benefits return from this expenditure. I should like to do this <Col N="368" /> examination under two headings.  I should like to take a look at the past performance of Min Fhéir Teoranta and then to look at the future possibilities in the field of dried grass production.</P>
      <P>I must say that for the purpose of looking at the past performance of this company Deputies are not supplied with very adequate information.  When I went to the Library to look up the most recent annual report of Min Fhéir Teoranta I found that the most recent one available was one covering the year ended 31st March, 1967.  When the Minister was bringing in a measure of this importance he should have ensured that a more recent annual report was available to Deputies to enable them to assess the case he was putting forward for this increased expenditure.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce, said on 14th July, 1959, when introducing the Bill which set up Min Fhéir Teoranta&mdash;I quote from column 1165 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>It is expected that the project will operate on an economic basis after an initial development period of five years.</P>
      <P>I submit that Min Fhéir Teoranta has not reached the then Minister's expectations. Deputy Donegan has made this point but it bears repetition: the report of the committee which recommended the setting up of Min Fhéir Teoranta prior to 1959 stated quite clearly that if this body was to produce efficiently it would have to have a production level of at least 2,000 tons per annum or, perhaps, at least 2,500 tons per annum.  I understand also from researches and from conversations that I have had with people in the grass meal industry that this minimum efficient economic level has in the ten years since 1959 come up to about 5,000 tons per annum.  So that, if you want to have an efficient enterprise in the field of grass meal, you must produce a minimum of about 5,000 tons per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear, even taking the figure in the Minister's speech of 1,800 tons per annum, that even after ten years, we have not reached the basic minimum economic scale of production <Col N="369" /> in Min Fhéir Teoranta.  The Minister said that in 1968-69 they were producing 1,800 tons in that year.  I submit that even that 1,800 tons is a freak. I do not believe that in any of the years prior to that the production of Min Fhéir Teoranta rose above 1,300 tons per annum.  It is quite possible that in the year 1969-70, for instance, the production of Min Fhéir Teoranta will fall well below 1,800 tons.  However, I speak subject to correction by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The most recent report available to me, which is for the year ended 31st March, 1967, showed that in that year they had produced only 1,071 tons. This was only one-half of the minimum amount laid down in the report and only one-fifth of the 5,000 tons which I believe to be the realistic minimum at the present time.</P>
    <P>This report also gave some other very significant figures.  Deputy Donegan may have mentioned these figures &mdash;I was not here for the early part of his speech and I hope the House will forgive me if I repeat something which he said.  The report shows that the cost of production per ton of grass meal by Min Fhéir Teoranta was £36 19s.  It shows also that in that year, that is, the year ended 31st March 1967, the selling price ranged between £27 17s 8d per ton down to as low as £21 1s 2d per ton.  The report also shows that the average loss per ton on the grass meal produced in the Glenamoy project was £12 0s 1d.  In other words, Min Fhéir Teoranta in 1967&mdash; and I think it is continuing to do so&mdash; was losing money hand over fist.</P>
    <P>These figures are interesting in another regard.  They indicate that the cost of production per ton of grass meal in that year was £36 19s.  I believe that commercial enterprises are quite capable of producing it at considerably less than this.  This would indicate that Min Fhéir Teoranta are a singularly inefficient concern when they cannot produce grass meal at comparable cost to that of private enterprises&mdash; enterprises very often with considerably less resources than Min Fhéir have at their disposal. It is important also to recollect the minimum selling figure of grass meal <Col N="370" /> at that time.  Min Fhéir were selling grass meal for as low as £21 1s 2d per ton.  This would suggest to me, as Deputy Keating pointed out, that Min Fhéir were dumping grass meal on the market, with considerable adverse effect on private producers, and this was a singularly destructive exercise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating also called into question, and very rightly so, the quality of the grass meal being produced by Min Fhéir Teoranta.  I understand that some of the commercial producers of grass meal&mdash;I think in 1967&mdash;arranged to approach Min Fhéir Teoranta for some of Min Fhéir's surplus grass meal in order to meet their orders. They found that the type of grass meal Min Fhéir were producing was of such a low quality that it would not satisfy the standards of the customers of the commercial enterprises.  We need considerably more information than the Minister has given us on the quality of the grass meal being produced by Min Fhéir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>In order to clear up these doubts about the quality of this grass meal, I should like the Minister to answer, at his convenience and certainly before this Bill is passed by this House, the following questions.  What is the percentage of protein in the grass meal produced by Min Fhéir Teoranta?  If it is less than 16 per cent protein then I submit its grass meal is of little value and does not come up to the standards of quality required by most consumers at the present time.  How often in the year is the grass harvested at Glenamoy? Is it harvested once, twice, three times or four times a year?  I submit to the Minister that the only type of grass which can be used on the type of land which is available&mdash;blanket bog &mdash;is particularly prone to growing stalky and that this stalkiness can very considerably reduce the quality of the grass meal.  If we are to avoid this grass becoming stalky and the resultant deterioration in the quality of the grass meal produced, then the grass must be cut at least four times a year.  How often do Min Fhéir Teoranta harvest the grass at Glenamoy?</P>
    <P>I suggest to the House that there are other grounds for doubt about the efficiency of Min Fhéir Teoranta.  It was <Col N="371" /> envisaged by the Minister in 1959 that there should be close co-operation between Min Fhéir Teoranta and the private producers of grass meal.  I understand, however, that no such co-operation did in fact take place until as recently as two years ago.  I also understand, as I pointed out earlier, that there is considerable dissatisfaction in the private sector about Min Fhéir Teoranta using their considerable financial resources to dump grass meal on the market to the detriment of private producers.  To come back to what I was saying earlier, I also understand that even if Min Fhéir Teoranta have formally been co-operating for the past two years with private producers they have been very much a sleeping partner in this respect and have not been making a very useful contribution.</P>
    <P>I understand that Min Fhéir Teoranta have been very deficient in the field of marketing their produce, that they have been making no great effort to sell their grass meal and have been leaving it very much to the private sector.  I would ask the Minister to go in great detail into the activities of Min Fhéir Teoranta in the field of marketing over the past five years. This money which is being sought today should not be sanctioned until we get a very clear assurance from the Minister that Min Fhéir Teoranta will make considerable efforts to improve their performance in the field of marketing.  If Min Fhéir Teoranta do not make greater efforts, I feel this House would be putting further money down the drain.</P>
    <P>I understand also that the employment given by Min Fhéir Teoranta is well below the 1959 expectations of Deputies and of the Minister.  At present, they are employing only 26 people.  This, in fact, is less than the similar project was employing in 1955 when it was closed down by the inter-Party Government.  At that time, the grass meal project in Glenamoy was employing 31 people.  Min Fhéir Teoranta appear to be in a worse position now as regards employment than existed in 1955 when the then project was closed down by the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="372" /> I should like also to ask the Minister the qualifications and experience of the members of the board of Min Fhéir Teoranta in the field of grass drying.  Does the board contain people who could be said to represent other firms in grass meal production in Ireland?  Have any of the members of the board in the past been members of a political party&mdash;if so, what party and are they still members?  It was also envisaged in the 1959 debate by the Minister that this project would mean that Min Fhéir Teoranta would use their operations to do drainage and other preparatory work and then hand the improved land over to local farmers for the production of sheep and other purposes.  How much land has been so handed over by Min Fhéir Teoranta to local farmers in the past ten years?</P>
    <P>So far, I have dealt with the record of Min Fhéir Teoranta over the past ten years.  There is a great deal of evidence from what I have said that Min Fhéir Teoranta are doubtful as a fit subject for the investment of £150,000 of taxpayers' money.  I should like the Minister&mdash;I think Deputy Donegan may have asked him this before&mdash;to make a very clear statement as to what he intends to do with this £150,000 which he is asking the House to vote.  What do Min Fhéir Teoranta intend to do with it?  Do they intend to use it to dump further inferior quality grass meal on the market to the detriment of private producers? Do they intend to continue producing grass meal on the present uneconomic lines?  I should also like to endorse Deputy Donegan's statement about the factory in Northern Ireland. This is something which should give the Minister very considerable concern. Has he considered that, if this factory in Limavady goes through, our export market to Northern Ireland&mdash; 5,000 to 6,000 tons per annum&mdash;will be completely removed?  In the light of this reduction in the market, does he consider further expansion in the field of grass meal production to be wise?</P>
    <P>Has the Minister seen any research results on alternative methods of using the Glenamoy bog and preserving existing employment at less cost to the taxpayer?  I may be wrong, but I <Col N="373" /> understand that there are considerable prospects in the field of forestry in this area.  Would the Minister consider setting aside some of this money for research to see if we could, perhaps, spend this money more effectively in other fields of production than putting it into Min Fhéir Teoranta?  I certainly think we could save a lot if we carried out effective research.</P>
    <P>I should like also very tentatively to suggest, from my very small knowledge of the production of this product, a possible change in production methods which might be made to make Min Fhéir a sounder economic and social proposition than it is at present.  This, I would emphasise, is very tentative because I have not got a very great knowledge in this field but I understand that there could be a useful change made in the production of Min Fhéir Teoranta.  I understand that there is a considerable market in this country for protein additives for the feeding of ruminants, in other words for the feeding of cattle.  I understand that if the grass in Glenamoy were used to produce dried grass pellets of a high quality they would serve this need very admirably and there would be a considerable market for them.  I have seen figures which would indicate that these grass meal pellets could be produced at a maximum cost of £20 a ton if the plant were fully and properly utilised which I do not think it is at the moment.  All Min Fhéir would need to do would be to instal a cubing plant.  I would commend the suggestion to the Minister that they should consider going into the field of dried grass pellets for sale as protein additives.</P>
    <P>I would also refer the Minister to <i>The Farmer and Stockbreeder</i> magazine for 28th January, 1969, which outlines a new cheap method of harvesting dried grass at a total cost of £10 16s a ton.  He might find the information in this magazine of that date of some use to him in streamlining the production methods of Min Fhéir Teoranta. I believe that the field of dried grass cubes would provide a long-term growth potential and I would urge the Minister to consider it as a possible substitute for the production of grass <Col N="374" /> meal which is so patently not providing this sort of long-term growth potential.</P>
    <P>There is an additional advantage to going into dried grass cubes in that this product could be sold to local farmers who might have considerable need for the grass meal cubes thus removing a considerable amount of the transport costs which at present have to be met by Min Fhéir because its present product has to be transported considerable distances to its market.</P>
    <P>However, I should like to emphasise very strongly that it is of vital importance that a high quality be maintained. If even a small batch of these cubes or of grass meal is seen to be of a low quality this will destroy consumer confidence and I would ask the Minister to take much more stringent steps than he has taken to date to ensure that products coming from Min Fhéir Teoranta are of the highest possible quality.  I would want him to make sure that it is at least 16 per cent protein as I said before.</P>
    <P>I have asked a number of questions in the course of my speech.  I believe that these questions should be fully and frankly answered before a final decision is taken to spend £150,000 more of the taxpayers' money, otherwise we are running the risk of wasting this money on yet another green elephant.</P>
    <P>I notice that section 2 of the Bill says:</P>
    <P>Min Fhéir (1959) Teoranta may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, given after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, borrow temporarily by arrangement with bankers such sums as it may require for the purpose of providing for current expenditure.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister tell me whether Min Fhéir Teoranta have been borrowing any money in this manner previously or how it has secured its revenue?</P>
    <P>May I also draw attention to the fact that the Minister in his speech refers to the assertion that 2,500 is a realistic basic minimum economic level of production of tons of grass meal per annum.  Would he consider that, perhaps, <Col N="375" /> 5,000 tons would be a more realistic minimum in the light of the changing circumstances since this report was brought out?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I should like to get out of the way before I deal in more detail with the points raised in the debate.  Firstly, in regard to the point raised by Deputy Donegan, the sum of £350,000 does not include the original £100,000 to which he referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>£450,000 is the total expenditure on grass meal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, in regard to the point raised by Deputy Bruton the company has borrowed from the bank heretofore but it did not have authority to do so.  I presume the bank was taking a chance because it could not legally enforce it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton also asked a number of technical questions to which I have not got the answers with regard to the protein content of grass meal produced by Min Fhéir and other questions of that nature.  He also asked about the political affiliations of the members of the board.  I have no knowledge whatever of their political affiliations, if any. Perhaps, the Deputy knows more than I do but I am not aware of political affiliations.  He did make a suggestion which rather surprised me, at least it was implied in something he said: that representatives of rival firms should be on the board of Min Fhéir Teoranta. This is what I understood him to suggest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If he did suggest that it seems to me to be a suggestion which would need to be viewed with a very great deal of caution before being implemented, for obvious reasons.  It is true that in certain respects the reputation of this company may not be the best but, though I do not profess to know the ins and outs of the situation in regard to Min Fhéir Teoranta and <Col N="376" /> the grass meal market, I get the impression somehow that there are some people who have an interest in rival firms and have things to say about Min Fhéir Teoranta that may be somewhat coloured by the fact that they are in business and competing with them. This is not to say that Min Fhéir Teoranta are not open to criticism on certain grounds but we ought to view some of the criticisms that are made in the light of the source of those criticisms.</P>
      <P>Another point I wanted to dispose of was made I think by Deputy Donegan who referred to the fact that this Bill had been circulated shortly before the last Dáil was dissolved.  He seemed to think that this was for election purposes. May I suggest that the fact that the Bill is at present before the House and is being treated as a matter of urgency is sufficient evidence that it simply had to be brought in and I wanted it brought in as soon as possible because of the very difficult financial situation of the company? In fact, the situation of the company is that unless the Bill is passed very soon the company will have to go into liquidation.  It is as simple as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but the fact that the Minister circulated the Bill just before the 18th Dáil was dissolved did reassure certain people in that constituency.  That is the point I was making and which I think the Minister has not refuted with any great effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel it may have reassured the bank manager more than anyone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the accounts of the company have not been available up to a recent date.  It was Deputy Bruton, I think, who made that legitimate criticism.  We have been endeavouring to get the company to bring their accounts forward more promptly and this effort will be stepped up in future.  I can tell the House from information available to me that for the year ended 31st March, 1968, production <Col N="377" /> was 1,500 tons and the trading result was a small profit for the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was giving the figures as they have been given in previous accounts so that they could be compared. Total trading loss to the 31st March, 1968, since the company started, was £25,276.  There have been&mdash;and some Deputy referred to this&mdash;efforts to rationalise between the various firms in the industry and so far these efforts <Col N="378" /> have operated to the benefit of Min Fhéir Teoranta and are likely to operate to greater benefit to the company in the future.  However, it seems that some of the criticisms expressed in the debate are quite justified.  Some Deputies seemed to find themselves in something of a dilemma, the same dilemma as that in which I found myself when facing this problem.  It seems clear on the basis of the record of the company that one should examine very carefully any proposal to put further money into it.  On the other hand, any decision not to do so with the consequent, almost immediate closing-down of the company would also be a very serious matter.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Keating was right to stress two aspects of the operations of this company, the employment aspect in an area in which employment is very difficult to provide and the advantage in the accumulation of expertise in this field, an advantage not merely in the Glenamoy area but in the whole economy. These are, therefore, two important factors to be considered in any decision about the investment of further money in this company.</P>
      <P>I endeavoured to outline to the House the fact that for unforeseen reasons the working capital available to the company was considerably less than was originally envisaged.  I think this has considerably cramped the company's operations in the past few years. Criticism was made of its marketing organisation or lack of it.  From the knowledge available to me I think the criticism has some basis of justification. I intend to meet the board of Min Fhéir Teoranta very shortly and to discuss with them future operations of the company and this is one of the matters to which I shall pay particular attention.  I should again stress that, for the reasons I outlined earlier, I believe the board and employees of the company have not found it easy to operate the company as they would like to have done because of lack of working capital.  The future programme, of course, includes examination of the advisability of going into different production lines, as I indicated earlier, including production of grass cubes or grass biscuits suitable for inclusion in coarse dairy rations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="379" /> It is reasonable to suggest that any expertise available in the utilisation of this kind of bogland should be utilised and I intend to ensure that arrangements are made to make such expertise as we have in this field available to the company.  The question of the proposed new plant in the north is, of course, one that gives me concern. Nevertheless, we should ask ourselves why is this being erected.  Does it not indicate that those people at least have some confidence in the future prospects for the grass meal market?</P>

      <P>The difficulties which have arisen are not due, to any great extent at any rate, to the fact that the company has been operating in bog land.  There have been other difficulties that have contributed a great deal more. However, as I say, we have got to face this dilemma of what should be done with this company in present circumstances. I cannot guarantee to the House that the further investment envisaged here will ensure with absolute certainty the viability of this company in the future with the production of grass meal at a reasonable profit.  The indications available to me are that it will enable the company to do that. It may be that the overall operations of the company will be profitable because of some diversification into which it might go, but I cannot give the House an absolute guarantee that this is so. However, I can say that the information available to me suggests that the making available of this capital to the company, together with the examination of the future lines of operation and production of the company, with the expertise which will, I hope, be made available to us, should give us a reasonable prospect that this investment will have been worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the investment that has taken place to date, I think it would be a mistake to regard this as a complete write-off.  The information which <Col N="380" /> has been accumulated has not gone to waste and can be utilised in the future. Also, in regard to the actual money spent, a great deal of it&mdash;up to £100,000 of it, I think&mdash;has been spent on labour in the locality; and in this area of the country this is a very important factor and one which is not to be lightly dismissed.  It seems to me that our problem in regard to that kind of area in the west is largely a holding operation to enable people to live there until we can provide them with a better and more secure way of life. If the money we have expended so far had achieved only that, it would have been worthwhile.  I think it has achieved more than that.  The prospects for the future are considerably better but I accept what has been suggested here in the House.  There can be improvements and considerable improvements in the performance of this company. I would hope, at my meeting with the board shortly, to take steps to ensure that that kind of improvement will take place.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in and impressed by the contribution of Deputy Keating who knows a good deal about this matter&mdash;more than I do.  I am sorry he allowed himself to veer off the very sensible and intelligent line he was following.  I hope that when he is a little longer here he will realise that really there is not any dividend in that kind of thing.  There was much more dividend in 95 per cent of Deputy Keating's speech than there was in that little five per cent of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait until Min Fhéir Teoranta are able to produce a dividend and you will be doing well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>They will do that too. Again.  I want to stress that this is not merely an operation which can be judged solely by ordinary commercial tests, or on the balance sheet which Deputy Donegan would like to see. This is important and very important I agree, but it is not the sole criterion in relation to Min Fhéir Teoranta. There are the other two very important aspects mentioned by Deputy Keating: the expertise which can be accumulated in this very important field&mdash;very important to us in this <Col N="381" /> country&mdash;and the employment afforded in an area like that in the west.</P>
      <P>In the light of these considerations it seemed to me, when I was considering this and was faced with the dilemma with which speakers on this Bill have been faced, that the right conclusion to come to was to make a further investment in the company and try to ensure as far as one could that this investment is spent as effectively and as intelligently as possible, and that it was not the right decision to decide to wind up the company and throw away what has been achieved so far, and throw the people concerned out of work.  I am confident that the House will agree that that decision to which I came and which, therefore, led me to introduce this Bill was the right decision.</P>

I should like to ask the Minister also would he consider the possibility of, instead of giving a lump sum of £150,000, giving sums on a yearly basis, smaller amounts on a yearly basis for the next few years, pending the discovery of a genuinely effective long-term method of production in which it would be sensible to invest so big a sum as £150,000.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purposes of this Bill are:-</P>
      <P>(i)  to empower the Minister for Finance to take up additional shares in Aerlínte Éireann Teoranta to the amount of £10 million;</P>
      <P>(ii)  to empower the Minister for Finance to make further payments for capital purposes to Aerlínte, not exceeding £5 million; and</P>
      <P>(iii)  to increase to a total of £50 million the limit of money which Aerlínte and Aer Lingus, between them, may borrow under the guarantee of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Since the enactment of the Air Companies Act of 1966 there has been no statutory provision for further investment in the airlines by the State.  That statutory provision was repealed by the 1966 Act in the light of a decision reached some years earlier that, at that time the companies could be regarded as having reached a stage where they should be able to finance further normal growth from revenue and commercial borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This view has had to be modified in the light of a number of new factors. There has been sharp growth in the transatlantic traffic.  The pace of technological change leading to the introduction of faster and larger aircraft and intensified international competition have brought about the need for further substantial capital investment in new aircraft and equipment.  The air companies in common with other carriers on their routes have to face <Col N="386" /> the effects of the rapid pace of technological change and intensified competition. Once newer and more profitable aircraft types are introduced on a particular route by one airline its competitors have no option but to re-equip themselves in like manner unless they are prepared to accept a declining share of the traffic, reduced profitability and, ultimately, a cut-back in the employment of staff.</P>
    <P>The growth in air traffic is expected to continue and the air companies have made forecasts of the traffic they expect to cater for over the next five years.  These forecasts show an increase in passenger numbers from 1,372,000 in 1967-68 to 2,163,000 in 1972-73.  Over the same period revenue is estimated to increase from £24 million to £46 million.  This period will also see the introduction on the Atlantic of the Boeing 747 jets.  To maintain this momentum and to secure the forecasted increase in traffic and revenue in this dynamic industry the air companies must acquire the necessary new aircraft and ancillary equipment.</P>
    <P>The five year programme for capital re-equipment by Aer Lingus and Aerlínte up to 1973 includes the acquisition of eight Boeing 737 jets for Aer Lingus, one Boeing 320 jet and two Boeing 747, Jumbo, jets for Aerlínte.  The originally estimated cost of these aircraft has escalated and has also been affected by the sterling devaluation of November, 1967.  The companies' total capital outlay for the five year period is estimated at £71.5 million.  The companies are satisfied that this heavy investment would yield a satisfactory commercial return but the sheer amount involved created serious difficulties for them.  They undertook a close study of the financial aspects of the proposals in consultation with three leading international bankers.  They were advised that to service commercial loan capital on this scale would, because of the burden of interest and capital repayments, be beyond the capacity of an airline of their size. Furthermore, if the companies were to rely solely on borrowing and on their own resources, the high proportion of their capital which would then be in the form of loan capital, would tend to worsen future prospects of borrowing. <Col N="387" /> It was considered that the only satisfactory solution was to reshape the capital structures of the companies so as to increase the proportion of equity to loan capital.</P>
    <P>This conclusion was reached independently by the companies and by their consultant bankers.  The air companies were satisfied that of the total of £71.5 million required, they could, over the five years, find £28.8 million from their own resources, namely depreciation reserves and accumulated profits.  They also considered, with the concurrence of their advisers, that they could prudently borrow a further £28 million.  This left the balance of £15 million which the companies proposed should be provided in the form of equity by the State.  Following detailed joint study by the companies and by the Departments of Finance and Transport and Power, the Government decided that the Minister for Finance should provide to the companies a further £10 million share capital and a further £5 million in the form of non-repayable interest bearing advances.</P>
    <P>The companies have advised me that they are confident that they can borrow the full amount of moneys required and they have undertaken to do so initially but for the reasons I have already mentioned, namely, the imbalance which such borrowing would introduce in the proportion of equity to loan capital, the Government have indicated to the companies that they will be prepared to take over an amount not exceeding £15 million of this borrowing and will make available in its stead £10 million share capital and £5 million non-repayable advances.  This will remove the distortion of the companies' capital structure and will facilitate the companies in continuing their successful growth especially on the transatlantic service.  The proposed further State investment in the equity of the companies will not be provided as subsidy or grant.  It is an investment in an outstanding growth industry. While there has as yet been no direct return by way of cash dividend on the States investment in the companies, the companies' record of achievement gives us reasonable grounds to expect such return at a <Col N="388" /> future date.  We must, however, take into account the very substantial indirect return from our investment in the companies which play a key role in the development of tourism, in the provision of highly skilled employment and in the development of technological and management skills.  The air companies are one of our major growth business whose continued welfare remains a major concern of the Government.</P>
    <P>Over the past ten years the joint revenue of the air companies has increased from £4.8 million to £24 million, an increase of 400 per cent.  Passenger traffic in the same period has increased from 515,000 to 1,372,000 an increase of 166 per cent and employment has increased from 2,000 to 5,000 approximately.  The companies have been operating profitably for many years but their profits have been re-invested in growth rather than distributed as cash dividends and the State's investment of £13.6 million shows a growth of £4 million as at 31st March, 1968.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the profits made by the companies have derived from the transatlantic operations of Aerlínte. Short haul operations of the type carried on by Aer Lingus are everywhere marginally profitable but the Aer Lingus network plays an essential role in our national economy by virtue of its services to tourism, to business and as a feeder to Aerlínte's profitable transatlantic routes.</P>
    <P>The value of the airlines to the national economy was recently the subject of a study commissioned by them from distinguished consultants.  The study shows that the total return to the community after the most realistic possible estimation of the indirect and social benefits accruing from the activities of the airlines, but not susceptible of precise measurement in money terms, is certainly not less than 11 per cent and possibly as much as 26 per cent on the total capital investment. Some interesting points which emerge from the study were that the airlines earned 70 per cent of their revenue from outside of Ireland while only 45 per cent of their expenditure was incurred outside the country leaving <Col N="389" /> a substantial favourable balance.  It was also reckoned that in the absence of our own national airlines up to £1.6 million annually would have left the country by way of fares to foreign carriers.  The net contribution of the airlines to our foreign earning was in the order of £6.4 million per annum.</P>
    <P>The five year programme, the financing of which this Bill deals with, will see the companies expand into a new and greatly increased level of activities. They will, by Irish standards, be very big business indeed.  It would be unwise, however, to believe that either the aviation industry generally or our own airlines will be able to relax after 1973.  The pace of technological progress continues to increase.  There are prospects of even larger jets than the Boeing 747 and supersonic jets are just around the corner.  Because of the magnitude of the capital outlay which the expansion of the air companies is likely to involve in future years the Government have, therefore, decided to carry out a thorough review of the position before the end of the present programme.  The companies are planning to undertake in 1970/71 a review in depth of their capital programmes and commercial prospects and will engage specialised consultants, as necessary, to assist them in doing so.</P>
    <P>I should avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate the boards and staffs of the air companies on the success the companies have achieved to date.  I have every confidence that this success will be maintained and that the companies will reach and surpass the difficult commercial targets which they have set themselves.  I consider that the investments we are now making will be put to good use and that they will yield returns both direct and indirect which will be of crucial benefit to our economy.  I have, therefore, no hesitation in recommending this Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In many ways we are being asked to accept this Bill as a sort of &ldquo;pig in a poke&rdquo;.  The Minister in the last paragraph of his speech said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the magnitude of the capital outlay which the expansion <Col N="390" /> of the air companies is likely to involve in future years the Government have, therefore, decided to carry out a thorough review of the position before the end of the present programme.</P>
    <P>I take it some review must have been carried out in recent years because, otherwise, we would not be asked to continue practically annually the giving of large sums to our air lines and the Minister might have told us what the result of that review was.</P>
    <P>At the outset, I should like to pay tribute to the board and personnel of our air lines.  I have had the privilege of travelling by our air lines to many countries and I know the efficiency with which they deal with both passengers and cargo.  I know the unfailing courtesy shown to users of their craft.  Sufficient tribute could not be paid to the former general manager and managing director, Mr. Dempsey, for the magnificent work he did right from the very foundation of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I query whether we are entitled to give Aer Rianta and its subsidiaries a blank cheque, so to speak.  Aer Lingus now operates throughout practically all Europe. Apparently the profit it makes is merely marginal.  I understand that a considerable proportion of Aer Lingus shares are held by BEA, a rival company on European short haul routes. Is this marginal profit due to the fact that a considerable proportion of the shares are held by a rival company? We are further informed that the bulk of the profits are derived from the small transatlantic operations of Aerlínte.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the huge sums not only being spent but actually available to rival companies on the transatlantic haul and we should, I think, consider carefully whether or not we should advance these moneys and permit this borrowing before this thorough review of the position is carried out.  We are now permitting the company to borrow a sum of £10 million and we are giving the company a non-repayable advance of £5 million.  Will we receive any return for that money?  The Minister has given us very good reasons why we should continue these operations.  He <Col N="391" /> has pointed out the considerable amount of prestige and finance to the country by way of tourism, but it is rather significant that the estimation varies between not less than 11 per cent and possibly as much as 26 per cent.  Surely there should be some method of estimating a more approximate and accurate figure of the profit likely to accrue as a result of the investment of these large sums.</P>
    <P>I wonder are we just carrying on in a very haphazard manner when the Minister points out that other companies throughout the world are experimenting with supersonic jets and admits that supersonic jets are just around the corner.  Have we any estimate of what the costings of our investment in supersonic jets is going to be and what would be the profits derived from them?  Will they be in the neighbourhood of 11 per cent to 26 per cent? These are matters which deserve consideration, matter about which we know very little.  They are matters about which the Minister could give us much more information than he has.  He tells us about the increase in passenger traffic.  We are aware of that, but will we reach the stage in the very near future when our planes will be outmoded and out-of-date, just as our railways were in the past?  Are we up-to-date and are we receiving from all levels involved the information to which we are entitled? These are matters which require detailed explanation from the Minister, which he has not given us and which we find difficulty in obtaining from our own researchers.  However, we cannot oppose this Bill in so far as it merely provides for further additional share capital to be taken up by the Minister in these airlines.  For that reason we do not oppose it.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy O'Donnell I certainly am not going to oppose this Bill.  Apart from anything else the amount of money involved, £15 million, although it would have been looked on as an extraordinary sum 50 years ago, is now small beer compared with what we will see next Tuesday when we discuss the Finance <Col N="392" /> Bill.  I have not forgotten the kind of debate that took place here when Mr. McGilligan brought in the original Electricity Supply Board Bill, when the sum involved was £5 million.  Any criticism I may have to make will not be on the basis of the amount of money involved.</P>
      <P>I might compliment the Minister, or whoever wrote his brief, because certainly it is put together nicely.  It has a number of intriguing words here and there.  In the first page, for instance, there is a reference to &ldquo;reduced profitability.&rdquo; All the time air companies have been talking about operating profit and some people talk about operating surplus.  I must admit that the expression &ldquo;operating profit&rdquo; is a contradiction in terms, but that perhaps is being precious about the matter.  There is no doubt about what reduced profitability means; it means there was profitability at some stage but I do not think that it is reasonable to suggest that we have been able to make money in that sense out of the operations of our air companies.  I am not to be taken as being in any way critical of the technical or indeed of the financial operations of the companies, but the figure which comes before us, of over £70 millions, is indeed a very large figure.</P>
      <P>There is again a reference, appropriately enough, to this &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo; industry; it certainly is not a static industry by any manner of means in any sense of the term, financially or otherwise. On the whole, we get from the Minister a very comprehensive survey of what is required and showing that the purchase of a number of aircraft will cost £71½ millions.  There was a time when every bench in this House would be full at the mention of a sum of £71½ millions, but times have changed and the value of money has changed.  I agree with the statement that &ldquo;it was considered that the only satisfactory solution was to reshape the capital structures of the companies.&rdquo; That is a reasonable decision.  The Minister proposes to take up £10 million of new share capital and to advance £5 million of interest-bearing capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not said but it is quite true that up to the present no return whatever <Col N="393" /> has been obtained from the companies. I am speaking financially, about the balance sheet and the profit and loss account.  In that financial sense there has been no return, but that does not mean that the companies are not effective; the contrary is the case.  There is a sort of insinuation in the approach made to the problem.  The Minister said: &ldquo;The proposed further state investment in the equity of the companies will not be provided as subsidy or grant.&rdquo;  It would have been just as well if that particular sentence had been left out.  There is no difference between putting £10 millions capital into the company and giving it a grant. There is no effective difference.</P>
    <P>In recent times I have found, as Deputy O'Donnell has found, that this company has been exceptionally effective in its operations in every sense, from the point of view of time keeping, giving satisfaction to passengers and so on.  I do not leave the country very often but when I do I travel by Aer Lingus and I find the services extremely satisfactory.  The Minister also stated that: &ldquo;The companies have been operating profitably for many years&rdquo;.  This is not really so.  I am using the word &ldquo;profit&rdquo; in its true sense.  Again, I am not criticising the company for this. The truth is that very few air companies all over the world operate profitably.  Most of them are subsidised in one way or another.  We have a slightly more difficult problem here than a large country like the United States or even Britain has because we have to buy our planes from abroad and that means a certain load on the rest of the economy.  The suggestion that there should be a further investigation by the Government is a desirable one and I am glad the new Minister intends doing this.  Let me say in relation to the kind of general Government economy that we have been operating in recent years that these are moderate enough figures.  I am not to be taken as criticising them unduly but it is only in that sense that they are moderate enough figures. The Minister may take it that I agree with the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill.  It gives me great pleasure always to speak on Bills to do <Col N="394" /> with the air companies, as I have had occasion to do in the other House, because of my own personal connection with Aer Lingus and Aerlínte over a period of 12 years, where, indeed, I spent the formative years of my adult life.  I should like to say to the House that from my experience of the company at that time, although one would have no difficulty in making criticisms because all of us, no matter what organisations we are in, can see what is wrong and suggest how it could be put right&mdash;there are many criticisms one could make&mdash;I know that by the standards of international airlines, Aer Lingus was, and to my knowledge from the studies I have made of it since then, still is, one of the most efficient airlines in the world.</P>
      <P>I can recall that towards the end of my period in Aer Lingus the Air Express Bureau in Brussels, which is run by the European airlines as a joint service to them, developed a method of comparison of efficiency which took account of the different elements which go to make up the economy of an airline, a method of measuring efficiency which took account of the fact that different companies had different planes operating over different stage lengths, with different degrees of seasonality. They were able to take out these separate factors, leaving behind the true residue, the element of efficiency, and compare the efficiency taking due account of these factors which tend to make companies incomparable with each other.  It is my recollection that from that study at that time Aer Lingus emerged as the most efficient of the European airlines, efficient in the use of its resources, in securing the highest return on the investment, securing high load factors on all its routes and, on the whole, I think it has preserved that since then&mdash;although I have a criticism to make later on about Aer Lingus itself, as distinct from Aerlínte, in its load factors in the last couple of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say a few words first about Aerlínte.  The progress of this company has been nothing short of phenomenal.  I do not think that it is sufficiently realised in this country the rapidity of its progress, how this compares with other trans-Atlantic airlines and what a significant <Col N="395" /> share of the trans-Atlantic market this company has.  I looked at the figures quite recently and although my recollection is a little uncertain I think I am right in saying that it is the fifth or sixth largest European airline operating across the Atlantic&mdash;this is in terms of traffic carried.  We are a small country.  There are many more countries in Europe bigger than us operating planes across the Atlantic.  We have outstripped many larger countries and our airline is carrying a share of the traffic which is far beyond that which might reasonably be considered appropriate to a country of our size. This has been achieved in a short space of time.  It is less than 12 years since Aerlínte started operating.  The House will recall the history of the company, although it is often presented differently on different sides of the House.  Speaking as one who saw it from neither side of the House but from inside the company, I should like to say a couple of words about this which are relevant to the Bill before the House today.</P>
    <P>When the company was first proposed in 1946-47 it was proposed at a time when the volume of air traffic across the Atlantic was not such that an Irish airline could do anything other than incur very heavy loss.  I was, though young at the time, the official responsible for estimating the amount of traffic and contributing to the estimation of the size of the loss.  It was my estimate, and I think this was borne out by the subsequent figures of the traffic across the Atlantic, that it would have carried in its first year 8,500 passengers and the loss would have been, I think, about £1 million and a loss of a million of 1947 pounds is an awful lot more than £1 million today&mdash;twice as much in fact.</P>
    <P>In current money terms the loss would have been of the order of several million pounds a year, diminishing slowly but continuing as a very substantial loss for six, seven, eight or nine years.  I think, and I thought at the time as a member of the staff of the company, that the decision to terminate the service then was wise.  I know it is arguable and I do not want to enter any controversy about it because I <Col N="396" /> know that the other side of the House felt disappointment that the project they had launched was cancelled by the inter-Party Government and I do not want to be dogmatic about it.  I would only say that there was a very strong case for cancelling it and I think that if, in fact, it had gone ahead, the Irish people over that period of the late forties and early fifties would not have accepted the scale of subsidy that would have been required to keep it going through the lean years until the traffic reached the point at which Aerlínte could operate successfully.  I think, moreover, that the decision taken at that time to purchase a fleet of five Constellation aircraft, which was three more than were needed for the Atlantic service and to impose on Aerlínte the burden of operating these aircraft on short haul services for which they were completely uneconomic, which would have added to the subsidy burden of Aer Lingus a very substantial sum also&mdash;I think about £300,000 a year extra cost to Aer Lingus for carrying the same number of passengers in less economic aircraft&mdash;would have done such damage to Aer Lingus and its reputation that it would have suffered.  I know that this is arguable.  I know that the other side of the House have a case for saying the service should not have been cancelled.</P>
    <P>I should like, however, to put to the House at this point, as somebody who saw it from the inside, that there was a very strong case for the decision taken and I think that if the project had been continued it is not at all impossible that one or other Government would at some point in that period have felt obliged to cancel the service and it would then have been extremely difficult to start it up again.  As it was, the service was cancelled and profit was made out of the sale of the aircraft and it was possible then to choose the right moment to re-launch the service and that moment was chosen by the present Government who came back to office in 1957.  There had been attempts in 1954 and 1955 to restart it but the time was not propitious.  It was not possible to do so although Mr. Lemass was anxious to do so.  They chose a good moment, when the volume of traffic across the Atlantic had reached the <Col N="397" /> point at which very quickly Aerlínte would be able to become a profitable company and where the development losses would be on a scale small enough to be tolerable without provoking an outcry from the people who would be unhappy about a continued large subsidy over a period of years.</P>
    <P>So, Aerlínte was re-launched at this point.  Within a very short period it became profitable and the traffic developed as forecast in the first three years&mdash;I had something to do with the forecasting myself.  It developed after that time more rapidly than, certainly, I would have foreseen if I had remained in the company and was making the forecast and has since then continued to develop at an astonishing rate throughout almost the whole period of its life after the first couple of years of development&mdash;a very short period, indeed, of development and development losses, which compares very favourably with other new trans-Atlantic airlines starting up in the fifties and early sixties.  After that short period, it started earning and has since then earned on its capital annually something between ten and 15 per cent return on the capital invested.</P>
    <P>I would like to take issue here with Deputy Professor O'Donovan on this point.  It is, of course, true that this company and Aerlínte have never paid dividends but this is not to my mind the crucial issue.  The question of dividends in a sense obscures the true issue.  The true issue is: what does the company earn on its capital and what return is it securing on its turnover every year?  By that criterion Aerlínte &mdash;and here I have to distinguish it clearly from Aer Lingus&mdash;has been a profitable company almost since its inception and has earned a return on capital which any private commercial enterprise would consider to be reasonably satisfactory&mdash;ten or 15 per cent on a capital which itself has been selfexpanding because since the initiation of the company the Government have not provided additional capital to Aerlínte although they gave some extra capital to Aer Lingus in that period &mdash;and this company, starting off with £7 million capital, has built up, out of its profits and its appreciation funds, assets so that they now are several <Col N="398" /> times as great as at the beginning and has done this out of the accumulated profits.</P>
    <P>I think, perhaps, this was tactically unwise.  I think, because people do not understand the concept of ploughing back profits and not paying dividends and using the money in this way, that it might have been better if the company had, in fact, from the beginning behaved as a private enterprise firm would have done: paid out dividends to its shareholders, the Government, and the Government would then have handed these dividends back to it as extra capital for its expansion.  I think it has been foolish of the company to finance the whole of its extremely rapid expansion&mdash;far more rapid expansion than almost any industry that we are used to within this country&mdash;I think it was foolish of it, perhaps, to attempt to finance the whole of its expansion out of its own resources at the expense of paying a dividend.</P>
    <P>What would have happened with an ordinary private company is that it would, in fact, have paid dividends and from time to time would have gone to its shareholders with rights issues, would have secured from its shareholders additional sums of capital because they would have been so pleased with the return they had been receiving in dividends.  If that course had been followed the company would today be in exactly the same position, with the same planes, making the same amount of money, and people would believe of it that it was a profitable concern but, because the other course was adopted, of paying no dividends and ploughing all the profits back, there is a continued belief&mdash;reflected, I think, in what Deputy O'Donovan said&mdash;that the company is in some way not profitable.</P>
    <P>As I said, I distinguish here between Aer Lingus and Aerlínte because in the case of Aer Lingus the company has not earned profits.  It has had some losses.  It has had a very small return on capital in some years, a negative return in others.  Its position is quite distinct from that of Aerlínte.  Aerlínte is by any commercial standards a profitable company.  When people say it has not paid a return on its capital <Col N="399" /> they are applying to it a criterion they would not apply to a private company. We do not say to ICI, for example, this is not a profitable company because it is not paying fixed interest at seven per cent per year on its capital and making a profit on top of that. People talk of Aerlínte as if it is not profitable because it is not paying fixed interest on the interest-bearing stock and making a profit on top of that again.  It is a company financed by equity capital and equity capital earns a high yield&mdash;ten to 15 per cent&mdash;and this decision, then, is taken not to distribute it but to plough it back&mdash;a decision which, I think, has led to a lot of unnecessary misunderstandings.</P>
    <P>There are some question which I should like to ask about the Bill before us, arising from this.  I think it is not only proper but overdue that the Government should, at this point, expand the equity capital of the company.  The Government have, by their unwillingness to do so to date, imposed an undue strain on the company by forcing it to finance the whole of its expansion out of its own profits and depreciation fund and out of external borrowing. Its balance sheet now has a very odd unbalanced look about it.  I think the Government have been unfair to the company by not meeting earlier its requirements in this regard.  I am glad they are now doing so.  It is proper that they should do so.  The company's balance sheet must be restored to a more reasonable appearance.  The company must be put in a position where its equity capital bears some reasonable relationship to the amount which it has had to borrow&mdash;much of it from outside this country.</P>
    <P>What is the reason for the different form in which additional capital is given?  It seems to me entirely sound that the Government should at this point provide additional equity capital for Aerlínte, as I said, but why do the Government propose to provide £10 million additional equity capital and £5 million in this very peculiar form&mdash; in the form of sums which may be required for the purpose of defraying expenditure incurred by Aerlínte which is properly chargeable to capital?  It is extraordinarily cumbersome terminology <Col N="400" /> and I think also it is a cumbersome procedure.  I am sure there is a reason for this.  I am even prepared to believe there is a good reason for it but I am in the position that I do not know the reason.  It does seem rather odd that the Minister should introduce this Bill and fail to explain the reason for this peculiar arrangement.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the subsection of that section in which it is said that the sums paid to Aerlínte under this section shall be on such terms as to interest and other matters as may from time to time be determined by the Minister for Finance but shall not be repayable.  This is a non-repayable sum.  Therefore, it appears to be a grant, if I understand correctly, which may or may not carry interest. I cannot, offhand, recall another case of this kind&mdash;although there is perhaps a somewhat analogous and extremely objectionable case, the case of Nítrigin Éireann, established, as I recall, with a share capital, with a fixed interest-bearing capital, a capital which in fact not only has not been remunerated but for the remuneration of which no provision was made in the balance sheet.</P>
    <P>I have been worried and concerned over the years at the fact that the balance sheet of Nítrigin Éireann is one which I should have thought a firm of commercial auditors should not pass.  Although the company is required to pay interest to the Exchequer on its capital, not only was no sum fixed but no liability was put into the accounts for the amount which eventually will become due when this amount is fixed.  Year after year, the Government have failed to tell the company what it owes.  This seems a most negligent way of doing business &mdash;to lend money to a concern on the basis that: &ldquo;I shall be looking for interest some day and I shall tell you some year how much it is that you owe me and, in the meantime, do not bother to mention in the balance sheet that you owe me anything&rdquo;.  If anybody did business in that way in the private sector, he would very quickly be in the courts&mdash;which is where we cannot get the Government.  It seems to me that this is quite an improper way to do business.  I have, in fact, criticised elsewhere previously the treatbod <Col N="401" /> ment of Nítrigin Éireann accounts and I shall continue to do so as long as the situation exists.</P>
    <P>The situation here is analogous though not quite the same.  At least, in this instance, it is said that the Minister shall determine the amount of interest.  It is left open as to whether or not interest is to be charged. I think we should be told if interest is to be payable on this and, if so, at what rate.  I do not think it should be left to the Minister.  I think that when the Exchequer provides money in the form of an interest-bearing loan or investment, as the case may be, either it should be treated as being fixed interest-bearing stock and the amount of interest should be stated or else it should be an equity shareholding on which a dividend may or may not be paid.  These are two traditional forms of investment, two traditional forms of providing the funds of a capital nature to a concern.</P>
    <P>This new approach here of giving a non-repayable grant, which is not, in fact, a shareholding and on which interest may or may not be paid, does not correspond to anything known in the commercial world.  I do not understand the reason for it.  I think it introduces unnecessary complications into the system and I do not like the look of it.  It seems to me to be bad accounting.  I should like the Minister to deal with this point when he is replying.  It is, of course, something we can take up further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that I wanted to say a word about Aer Lingus.  I think it is not inappropriate to do so at this point because the Aer Lingus position is connected with Aerlínte.  Aer Lingus was run for the first 20 years of its existence as an air line running services between Ireland and Britain and to some degree&mdash;and to an increasing degree&mdash;to the continent.  That was its <i>raison d'être</i>.  Its job was to operate as extensive a network as it could as profitably as it could on those routes. When the network was established, something which I think was inevitable happened.  Aer Lingus came to be regarded increasingly as a kind of feeder service to the transatlantic route.</P>
    <P>The development of Aerlínte very <Col N="402" /> quickly reached the point where the scale of their operations, turnover and, indeed, the capital invested in it equalled or, indeed, exceeded that of Aer Lingus.  Increasingly, the Aer Lingus services came to be regarded as feeder services so that, in fact, the decision as to whether a particular Aer Lingus services was operating at a particular time was governed not necessarily by the convenience of the great bulk of the people travelling on such a plane between Ireland and Britain or Ireland and the continent but rather, in some instances, by the consideration whether this would provide a convenient connection with a transatlantic service and would feed people into the transatlantic service or provide a method of distributing them throughout Europe once they had been attracted on to the transatlantic service by the existence of these connecting routes.  The effect of this on aer Lingus has been to an extent that I, as an outsider, cannot, of course, now determine but its operations have been somewhat less economic than they might otherwise have been.  If the time and the place is determined by the need to feed passengers into the transatlantic service and is not necessarily the timing that suits the people travelling on the local route, then naturally fewer people travel.  Of course, more money is being made by the concern as a whole.  I am not, in this criticism, necessarily criticising this method of running the company. The purpose is to maximise the profits for the concern, taking Aer Lingus and Aerlínte together, but I think that, so long as the two companies are accounted for separately, some account should be taken of this.</P>
    <P>If Aer Lingus is to be required to operate this kind of feeder service at some cost to itself and if the dominant factor or a dominant factor in the determination of its route network, pattern and timetable is to be what suits Aerlínte, and if this has the effect of reducing its revenue and profits, then I think it would be appropriate for Aerlínte to make some payment to Aer Lingus in this respect.  I recall, in this connection, that when the service was first started, those of us who were in Aer Lingus were given the <Col N="403" /> task of running Aerlínte as well as Aer Lingus.  One of the first things we had to do was to arrange for this mythical connection service between Shannon and Dublin.  As the Minister knows, that is regarded as being an internal service operated internally by Aer Lingus.  It is just a happy coincidence that the same plane runs to Shannon and to New York and that people do not have to get out at Shannon to board another plane, but, technically, it is of course an Aer Lingus internal connection service which happens to connect with the transatlantic service.  This gets over the problem of the agreement with the United States.</P>
    <P>I recall that we had a problem of negotiating a charter agreement with ourselves.  We had to sit down around a table and decide what was the appropriate fee to charge to Aerlínte for providing this feeder service.  I suppose we were biased in favour of Aer Lingus which had been our company for ten or 12 years previously.  This new intruder which we also represented perhaps did not command our loyalty to the same degree.  Perhaps the contract we signed with ourselves was a little unfair to Aerlínte.  I was a little disconcerted when a decision was taken shortly afterwards that the whole administrative work of Aerlínte was to be carried out by Aer Lingus for the remarkable sum of £10,000.  This kind of internal accountancy, designed to place the figures of one company in favour of the other, is something which I think is wrong.  As long as the two companies are separated, it is the duty of their boards of directors to see that each of them gets a fair deal and that the relationship between them is an arm's length relationship, a separate company with a separate board of directors, as they had at the beginning. I was not happy then and I still am not quite happy that that relationship is preserved.  I think Aer Lingus has perhaps had something of a raw deal.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider whether in fact it might be proper for Aerlínte, out of its substantial profits &mdash;earned in part at least, perhaps, at the expense of Aer Lingus services, their convenience and their level of <Col N="404" /> profitability&mdash;to make some payment to Aer Lingus if, in fact, Aer Lingus services are influenced to the company's detriment in this way.  I think it may be that the remarkable imbalance between the profits of the two companies may owe something to this factor.  I do not want to overstress it.  I have no inside knowledge for the past ten years as to what the position is but I would ask the Minister to have a look at this.</P>
    <P>Of course, I do not suggest for a moment that this is the only reason explaining the Aer Lingus financial position. The fact is, as the Minister has said, that the running of the short haul air service is difficult.  It is not of its nature profitable and Aer Lingus faces difficulties greater than those that face other airlines operating a similar service. The seasonality of traffic between Ireland and Britain is almost unique in its intensity.  One of the last things I did, in fact, it was after I left Aer Lingus, the last study I carried out as a paper to the Institute of Transport, was one on the seasonality of traffic in Aer Lingus.  I established, I think, that the peak traffic was eight and a half times the average winter traffic at that time.  This is an extraordinary variation. A more normal variation in many parts of the world would be a one-anda-half to one ratio as against eight-and-a-half to one.  Certainly as against BEA the seasonality factor is much greater.  This is a disadvantage which is almost unique to Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>On top of this the length of the haul is shorter than in the case of BEA or almost any other European airline, a further serious disadvantage. Beyond that again there is the fact that traditionally the service transport fares on routes across the Irish Sea have been very much lower on the rate per mile than the service transport fares across the English Channel which are deflated by the very high port charges at the ports on both sides of the English Channel.  As a result Aer Lingus have had to operate a more seasonal network than anybody else, on shorter hauls than anybody else and meeting more acute competition in fares than anybody else.  It has required great efficiency on the part of the company to overcome this triple difficulty and to at least break even.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" /> Nevertheless, it is a matter of some concern that in the last couple of years the company's performance has been below its own average, shall we say. It has incurred losses where the profits have been small.  If one looks at the figures one can trace this back to the fact that the load factors have fallen below the level that used to be attained.  Aer Lingus and Aerlínte have always had this tradition of high load factors.  It was something which I must say I myself in the company over 12 years always sought to maintain.  Since 1948 when we got rid of the Constellations, since the summer of that year when we set out to re-schedule the routes, when the Constellation aircraft were disposed of on the 6th June, from that time onwards the tradition of the company has always been to gauge the service of the traffic.  It has never been a company that has gone in for extravagant policies of laying on extra services in the hope of getting the odd passenger.  The company has always aimed at high load factors.  It had to do so because of the extreme economic difficulties it faced which could only be overcome by operating in this very efficient way.  In the last couple of years the load factors of Aer Lingus have fallen and it seems to me, as an outsider again, I have at this stage no inside knowledge, that the company has not been as efficient in this period on the Aer Lingus side as it might have been.  It does seem to me that they have not accurately forecast traffic, that they have made inadequate allowances particularly for the effect of the car ferry service which made inroads of a clearly unexpected nature into the company's traffic.  For this reason and, perhaps, because of more short-term and detailed deficiencies in their scheduling the load factors have fallen.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether he can offer the House any assurance that the difficulties the company have faced in recent years are, at least in part, temporary.  Can he say that with more accurate scheduling of aircraft, more accurate pre-planning, by taking full account now of the effects of the car ferry the company are able, are, perhaps, able even in this financial year, to improve their load <Col N="406" /> factors and their profitability?  I see no reason why they should not.  I think the company should be in a position this year to recover any mistakes they have made in the last couple of years, to improve their load factors and to become again more profitable, never I am afraid as profitable as the long haul operator, but, nevertheless, more profitable than they have been.  I should like to ask the Minister whether he can offer any assurances to this effect.</P>
    <P>On the broader picture on which doubts have been raised by other speakers, the Minister himself has raised a doubt as to where the company go in the long run.  I would like to think that it would be possible for Aer Lingus and Aerlínte together to continue as an independent Irish airline into the furture and that we would be able to continue to fly the Irish flag across the Atlantic but I have some doubts.  Even larger airlines than Aerlínte and Aer Lingus and much larger countries have had to consider whether the scale of investment required for modern fleets of aircraft may not be such as to require co-operation between countries in order to work jointly to achieve economies.  There was, indeed, the abortive air union project in Europe in the late fifties and early sixties which may some day be revived.  This was an indication that airlines of countries as large as France, Germany and Italy felt the need to come together to share resources for maintenance of aircraft and, perhaps, also to share their capital resources. May it not be that at some stage we may face that?  I hope not.  I would hate to see the day when we cease to fly our own flag on our own aircraft throughout the world, but undoubtedly the scale of the economic burden now facing us and the fact that the Minister after many years during which he has been able, rightly or wrongly &mdash;I think, perhaps, wrongly&mdash;to keep away from this House as far as Aerlínte was concerned, not to seek capital for it, now has to come to us for the relatively substantial sum of £15 million, twice the present share capital of the company, may be the beginning of a process which may run beyond our control.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="407" /> It may well be that as the sums become increasingly enormous and as it becomes increasingly difficult to borrow more than a proportion of these abroad and as it becomes more and more necessary to increase the equity capital of the company beyond the extent to which it can be increased out of profits and depreciation funds that the increasing drain on national resources might force us to reconsider the position of the company.  I hope that will not happen.  I hope that day will not come.  I for my part&mdash;and I think I can speak for others on this side of the House&mdash;say that we will try to put it off as far as possible but I am glad the Minister is initiating a very deep study into this whole question and that outside consultants may be employed also on this and that we shall get a report going to the roots of the problem which will give us guidance as to where we go as we move from the 1970s into the 1980s, into the period of supersonic aircraft, costing individually, perhaps, tens of millions of pounds.  It is necessary for us to have this further look at the position now.  I hope what emerges from that will be positive.  I hope it will be something that will enable us to continue to have our own airline flying our own flag but we cannot be sure that this will be the case.  In the meantime I welcome this Bill but I should like the Minister to explain the reason for treating the £65 million differently and reserve my right to table an amendment to that particular section.</P>

    <P>I did not intend to speak on this Bill but I thought I should avail of the opportunity to express my concern on behalf of the people who live in the area bordering on the airports, particularly Dublin Airport.  Deputy FitzGerald treated us to certain mental aeronautics regarding profitability, progress factors etc., but I am more concerned about the people who live in the area.  If Aer Lingus or Aer Rianta satisfy me that a certain amount of the money they now seek will be devoted to reducing noise I shall welcome the Bill very much.</P>
    <P>It would be amiss of me or anybody to criticise the progress made by Aer Lingus.  They are entitled to full commendation from this House and the Irish people.  We may, however, be thinking too much of profitability and how we compare with other international airlines and forgetting that in the vicinity of the airport here we have thousands of people old and young. some infirm, who must put up with the tremendous incidence of noise in this area.  I do not know whether it is possible in this age of advanced aeronautics and technology to reduce the noise but it is a matter of greater concern to me than the question of £.s.d</P>
    <P>I have been in houses in Finglas, Ballymun and Santry where a plane going over has caused windows to shatter, doors to vibrate and, to all intents and purposes, has rocked the house.  In these houses we may have young children trying to sleep, elderly people hoping for a quiet night and, generally speaking the quiet atmosphere of the house is disturbed.  I should like Aer Lingus to devote more money to purchasing engines that make less noise, whether they are dearer or not.  I speak as one with very little technical knowledge but with certain experience of the noise involved.  It is rather strange that in a situation where <Col N="409" /> we forbid industry to make certain types of noise and prevent people from sounding motor horns after a certain hour there seems to be no restriction or prohibition on the noise from planes. I hope greater emphasis will be put on the importance of this aspect of the matter as technology advances. Whether the noise causes injury to the inner ear in the case of some people is something that, perhaps, the medical men in the House might discuss.</P>
    <P>My purpose in rising was to ask Aer Lingus to devote more money towards the reduction of noise and have more frequent consultation with those living in the airport areas.  I would wish to see Aer Lingus prospering and advancing with less disturbance of the people of Ballymun, Finglas and Santry.</P>

      <P>I Welcome the fact the State is investing more money in our air companies.  For some time past many of us were concerned about the extent to which the ownership of our airlines was passing out of our control because we were, apparently, seeking to have more foreign money invested in these airlines.  While we might nominally still have control of them, when foreign money is invested in any concerns the independence of Irish management is obviously somewhat curtailed.  Therefore, it is a welcome turn of events that circumstances have forced the Government&mdash;rather unwillingly, I think&mdash;to put more Irish money back into the airlines.  If the world money market were more fluid, if there was greater money available from abroad than now appears to be available, I think the Government would not be bringing this Bill before the Dáil.  They would quite happily have allowed the Irish air company to be financed to an unsafe degree by foreign financiers.  At any time this is an undesirable development but in an uncertain world, in which wars can easily occur, it should be apparent that the control and usage of our planes would be decided not by ourselves but by the people and countries that had given the money to Ireland so that Irish planes could operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="410" /> We do not own our aircraft simply by painting shamrocks on them and, if the world financial situation was not as restricted as it is now, quite possibly we would have planes which would be nominally Irish planes but purchased with foreign money.  We understand, of course, that if money had been obtained abroad it would have to be repaid but until it had been repaid effective control would be in foreign hands, and that would be wholly undesirable.  This is the kind of investment which we in Fine Gael welcome because it is a kind which private resources are probably incapable, in present circumstances, of financing. The resources of the State are so substantial that the Government can effectively invest in what is a major growth industry which has performed exceedingly well in the past and promises to operate even more successfully in the future.  Small minds will certainly never finance the kind of operations in which air companies must engage and it is a welcome development that circumstances have forced the government to put more enterprise, more Irish investment into the future growth of our air companies.  I hope that at no time in the future will the Government again contemplate surrendering Irish airlines to the mercy of foreign investors, as they would have done if circumstances and the advice of bankers had not forced on them the obligation of putting back Irish money into Irish airlines, Irish enterprise and Irish success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the House for the manner in which this Bill has been received.  It has been acknowledged by all Deputies participating in the debate that this is a necessary measure to put the capital structure of Aerlínte into proper form. The main purpose of the Bill is to ensure that in future Aerlínte and its allied companies can go forward and be in a position to raise the massive moneys that will be required for its future expansion on the basis of having a sound capital structure, that the development that was arising was an imbalance between loan capital and equity capital and that the advance of this £10 million in the form of equity share capital and £5 million in the form of non-repayable interest bearing loan <Col N="411" /> capital, which will in effect be preferential equity investment by the State, that this £15 million investment by the State will redress that imbalance and bring roughly the equity investment and the loan investment into a 50/50 ratio, which provides a sound capital structure for the future of the company when the company will require to get money from any and every source.  I want to assure Deputy Ryan that the moneys will be very substantial in the future.  At least the companies will have a capital structure in which there will be an even balance between loan and equity capital and on the basis of that capital structure it can look forward with confidence to securing the necessary funds which it will require in the future.  I mentioned in my opening remarks that the immediate investment over five years will be £71.5 million.  To keep the sort of 50/50 balance I am speaking about between equity and loan capital investment, the State steps in and provides £15 million.</P>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald in a very interesting contribution from his very detailed knowledge of this matter and from his own personal experience made a point in regard to the £5 million investment by way of loan capital investment and queried the nature of this type of investment. I want to assure Deputy FitzGerald and some other speakers&mdash; I think Deputy Dr. O'Donovan made the point that this was really in the nature of a grant rather than a loan investment&mdash;that this is not so.  This is intended to be a non-repayable loan bearing interest which will be returned to the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get to the point.  The Exchequer and rightly so was interested in securing this preferential position in regard to what moneys would be advanced.  So out of a total of £15 million advanced by the <Col N="412" /> Exchequer, the Exchequer is guaranteed a return in respect of the £5 million on the current rate of interest from the air companies.  This puts the Exchequer, from the point of view of the Exchequer <i>vis-à-vis</i> the air companies, in a stronger position in regard to that £5 million than with regard to the other £10 million that is pure equity. The £5 million is preferential equity which must return the interest to the Exchequer year in and year out.  I am hopeful that from the other £10 million equity investment, because of the growth of the air companies and their success which has been apparent and looks like continuing, a dividend will also accrue.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the differentiation between the £10 million and the £5 million within the £15 million framework of the advance is to ensure that the £5 million will with certainty return in effect in dividends to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a company &mdash;Aerlínte Éireann Teoranta&mdash;under the Companies Act.  The appropriate way of achieving the Minister's objective is to provide preference capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same thing.  Without going into the nomenclature of the business, the fact is that £5 million of this £15 million will yield interest year in and year out to the Exchequer, again within the terminology of section 2 to which Deputy FitzGerald referred.  The Exchequer may not insist on such interest return in the event of difficult days ahead or difficult times.  That is why the section is so flexible.  The intention is as of now that this £5 million will yield interest to the Exchequer year in and year out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>But surely preference shares are shares on which a certain rate of interest is payable?  It may not be paid, of course, at certain periods when the company is in difficulties, but it seems extraordinary when you have a company under the <Col N="413" /> Companies Act to invest a new class of security and not use the ordinary preference share mechanism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <P>We can have a discussion on section 2 on Committee Stage.  Deputy O'Donnell raised one point which I want to say straight away has no basis.  There is no question of BEA having any investment holding in the Irish air companies.  There are traffic sharing arrangements and pooling arrangements in regard to traffic between BEA and Aer Lingus but there is no question of BEA having any investment holding in the Irish air companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Had at one time but not at this stage and not for the past eight years to my recollection.  Not for eight years roughly has there been any holding by BEA in Aer Lingus and all that exists at the moment is a sharing arrangement in regard to traffic which suits both air companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="414" /> The reality of the matter&mdash;as emphasised by Deputy FitzGerald&mdash;is that all short haul operations managed by air companies at the moment are finding it very difficult to pay their way. Aer Lingus are marginally successful in their short haul operations and are showing a marginal profit and in this respect are well in the top of the league as regards short haul operations conducted by any of the other air companies throughout the world.  The importance of short haul operations so far as the total operations are concerned&mdash;and Deputy FitzGerald referred to this also&mdash;is that Aer Lingus operate a feeder service into the more profitable operation, that is the Aerlínte transatlantic operation.  Without the short haul feeder by Aer Lingus, the successful operation of the transatlantic operation by Aerlínte would not be possible.</P>
    <P>In this respect I want to refer to Deputy FitzGerald's point in regard to the administration aspect.  He made the point that as between Aer Lingus and Aerlínte possibly Aer Lingus were carrying a greater share of the accounts in relation to administration and that this might be in some way, Deputy FitzGerald suggested, distorting the accounts in favour of Aerlínte.  This is a matter which I will certainly take up with the chairman and the board and the managers concerned whom I am meeting inside the next few days. It is a matter that I will certainly bring to their attention and it is a matter I was not aware of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely said that did happen at the very beginning of the operation.  I have no reason to believe it is happening now.  My point was a different one.  If Aer Lingus is providing a feeder service at some cost to itself in business profitability it should get some compensation from Aerlínte for it.  I am not suggesting that at this point there is any inequity in the distribution of the burden of overhead administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, it is a matter that I will look into and I will bring the Deputy's observations to the notice of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised to hear from the <Col N="415" /> socialist benches Deputy Dr. O'Donovan concentrating to a very large extent on the question of profit and introducing a very Victorian capitalistic notion in regard to the defination of profit in relation to State sponsored and nationalised enterprises.  In a very pleasant way, he was intent to point out that in the strict narrow accounting sense the air companies were not showing a profit, as if that were the only criterion to be adopted and, again, it was inferential from what he said that this was the only criterion to be adopted and followed in regard to the assessment of the worth or otherwise of State sponsored organisations.  I thought it was extraordinary coming from socialist benches&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We said during the campaign that we were the party of practical socialism and the party that always concerned itself with the development of public investment so as to enlarge the area of employment for our people.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tunney raised the point about noise.  This is a question that is agitating air companies throughout the world.  We have not the research facilities to deal with it here.  It is a matter of great concern in bigger built-up areas in other countries but it is of concern to us here as well.  We have been assured that in regard to the new, <Col N="417" /> larger aircraft now being purchased special devices have been installed which will ensure less noise.  All the big aircraft manufacturing companies throughout the world, Boeing and the rest of them, are putting substantial sums of money into research designed to reduce noise considerably.</P>
    <P>As I said in my introduction, the purpose of the Bill is to ensure a more balanced capital structure in the future with a view to ensuring that these very successful companies, moving into a highly competitive age in the future, companies that have already embarked on a dynamic programme of growth, will be employing twice as many people in ten years time.  It is important at this stage to ensure that the capital structure of the companies will be such as will attract investment to enable them to continue to operate successfully. This is a matter which is appreciated generally on all sides of the House and I thank the House for the welcome that has been given to the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Séard atá i gceist leis an mBille seo ná comhacht a thabhairt don Rialtas tréimhse Oifige Seanaid Ollscoil na hÉireann d'fhaidiú ar iarratas ón Seanad.  Cúig bliana gnáth thréimhse Oifige an tSeanaid agus beidh an tréimhse reatha caite ar an 31ú Deireadh Fómhair, 1969.  Tá 35 baill ar fad ar an Seanad.  Toghtar cuid acu ag na Coláistí Ollscoile, cuid eile ag na céimithe, ainmnítear ceathrar ag an Rialtas, agus tá roint eile fós ina mbaill <i>ex-officio.</i> Níor mhór sa ghnáthshlí na toghacháin don Seanad do reachtáil sa choicíos idir an ceathrú agus an dara seachtain roimh an 31ú Deireadh Fómhair, 1969.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beidh cuimhneamh air ag na Teachtaí gur mhol an Coimisiún Um ArdOideachas <Col N="418" /> go mba cheart deireadh do chur le hOllscoil na hÉireann agus stádas nea-spleách mar ollscoil a thabhairt do gach ceann de na comhcholáistí. Ghlac an Rialtas i bprionsabal leis an moladh sin.</P>
    <P>I mí Lúnasa, 1968, bunaíodh an tÚdarás Ard-Oideachais.  Tá breithniú á dhéanamh ag an Údarás faoi láthair ar an eagar ba chóir a bheith ann feasta i leith ard-oideachais i gcoitinne agus i leith ollscolaíochta go speisialta. Ó tharla na cúrsaí sin amhlaidh agus de bhrí nach mbeadh lán shaol-ré ag Seanad nua d'iarr Seanad na hOllscoile ar an Rialtas a théarma oifige d'fhaidiú tar éis an 31ú Deireadh Fómhair, 1969. Mheas an Rialtas go raibh réasún ag baint leis an iarratas san.</P>
    <P>Is d'fhonn comhacht a thabhairt don Rialtas gníomhú do réir an iarratais atá an Bille seo á thabhairt os comhair an tí.</P>
    <P>The Senate of the National University of Ireland comprises 35 members:</P>
    <P>The Chancellor of the University.</P>
    <P>The Presidents of the three Colleges.</P>
    <P>Four nominees of the Government (including one woman).</P>
    <P>Six persons elected by the Governing Body of UCD of whom three are members of the Academic Council of the College.</P>
    <P>Four persons elected by the Governing Body of UCC of whom two are members of the Academic Council of the College.</P>
    <P>Four persons elected by the Governing Body of UCG of whom two are members of the Academic Council of the College.</P>
    <P>Eight persons elected by Convocation.</P>
    <P>Four persons co-opted.</P>
    <P>The Registrar.</P>
    <P>It holds office for a period of five years and its current period of office is due to expire on 31st October, 1969. In the normal way elections for the selection of the elected members should take place within four to two weeks before the 31st October, 1969.</P>
    <P>However, the Commission on Higher Education recommended that the <Col N="419" /> National University of Ireland should be dissolved and that every one of its constituent colleges should be given the status of an autonomous university with its own governing authority.  The Government accepted that recommendation in principle.</P>
    <P>At present the Higher Education Authority is engaged on preparing recommendations as to the form the future university structure here should take.  This is being done with particular reference to the provision to be made in Dublin and to the establishment of independent universities in Cork and Galway.</P>
    <P>That being so the Senate of the National University requested the Government to take powers to enable the life of the present Senate to be extended.  In making that request the Senate felt that there would be little point in holding elections for a body the period of office of which would be comparatively short.</P>
    <P>The Government decided to accede to this request and hence the Bill which is now before the House.  It is a simple measure and does not in any way prejudge the future provision for higher education generally.</P>

      <P>The Minister's account of the genesis of this Bill seems to me incomplete, and as the position, as I understand it&mdash;and I am, of course, open to correction if I am wrong&mdash;shows rather a different picture, this affects the attitude which we shall take to this Bill.  My understanding is that the Senate of the National University, considering this matter some months ago, decided that, in view of what then appeared to be the likelihood of the merger of the two Dublin colleges and the creation of the two universities in Cork and Galway going through reasonably expeditiously, there might be no point in having an election this year for a senate which might never act as the Senate of the NUI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owing to a misunderstanding they thought they had only to apply to the Government for an order in this respect; there was apparently some confusion as regards the 1940 Bill <Col N="420" /> under which the government of the day took power to extend the life of the governing Body of UCD and, perhaps, of the other colleges, a Bill which, however, does not extend the life of the Senate of the National University.  When this was discovered&mdash; and the point had been reached in the process of elections to the Senate at which it was not, in fact, possible, as I understand it, for the election to proceed in accordance with the law&mdash; it became necessary, regardless of whether it was considered desirable to extend the life of the Senate, for legal reasons to extend the life of the Senate and it is in those circumstances that this bill is before us now.  I am open to correction in this because one has not got the same sources of information as the Minister has.  But this is an important point and, while I am prepared to endorse the Bill in so far as it is necessary to legalise what is, in effect, an oversight and postpone the election of the Senate for whatever period is necessary for that purpose, I will not support the proposal to extend the life of the Senate for a year, or longer, on the grounds put forward by the Minister.  It is important that we should understand the purpose for which the Bill is required.  The Minister should have given us a fuller explanation.  I may, however, be misinformed, in which case I shall have to approach the Bill from a slightly different angle.  When he comes to reply the Minister can brief us about this.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Bill is designed to extend the life of the Senate it is objectionable on several grounds.  First of all, a similar procedure was adopted over two years ago in regard to the governing body of UCD.  At that time, shortly after the April, 1967 announcement by the second last Minister for Education about the merger, the governing body decided by a majority &mdash;there were dissentient voices; I, as is my usual custom, was one&mdash;to apply to the Government under the 1940 Act for an extension of the life of the governing body.  They did that because at the time they suffered from the delusion that there would be a merger of the two universities in the near future and to engage in the very complex electoral procedure, which involves <Col N="421" /> a kind of interregnum for a certain period while bits and pieces are put together under the 1908 Act, would be an undesirable situation for the college to find itself in, without a governing body for a period of some months and that at a time which was thought to be a critical period in the merger negotiations, December, 1967 to February, 1968.  A year passed and the matter came up again before the governing body.  It then seemed the merger was actually going to go through and the governing body persuaded itself&mdash;this time, unanimously&mdash;that there was not really any point in having an election.</P>
    <P>Having postponed it once, to have an election then seemed to be somewhat ridiculous when the whole thing would be settled in a matter of months, and the same procedure was initiated in June 1968; the election of the governing body was postponed.  The governing body has now decided that it was rather foolish in its expectations and there is no longer any point in carrying on this farce and the normal electoral procedure will, in fact, go ahead.  It has been set in train.  That is the absurdity of this particular method; the merger has evaporated so far into the distant future, that the governing body, having decided not to have an election, have now decided to have an election.  There is a lack of co-ordination between these two institutions of the National University of Ireland.  The governing body is more realistic.  At this point the merger situation has become complex to the point at which while it is not insoluble, it will not certainly be solved this side of Christmas which seems to be the implication in the Bill, or next Christmas or the Christmas after that.  The position about the merger at the moment is that it now appears as if the merger will not, in fact, take place.  In fact, steps are now being taken, as the Minister must be aware, though he is not very long in office, to move towards the four universities of Ireland proposal and the merger seems not to be at this moment in issue.</P>

The only justification for the Bill is the merger proposal.  If I am right in thinking this is not something that will happen in the near future the Bill falls to the ground.  It is essential, therefore, that the House should know the current position of the merger for, without that, the House cannot make up its mind on the Bill.</P>

      <P>The pros and cons are so complex and so nearly related to the question of whether the merger is likely to take place that the merger is in fact, the <i>raison d'être</i> for the Bill. We have to discuss the merger and how and when it may happen.  That is the whole purpose of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to discuss whether this Bill is appropriate and we allege that it is, in fact, unnecessary. That is the purpose of a Second Stage debate.  It does involve the question of whether the merger is likely to happen, otherwise the discussion would be completely vitiated and there would be no point in discussing the Bill.  The position about the merger is that the proposal that is before the <Col N="423" /> university is one which in its present form is so unbalanced as, indeed, in a totally different way was the first proposal, that it does not command any support by the staff or the students of University College, Dublin.  It does not command the support of more than a minority in its present form.  It is because it does not command that support and because many of the staff of Trinity College also regard it with dislike and dismay that the prospect of its taking place quickly is remote. The reason why it is unpopular is something we have to consider and I should like to put to the House the reason why the merger, as proposed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to consider whether the stated reason for it is a valid reason.  The stated reason is:</P>
      <P>At present the Higher Education Authority is engaged on preparing recommendations as to the form the future university structure here should take.  This is being done with particular reference to the provision to be made in Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, of course, is the merger&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>and to the establishment of independent universities in Cork and Galway.</P>
      <P>That being so the Senate of the National University requested the Government to take powers to enable the life of the present Senate to be extended.  In making that request the Senate felt that there would be little point in holding elections for a body the period of office of which would be comparatively short.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That being so, I have to discuss whether or not the statement made by the Minister is, in fact, a relevant statement and whether, in fact, the Minister is right in his expectation that this merger proposal and the creation of two independent universities in <Col N="424" /> Cork and Galway are so imminent that, to use his own words, there is no point in having an election to the National University of Ireland.  I see no other basis on which to consider this Bill and I propose, therefore, to consider why this merger in its present form is likely to command sufficient support to go through within a year and, if it does not, there is no point in extending the life of the Senate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

      <P>That being so the Senate of the National University requested the Government to take powers to enable the life of the present Senate to be extended.</P>
      <P>That is the reason why this Bill was requested.  How discuss the Bill if one does not discuss the reason for the Bill?  I am, I think, strictly within the rules of order.  The problem with regard to the merger is that in its present form it is so unbalanced a proposal that it makes it impossible to see how it could be accepted within the necessary period to make this Bill desirable or to give this Bill any meaning.  The aspect of the present proposals which creates the situation is the imbalance which these proposals create between the two colleges which it is proposed to merge.  The reason why this Bill is unlikely to be of any use is that the degree of unpopularity of these proposals particularly in University College, Dublin, is such that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand, Sir, that you do not wish the debate to be widened into a discussion in detail on the proposed merger, but what we have to discuss is whether the present situation about the merger is likely to lead to a decision on the dissolving of the NUI in the near future.  The purpose of the Bill is to deal with the situation which, hypothetically, will lead to the NUI no longer existing in the near future so that it would have been a waste of time to have had an election to its Senate.  Therefore we must discuss the question of whether the merger and the creation of these two universities and a break up of the NUI is likely to take place in the near future. In discussing that it is necessary to make limited and appropriate reference to why one believes the merger will not take place.  I propose to restrict my remarks much more than before your ruling and to deal with the question of why I do not think the merger will take place.  I quite accept your ruling that I should not discuss the merger <i>per se.</i></P>
      <P>The reason why the break up of the NUI is not as imminent as people think is that the merger is put forward is of such a character as to be unacceptable to people in UCD, by a large majority, and also unacceptable to many in Trinity College.  The reasons are relevant to why there should be a break-up of the NUI.  The reasons include the imbalance that is proposed between the two colleges.  This explains the resistance in UCD.  I should like to make the point that there are many people in that college, and I am one of them, who have favoured a merger, or an association, of these two colleges in a single university.  Even those of us who favour this in principle could not support the proposed merger as put forward at present.  Because there is such unanimity such strength of opposition has developed that the likelihood of this merger being put into effect in such a short time as to make this Bill relevant or useful is minimal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="427" /> The reason why this view is held is that it would aggravate an imbalance already existing between the two colleges.  They differ very substantially. One is an ancient foundation with a long tradition; it is a small college and it feels no obligation to expand.  It is also a college which traditionally has drawn many of its Irish students from particular social groups.  The position that is likely to arise if this merger goes through is that the imbalance would be aggravated because the two faculties it is proposed to add to Trinity College are faculties which draw a higher proportion of students from the upper income groups of the middle class than any other faculty.  At the same time it would tend to increase the flow of students from that particular group to Trinity College and would create a new social division or aggravate an existing social division in an undesirable manner.  It is not to be expected that a college such as University College, Dublin, would readily accept that the two leading and ancient faculties would be removed and added to another college.  I do not intend to develop this point.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair should have seen the detail I had intended going into.  I will leave the matter there.  However, I am disappointed that this is not an occasion on which to discuss this matter and I feel it needs to be discussed.  I will turn now to another aspect or another reason why it is important not to pass this Bill.  If this Bill is passed the Senate of NUI will lose the authority it now holds, through being a duly elected body, elected according to the processes of law for a fixed term of office.  That body is not in its present form an adequately representative Senate, in my view, just as the governing body of UCD is not adequately representative of the staff and students.  Nevertheless, that Senate continues to command sufficient authority, through the fact that it was duly elected, to be able to carry out its functions successfully. <Col N="428" /> Experience has shown us, in the case of the governing body of UCD, that if you have a body inadequately representative of the staff and students of the college, and if you extend its life beyond its proper term, it is likely to lead to a situation of great danger.  I have seen the authority of the governing body being eroded because of its character and because of the growing recognition of its junior staff, which represents two-thirds of the staff, and by the students that they have no representation.  I have seen the erosion of its authority with the growing recognition of its unrepresentative character and I have seen, as others have too, this leading to growing tension and certain troubles which fortunately are not serious as yet.  I have seen that happening and this has been attributable in large part to the fact that the governing body lost such authority as it had when it ceased to be a duly elected body and became arbitrarily extended in its life.  I have seen that happening.  It is because of that, amongst other reasons, that I will be opposed to an extension of the life of the Senate of the National University of Ireland for any period longer than that necessary to legalise the illegal situation that has been created, as I understand it, by its failure to initiate the due procedures according to law which should have been initiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is a good reason and I think the House should have regard to it because there is a serious situation developing in our universities.  Our universities are not unique in this.  I would make the point that we are fortunate in this country in the kind of relations we have had between the staff and students and between both and the university authorities.  We are fortunate to have avoided many of the troubles of other countries. When we find that there is some feature of our university system which is remediable and which if remedied could avoid, perhaps the serious kind of troubles that have occurred elsewhere, it behoves us to remedy the ill that exists and it is for that reason that I think it is desirable that the governing body of the Senate of the NUI should in due course, when proposals come forward from interested parties concerned, <Col N="429" /> be reformed so as to gain a more representative character.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, pending that being done, and so long as the Government have not got proposals for such reforms before it, emanating, one would hope, from the staff and students of the colleges concerned, so long as that situation exists it is of great importance that these bodies should continue, unrepresentative though they be, to be elected by due process of law in accordance with the timetable laid down in the Act and Charter establishing the college.  If that is done, at least it is not possible for people seeking to cause trouble in the college to say, as has been said, indeed, in UCD, of our governing body, that it is not even a properly elected body, that its term of office expired some time ago and it got itself extended by using some emergency powers legislation introduced in 1940, and no longer carries any authority in the college&mdash;views put forward with a view to giving licence to actions of a kind which one would hope to avoid.</P>
    <P>That is the situation we are in and I would, therefore, appeal to the Minister to reconsider the position on this Bill. If I am right in understanding that the Bill is technically necessary because of the fact that the Senate of the NUI, believing that the extension which they sought could be given by Government order, allowed themselves to become illegal, and if it is necessary to pass this Bill to legalise that situation, then, of course, I would support the passage of the Bill for that purpose.</P>
    <P>It is one thing to pass the Bill to legalise that situation and to have an election of the Senate of the NUI at the earliest possible time thereafter; it is another thing to use this Bill to extend its life because of the belief which, if it exists on the Government benches, certainly exists nowhere else now, that the merger is going to go through within the foreseeable future. It is really absurd to come in here and suggest that this is going to happen when the Minister should know, if he has had the opportunity to brief himself, and those advising him certainly know, of the developments occurring <Col N="430" /> which involve a move in the direction of four separate universities.</P>
    <P>Now, on the question of the merger itself, I should like to say that I think that there were good reasons for having a merger.  I myself was in favour of a merger, though not the merger as proposed. I should like to stress this point. However, I recognise that the reasons I had for supporting a merger are reasons which could be met by some other solution.  I would not be dogmatic about it.  But, there are things that need to be done as between these two colleges.  It is necessary that the facilities in them be co-ordinated.  It is necessary that where there is a specialist teacher in a particular aspect of a subject in one college his services be available to students in the other college. It would be absurd to continue a position in which students have to be taught by someone less qualified when there is somebody well qualified for the purpose a short distance away whose services could be made available. It is academically desirable that such co-ordination take place.  It was my belief that this could best be secured by a merger.  Indeed, perhaps, at some stage I may have felt that it could only be secured by a merger but I recognise that there may be other means of doing it and if that is the case and if this result can be achieved, then, perhaps, the merger may be unnecessary but I think that the Government would be right to press for adequate co-ordination of university facilities if the merger is to be abandoned, as now seems likely.</P>
    <P>It was also intended in proposing that there should be a merger to in some way facilitate the removal of the ban on Trinity College.  It was intended in some way to get the bishops off the hook.  Indeed, there is some reason to believe that this may have been an important element in the thinking of some of those initiating the merger proposal. I think this problem is one which is self-solving.  I do not think it is the function of the Government of this country to get bishops off hooks on which they should not have been and off which they will get themselves if left to themselves and left with no alternative.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="431" /> Another reason for the merger was the fact that many places in Trinity College at that time, about 2,000, were taken up by foreign students.  That situation has been remedied because, with the disregarding of the ban, an increased number of Catholic students are going there and filling up the ranks and this problem looks like solving itself.</P>

      <P>The Chair would like to refer to the fact that the Chair has already ruled on this matter that there ought not to be discussion on the merger <i>per se.</i> It might merit introduction on this Bill at the present but, <i>per se,</i> there ought not to be discussion on it.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I was trying simply to indicate the reasons for my personal position in regard to the merger at this point but if I have strayed too far from the direct subject I shall certainly bring that part of my remarks to a close.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would again sum up my reasons for being unhappy about this Bill: first of all, the absurdity of bringing in a Bill here to extend the life of the Senate of the National University of Ireland at the same moment as the governing body has just decided within a matter of weeks not to extend its own life any further after doing so for two years in the hopeful expectation that something might happen about the merger.  I cannot see how a Government can justify on the one hand the governing body going ahead with its election and the Senate election being abandoned, more particularly because these bodies are intercommunicating to a very high degree. Indeed, the Senate elects to the governing body and the governing body elects to the Senate.  There is no one on the electoral body who is not in perpetual motion between them through this interesting mechanism.  This being the case, I cannot see how you justify abandoning the election to the Senate when that Senate which is now not going to have an election is going, in fact, to choose members of a governing body which will have an election and the new governing body having the <Col N="432" /> election is going to choose people to the non-elected Senate.  The two bodies are so closely linked that to adopt opposite procedures in regard to them at this point of time is utterly absurd.  I cannot blame the Minister because the Bill was initiated before his time but I do not think the previous Minister really thought the thing out.  I cannot believe his advisers really thought the thing out in coming to the House with such an extraordinary proposal at this point of time.</P>
    <P>The Charter of the NUI is a document which sets out the details with regard to the Senate of the University and the governing bodies of its colleges. It is one document.  These are two sets of bodies within one institution. If there is a reason for abandoning elections in one, there must be reason in the other.  If it has now been decide, and I think properly, after several years of hanging around waiting for a non-existent merger, to hold elections and to at least have an elected governing body instead of those which have lost all authority, if it is decided to do that, how could the Government have chosen this moment, of all moments, to introduce a Bill to extend the life of the Senate indefinitely?  The absurdity of this is so evident that when one puts it like that it becomes clear that the only value of this Bill and the basis on which one could support it is to legalise an inadvertent illegality committed by the Senate in thinking that the Government could extend its life by order.</P>
    <P>I also feel, as I have said, that it was most undesirable in principle and, indeed, for obvious practical reasons, to undermine the authority of any university institution at this time by artificially extending its life and I think the case against that has been shown in the case of UCD.  It is evident to anybody who has followed events there that the situation there is a serious one, has been serious and is a potentially serious one even today and will be serious next autumn because of the fact that we have a governing body which is unrepresentative of two-thirds of the staff and of all the students and two-thirds of the staff and the students have no power to elect any members to it and which has extended its life <Col N="433" /> with Government connivance and Government support for several years so that it has lost the moral authority it needs to have.  There have been few periods in the lives of universities in this country when it has been so necessary for the bodies which govern them to have moral authority as well as power and this House should do nothing to undermine it.  I would, therefore, appeal to the Minister in replying to the debate to give us an assurance that the Bill will be used to remedy whatever technical defects there may be in relation to the Senate of the NUI but that he will ensure that the procedure for the election of the Senate of the NUI starts immediately.  It should have started several months ago &mdash;that is why this Bill is necessary now &mdash;and that the election will take place, if not by 31st October, when it should, at least by the 31st December so that there will be a newly-elected Senate with the function of appointing members to the governing body which is being elected in accordance with the governing body of UCD.  It could be very valuable to have a new Senate&mdash;a Senate that would have been elected by the present generation of electors which include a very large proportion of people who have come on the register within the past five years.</P>
    <P>Owing to the rapidity with which our universities have expanded, the proportion of electors on the register is exceptionally high.  There is quite a disproportionate share of electors on this register, who elect 80 members to the Senate whose names have been placed on the register within the past five years and who are much more in touch with the current realities of university life than other generations.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress the point that the changes that have taken place in our universities within the past 12 months are really quite extraordinary. It would have been inconceivable, say, two years ago, to think that we would have in UCD today a system whereby there are staff-student committees working in every department&mdash;committees which are working closely and harmoniously together in arranging courses for the various departments and committees which have proved their worth during the past year.  These <Col N="434" /> committees have commanded the support of the students and the admiration of the staff for the way in which they have worked.</P>
    <P>It would have been unthinkable also even six months ago that an assembly of these staff-student committees could become a sort of parliament meeting together to discuss crucial issues as to how the college is run.  These developments have changed the atmosphere in our college in a way which was unthinkable two years ago.  The universities today are quite different from what they were.  The whole idea of what a university is for is changing.</P>
    <P>There is a desire among staff and students alike to recreate in some form the community of scholars which universities were in mediaeval times, a desire to recreate a sense of sharing in this process of expanding knowledge and of passing on knowledge.  On the part of the students there is a desire to participate fully in the running of the institution in which they play a part; the staff have been alerted to the needs and desires of the students which may at times seem to be dramatic or even melodramatic in the way in which they are presented.</P>
    <P>Personally, I can say that having passed through the events of February and March in my college my experience at that time was different from any which I had ever previously known.  To find oneself in a situation in which people broke out of their normal relationships and established new types of communications with each other; to find a situation in which most of the staff of the college, not all, sat down to discuss with students the problems of how the university should be run and discussed it together in a constructive manner was something completely new.</P>
    <P>We are in a new era in our universities. The transition will be difficult.  It will be difficult for us to find our place in a new relationship but the effort will be rewarded and nothing should be done at this point to disturb this transition. Nothing should be done to weaken the authority of the existing bodies who have to carry the process through, but to extend the life of any of them at this stage would be a mistake. The Minister should have regard to <Col N="435" /> these facts when considering the position.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the governing body of the college have decided that there shall be an election and not to seek from the Government any further extension. I am glad that an election will take place, although I know that because of the antiquated constitution of the governing body, the governing body that will emerge from that election will be in many respects unrepresentative. However, it will be possible for them to take a step towards a new type of university structure, for example, using their power of co-option to co-opt students to the governing body.  By taking this decision not to extend its own life, the governing body have taken the first step towards student-representation on its own councils.  Had the governing body taken a decision similar to the kind of decision being put to us in this Bill to prolong its life, again because this mythical merger is about to take place, the governing body would find themselves precluded by law from having students on their councils during the year 1970.</P>
    <P>I am glad that this has not happened. It would be a pity if we in this House should, even in relation to a body that has less direct involvement in the college, take a step that would preclude the representation of the new tide of opinion on the Senate and make it more difficult for the Senate colleges to appoint to the governing body these new type of persons who would be able to bridge the gap between students and staff on the one hand and between the administration of the colleges on the other hand.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister not to press this point.  Let us have the Bill by all means if it is necessary to remedy an unintentional legality but let us not use this Bill to prolong the life of a body which needs to be re-elected, which needs to have the opportunity of being replenished with people who know something more directly of the new tide of opinion within university affairs, a new body which also would in choosing its representatives in the governing body of UCD take account of this tide of opinion, a body that <Col N="436" /> would be more representative and one that would be more likely to command the support of the students than the governing body we have today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy FitzGerald, I do not rise to oppose this Bill since its legal necessity is obvious to all but I do feel, like him, that this is an extremely depressing and regrettable Bill.  The Minister in his speech described it as a simple measure and I suppose that is what it is.  It is not in itself a significant Bill but it is an unfortunate Bill because we are being asked casually this evening to perpetuate an ancient order, an order that should have passed.</P>
      <P>We are being asked to put something into operation in substantially the same form in which it worked in 1908 in the days in which the universities were the prerogative of the rich and of the fee-paying classes.  This is no longer so.  The taxpayer now subsidises the universities and it is consequently sad that we, as representatives of the taxpayers of Ireland, should be offered so barren and even so temporary a measure as this which simply says &ldquo;Give us another year's life&rdquo; rather in the way the Parliament of Charles I endlessly gave itself more life.</P>
      <P>Now that we pay for our universities it is only right that we adopt a more constructive and more substantial approach to them than is represented in this measure.  They are the property of the taxpayers, the servants of the taxpayers and, even though it may sound unpopular to some of my colleagues in Trinity College, I do not exempt my own college from the failings of being in some ways an antique institution requiring reform and requiring reform initiated in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to follow Deputy FitzGerald quite so fully into the labyrinthine depths of the merger.  The Deputy's speech has made quite clear that the Minister has inherited what has been described in another context as a bed of thorns but the Bill itself is sad for yet another reason: it is evocative of a general policy of delay and deferment which seems to have settled over the educational policy of the Government.  It seems to be evocative of the fact that the Government <Col N="437" /> recognise, as we all must in our secret hearts, that the bright hopes of a few years ago are grinding to a halt and that our approach to higher education in this country is in a sort of dissipated mess from which no Minister seems able to disentangle any form of optimism or any form of inspiration.</P>
    <P>We are being asked to perpetuate an institution which two and a half years ago on the 18th April, 1967, the Government, in the words of the late Minister for Education, announced their intention of dismantling.  I, for one, apart from being a socialist, a believer in the merger and in the view that a university is the servant of the community was, as secretary to the Association of University Teachers, closely involved in the attempts to make these hopes come true.  Two and a half years later they had not come true.</P>
    <P>Today, as the Minister says, this simple preamble which he has given here to the Bill is sopped through with apologetic phrases which cover a multitude of unfinished business, not merely the sentences which Deputy FitzGerald quoted with particular reference to the provision to be made in Dublin, whatever that means&mdash;and apparently we cannot ask.  This Bill does not prejudge the future provision for higher education generally, whatever that is, and again we cannot ask tonight what it is. At present, the Higher Education Authority is engaged on preparing recommendations that will affect the future university structures.  Again, we cannot ask what those recommendations are.  That body has been sitting since last summer, so far as I can recall.  We do not know the terms of reference of that estimable body quoted here by the Minister.  I am in order in referring to the 15 good men and the fine chairman.  I respect those men. The fact that their choice for that function was apparently coincidental with their total agreement with the policies of the Minister of the day is apparently irrelevant.  The fact that the terms of reference of that body are unknown is also irrelevant.  The fact, in the famous phrase used by the Minister's predecessor, that they took their jobs in the context of the assumption that what has been decided has been decided and the fact that the meaning of it has <Col N="438" /> never been explained to us is also irrelevant.  In the context of all these unanswered questions they are apparently still thinking and will continue to think until the millennium.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an important Bill for another reason.  It highlights the fact that education in general, and higher education in particular, will be two of the key topics of the Nineteenth Dáil. It emphasises the importance of the Minister for Education.  I congratulate the present Minister on occupying his position.  The Government have quite rightly emphasised the importance of that Minister by the appointment of a Parliamentary Secretary to him.  I congratulate the Deputy who has taken that office and I wish him well in it. They will be subjected in their offices to many of the pressures we are familiar with in this country if they seek to answer the questions which they do not answer in this short piece of paper before us here.  They will be subjected to many pressures from strange people, and not just from the bishops.  I have nothing against bishops, rumours to the contrary notwithstanding. Some of my best friends are bishops.  They will be subject to pressures from different groups like the doctors in the Mater Hospital and in St. Vincent's Hospital.  We had Deputy FitzGerald never quite remembering whether he is Deputy for Dublin South East or Deputy for University College, Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Half of UCD is in Dublin South East.  In the face of these pressures I hope that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary will take the relevant and right decisions.  One of the reasons why this Bill is before the House is that the present Minister's predecessor, for whom I have great personal affection and admiration, had an uncomfortable unwillingness to take unpopular decisions.  To stray from the bounds of relevance, that reminds me of the Government's attitude to the Buchanan Report.  We can never be quite sure whether it is on or off.  It is on where the news is <Col N="439" /> good.  It is on, for instance, in Letterkenny but it is off in other parts of the country.  The same can be said with respect to higher education.  The Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary will be faced with these decisions.  I hope they will have the courage to take them and to resist the pressure of people like the medical bodies who resent the structures of the decision taken on 6th July.  They resent them in a different manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say something else which arises from the Bill.  We are taking a decision affecting the structure of the universities.  My comment is about a phrase which has been often heard in the past two years.  The phrase is &ldquo;university autonomy &rdquo;.  The words &ldquo;autonomous university &rdquo; are used in the Minister's speech.  I would like to say words of comfort to the Minister in this regard.  I am quite sincere in saying that I, for one, have no tremendously high opinion of academics as such.  Some of them are quite decent people, like myself and Deputies FitzGerald, Keating and O'Donovan.  On the whole, academics tend to be conservative people and to resist change.  I would like to stress this point which I think justifies the suspicion of resentment which the academics of Ireland have taken to the situation which this Bill epitomises. The first point is that, as in so many other fields, the Government have brought this strange situation on themselves by failure in consultation. Academics may not be superior to other people, but in general terms they are not inferior.  They are entitled to be consulted about their fates, destinies and job opportunities.  On the whole, they were not so consulted.  The famous statement of the Minister's predecessor made on 6th July, 1968, was shown to myself and to some other representatives of academic opinion in the Irish Federation of University Teachers on the night before its publication.  We were grateful for this.  To some extent it was a precedent and an innovation, but it scarcely constitutes consultation. We were handed a document already agreed for publication and asked to check, in effect, to see that the typography was accurate.  This brought <Col N="440" /> a tide of rather new, stubborn, often ill-informed, inaccurate and unfortunate resentment of the Government's initially popular proposal.  In one sense, the academics are themselves to blame &mdash;and again I make myself unpopular with some of my friends by saying this. They are somewhat at fault themselves for failing to grasp the opportunity of history which the late Deputy Donogh O'Malley saw for them.  The Government, in my opinion, stand condemned to the extent that the necessity to introduce this measure here tonight arises partly from the fact that at no point were the people most deeply involved in this particular area of human activity properly and intensely consulted.  The assembly of some car parts would have been managed with more dignity, care and consultation than the decision about the merger of the two governing colleges.  No wonder the thing has dragged.</P>
    <P>I have another point to make which arises from the reference to &ldquo; the autonomous universities &rdquo;.  The Minister has a problem to determine what is worthwhile in the autonomy of an independent university.  Some statements made during this general election and during the recent referendum campaign which preceded the election did not exactly suggest that the members of the Government valued university autonomy particularly highly.  I myself was the recipient of some remarks which seemed to suggest that autonomous university academics were a species best liquidated in some indescribable manner.  The bodies which we are discussing are ultimately the major repositories of intellectual freedom of our country.  Much good has come out of them.  We should treat them with more dignity than to meet here tonight and casually to perpetuate an ancient form.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn very briefly to something which Deputy FitzGerald said.  I will not follow him into the depths of the merger.  On it, to a great extent, he and I are in greatest agreement.  In one way we disagree.  His references to the social status of the students of Trinity College and to the allocation of medicine and law to Trinity College are inaccurate.  I must place on record that his remarks are inaccurate.  I will <Col N="441" /> not follow him into them.  I know I speak here not as a representative of Trinity College but as a representative of Dublin North West.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as I am here the interests of Trinity College will be looked after.  Many of the things that Deputy FitzGerald was referring to&mdash; that point he put&mdash;are among some of the pressures the Minister will have to resist.  I do not want to delay the House much longer.  Let me say here, and I do not want this to sound patronising, that to many of you the university is a strange world full of strange birds, queers and things like that, as they have been described.  If you look down this interesting document, the method of election here, I would like you to bear in mind it is talking about people and those people have as much right to have their feelings considered as workers by hand or brain in any other industry.  Because of the incapacity of the Government to fulfil their intentions, placed on record in April, 1967, a total question mark has hung over the livelihood and the intellectual context of the people who work on the staffs of each one of the five Irish colleges&mdash;and indeed Maynooth as well to the extent that it may well, and I hope will be, associated with any merged Dublin University of the kind which I hope will come into existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, because of the incapacity of the Government to solve this problem, there are at the moment students going into the Dublin colleges who do not know whether the courses they are following will still be there in three years time, by the time they come to complete them, who do not know whether they will still be where they are now, who do not know whether they will be taught by the people who now teach them.  I respectfully suggest this is just not good enough.  Those people are entitled to something more than that.  Applicants to my own college for courses like social study come to me and say:&ldquo; Will it still be there by the time I graduate?&rdquo; I think this is a fair question.  The Government <Col N="442" /> should accelerate the tempo of their decision making.  I associate myself with Deputy FitzGerald in hoping that the extension of the life of the Senate of National University embodied in this Bill will indeed be a brief one, even though the form of replacement which I envisaged would probably be closer to that envisaged by the Government than envisaged by Deputy FitzGerald.</P>
    <P>I should like to associate myself with him also in another thing which arises from this list of eminent and respectable gentlemen, which is almost incomprehensible in itself and which is probably being made even more incomprehensible by the speeches of Deputy FitzGerald and myself.  If you look down that list of gentlemen you will find a cumbersome, unworkable, unrepresentative, undemocratic, unwieldy body.  You will also find a body which, as he says, contains no student representative.  I think it is unnecessary for me to labour that point except to associate the Labour Party most totally with what he has said.  While we cannot endorse the wildness of some forms of student violence as practised on the Continent, and indeed as practised to some extent in our own country&mdash; though more in Deputy FitzGerald's university than my own&mdash;while we cannot go that far, it is obvious that no future constituents of the university can have the kind of structure outlined here.  There must be a place for the students in it.</P>

      <P>If we could return <Col N="443" /> from that brief trip to Cuba&mdash;in return I promise I will not mention the Blueshirts&mdash;may I say again I hope the Minister will not merely allow this to be a short-lived provision but that when he comes to the structure of the new body which takes its place, if one does, he will make sure it is a small and workable body and not one in which distinguished men drive great distances at infrequent intervals to do absolutely nothing.</P>
      <P>Now, let me draw together what I want to say about this.  A could of doubt, as I said, hangs over the whole of higher education in Ireland and this simple measure epitomises that could of doubt.  We just do not know what the intentions of the Government are and, to do the Government justice, I do not believe they know themselves. In a sense this is an enabling Bill of a rather curious kind.  As it says, it does not in any way prejudge the future provisions of higher education generally. Fully translated this means that the Government by this Bill keep their options open to do anything or nothing about higher education within the next 12 months.  That is not really good enough in 1969, two and a half years after that declaration.</P>
      <P>Let me say three brief last things. This Bill solves nothing.  The Minister and the Dáil, to the extent that the Dáil as the representatives of the people of Ireland are the supervisors of higher education, face three appalling challenges.  The first is that we must cherish and retain that part of the university autonomy which, as I said, is invaluable in any free society, which we must always give due respect to; we must have that freedom of idea and freedom of criticism in a free society and we must never take it away because we read scare headlines about Maoists, Trotskyists or anything else.  We must retain that if we are to be a country dignified enough to call itself democratic and free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, we must make the universities of this country democratically, representative not merely of the students, who should be included as well, but representative of the junior <Col N="444" /> staff.  Deputy FitzGerald did not make that point, but I am sure he would agree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did make it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  On that point I was not listening to the Deputy. It must be representative of the junior staff as well.  Finally, and most important, we must in the lifetime of this Dáil, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, make our universities the property of the nation, as they have never been, and stop them being class enclaves, which Deputy FitzGerald's university is as much as mine is and which all universities are.  It is tragic to me to walk around the streets of parts of Dublin North West, which is largely a working-class constituency&mdash;streets of parts of Cabra, for example&mdash;and to look at smiling young children, beautiful children, and feel the university will never be relevant to their lives under any circumstances.  They will be lucky if crammed, overcrowded secondary schools are relevant to their lives.  We have got to stop that.  We have got to make our universities democratic, which this one is not.  We have got to retain their freedom but, above all, we have got to give them to the people so that they can enter them on merit and plough back into the service of this nation the skills and abilities which God gave them and which at present are being thwarted and obstructed in the slums of Dublin.  I do not oppose this Bill, as I say, but I find, like Deputy FitzGerald, it is an intensely depressing and inadequate one.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it very interesting to listen to my academic friends in their long speeches on this subject but it might be no harm if we asked ourselves what is at issue in this Bill. We all know the university question is one of the important matters which will, before the end of this Dáil, come before us.  I see nothing wrong with the Government keeping their options open at this stage.  It is a very good thing that their options should be open to see what is to be the solution for this university question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill does no more than continue the <i>status quo</i> in order that a thorough <Col N="445" /> solution may be found.  Now, I ask Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Thornley do they advocate a piecemeal solution.  Any delving into the issue at this stage or any dealing with a facet of the problem at this stage can only result in a piecemeal solution.  I, for one, would oppose that.  I do not want to follow my friends in a long discussion about where the universities are going and what they have been.  I will just point out that this Bill is simply aimed at continuing the situation here until the answers can be found.  For my own part, I do not think this Dáil can dissolve before these answers are found.  First of all, Deputy FitzGerald, I think, and Deputy Thornley talked about structure.  Are they thinking straight in this?  Surely, if we had a Senate election in the morning or in October we should get the same structure? It is totally irrelevant at the moment to talk about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There is really nothing to be gained by having an election if we are going to change the whole structure in a short time.</P>

      <P>This Bill proposes to carry on the existing set-up for a period.  From my point of view, I should prefer to see it that way than to rock the ship with further perturbations at this moment.  If we are going to reorganise, surely the thing to do is to take the problem as a whole? Actually, it is quite clear, as far as I can see, that, on the last analysis, neither Deputy FitzGerald nor Deputy Thornley will be very strong in their opposition to this Bill.  They will find the formula by which they will accept it, albeit it is a formula.  I might add that the formula was the excuse for the talk.  Let us get down to realities, if that is so, and simply face the situation.</P>
      <P>There is nothing more in this Bill, for all the things that have been said, than a proposal to continue an existing situation until the problem as a whole is resolved.  There is every earnest and every reason to believe that this will happen very quickly.  I do not think there is anything else to be said.  If I were to expand on this subject, I should be joining in the type of thing for which I am criticising my friends.  The best example I can give is to stop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all earnestness, I would suggest, in finality, that this university situation is complex.  It needs looking at in the modern context, to use these clichés, this current coin, if you like. There are a number of faces to this. Overall, there is the point of view of our universities surviving as universities in the world picture of university life.  This is something that must engage all our attention seriously.  It is not something that can be relegated merely to the state of being a football for political play.  If that is so, surely the best thing for us to do here tonight is to take this Bill and to pass it on the basis that it is a stage to enable us to clench with the main problem?  I do not think we will help if we drag <Col N="447" /> other issues into it here tonight or talk too much about the admitted complex issues that are in it&mdash;later, yes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As probably the most recent graduate of NUI sitting in this House, I should like most strongly to endorse the remarks of Deputy FitzGerald.  He showed a very deep understanding of and sympathy for what the junior staff and students in our university, in particular UCD, are trying to do at this time.  He showed this sympathy in the case he made against this Bill on the grounds that it granted powers of self-perpetuation to a body which was undemocratic and unrepresentative of junior staff and of students.  I, also, object to this Bill on those grounds.</P>
      <P>It is essential that junior staff and students be represented on the Senate of the NUI.  Any attempt to grant powers of self-perpetuation to a body which does not grant such representation is to my mind quite wrong.  If staff and students are given representation, if they are given a real say in how the NUI is run, these students and staff will be found not in a position of violent confrontation with their professors and with the administrators of the university but in a position of constructive co-operation in developing a genuine university community which would be much more efficient and much more useful to the community at large than is the present university structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Students and junior staff have got particularly useful contributions to make to the running of NUI.  Students are, in the final analysis, the people most closely affected by university education.  They are, so to speak, the subjects of university education.  They are the people who are its product. They are also an articulate and intelligent body of people who will, even at the highest administrative level, be able to make a useful contribution and useful suggestions as to how the NUI, or their particular constituent college, can more effectively and usefully be run.  Most of all, they are the people, for instance, who know if a certain course of lectures is not useful. They know this more than the staff know it because they are the people <Col N="448" /> who have to learn on the basis of these lectures.  I think this can be applied right up through university education, even at the highest level.  Therefore, I believe that, before powers of self-perpetuation are granted to this body, this House should ensure that this body gives proper representation, democratically, to staff and students.</P>
    <P>I believe it is only when students are denied such a real say in the way universities are run&mdash;as they are by the present system of university education in this country&mdash;that they are forced into what may be described as irresponsible action.  If they are treated as responsible people, if they are given responsibilities and powers within their university situation, they will act responsibly.  If, however, they are treated as children, then we can only expect them to act irresponsibly, however much we may deplore their irresponsibility. I appeal to the Minister to bring about the following two reforms as a short-term interim measure&mdash;and I emphasise &ldquo;as a short-term interim measure&rdquo;.  I would ask the Minister to use his powers, as outlined in his speech here, of nominating people to the Senate of the National University of Ireland.  I will ask him to nominate, if possible, four elected student representatives, possibly the chairman or president of the various SRCs of the Colleges to the Senate of NUI.  Thus we will have at least some minimal student representation.  However, this is only an interim measure and I would ask the Minister when he is considering, as he will be, the overall structure of university education and bringing into effect new structures and new forms of governing bodies and so on to ensure that students and junior staff are given full democratic representation on the bodies which run universities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to express disappointment and dissatisfaction with the introduction of this Bill this evening.  I feel that it is unnecessary because the election of a Senate to the National University is important and I cannot see any proposed legislation coming through this House within the next 12 months which will be of benefit to the whole question of the <Col N="449" /> university merger.  I am not in agreement with the present proposals for the merger of the universities in Dublin and I know that the staffs in both Trinity College and in UCD are basically against the merger as proposed at present.  From what the Minister has said in his introductory speech I think that the merger is not on.  From what he said I think that there will not be a merger of UCD and Trinity and I challenge the Minister to make a clear statement to this effect.  I feel that the recommendation of the Commission on Higher Education that there should not be a merger should be accepted for what it is and that the recommendation to establish independent universities throughout the country is a reasonable and good one.  While apparently we must accept the present Bill as a technical necessity I ask the Minister not to abuse it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald spoke here today as a representative of Dublin South-East but also as a representative of UCD and my colleague Deputy Thornley from the point of view of Trinity.  I find myself in the peculiar and anomalous position of, in fact, being a graduate of both universities, of having, perhaps, a closer relationship with UCD and, therefore, the National University of Ireland in the sense that my first degree was from there and arguably on the other hand a closer relationship with Trinity on the basis that since 1960 it is there that I work.  However, I want to talk about this Bill solely, of course, since we may not discuss the merger <i>per se</i> though apparently we may discuss it in relation to its significance for this Bill.  However, I want to discuss the Bill primarily in relation to things that have already been said and in particular later on in relation to some of the observations of Deputy de Valera.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like first briefly if we could have an opinion as to the suitability of the Senate of the NUI to be continued in office, to have a look at the composition of that Senate, because I want to suggest, as a result of examining its composition, that the need for changing it by election as soon as possible is particularly acute in relation to the composition as it now obtains.  The Senate is made up of 35 people.  Of <Col N="450" /> those 35 one is the Chancellor of the National University of Ireland who will not be subject to change as a result of an election if it is held.  Three of the 35 are presidents of the three constituent Colleges in Dublin, in Cork and in Galway and they will not be subject to election either.  Four are nominees of the Government, including one woman, and while they may be subject to change they will not be subject to the democratic process of election and to the validation which that democratic process gives.</P>
    <P>I want to turn aside now for a moment from the analysis of this Senate to say a word about the way in which the Government have used their power of nomination because we are discussing NUI and UCD as if they were new-minted and as if the Fianna Fáil Government had not been in power one way or another with two very short interruptions for the vast majority of my life and all of the lives of a number of people here with tiny interruptions.  The point is that UCD, as it now exists, and the National University of Ireland as it now exists, are very much the creation of this series of Fianna Fáil governments.  We are asked now to take on trust their benevolence in relation to universities and their determination to change them drastically for the better when we can, in fact, only judge them on the evidence of their record.  The two interruptions by inter-Party Governments were so short as to have permitted no time for serious university reform and I suggest that, in fact, the crisis in the National University of Ireland which now exists, and I do not wish to exacerbate it and I do not wish to make from outside the problem of finding adequate solutions more difficult, but I think we would deceive ourselves if we thought that a real crisis did not exist; to a very great extent that crisis exists because of the action of the Fianna Fáil Government over the years to which I have referred so that we cannot, if we judge them on the basis of their past record, depend on them to produce the drastic solutions which Deputy de Valera promised us on the condition that we will now please leave the Senate as it is.</P>
    <P>I was engaged before that digression <Col N="451" /> on my part in an analysis of the Senate as constituted and I had got to the point of dealing with the four nominees of the Government.  There are a further four persons who are co-opted by the body itself once it comes into existence and these too are validated in the same way as elected representatives are. Finally of the non-elected persons on the Senate there is the registrar.</P>
    <P>The non-elected persons, therefore, constitute 13 of the 35 people on the Senate and without claiming strict accuracy this seems to me about 37 per cent of the whole Senate.  The elected persons on the other hand constitute 22 of the 35, which is 63 per cent or thereabouts.  The point I am coming to is that these 22 are elected in four different ways, perhaps, not in terms of technique but in terms of the place from which they are elected&mdash;six by the governing body of UCD, four by the governing body of UCC, four by the governing body of UCG and eight elected by convocation.  The result is that the 22 elected people will be different in their outlook, in their political allegiance, in their attitude to a university, in their social aspirations. The point I am making is that they will not be a coherent or cohesive group whereas, on the contrary, the 13 non-elected members will, in fact, be coherent and cohesive and will represent a perpetuation of an undemocratic trend and of a settled trend within the Senate of the University.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, arguing that at a time of crisis like this the Senate is in profound need of re-valuation by the process of election and that this need is all the greater precisely because the elected representatives are only 22 of the 35 and precisely because they do not form a coherent group.  As I understand the argument of Deputy de Valera in favour of the passing of this Bill at this time, what he, in fact, says&mdash;I hope he will judge my précis to be a fair one&mdash;is that if we are going to reorganise, leave the composition as it is at the moment because a big reorganisation is coming anyway.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>We are raising the question of Biafra on the Adjournment and the question I tabled on that subject as a matter of urgent public importance because we see in Biafra at present a rapidly deteriorating crisis, a crisis which was already grave&mdash;I hope I can have the attention of the Minister for External Affairs, thank you&mdash;and which has deteriorated very rapidly within the past months.  We are very anxious to know what the Government propose to do in this matter which is of very grave concern to many Irish people both in Biafra and here at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A United States Senate commission headed by Senator James Goodell reported earlier this year its estimate that 1,500,000 people had probably died in Biafra as a result of the war and blockade there.  That commission also estimated that another 2 million might die before the present year is out. Those figures are an adequate index of the gravity of this crisis.  And I do not think we need labour them.  Subsequent to the Goodell commission report there was for a time a certain improvement in the situation.  I was there myself last Easter on a visit as a trustee of the American-Biafra Relief Services Foundation and I had occasion to see on the spot the work that had been done, in particular by the Joint Church Aid people, including Caritas Internationalis and the International Red Cross.  They had then got <Col N="453" /> going&mdash;through the medium of 25 to 30 flights a night coming in from São Tomé and flights also from other places&mdash;an air lift taking in approximately 250 tons of protein foods per night.</P>
    <P>I think we have a right to be proud of the part played in this by Irish people and in particular by Irish missionaries on the spot there.  I should like to mention the name of Father Anthony Byrne who is mainly responsible in São Tomé for the flights from there.  With the aid of those flights the protein famine was brought under control.  There remained in the wings&mdash; and there still does&mdash;the threat mentioned by the Goodell Commission of a further and even more disastrous carbohydrate famine which could not be adequately met by the air lift.  This threat still hangs over Biafra but for the moment it has been superseded by a more urgent threat arising from new actions by the Nigerian Government. The opening of this new phase dates approximately from the 5th of last month when the Nigerian Air Force&mdash; apparently deliberately&mdash;shot down a Red Cross plane.  This was followed by a statement by Chief Obafemi Awolowe, Vice-President of the Executive Council of the Nigerian Government, to the effect that starvation was a legitimate weapon of war. He strongly implied that the policy of the Nigerian Government would be to starve out Biafra.  This was combined in a most sinister way with the assertion by the Nigerian Government of a claim to control all relief activities in both Nigeria and Biafra, that is to say, that relief activities into Biafra would be controlled by people who are bent on a policy of starving the Biafrans.</P>
    <P>This policy has had effect.  Red Cross flights seem to have been almost suspended. Joint Church Aid are endeavouring very bravely and creditably to keep up some flow of supplies for at least the hospitals but flights are down from 25 to 30 per cent per night to six. That means that supplies for civilian refugee centres are cut off.  The implications of this are, of course, terrible.</P>
    <P>The factors which caused the famine in the period before the flights are still there.  An area already as densely populated as the Nile valley before the <Col N="454" /> was has received an influex of people approximately doubling its original population and this population is cut off from its main original sources of protein supply.  So that the return of famine conditions at a rate even exceeding that anticipated by Senator Goodell is mathematically certain unless relief shipments can be very speedily resumed.</P>
    <P>Those were the conditions in which several Deputies tabled questions expressing concern which was very widely and strongly felt throughout this country.  The Minister's reply yesterday was, it seemed to me, cautious and noncommittal. By taking a fairly large number of highly specific questions together he avoided giving specific or precise answers to any of them so far. He indicated that it was unreasonable to expect him to commit himself on important questions so soon after taking office.  That is fair enough up to a certain point and in relation to certain questions but there are emergencies and great human disasters&mdash; and this surely is one of them&mdash;in relation to which a man must commit himself rather speedily or his commitment comes too late to be of any use at all.  This is such an emergency and such a disaster.  It is a disaster that may rank in history with the holocaust of the European Jews.  <i>The Times</i> in London has described it as &ldquo;the greatest crime for which Britain has shared responsibility since the Irish Famine&rdquo;.  Compare the strength of that language with the cool and politic utterances of members of the Irish Government on this subject.</P>
    <P>It will not do, we would suggest, to treat this question on a basis of routine. Above all, it will not do, we suggest, to praise the exertions of the Minister's predecessor in the cause of peace in Nigeria-Biafra.  It will not do for the reason that there were no such exertions. At least we must presume so, as long as we can get no information about what they were.  I put down a question on that subject and got no reply for the reason, I think, that there is none.</P>
    <P>Why, Deputies may ask, should Ireland in particular be expected to do anything?  For several reasons.  First of all because we share in the general <Col N="455" /> human responsibility to do everything in our power to avert a great human disaster.  Secondly, because we are involved already as a people through the efforts of our missionaries and the contributions of so many thousands of ordinary people.  We are, I believe, as a country, the highest <i>per capita</i> contributor in the world to relief in Biafra.  The Government should at last, we think, begin to reflect the concern of the people about this matter. Thirdly, because we have very close relations with the power, Great Britain, which shares with the Soviet Union the responsibility for what is being done to Biafra and Biafrans by the Nigerian Government which is armed to the teeth by Britain and the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>If it is accepted that we ought to try to do something, and I think most Deputies here will feel that and the country feels it, what can we do?  It is a rapidly changing situation, changing at present for the worse, and our opportunities will be changing too. What is needed is the will to take advantage of such opportunities.  That will has been lacking hitherto.  I hope &mdash;I hope very much&mdash;that it will very soon become evident in the new Minister for External Affairs, Dr. Hillery. We do not wish to judge him on his reply of yesterday, but we look forward with great interest to his reply this evening.</P>
    <P>Specific suggestions may be made.  I made one of them about the possibility of using an Irish ship&mdash;and there is an Irish ship in those waters&mdash;to bring a shipment of supplies to Biafra up river, up the Cross river, and that, I think, might be technically feasible and I hope it will be explored.  I do not think the Biafrans would put an obstacle in the way of that and I believe the Government should try to overcome any objections the Nigerians may have.</P>
    <P>Also&mdash;this is, perhaps, the most urgent suggestion I would make, and I hope it will be taken up&mdash;there are, I understand, supplies of food in large quantities at Liberville in Gabon. Africa Concern and Caritas Internationalis are aware of this situation. They are anxious to fly that material in <Col N="456" /> and they could fly it in.  They are still taking the risk of these flights from Liberville.  Now, the only obstacle to that is money and I hope the Minister will cut any red tape there may be and see that the money is made available for those flights.  I am sure if there is need for any facilities from this House in that matter, we unanimously would be prepared to support that to help him to have that food brought in.  I believe at the moment we contribute only to the International Red Cross&mdash; I speak subject to correction&mdash;and I think we should also contribute to Africa Concern and Joint Church Aid so that as this situation changes whichever body is prepared and able to get the food and the medical supplies in, would have the financial means of doing so.  That certainly is one point on which I hope very much the Minister will meet us this evening.</P>
    <P>More generally, a serious manifestation of our concern would help those in Britain&mdash;and there are a good many of them&mdash;who are trying to work for peace and whose concern has been expressed by <i>The Times</i> and many other papers.  What I suggest above all is that the Minister should look into the situation on the spot, and now, to see for himself how we can best help. The Minister knows&mdash;he has shown that he knows&mdash;that there are times in which it is not enough just to work through the regular routine departmental channels.  He has shown this by his decision to visit the EEC capitals instead of just replying on our ambassadors' reports.  He should do the same I think <i>a fortiori</i> for Nigeria and Biafra.</P>
    <P>I believe he should go there himself, to Biafra as well as Nigeria, and not just to Lagos as Mr. Wilson did, as his predecessor once, to his credit, went to the Congo, including Katanga.</P>
    <P>I should mention here, and it is important, that we are at the moment represented on just one side in this war. We have a representative, an ambassador, in Lagos.  We had a representative or consular also in Biafra.  I met him there in September, 1967, on my own first visit there&mdash;Eamon O'Toole who was doing an excellent job there.  When the Americans and the British withdrew their representatives after the fall of Enugu in October, 1967, we, it goes <Col N="457" /> without saying, withdrew our representative too, which followed automatically, as has been the picture all along.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that whatever weight in it may be too late, or our weight in the scale may be too small, to avert utter disaster.  That is quite possible. The Minister cannot be blamed if he tries and fails but the essential surely, a Cheann Comhairle, is to try.  That is what the Government have not yet done in more than two years that this horrible war has lasted.  We hope that we are about to learn from the Minister that he seriously intends to try.  I am not asking him at this stage to commit himself to one side or another.  I can well see that there is force in the argument that, for example, recognition by us of the Biafran Government at this stage might do harm to our people in other parts of Nigeria and might weaken our position as a possible mediator.  I am not, therefore, recommending that step at this stage.</P>
    <P>I am asking him to do something which a new Minister can reasonably be asked to do, that is, to find out for himself what he can do.  If he really wants to find out, I suggest that he must go there or send a personal representative if he wishes or, if he likes, a Parliamentary delegation but, at any rate, do something to lift it out of the present level of stately exchanges through channels while people continue to die.  There is no use in relying on reports from Lagos and still less use in these background briefings in London, the only purpose of which is to put as much blame as possible for the tragedy on to the shoulders of the Biafrans themselves.  We have heard too much of that.</P>
    <P>The official British position on this is very much that of Edmund Spenser at the time of a not dissimilar event, the Desmond Rebellion in this country in the Elizabethan period, when he described the hideous suffering of the rebels who were starved into submission at that time and added complacently at the end: &ldquo;They died of the extremity of famine which they themselves had wrought.&rdquo;  Up to now that, or something like it, has not only been the British position but essentially, I am ashamed to say our official position also.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="458" /> I imagine the new Minister must at least have some doubts about that.  I am glad to hear that he is going to see the representatives of our missionary organisations and I believe that what they say is likely to increase his doubts.  There is only one effective way of setting these doubts to rest and that is to go there or at least send somebody there, somebody of leading position.  If anything effective is to be done, a Cheann Comhairle, to avert the extremity of famine and disaster there may not be much time left.  I hope the Minister, in his reply, will show above all, a sense of urgency.</P>

I felt that a new Government were entitled&mdash;even with continuing personnel&mdash;to have a review of all policies, to examine what you are doing, to review events and decide whether this is the way you want to do it in this Government.  For that reason I took the line that I personally would go about making the examination which would guide me in advising the Government on how Ireland should behave in this situation of the Nigerian war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not to be taken, as some Deputies took it, as being too deliberate and too delaying.  We have already <Col N="459" /> a policy which has been decided by the Government.  It is not the policy of Deputy Aiken.  This is a Government policy, decided on after full examination of all the information the Government could gather together and the Government decided on it.  It was not a personal policy of Deputy Aiken's.  It was Government policy.  If I had time &mdash;ten minutes is not a lot for this complex problem&mdash;I would explain the position more fully.</P>
    <P>There were two main considerations in forming Government policy.  One was the belief that the development of new African countries should take place along lines of peaceful evolution, that as far as possible there would not be any further intervention in their affairs by outsiders.</P>

      <P>I do not know if I will be able to give a fair account of our attitude in ten minutes.  I undertake to discuss this problem at any time.  I know this cuts across tribes and, perhaps, natural boundaries and so on but we did hope that negotiation and peaceful ways of forming new countries would be the way and that there would not be a succession of cruel civil wars to decide what natural boundaries would arise in the African Continent.</P>
      <P>The other consideration was our concern to safeguard in every way the excellent relations which have always obtained between this country and Nigeria particularly, I think the House will appreciate, with a view to making it possible for our missionaries and medicals to continue in the future the excellent work they are doing in all parts of Nigeria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, the Government have a right to decide on their own policy and, as I indicated, I have already begun the task of examining this situation with a fresh mind, an open mind.  I had my first meeting with these people yesterday and the days to the end of this week are filled with appointments with, I think, seven or eight representatives of organisations, missionaries, Red Cross and the two sides of the civil war if you like.  This will take up my <Col N="460" /> time for the next few days.  I have no intention, I must say, of making a hasty change in policy.  This policy has been thought out, examined by the Government, and the only reason why I would make a change would be if an examination of the situation, a thorough examination by me, indicated a need to change the policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared to examine it on the spot?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to go anywhere, meet anyone, if there is any help I can give in this situation.  I will make that decision myself.  As I told Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien yesterday, when I make examinations, each examination will probably suggest to me something further I should do and I will follow these examinations with the one intention that, if there is any help whatever that Ireland can give in this tragic conflict, I will see that we give it.  The only real solution for the tragic human suffering that the war entails is the cessation of the war.  However, as long at the war continues we have to take every action open to us to see to the humanitarian relief of the people involved.</P>
      <P>We want to help.  We start off with this attitude.  I listened to the Deputy and I think I have more information than I had before I started but my attitude is still what it was yesterday.  I want to help.  I want this country to do what is exactly right for this country to do.  As far as Deputy Aiken is concerned, I should like to say that since the emergency appeal was first made by the International Committee of the Red Cross over a year ago, when the relief situation became critical, Deputy Aiken got the Government to contribute over £100,000.  I do not know whether I am right in saying this but I think we were one of the first in to help there.  Deputy Aiken, whatever anyone says about him, is a man respected all over the world.  He is a man respected all over the world because of his continued efforts for peace.  He got our Government to contribute £100,000 to the Irish Red Cross for the despatch of food and medicine for the civilian victims of the war particularly in the distressed eastern and south-eastern areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="461" /> In addition, through Deputy Aiken again, our Government pledged £25,000 for any Irish Red Cross medical team going to either side in Nigeria.  The second such team is now working in Abakaliki and additional personnel arrived in Lagos today from Ireland on their way to strengthen that team and I understand further personnel will be joining them shortly.  I would add, too, that the Government are considering, again on the initiative of Deputy Aiken, making a special contribution to the UNICEF Programme for Nigeria-Biafra.  The House knows, of course, that these official contributions or donations by the Government are additional to the very generous donations made by the Irish people through the various voluntary agencies for the same purposes.</P>
    <P>As regards the serious difficulties encountered in recent weeks by the relief agencies I can say that certain actions had been taken, before I became Minister, under Deputy Aiken.  After the shooting down of the Red Cross plane on 5th June, the ambassador in Lagos, on instructions, made a <i>démarche</i> to the Federal Government strongly supporting the Red Cross demand for respect for mercy flights.  After that statement by the Federal Republic on the 30th June, a further <i>démarche</i> was made through the Embassy in Lagos and I quote:</P>
    <P>&mdash;to express the Minister's concern at the interruption of the relief work of the ICRC on both sides of the fighting line not only in view of the possible effect of such interruption on the organisation and procurement of immediate relief supplies for Nigeria but also for its long-term effects in securing help for reconstruction and on the recognised role of the ICRC in war situations generally.</P>
    <P>We fully support the mission, headed by the President of the ICRC, which is now in Lagos trying to find means to continue their work of mercy.</P>
    <P>I want to see the war in Nigeria over.  I think everyone in this House wants that.  My predecessor&mdash;as I said in the Dáil yesterday and I think most of the Eighteenth Dáil know&mdash;exerted every effort to this end and the various <Col N="462" /> moves which he undertook to encourage a peaceful settlement are known to those who want to know them.  Before the conflict began he counselled both sides, as a man of international standing; he asked them to try to solve their difficulties otherwise than by force.  Since the conflict began he took every opportunity &mdash; both personally dealing with Ministers and through diplomatic contacts as well&mdash;of urging the need to have a negotiated ceasefire and a peace settlement that would recognise and support the rights of people in all parts of Nigeria.</P>
    <P>We all feel badly about Nigeria.  We feel badly about this idea of people starving.  We want to help.  To give the Deputy his due, he did not bring in any insuperable difficulties and I must confess I did expect a certain amount of opposition for opposition's sake.</P>

      <P>I should like to quote from a statement issued by the Irish Catholic missionary bodies in December, 1968.  It says:</P>
      <P>The corporate concern of the missionaries must be for the people on both sides.  At present there are 600 Irish missionaries working there &mdash;of whom 500 are in the area under effective federal control.  All of these are working with complete freedom and with the respect and protection of the authorities concerned.  As missionaries, it is neither our wish nor our function to pass judgment on a political situation which is complex and delicate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, the Deputy did not ask me to get into the difficult complex political situation.  This brings me back to what I attempted to do in the Dáil yesterday. I attempted to establish my right as a member of a new Government to <Col N="463" /> examine the situation on which a thorough examination had been done, on which the former Minister had exerted every effort.  As I say, I am willing to meet anyone, go anywhere, if I can help.  My right is to examine it and make my own decision and recommend it to the Government.</P>
    <P>I must confess again that this seems to be the attitude I met this evening. I will continue my meetings over the next few days.  The appointments have been made.  My free time is filled with appointments with people who are interested in this matter.  I have an open mind but I would not like to give the impression that coming into this office I reject what was partially my decision because I was a member of <Col N="464" /> the previous Government.  This was not Deputy Aiken's policy.  It was Government policy.  It was formed in the full knowledge that we could glean.  If there is anything this Government can do I will go any place and meet anyone to help the sorry situation in that tragic country.</P>

      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 15th July, 1969.</P>
