    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether any directorships or other positions in any business or other concern are held by Government Ministers; and, if so, if he will state their nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No Minister holds any position that could reasonably be regarded as interfering, or being incompatible, with the full and proper discharge by him of the duties of his office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say if Ministers are allowed to hold directorships while holding office as Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no ordinance or decree against it but there is a convention and I am satisfied that the members of this Government comply with that convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The convention is still being adhered to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the same convention as obtained when the now President was Taoiseach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same convention as operated when Deputy Costello was Taoiseach and as regards the members of his Cabinet, even though some of them did hold offices, some as lecturers and professors, he said, too, that none of those Ministers <Col N="722" /> had any positions that were incompatible with the proper discharge of their duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the convention been the same for the last 25 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no member of this Government who is governing director of the <i>Irish Press,</i> if that is what the Deputy is worried about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did not have the <i>Irish Press</i> in mind at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to find out from the Taoiseach what is the convention and if the Taoiseach is fully satisfied that all his Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries have given him full and frank answers.  Does he believe that any of them may be holding directorships under the name of &ldquo;Mr. Smith&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mr. A&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mr. B&rdquo; and not revealing that information to the Taoiseach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not conduct an inquisition into the private affairs of every Minister.  As I said already, I am satisfied that none of them has any office or receives any emolument whatever that could interfere in any way with the proper discharge of his functions as Minister.  I was elected president of a golf club last week.  Does the Deputy regard that as being in any way incompatible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach say the precise wording of this convention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no precise wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach tell us what it is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That Ministers are expected as soon as they take office to relinquish any directorships that they have in companies.  That has been done and has always been done, as far as I know.  I do not think there is any precise wording to it.  It is an understanding or convention.  I do not know what the Deputies opposite are trying to get at.  If they have any specific charge to <Col N="723" /> make, let them make it here and we will answer it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach inform the House how many have relinquished directorships since July or since the Government took office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that any one of them had a directorship that they had since July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Had they got them after resigning from this House&mdash;21 of them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been two new Ministers who, as far as I know, never held a directorship in any company.  Therefore, there was no directorship to relinquish.</P>

      <P>Question No. 2.  There are 116 questions on the Order Paper and I would ask Deputies to allow questions to continue as quickly as possible in order to dispose of them.  We have had six supplementaries on this one question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Membership of EEC.</Title>
    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is satisfied that the negotiating committee of the EEC are prepared to deal with Ireland as a separate entity for admission to the Community; if any discussions on these lines have already taken place; and, if so, with whom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreement has yet to be reached by the member Governments of the Six on the opening of negotiations with the applicant countries and on the procedure to be used <Col N="724" /> in the negotiations.  Our interest in securing simultaneous accession with the other applicants is understood and accepted by the member Governments and the Commission of the European Economic Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that it is accepted by the Taoiseach and his Government that any negotiations that take place will be joint negotiations and not separate negotiations?  I further put it to the Taoiseach as a query, is it not a fact that our interest in the benefit that we may gain from membership of the Common Market will be somewhat different from that of other applicants?  It is largely in agriculture that our interest will be and, therefore, does the Taoiseach not consider that separate negotiation as a separate unit on behalf of this State is most eminently desirable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know from where Deputy Esmonde got the assumption that there would be joint negotiations.  There will not be joint negotiations.  There will be separate negotiations.  The proposal of the commission is that there would be initial negotiations on accepted procedures as a first phase and on the common policies already agreed and the second phase would be envisaged, that would be, the procedure involving mainly Ministers who would at that phase confirm the results of the first phase and concentrate then on political problems such as those imposed by enlargement of the community, institutional problems and consequential amendments in the text of the treaties. These are envisaged as being separate negotiations but the main purpose is to ensure that there would be simultaneous accession and, again, the commission, in its opinion published on 1st October, envisages simultaneous accession as well.  As far as our separate interests are concerned, that is, the separate interests of the applicant countries, the Deputy can be assured that we will pursue our separate interests to the fullest possible extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the information that must be available to the Taoiseach from the countries of <Col N="725" /> the Six through our representatives there, would the Taoiseach care to hazard a guess as to whether, in fact, we will become a member in the near future and would he, like his predecessor, care to name a year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems to me to be a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a separate question but, as the Deputy is aware, a summit meeting, that is of the heads of Governments of the Six, was due to take place in mid-November.  That has now been postponed until early December.  I cannot hazard a guess at this stage as to when negotiations will be commenced after that date.  Certainly it will not be before next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Taoiseach has no idea as to whether or not we will be admitted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to negotiate our entry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach remember eight or nine years ago when everybody in Dublin was talking about going into the Common Market the next year and, when people like myself said we would not be in for an age, we were laughed at?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  But nobody in Brussels, Paris or Rome would have hazarded a guess then as to when we would be in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that the Common Market is rather like the common mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy opposed to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This may have been affected by a recent reduction of levies to some European countries.  It is probably not a long-lasting arrangement. While that reduction might reflect at present some higher price capable of being obtained elsewhere than is capable of being provided at home I think the prices being obtained at home are better in the long run and sustain the trade that has been taking up the sows, one month with the other round the year, for years past.  If we were to dissipate the outlets by spasmodically allowing the raw material for sausage manufacture and other such trade to disappear then perhaps we would be left with the sows and no export outlet for them or, if there were, not at a remunerative price.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy's question refers to the release of non-reactor cattle from herds in which the <Col N="734" /> presence of either tuberculosis or brucellosis has been established.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, these animals have been exposed to infection and may well be incubating the disease.  It is essential therefore to ensure that they do not move to other herds until further testing shows that they do not carry the risk of infection. Otherwise there would be a very serious danger of the spread of disease.</P>

      <P>Full-scale eradication of brucellosis&mdash;that is, blood testing of each herd followed by slaughter of reactors&mdash;was started in County Donegal in May, 1966.  The county was declared brucellosis-free in June, 1968, and animals from clear herds in the area have now full brucellosis-free status.  Testing commenced in Counties Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim and Sligo in December, 1966, and I would hope to be able to declare these counties brucellosis-free when the round of testing now in progress is completed by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The building of an extension to the brucellosis blood testing laboratory necessary for any extension of eradication measures is now virtually completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Preliminary measures have been taken in other areas.  The calfhood vaccination scheme was introduced in 11 counties, including the main dairying counties, in June, 1965, and by November, 1967, when it was suspended because of the foot and mouth emergency, nearly 600,000 calves had <Col N="736" /> been vaccinated with Strain 19 against the disease.  This has now been replaced by the heifer vaccination scheme, which came into operation last March in approximately the same area.  In this scheme, the recently developed 45/20 killed vaccine is used, and two injections of the vaccine are given.  The use of Strain 19 has been discontinued.  So far, 109,000 animals have received their first injection under the scheme.</P>

In the latter part of the reply I have just given &mdash; that is, in relation to the brucellosis (certified) herds scheme &mdash; any man outside the areas I have mentioned where we have started the scheme proper who wishes to get on with the eradication of brucellosis will be facilitated.  After he has done a little bit for himself in such circumstances, we will then come in and do the final two tests free and any reactors found will be taken up and compensated for in the normal way as applies in <Col N="737" /> areas of eradication where we are operating.  The point must surely get home to some of these people that only five herds in the entire country, outside the test areas, have made any attempt to avail of this very useful scheme to date and this is most disappointing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the position arising because of the high level of expected expenditure in the current financial year on grants already approved under the scheme in relation to the funds available to my Department is still under review, I am not yet in a position to indicate when further applications for grants can be approved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that large combines from England are ready to buy all the tomatoes we can supply if we can ensure continuity? There are large supermarket operators prepared to do this and in view of the fact that these grants have been cut off at this stage surely it is not conducive to the advancement of the industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say they have been cut off; they may have been curtailed because of the fact that the total overall provision made at the beginning of the five year period, which was announced as being the term for the scheme, was exceeded quite considerably some time ago, despite the fact that we are only in the third year of the five year term.  There was a greater uptake of the grants than could have been foreseen or was provided for.  My problem and the problem of the Government is how far further financially we may go in providing grants on the basis on which they have been available, or on some altered basis, for the next couple of years which will give us the five year spread.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly one revision is very necessary and that is that £500,000 was provided and we have already paid out £800,000.  This in itself calls for revision and is one of the reasons why I have replied as I did to this question.  Further applications must be looked at in the light of the whole circumstances of the scheme, its effects on production, markets and prices and on the economics of tomato-growing to those in the trade as well as in respect of people in the future.  All these factors must be taken into consideration.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if CIE are subject to the Planning Acts; whether permission was sought and granted in respect of the cement depot at the railway siding at the junction of New Cabra Road and Carnlough Road, Cabra, Dublin; and whether permission was given in respect of any other cement silos in Dublin supplied by CIE rail service.</P>

      <P>CIE are subject to the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  By virtue of section 15 of the Town and Regional Planning Act, 1934, which was in operation at the date the development referred to was commenced, it was exempt from planning control.  It would also have been exempted development under the 1963 Act.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware of the extreme nuisance and noise caused by the 24 hour shift of heavy lorries coming and going from a cement plant at Cabra, Dublin; and of the numerous complaints which have been lodged regarding this nuisance from the local residents; and what action he intends taking to remedy matters, bearing in mind the aggravation this system of work is causing to the traffic problem at the Phibsboro Road and North Circular Road junction.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that operations at the CIE cement silo <Col N="745" /> at Cabra Road, Dublin are causing great disturbance to residents of that area; and if he will ensure that these operations will in future be carried out without causing any nuisance to local people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take questions Nos. 27 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>I have received no complaints that the operations of CIE at their cement depot at Cabra are causing nuisance through noise and disturbance.  If the matters complained of are due to the driving of vehicles or are caused by the use of defective or badly loaded vehicles in a public place, the matter is one for the enforcement of the relevant Road Traffic Regulations by the Garda.  Measures to deal with any traffic congestion arising would be for the Dublin Corporation and the Garda.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister now accept this complaint of mine as an indication of complaints about the silo? People have probably made the mistake of sending complaints to CIE or to the Minister for Transport and Power but the Minister may be assured that local residents are much concerned about this matter and have asked me to complain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if there has been any cut back in the allocation for local authority housing from his Department to Cork Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no reduction in the amount of capital being provided to Cork Corporation for local authority housing.  On the contrary, the amount of capital provided each year for this purpose has been increasing steadily and at a substantial rate.  In this connection I would draw the Deputy's attention to my reply to Deputy Barry's Question No. 75 of 23rd ultimo in which I pointed out that I had already notified the corporation of an increase of £300,000 in the total amount of £2.3 million provisionally allocated this financial year for local authority housing in Cork city.  The <Col N="746" /> revised total of £2.6 million compares with totals of £1.2 million in 1968-69 and £475,000 in 1967-68.  A formal request from the corporation for further capital for local authority housing has since been received in my Department and is under consideration at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the allocation of some £900,000 by his Department for housing in Cork city still falls short by some £600,000 of meeting the planned housing programme of Cork Corporation? Would he further agree that the city manager had no option but to defer a scheme of 109 houses at Ardmanning, another scheme of some 40 houses at Lansdowne and that he also had no option because of the non-availability of funds sought from the Department but to defer the completion of land purchase in Cork for essential housing needs?  Would he not agree that there has been a <i>status quo</i> situation as regards financial contributions injected into the position in Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation is not £900,000; it is £2.6 million, which is almost three times the Deputy's figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that his figure of £2.6 million includes money allocated to the NBA which, on the terms of contract with the NBA, was outside the normal housing allocation for Cork Corporation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>But that is including the NBA.  Does the Minister not agree that originally they were supposed to provide their own finance, not out of the local government funds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That was in the terms of the contract advertised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure is £2.6 million for local authority housing in Cork city as against £1.2 million in the previous year.  It is not a cut back in the allocation of money for local authority housing; it is the opposite. <Col N="747" /> It is three times as much as Deputy Desmond thinks it is.  A request for a further allocation is under consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will give details of Dublin Corporation's house building programme for 1970; and how far this will go towards easing the present urgent housing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of the corporation's housing activities in 1970 will be determined by their present overall housing programme.  At the 30th September, 1969, they had, in their weekly tenancy programme, 2,276 houses and flats being built or ready to be started; new schemes were being prepared for 2,533 dwellings; and sites had been acquired or were being acquired for 5,030 dwellings.  In their purchase houses/private sites programme, they had 1,802 dwellings in progress or ready to be started, were preparing plans for some 3,053 dwellings or private sites and were <Col N="749" /> acquiring sites for another 6,000.  Over 4,000 weekly tenancy or purchase type dwellings were, therefore, in progress or ready to be started, while plans were being prepared for a total of over 5,600 dwellings.  At the same time, the number of families on their approved waiting list for rehousing was less than 5,000.  Comparative details are not, of course, available at this stage for their 1970 programme. The corporation will however aim at maintaining this high level of activity, subject to available resources.</P>
      <P>This impressive programme should make appreciable inroads on the housing needs of Dublin city, and, in particular, should enable the families who are at present on the corporation's approved waiting list to be offered suitable alternative housing accommodation within a reasonable period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

Is he aware of this fact and is he also aware that the same families are being debarred from obtaining loans for houses because of their low incomes?

      <P>Before the adjournment last night I was referring to the fact that the Minister in his speech expressed concern about the small number of safety committees set up in industrial undertakings.  The Minister said the number had increased over a two-year period by about 12.  One figure which he did not give and which would have been very useful if he had given it was that in factories in Ireland over the last five years there have been over 11,000 accidents reported.  That does not include, I am quite sure, a number of accidents which have occurred and which have not been brought to the notice of the authorities. This is a very serious matter, because if one divides 11,000 into the number of people employed in manufacturing industry it is only a matter of a few <Col N="765" /> years until everybody employed in manufacturing industry will have had at least one accident.</P>
      <P>I know that the National Industrial Safety Organisation&mdash;I see they, like everybody else in this country, have adopted the American system of using initials; it is just another set of initials to remember, NISO&mdash;are attempting to increase awareness of the necessity to prevent industrial accidents.  The only thing I do not like about it is the sign they are using, the red triangle; in some countries it could be ministerpreted.</P>

      <P>The question of the recent arrangement about bringing up the pay of lower paid workers has been referred to at length in the Minister's opening statement.  While this was originally intended to do some good. <Col N="766" /> there has been a great deal of hypocrisy about it.  The original idea was to bring the lower paid workers into some sort of relativity with those who are better paid without interfering with the general wage rates.  This was interpreted and subsequently operated in such a way that when the lower paid workers got 25/- a week those who were not originally intended to be included succeeded in getting for themselves up to £3 per week under the same agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in trying to cod the lower paid workers by saying: &ldquo;We are giving you something special.  You are now on your own, and you will probably be nearer everybody else.&rdquo; Those of us who deal with workers, negotiating with employers, know how difficult it is to try to get the pay of lower paid workers somewhere in line with what is being given to their better paid brethren.  We find that as a result of increases granted to people who are already reasonably well paid, the lower paid worker's cost of living goes up and he gets nothing to compensate him for it.  This has turned into a pretty bad joke because the lower paid worker is now the odd man out.  While I agree there are people who would not be included in the category intended to be covered by this originally and who would be entitled to some adjustment in their wages, when it comes to the question of the £4,000 a year man getting an increase because the lower paid workers are getting something special, then the joke is certainly on the lower paid worker.  The aspect of it which I think is particularly annoying is that we have now reached the stage where State employees, having got £1 a week increase, find that before they get it, the Department of Finance takes 7/-income tax which brings it down to 13/- and if they are living in a local authority house&mdash;as many of them are&mdash;because of a special arrangement made by Deputy Blaney when he was Minister for Local Government, which has been carried on since, the local authority collects a further 2/6d out of that £1 increase as a rent increase. This £1 increase firstly becomes 13/- and with the 2/6d rent <Col N="767" /> increase it then becomes 10/6d.  The lower paid worker is told that this increase is to compensate him for the fact that he has been very badly paid. On top of that the stamps are to be increased by 3/6d a week on the 1st January next and this will probably mean an extra 1/6d to be paid by the worker.  We find that the lower paid worker is worse off than he ever was.</P>
    <P>Something has got to be done about this.  The Government have no right whatever to talk about increases for lower paid workers if they are not going to give them something reasonable. Anybody who thinks a man in the year 1969 and 1970 can rear a family on £11 a week does not know what he is talking about.  I would suggest that the new Minister for Labour-look into this.  I know that negotiations were carried out with the trade unions on one side and State representatives on the other and they discussed things very fully, but nobody seemed to understand what was going to happen when the scheme was put into operation.</P>
    <P>We have one case where the Department of Finance only a week ago got sanction from itself for payment of this increase.  I thought this had been tied up before the election took place last June but, apparently, I was wrong.  They are only now in the course of giving the increase to the employees concerned.  I know quite well it would not happen with the higher echelon; it is only the person at the bottom of the line who gets &ldquo;clobbered&rdquo; every time.  On more than one occasion since the agreement was in operation I have had to approach the Minister for Finance for the purpose of getting him to force other people to do what was originally intended.  One Minister I interviewed with a group of my trade union colleagues on the question of wage increases, after listening, I thought, intently to the case being put that women workers should get the same increase as men, blandly came out with the remark that he thought this scheme did not come into operation until after the 1st of April next.  We talk about joint responsibility <Col N="768" /> in the Cabinet for things like this, but here is a case where a Minister did not know, possibly he did not care, and it was only when we referred him to the Minister for Finance that he discovered the scheme had been in operation since the 1st June of this year.  I know there is an attitude in this country of the haves and the have-nots.  It is running right through this sort of thing.  The man working in a river or in a forest finds it very difficult to get even a small increase paid to him once the increase has been sanctioned.  This is not good enough.</P>
    <P>When the scheme was being discussed it was agreed on existing wages without any other change that certain increases were to be given, but the Government Department concerned wrote into this scheme, and I quote:</P>
    <P>These increases have been sanctioned subject to the conditions:</P>
    <P>(1) that where workers are on autonomous rates of pay these will cease, or where there is a link with outside employment this link will now be broken; and for the future, wage movements for drivers and gangers will be related to changes in the basic rate for labourers.</P>
    <P>(2) that incentive bonus, where payable, will for the period 1st June to 30th September be calculated on the pre-June 1969 basic rate.  From 1st October 1969 bonus will again be calculated on full basic wages.</P>
    <P>This was added after the agreement had been made and if we wanted to see these people getting any increase at all this year we had to agree to this blackmail&mdash;there is no other word for it&mdash;which was used for the purpose of trying to force workers to accept less than it was at first intended they should get.  When I look around and see how well some people are paid for doing very little I get very angry when I see other people working terribly hard, doing important work, which nobody wants to pay them for if they can possibly get out of it.</P>
    <P>The onus is on the State to give a substantial increase to these people irrespective of what wage negotiations <Col N="769" /> are carried out at a later date.  I am terribly disappointed at the fact that what was originally intended to bring the lower paid worker into line has turned out to mean that they are given an increase, which having been applied to everybody else, leaves them in the same position, and in many cases in a worse position, than they were before the negotiations started.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot about the maintenance craftsmen's strike.  As the Minister is a sensible man I should like to ask him if he has ever wondered why it is that, when a wage demand is being discussed and an offer is made, or when no offer is made by the employer, the employer sticks his heels in the ground and says: &ldquo;I will not give any more&rdquo;.  The workers were on strike for weeks; nobody wants to tramp a picket line if he does not have to, because there is no pleasure for a worker to be walking up and down outside an employer's premises with a placard on his shoulder knowing that the amount of strike pay will not keep his household for the coming week and also knowing that unless he does not do this his employer is not prepared to see reason.  The position in this strike was that&mdash;as in so many others&mdash;at first not an inch was yielded but, as the weeks went by, further and further offers were made.  I would suggest to the Minister that the final offer could have as easily been made before the workers went on strike as when it was made, when they thought they had them grounded to the dust.</P>
    <P>I should like to sound a warning that some day the workers in this country will get fed up with this treatment of trying to wear them down and absorb whatever funds their trade unions may have: a strike will take place which will rock this country unless a more sensible approach is made by employers to the question of wage negotiations. There are employers who are Members of this House and from time to time I have had the job of negotiating with some of them.  I have always found them quite reasonable because most of them do understand what is a reasonable offer.  But there are far too many people in this country&mdash;the bigger the firm the tougher they think they <Col N="770" /> are&mdash;who will hold the worker to ransom in the hope that they will save a fraction of a penny.  They tell us that production costs will go so high that we will lose our export markets if they give an increase.  Subsequently, when they do give an increase and they do not lose their export markets, we are able to read in their annual reports about the tremendous profits they made during the year.</P>
    <P>Some of these firms caused untold hardship to business and to the workers before they agreed to give a reasonable increase in wages.  This is something that has got to be faced up to.  I know the previous Minister and his officials, with the best will in the world, tried to do something but they did not go far enough.  I would suggest that greater interest be taken in this matter, by the Minister and his staff, because the whole key to the prosperity of this country is the way in which labour relations are handled.</P>
    <P>Let me say something else.  A number of serious strikes have occurred in this country, some of them in semi-State bodies, because, first of all, the person sent to negotiate was the next thing to the messenger boy.  There is no point in that.  If negotiations are taking place and if the trade union send their top men, it is an insult to their intelligence for the other side to send a fellow who, after discussing the matter for a couple of hours, says, &ldquo;I am sorry.  I will have to refer back.&rdquo;  And he refers back to somebody else and that person in turn refers the matter to somebody else and one does not know with whom one is dealing.  Let us face this in a reasonable way.  When negotiations are taking place it is up to the employers to send their top men and matters can be settled across the table.  Every dispute has been settled across a table.  That is the place to settle disputes.  Sooner or later people have to sit down and there has to be given and take.  We do not get 100 per cent on our side.  Let me say, we do not expect to get it.  The employers cannot expect to get away with 100 per cent on their side and they do not expect to get it.</P>
    <P>There is the idea of wearing down trade union funds.  That, apparently, is an idea that many employers start off <Col N="771" /> with.  That should be abandoned because no trade union will be allowed to go broke because of the fact that their funds have been paid out in strike pay. An injury to one is the responsibility of everybody in the trade union movement and we will see to it that nobody will have to go back on his knees to work.  There will be no more 1913s in this country.  As long as that is remembered by employers, we can make a fair effort to negotiate.</P>
    <P>The question of a cooling-off period has been referred to here.  Let me repeat that the cooling-off period should occur before the expiry of the agreement.  Negotiations, on wages particularly, should start much earlier. If the matter is approached in a reasonable way, it can be settled and there is no necessity to have any cooling-off period afterwards.</P>
    <P>Secondly, while we all deplore unofficial strikes and feel that the only way to deal with them is through an organised group on the workers' side and the top men representing the employers, at the same time, an employer who deliberately dismisses a worker without giving him or his trade union an opportunity of discussing the matter, is asking for trouble.  The biggest difficulty that we have&mdash;I have found this in many cases&mdash;is that when a man is dismissed, often in the wrong, it is very difficult to prevent his fellow workers from walking out the gate, declaring that if the man concerned is not going to work they will not work either.  There is no use in trying to persuade men that they are wrong in standing by a man whom they consider to have been unfairly treated.  It is the easiest thing in the world for the employer to suspend a man and for his trade union then to ask the employers to discuss the matter.  There is no trade union who will not, within a couple of hours, have somebody available at top level to discuss matters.  Workers are responsible people and when a case is put to them which they can understand and agree is fair there is no question of trying to bully.  An employer who thinks he can boot a man out the gate first and then start being tough with those who are left is looking <Col N="772" /> for trouble and he will get trouble.  I or anyone else in the trade union movement do not condone the unofficial strike but it is one case in which it is awfully difficult to condemn it.</P>
    <P>We are told of the terrible losses that have occurred as a result of the maintenance strike.  While the handling of the maintenance strike was not perfect on any side, at the same time we must remember that it is very annoying to somebody doing a skilled job and who cannot be done without, in whose absence the job cannot continue, to find people who are doing a far less important job getting two to three times what he is being paid at the end of the week and getting substantial increases without, apparently, even having to bother asking for them. These things always cause trouble. This is a matter that will have to be dealt with in some other way.</P>
    <P>There is another matter with which the Minister has a very slight connection and about which he might talk to his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare.  It is the matter referred to in his speech that there were 12 persons out of work for every one on strike. Of course, there were.  But, do you know what happened those 12 persons? If they were not supported by their trade union, they might starve as far as the Government were concerned because of the archaic arrangement which means that if there is a strike in a job and if somebody is locked out that person is not entitled to draw social welfare benefit.  If men are locked out they are not entitled to social welfare benefit.  Is there any justification for that?  I do not think there is.  If there were a storm or a flood or an explosion in a factory, as a result of which men were laid off, the men can draw social welfare benefit but if there is an explosion in men's minds in regard to something that they consider unfair, then whoever is affected, even remotely, must starve as far as the Department is concerned, the object, of course, being again to dissipate trade union funds by making the trade union pay them strike pay or to starve the people concerned into putting pressure on those on strike to return to work.  In 1969 such things should not <Col N="773" /> happen.  It should not be necessary for anybody to have to do without food for the reason that it is considered that they are connected with a strike from which they will not benefit and which they were not instrumental in starting or continuing.  I suggest that the Minister and his colleague in Social Welfare should have a hard look at this and I am quite sure that they will come up with an answer to the problem.</P>
    <P>We have heard talk about the Trade Union Bill which was to be introduced and somebody here&mdash;I do not think it was the Minister&mdash;got rather confused about the Educational Company judgment and suggested that it would be necessary to have a referendum to change the Constitution for the purpose of having an amendment.  The former Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, in this House gave a solemn promise to me that he would see to it that when the Trade Union Bill was introduced this judgment would be dealt with and the necessary section would be enshrined in the Bill to ensure that what happened then would not happen again. Mr. Lemass was not a fellow who was in the habit of making wild statements and he must have checked with somebody before he made the statement because a month afterwards I challenged him again on the subject.  In the meantime everybody knew that he had made the previous statement and, therefore, there was ample time to correct it.  He repeated the assurance.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions in writing had an assurance that this would be corrected. Yet, we were told it was not included in the Bill that Deputy Dr. Hillery introduced and in the new one that is being introduced somebody has mildly suggested that it will require a referendum as the Constitution would have to be changed.</P>
    <P>That is all a lot of nonsense.  The Minister should make a statement when replying as to whether or not he proposes to honour the promise given by the former Taoiseach.  Does he intend to have the effect of the judgment altered and, if he does or does not, he should let us know why.  There is no reason why the Minister cannot do that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="774" /> There were a number of provisions in the Bill introduced by Deputy Dr. Hillery&mdash;I do not want to deal with them at length&mdash;which could not be accepted by the trade union movement. A new Bill should be introduced which would cover the various points that were objectionable in the previous Bill. It would not be the first time that that was done.  We remember what happened a few years ago.  The Succession Bill was introduced and it was changed twice before it was passed into law. There is no reason why we should not have this done again.</P>
    <P>Numerous references have been made to the question of the increase in the consumer price index, as it is now called, and the effect that this would have on wages or the effect that wages have on it.  Many of us have now reached the stage where we are convinced that there should be some other way of adjusting living costs of the ordinary person because wages increases which are given are usually given, in the case of certain types of workers at any rate, long after the cost of living index has risen so high that the workers are always trying to catch up on what they have already spent.</P>
    <P>I remember some years ago listening to the former Taoiseach talking about a wage increase having affected the cost of living.  It was the famous five per cent increase.  He completely forgot that the increase in the cost of living took place two months before the second phase of the increase in wages became operative so that, in fact, the wage increase could not possibly have affected the increase in the cost of living and, therefore, the reference to it was entirely irrelevant.  So long as prices keep going up there is no reason at all why workers should be prepared to accept wages which do not give them a fair living.  This applies to industrial workers and, when I speak of industrial workers, I included in them agricultural workers.  We are always claiming here that agriculture is our primary industry but, when we come to deal with workers in general, we divide them into two classes, agricultural workers and industrial workers, as if agricultural workers were born into a separate caste.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="775" /> It was suggested that any agreement should run from 2½ to three years. None of us has much objection to that except that it is so very difficult when negotiating an agreement now, which will not expire until the end of 1972, to estimated what the likely increase in the cost of living will be in that period or how the proposed increase will be related to what will be paid in 1972. If one makes an agreement for too long a period and workers find that that agreement does not give them the compensation they expected and also discover that others, who do not enter into a 2½ or three year agreement, have got very much more than they did, there is a very strong inclination to attempt to get some type of interim arrangement.  If that is successful everybody immediately says that the trade unions and the workers are breaking their agreement.  We should always remember that the workers concerned have only one commodity to sell, their labour, and an increase in wages represents to them shoes for the children, a new suit for the man of the houses, a shirt, or something like that.  Even the kind of food they eat depends on what the wage packet is like.  If some of those who are so tough about the necessity for holding down wages did a few trips around the working-class people in this country there would probably be a different outlook on this whole question of wages for workers.</P>
    <P>There is then the question of pension rights.  Recently a rather extraordinary thing happened.  As the Minister is aware, some years ago a pension scheme was introduced for Bord na Móna workers.  It was negotiated between the board and the trade unions. It was sent to the Minister for Transport and Power of the day and it was rejected by him.  Subsequently a very much reduced pension was introduced for Bord na Móna manual workers.</P>
    <P>When it came before this House I proposed a motion that the pension scheme be not ratified.  That was discussed and I always remember the present Minister for Health making the case that the pension scheme was <Col N="776" /> adequate because, added to social welfare benefits, the worker would have 75 or 80 per cent of what he was earning. When I questioned the Minister as to the year in which this would occur he admitted to me he was thinking about the year 2003 because it was a 40-year period.  In the year 2003, the Minister estimated, these men would have 75 per cent of their wages as pension.  This is a contributory scheme and the fund is growing.  Recently those of us who deal with the workers were very surprised to see the following notice in one of the midland papers, the <i>Midland Tribune</i> to be exact, in which it was stated:</P>
    <P>Following representations by Mr. G. Connolly, TD, concerning pensions for manual labourers employed by Bord na Móna the Minister for Finance, Mr. C. Haughney, has written to him that &ldquo;proposals relating to pension arrangements for these workers and the grant of pensions to them have recently been put forward by my Department for consideration by the Department of Transport and Power and Bord na Móna.  These proposals would be advantageous to the pensioners and should be accepted.  Arrangements will be made to implement them as soon as possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here we have the sanctioning authority, the Department of Finance, writing to a Government Deputy in the midlands to tell him they had drawn up a new pension scheme.  Did anybody ever hear such nonsense?  The whole idea was for the purpose of gaining a certain amount of political kudos because neither the Minister for Finance nor his Department had any right&mdash;good, bad or indifferent&mdash;to do any such thing.  If they did have proposals which they thought might be of interest the trade unions were as much entitled to get a copy of those proposals as was the employer side.  We wrote to the Department of Finance and asked them to let us have a copy, but they were very coy.  Eventually they said the matter was not as it appeared.</P>
    <P>My own opinion is that, by some strange chance, something which was being prepared for somewhere else <Col N="777" /> happened to fall on the plate of Bord na Móna because, as the Minister is aware, application has been made for a pension scheme for certain State employees in the Department of Lands, the Department of Agriculture and the Board of Works; I believe the pension scheme referred to was one which someone had cooked up for these particular workers and, by some accident, it was communicated to Deputy Connolly.  I do not know him; I am sure he is quite a decent fellow.</P>

      <P>I believe that this scheme was sent, by accident, to Bord na Móna but was really intended for other types of workers.  It is now being kept a very close secret.  No one can get a copy of it.  Recently we had a Labour Court case because, following the Industrial Relations Bill early in June last, we decided we would try to have some things granted to State employees, things they had not been <Col N="778" /> able to get up to this, and we took the matter to the Labour Court.</P>
      <P>We found an extraordinary situation there: the people representing the State made the case that there was no point in their discussing anything with us at conciliation level because the Department of Finance were the people who would officially sanction whatever it was and, since the Department of Finance were not represented, these others could make no agreement.  If we are going to have that reply given at conciliation level in the Labour Court to claims made for State employees, I would suggest that the Minister should ensure that a representative of the Department of Finance&mdash;not one of the junior clerks but a senior representative who can say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the claim made&mdash;should be present when these things are being discussed. At local authority level, we have discussed numerous things with the county managers, all of them being subject to sanction by the Minister concerned who does not have to have a representative present at the Labour Court in order to find out whether certain things can or cannot be agreed to.  Let us not make a joke of the Labour Court; that appears to be what some people would like to do now.  Let us have an official present from the Department of Finance who would be able to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think that, no matter what we do, we must get a fair type of wage-fixing machinery in this country.  Most of the trouble has been caused by the fact that, so far, the State has been working on the theory that they should not lead. Their story has always been, in effect: &ldquo;We cannot be the leaders in any wage negotiations.  We shall follow behind. We shall pay whatever the best employer pays.&rdquo;  When you start quoting employers with whom one would think they should measure up to, there is always an excuse.  They say, in effect: &ldquo;He is not in the same category as us.&rdquo;  How can you compare the job of the man who is cleaning the road for the country council or the job of the drainage worker, and so on, with the job of someone in industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State, however, always say, in effect: &ldquo;We must ensure that we will <Col N="779" /> not be a leader in this race&rdquo;.  Even the Department of Agriculture usually pay a few shillings above the minimum rate. The minimum rate for agriculture is the amount that the poorest farmer in the country is allowed to pay to the worst man he employs.  The State says, in effect: &ldquo;We pay 5/- a week over that&rdquo;.  That type of approach should have disappeared a long time ago. There is a responsibility on the Minister for Labour to ensure that a fair standard of wages and conditions of work operates in State employment. Then, if there is, the State can say: &ldquo;We cannot be condemned&rdquo;.  So long as we have the State paying the worst wages in the country, giving the least number of holidays and working the longest hours then the State cannot stand up and say that they are giving a fair deal to the workers of this country.</P>
    <P>Again, let me wish the Minister well. I know that, during his period in the Department of Social Welfare, he made an effort to try to straighten out a number of things which needed a lot of attention.  Any time I had occasion to approach him, I found him most courteous and I can say the same in relation to the officials of the Department of Labour.  There is only one complaint in that respect: I voiced it before.  I still believe that the conciliation officers in the Labour Court are not numerous enough.  Secondly, it is wrong that their only line of promotion is out of the Labour Court which means that, having learned their job, they are moved out and somebody else comes in who has to learn the ropes at the workers' expense.  Thirdly, if a case goes before the Labour Court and is discussed at conciliation or at full court level we should not have the position that, three weeks later, we still have not got a recommendation from the Labour Court.  I notice that it does not happen where there is a danger of a strike.  Again, if there is likely to be a big public outcry, the result comes fairly quickly.</P>
    <P>However, if the matter does not appear to cause much concern to the general public-most of us feel that if <Col N="780" /> something does not affect ourselves it is not important&mdash;it can happen that it will not be dealt with as quickly as it might be.  The Labour Court could possibly improve on the speed at which they produce recommendations.  I am quite sure this can be done.  We have very efficient officers at top level and at the Labour Court level.  These are matters that should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to one last point which I omitted to mention earlier.  When the State employees' agreement was being made, I understood it to apply to State employees under a certain level.  Now, it appears that certain State employees are being left out.  I refer to the Department of Defence.  We see advertisements calling for recruits.  We are told on the radio of the wonderful life they will have.  Believe it or not, they will get £8 a week.  Most of them are fairly well-educated now.  What young fellow leaving school will go into uniform for £8 a week?  For many years, the men in the Army are being paid a rate lower than what is being paid to people in jobs outside&mdash;jobs which these Army men would have occupied had they not entered the Defence Forces. The Minister for Labour might consider saying to the Government: &ldquo;A worker is a worker.  Whether he is in the Army or works in the forest, in agriculture or elsewhere, he should be paid a decent wage for the job he is doing.&rdquo;  If that is done and if the worker is paid a decent rate for the job he is doing, then I am sure the example of the State will be followed by many private employers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This new or fairly new Ministry is highly important.  The number of working days lost in this country compares unfavourably with that of most European countries.  Albeit our progress is slow, we are moving forward industrially and, therefore, employmentwise, towards a united Europe.  We need to have our labour relations and our machinery for dealing with disputes, our machinery for proper negotiation of conditions and pay, on a par with the best in Europe and also on a par with British standards.  It does not seem as if, at the moment, we have that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> I wish my friend Deputy Joseph Brennan, the Minister for Labour, the very best of good fortune in his new Ministry which is so important for us but I must point out that the Government have not succeeded in the work they attempted to do.  Trade union legislation is pending: indeed, it should have been produced many months ago. Like many other things, perhaps, it was postponed until after the election.  It was controversial and there would have been dissatisfaction, I presume, on some sides.  In such a situation, nobody can get everything he wants.  Politically, therefore, it was right from the Government's point of view to postpone it.  On the other hand, we are awaiting this new legislation which, in fact, should not have been so postponed.</P>
    <P>We are told now in the Minister's opening speech that if the trade union side and the employer side want to talk to him and to get down to discussing this legislation, he will meet them.  It is a long time since we had the argument about the Educational Company case.  Nothing has happened.  If the Government had taken the bit between their teeth they might have had a tough time; there might have been unfavourable comment from trade unions or employers; they might have been the jam in a rather indigestible sandwich. If they had done their duty to the people as a Government rather than to themselves as a political party, I believe they would have put themselves in that position and would have forced forward an improvement in our labour relations and an improvement in our negotiation procedure which is so badly needed.  Perhaps, I could be criticised for using the words &ldquo;forced forward&rdquo;. I would tend to say that these things must come by agreement rather than by force or pushing of any kind.  The Minister's predecessor played a very careful watching and waiting game.</P>
    <P>The Government played this in a most expert fashion which brought them past an election, an election which had extremely serious connotations in relation to the whole labour problem.  The proposals of the Labour Party had a very serious effect on that election just as the lack of improvement in the industrial situation had the <Col N="782" /> same effect.  If people are not workers they are inclined, when things seem difficult, and things seem not to be looked after, to become more conservative and to support the devil they know rather than the devil they do not know. This was a factor which reacted to the Government's benefit.</P>
    <P>I have studied the Minister's speech and the various steps forward that have been made, such as the initiation of a training system at Shannon, Waterford and Galway, with a further branch at Inchicore, the training for the hotel industry and the new manpower service and all are individual cogs in the machine, matters which should be mentioned in such a speech.  However, they are not matters of major policy, not matters on which the Minister as a politician or a statesman could take a line, not matters which could be described as a major part of a major speech.  The study of manpower was first done in Drogheda, a survey of what exactly full employment meant in terms of a percentage unemployed.  That is valuable information for the Minister so that he can produce a policy and guide the two major sections concerned&mdash;the workers and the employers.  We must remember that we are still producing many goods for consumption at home and that the consumer comes into it also because he is largely the worker himself.</P>
    <P>Matters such as the shortage of female labour and other points mentioned in the speech are very pertinent. There are areas in my own constituency where there is a shortage of female labour.  The question of full employment in the context of the NIEC report is something with which the Minister did not deal fully.  I do not want to be critical of his speech but we need 7,000 extra new jobs each year, according to the NIEC report, to achieve this definition of full employment by 1987.</P>
    <P>Such a performance has never been reached and whatever improvement there has been has not been sufficient. If sufficient has not been done in this regard the Minister and his Department must reach for the heights and if they fail in this regard we will be in the present position as far as projections <Col N="783" /> are concerned.  The target of 7,000 new jobs every year has never been reached from the time of the First Programme for Economic Expansion to compensate for the number leaving agriculture.  If the Minister fails to reach that target or states that the figure was incorrect, we may take it that we are failing in our efforts.  Of course, if he feels that the measures he is implementing will accelerate the effort and that in the years to come we will do better than that, then there may be some hope for the pupils who are about to leave school.  Unless we can do that we are failing.</P>
    <P>The first thing we must say when talking about industrial relations is that the right to strike must be there.  You can bring a horse to the water but you cannot make him drink.  If any of us feels strongly about something, say about our membership of Dáil Éireann and wants to terminate that membership, he would decide to do so.  If a worker feels deeply enough about something&mdash;that he is not going to do his work tomorrow because a fellow worker has been sacked, or because he himself was badly treated, or his conditions were wrong, or his chances of advancement were not sufficient, or his remuneration was not sufficient&mdash;he will withdraw his labour.  Any proposed legislation&mdash;legislation which should have been introduced a long time ago by the Minister's predecessor &mdash;should maintain the right of the worker to withdraw his labour.</P>
    <P>However, there are also the responsibilities. We are in a highly organised society and we will become more organised in the future.  The day when boss and worker were divided by a bowler hat and a soft hat is gone.  They are all in this together and they will become more involved, one with the other.  They must know more about each other and pull together and in this regard there must be far more consultation and there must be far better labour relations between the two sections. There is always in the background the fact that if a person wishes to withdraw his labour he must have that right, just as the employer if he wishes to withdraw his capital, his own <Col N="784" /> labour, and feels deeply enough about it, no matter what the law says he will do it.  There have been cases where that was done.</P>
    <P>I agree with the statement made by Deputy Belton and I think there was a &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; from Deputy O'Donovan when he made it, that children's allowances should not be extended to higher income people.  Any of us with a Dáil allowance and with any other income could be regarded, if you take the Health Act as a guide, as being in the higher income group.  Many of us probably have our children's allowances paid into a bank account each month. When you look at what you spend each day and what it takes to keep the house you find it is a relatively small sum but when you go to the post office on the day that these allowances are paid out and see what it means to the wives of workers who need that extra bit, see them queueing up to get that money, you realise how much it means to them.  If their lot could be improved even by 25 per cent of those who have a greater share of the world's goods and who do not need these children's allowances it would be a very proper procedure to adopt.  While this has to do with social welfare the Minister should mention it to his colleague.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour is directly concerned with the question of a national pensions scheme.  I suppose you could call the contributory old age pension scheme a national pension scheme in one way but there should be the opportunity for the individual employee to increase his contributions if he desires to provide for himself the extra money necessary to maintain his standard of living when he reaches a certain stage.  This sort of thing has been done in regard to the voluntary contributor.  When they go above a certain level of income they are allowed to carry on and pay their voluntary contribution.  This is something that should also be considered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The main plank of Fine Gael policy as regards the Department of Labour is that there must be a contract of service voluntarily entered into by employer and employee.  Within this contract of service there is room for laying down <Col N="785" /> rules and regulations freely accepted by both sides in the event of a dispute. These contracts of service are operating under the aegis of the joint labour committees of the Labour Court.  I am a member of the committee for the provender milling industry.  As I explained before, what happens is that ten representatives of the employers and ten representatives of the employees meet and plead their case to two independent members and an independent chairman, all appointed by the Minister.  When it comes to vote on the motion brought before that body, either by the employers or the employees side, we equalise: if there is an employees' representative absent, then only nine employer representatives vote and <i>vice versa.</i> That means that the judgment of the case is in the hands of the independent chairman and two independent members.</P>
    <P>This has worked extremely well on the basis that for both men and women minimum rates of pay are laid down. There are minimum rates in many areas.  And in my own area a figure has traditionally been added to the minimum.  In this industry the people are paid a bit more than the minimum. They have exactly the same number of hours to work.  There is then the situation whereby a contract is set up for a period of two years and in the last six months of the period, while the two-year contract is still continuing, we are sitting dealing with the future contract of service which will hold for another two years.  In that way we have six months in which to have a series of from six to ten meetings lasting from a half-day to a whole day, with a break for a meal.  We can then discuss without anybody going on strike or any dispute arising the views of the union members on what should be the rates of pay and conditions for the next two years or anything else they want to discuss and also the views of the employers.</P>
    <P>The employers have time to go back to their organisation and at a succeeding meeting give evidence, if they wish, on the profits in the industry.  The union people can go back and furnish examples at a succeeding meeting of <Col N="786" /> conditions and remuneration in comparable employment.  This can all be done in a spirit of communication with no strike notice pending and no row of any kind looming on the horizon. That is the main thing that must happen right across the whole spectrum of employment and until it does there will be difficulties that could be avoided.</P>
    <P>It is not for me to tell the Minister his job in this regard but there are many incentives that can be given both to employers and employees to tempt them into such an arrangement and get them to co-operate.  One means that could be considered immediately is, perhaps, the remission of a small share of taxation, if the Minister for Finance agreed to do so, for firms co-operating with the employees in this regard.  Even on PAYE the employee could get a small extra allowance which might be a few shillings a week or more.  This suggestion would mean that, as has happened in Sweden and other countries, you would have this global attraction of all employees and employers towards contracts of service the main consideration being that future remuneration and conditions of employment could be discussed while contractual employment under arrangements made in the past still continue. These negotiations could go on without all the row and fuss with which we are familiar and without the idea that if a union man comes into the office there must be trouble about.  This must go. Proper participation of workers and employers and proper working out of how best the industry in which they are concerned and the individual firm in that industry can get the most out of it for both sides are matters that must be provided for.</P>
    <P>There can also be provided in this contract of service, voluntarily, without unions shying away from it, a cooling-off period.  There can be machinery provided for discussion as a result of a bargain made whereby a cooling-off period can exist and there can be discussions over that period.  I am wholly in favour of the joint labour committees of the Labour Court.  You may find an employer who says that as a result of negotiations carried out in Dublin he is paying 10s more than he <Col N="787" /> should be paying or is getting one hour's work less per week for the same rate of wages.  This is rare and, in general, employers in various areas whose employments are covered by minimum rates of joint labour committees of the Labour Court are extremely happy with the situation and are glad to send one of their members from each area to Dublin to negotiate a peace in the last six months of the contract of service when workers in their employment are continuing to carry on without difficulty.</P>
    <P>On the question of worker participation and industrial democracy there may be difficulty in relation to the new legislation which the Minister hopes to introduce and which, in my view, was politically delayed until after the election. All sides should look on this in a sensible way.  When I say one thing which might be in favour of one side I do not want it to be taken as being all I am going to say because I want to make several observations.  First, it is quite clear that we must have participation by workers in the firms in which they are employed.  This is an absolute necessity.  The day when the employer was far more economically safe than his workers were is gone.</P>
    <P>We have all seen the old-fashioned businesses in this city in the last ten or 15 years where the great gods of business were the grocery wholesalers. The few who have rationalised their businesses and become cash-and-carry wholesalers or such, continue to exist and, perhaps, have prospered but many of the firms whose names are running through minds in this House as I speak are gone.  They are gone because just like anything, except a gilt-edge share, the shape of their business changed and they did not change with it.  We are facing this all over the broad spectrum of industry and business including the supplies and services trades. This means that the employer is in no more stable position than his employees unless he has reserves tucked away from days gone by.</P>
    <P>Very often, if new industries come forward, the skills of a worker, with God's help, will allow him to move his <Col N="788" /> employment and secure better conditions, perhaps, and better wages than he had with his former employer.  For that reason I make the point that we must have more worker participation. The fact that the new legislation we expect from the Minister and the new concept of looking after industrial relations which we also expect are on the map, even though delayed, is, as has been rightly said by some speakers here a result of the fact that there were rotten labour relations in the State sponsored companies.</P>
    <P>In order to indicate to people that this involvement of workers to some extent in the running of business is necessary and that the very involvement itself would show them how they can best prosper the business and themselves, as a policy measure, we in Fine Gael have stated that we would wish to see worker-elected representatives, as distinct from union representatives or any other group of representatives, on the boards of the State sponsored companies.  I am fully aware that certain union representatives have been on the board of the ESB and other boards for many years.  We are talking about something different.  We are talking about a workers' representative elected from the floor by the workers in the particular concern.  That is as far as we go.  In our opinion, that is as far as wisdom dictates we should go.  We would hope there would be situations in industry, in which we might see promotions from the floor to the board of a company, in which we might see works councils and in which we might see, in private enterprise, management endeavouring, as best they could, to implicate workers in the expansion of their business and the profits within their company.</P>
    <P>In our view that must be entirely voluntary on all sides.  There should not be any interference in private enterprise&mdash;and in that, of course, I include public companies&mdash;in whether or not such worker involvement occurs.  This will have to occur in the bigger companies, because good industrial relations will not be preserved unless it does.  That must come from the experience of the management and the fact that they see that this is the way in which they will preserve good industrial <Col N="789" /> relations, keep their good employees with them, and lead to prosperity for their companies.</P>
    <P>It is true that, for a very good reason, the forcing of such worker involvement in the decisions of a company's business would have a bad effect.  That is very straight and easy to describe.  Thanks be to God we have two things in this part of the hemisphere today: the free movement of men, and the free movement of money.  Whether we like it or not money equals work.  It equals work done at some time, in some place, by somebody.  If the working man could not save, if he wanted, perhaps, to supplement whatever the State was doing to educate his family better than he was educated himself, then his incentive to work would be gone.  Perhaps, he would prefer at that stage to take that work in the shape of money in his pocket and go down to the corner and have a pint.  He would be perfectly entitled to do that.  The incentive is there in the fact that he can store his money for use in future years.</P>
    <P>There is also the fact that money can move from one company to another very easily.  At the present moment, even in large public companies, notwithstanding the subscription of large amounts by way of the purchase of shares, most large public companies also exist on bank overdrafts. If things are going badly these overdrafts would not be forthcoming. They exist also on short-term and long-term loans got from various commercial banks and other sources. These will not be forthcoming if things are not going well.  That means that in order to get that solidity for the future that can be seen to be there, which will guarantee investment, we will not get more employment for our people in this country.</P>
    <P>The more things become mechanised, the more life becomes extremely difficult, the more this goes on and on, the more does each employer's job become more orientated towards how much money has been invested to provide it for him.  When I first came into this House 15 years ago, there was talk about it costing £1,000 to provide <Col N="790" /> a job for a man.  If there is one thing that has escalated more than anything else, during this 15 years of inflation, it is the cost figure per job per man.</P>
    <P>If you take a lorry driver and his helper leaving this city tonight with a 15 ton truck of the normal make, they have between £6,000 and £7,000 under them as they sit in the cab.  At each end the goods have to be loaded and unloaded.  There is also the production of those goods, the handling of them, perhaps, a fork lift truck, the checking of them, and all these different things. As you check through the numbers given for industry that is not in existence yet as potential employment, and the capital cost of providing that employment, you will find that the cost per worker in many cases is heading for the £10,000 figure per man.  There is an old Irish saying: &ldquo;An té nach bhfuil láidir ní folair dó bheith glic&rdquo;: &ldquo;Those who are not strong must be clever.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We must accept the economic fact that, unless we can attract money for our industries and the employment of our people, we will not succeed in getting above that deadline&mdash;which I already referred to when I said that the Minister was not reaching it&mdash;of producing 7,000 extra jobs a year to employ our people.  We have got to attract this money.  Recently a State sponsored company borrowed £8.5 million on the international market.  Next week or the week after, Nítrigin Éireann, which employ 700 people in Arklow, want to get their guarantee increased by £1 million.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is that that company want to have a guarantee of an extra £1 million to get from abroad.  I will move away from that now.  You cannot do that for private enterprise and private enterprise still employs the vast number of workers in this country.  Therefore, you must set up a climate for growth.  The Minister has a very serious responsibility to do just that.  I am sorry if my remarks on the free movement of money were <Col N="791" /> not strictly inside the scope of the debate on this Estimate but, Sir, with respect to you, I think they are entirely relevant in the context of the extra jobs that must be provided.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully said&mdash;and I fully agree with him&mdash;that we must increase the wages available to the lower paid workers.  When I use the words &ldquo;the wages available&rdquo;, I use them deliberately. Very many of our industries are employment orientated industries. In other words, if you have an industry where 80 per cent of the prime cost is, in fact, labour it is good for the country, but it is an industry which is very susceptible to changes in the cost of labour, the quality of labour, and the availability of labour.  In an industry in which they are cutting diamonds, the value of the end product is many, many times more than the actual cost of the labour going into it, no matter what the diamond cutter is paid.  That means we are susceptible to wage rates and conditions which do not conform, as far as production unit is concerned, with the best that is available everywhere else all over Europe.</P>
      <P>We must be extremely careful.  As we go along, we must see to it that we succeed in keeping abreast or in front of this slide rule maxim: that we must produce as much for as little.  At the same time, we must increase the wages of our lower-paid workers because they will emigrate as their standard of living rises and as something else happens. People who, perhaps, never left their houses from one end of the month to the other, now look at their television sets and see a nicely-furnished room and see the habits of other people depicted on the screen, they then yearn for and reach towards those habits themselves.  Therefore, perhaps we will find a scarcity of lower-paid workers here and a scarcity of jobs for higher-paid workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The freedom of the movement of money is a fact.  We may like it or we may not like it, but it is a fact.  The freedom of movement of people means that if we are to employ our people at home, this question of industrial relations rests primarily on a good contract of service operation right <Col N="792" /> across the whole structure of employment in this country.</P>
    <P>I want to revert to what I touched on already, the question of worker democracy and to clarify what I understand to be the Fine Gael policy. I am disappointed that the Minister did not clarify the Government policy in this regard.  It is Fine Gael policy to allow private enterprise to introduce worker involvement as it goes along, to introduce it as it feels there is benefit for the industry or the firm they are in.  We feel that the State sponsored boards should set a headline of worker involvement, and worker involvement I have defined as the election of workers from the floor and not trade union representation, which may not be the same thing.</P>
    <P>I want to say&mdash;and this is in no spirit of criticism of the Labour Party &mdash;that this policy is not the same as that of the Labour Party.  I want the employers and workers of this country to know that the Fine Gael Party in its policy on industry and in its policy on labour relations are quite clear in their minds.  I have studied the Labour Party policy and I would quote from page 31 of <i>Worker Democracy</i>, Section 1, Introduction:</P>
    <P>In this document worker democracy is defined as full participation by the workers in any decisions involving the utilisation of resources employed by an enterprise or organisation.</P>
    <P>Our party believes that while this would be an excellent thing to happen if we could get the whole team pulling together so that money will flow freely into this country from abroad, so that there will be the money to employ people, so that there will be the belief that it is safe, such would not be a wise thing to impose by legislation.  I quote from the bottom of the same page:</P>
    <P>The aim of worker democracy is to make the decision-takers in the place of work and in the control of the enterprise responsible to those who work in it.</P>
    <P>I hold that that is a misnomer, because they are responsible anyway. This is one ship and if it sinks they <Col N="793" /> all sink with it.  The decision-takers of the moment who are the employers, the executives, will go down just the same.  As I stated earlier, the day when the security of the executive or of the proprietor was very much greater than that of the worker is also gone.  I quote again:</P>
    <P>The vague word &ldquo;participation&rdquo; can mean anything or nothing, the frills of profit-sharing or the irrelevancies of works councils. Labour rejects these approaches on the grounds that there is nothing more pointless than participation in something over which you have no control.  Participation is often a device to ensure co-operation with managements for the purpose of controlling and exploiting for private profit.</P>
    <P>I make my last quotation from page 33 of this document:</P>
    <P>Worker democracy is understood as full participation in decision-making relating to the utilisation of the resources of an enterprise or organisation.</P>
    <P>The provision of contracts of service including good working conditions, schemes whereby there can be extra payments in time of sickness, family benefit schemes, schemes where there is payment in respect of a worker in case of death while at his work or outside it&mdash;these are all things that can come voluntarily, and must come voluntarily. We in Fine Gael believe that the extension of all these benefits is a responsibility of the Minister, and if he feels at this stage that he is going to be in difficulties when he introduces the new legislation, he has got a few years in government to be in these difficulties.  I wished he had not, but just as I have realised a few facts and related them here today in regard to industrial relations between workers.  I recognise that fact just the same.  The Government should now get themselves highly involved in this business of bringing the workers and the employers together. If they do that a good job could be done.  We on this side of the House have made our position entirely clear. It is that we look for that voluntarily in private enterprise and that as a headline <Col N="794" /> we would initiate it in the State companies in the hope that that example would spread.  However, I do want to point out that the Minister is in the Department a very short time. His predecessor dillied and dallied and did nothing, a good political move, in my opinion, but there is no election for a while.</P>

      <P>This is a vote for the Department of Labour and it is rather interesting to see one Deputy on the Labour benches.  I want to say to Deputy Tully who attacked me earlier today that I am glad he made it clear that the days of the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> activities in this country are over, and I hope they are.  Most of the speeches made here today have been made allegedly by labour men but actually they are made by rich men who have as much interest in labour as I have in the back of the moon.  These people have been talking about things which just do not happen at all.  They have never worked in their lives and, that being so, the descriptions they are giving of the types of work about which they are talking are entirely imaginary.</P>
      <P>I want to go away from the normal type of thing which has been said here today, yesterday and before that.  First, I want to congratulate the Minister on his changeover to this important office, and I am sure he will succeed in his new appointment.  I come from an area where a lot of what has been said here today means nothing at all.  The Minister himself comes from a similar area. When the Minister for External Affairs, Dr. Hillery, was appointed as Minister for Labour all the dole offices became known as offices of the Department of Labour.  &ldquo;A rose by any other name would smell as sweet&rdquo; but I can assure the House that if you change the name of a dole office to a local office of the Department of Labour it still smells as a dole office.  Many of these dole offices are orientated towards ensuring the continuance of the employment of the workers in them rather than ensuring some type of employment for the people who go to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Minister if anybody were to go into what is known as a dole office and asked for work they would not know what he was talking about. <Col N="795" /> Some time ago it was decided that these offices should become local offices of the Department of Labour.  I presume the idea is to give employment but that is not what has been happening.  It has probably been happening in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick, but it has not been happening in the West of Ireland.  I live within 150 yards of one of the biggest local offices of the Department of Labour in the West of Ireland and if I were to go up tomorrow and ask them to find me a man to paint the front of my house or do some plastering work they would not be able to supply one.  I know as far as the officials are concerned that what I am saying is not exactly the popular thing to say but I am one of those people who believes in saying what I think.  If any Deputy in this House were to walk into one of these offices in the West of Ireland and ask for work I can guarantee he would not get it.</P>
    <P>These offices have degenerated to such a degree that many decent people who want work and who would normally go in to look for work will not go in because anyone seeing them go in would be under the impression they were looking for soft money.  We have to be honest about it.  These offices were known originally as labour exchanges but they were renamed dole offices.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister realises that changes are necessary because if he does not it will mean that the West of Ireland and the other areas outside those I have already mentioned will be of no significance at all.  I can assure the Minister that we would like to see changes taking place.  I live in an area where there must be something like 1,000 people unemployed and there is no effort made by the local office to try to get employment for any of these people.  It is the same along the whole of the west coast.  The people employed in these offices are only interested in their own jobs.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to take the necessary steps to ensure that information with regard to available employment be brought to the attention of the unemployed.  I think an effort should also be made to make it clear to industry that there are unemployed people in certain categories prepared to work.  At the moment these offices are being used purely as dole offices.  I do not say that these people should not be paid dole but I do think these people should not merely be registered as &ldquo;unemployed&rdquo; they should be registered as being &ldquo;labourers&rdquo;, &ldquo;painters&rdquo; and so on.</P>
      <P>In these days of so-called free education it will be very difficult to get a worker at all.  It is generally accepted when a man sends his son or daughter to a college or convent that he will not have to work again.</P>
      <P>If the Department of Labour were to be called the Department of Employment I think there would be more sense in it.  The word &ldquo;labour&rdquo; normally means a manual worker or somebody who uses his hands.  We also have the Labour Party in this House in which there is not a man who has done a day's work in his life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the question of wages, although I do not know if it is under the control of the Minister for Labour, because the method being used at the moment by the big shots&mdash;practically every speech made here has been made by a rich man&mdash;is that of assessment of a wage or salary increase on a percentage basis.  It is grossly unfair method of giving an increase.  It is unfair that a man earning £12 a week and a man earning £60 a week should each get an increase of 10 per cent.  It cannot make sense.  I am asking the Minister to look into this matter regardless of any pressure that may be brought upon him to maintain the present system.  I doubt if there are many Deputies who will not agree with me that it is a shocking state of affairs that the county manager and the road worker should have increases in pay based on 10 per cent.  The manager has <Col N="797" /> a good laugh while the poor unfortunate road worker is still in queer street.  Why use that method?</P>
    <P>I presume that the Minister for Labour is the person who in future, if he is able to find anybody to work, will tell people what to do and will more or less dictate rates of salaries and wages.  If the Minister wants to make his Department a success, one of the first things he should do is take steps to ensure that increases when sought are given to those who deserve them and in proportion to the merits of their case.  There is no county manager or county engineer who cannot live on his present salary.  Yet, when an increase is given the county engineer may get an increase of about £10 a week while the road worker will get 4/- or 5/-.  I do not regard that as fair and I would ask the Minister to consider the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Labour has been established, as Deputy FitzGerald pointed out, some 3? years and I have been for about the same number of months as Minister in that Department.  For that reason, in coming with my first Estimate to the House I was anxious to produce as comprehensive a report as possible.  I want immediately to say to Deputy O'Donovan regarding his facetious remark, whether it was meant seriously or not, that it is 100 per cent our brief without any other Department influencing its production.  The Deputy made some reference to the &ldquo;hand of Charlie&rdquo;.  If it happens to coincide with Government thinking, that is only natural and as it should be where there is collective responsibility but, I deliberately set out to produce a brief that was comprehensive, that was factual, that was unbiased and devoid of any playing at politics.</P>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with the last speaker that &ldquo;Department of Labour&rdquo; is not a good name for the Department but that it should be referred to as the Department for Manpower Development, or some such name.  I might, indeed, think of that in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department was created for the purpose of giving to the workers at every level a new charter.  I was very <Col N="798" /> pleased with most of the speeches.  The debate ranged over all the matters included in the brief and over matters not included in the brief.  Most of the speeches were constructive and many of them were complimentary.  There were a few remarks which I did not like.  I do not like the type of speech that seeks to introduce a note of acrimony, to create a kind of belligerency as between worker and management. At least one speaker sought to establish that the Department was anti-worker. The last thing that I would like is that the Department would have an image of being anti-worker.  There are very few people in this House who could speak more authentically than I regarding the workers of this country. I would not be associated with the Department if it had an image of being anti-worker.  I do not think the people who make this accusation believe that it has that image.  They make the accusation out of a desire to create that type of acrimony which would greatly undermine the working of the Department.</P>
    <P>Not merely is the Department not anti-worker but it is pro-worker, always seeking to have a coalescing influence as between worker and management, between employer and employee, and I hope it will move even more rapidly in that direction.  The workers know that in the Department of Labour they have got a watchdog at national level that will always be prepared to see that proper conditions and proper relations are established with regard to their welfare.  I know from some of the speeches made that some people think of the Department as only having something to do with industrial relations. They forgot the fundamental work for which the Department has been established and organised.</P>
    <P>I may as I proceed refer to some of the remarks made by some Deputies. It would not be possible to cover all of them but many of the principal comments were made by various speakers. Therefore, it is hardly necessary to refer in each case to each individual speaker. I was particularly pleased that all of the speakers who referred to it, spoke of the AnCO service, the training service, in favourable terms.  While in some cases Deputies may have been critical <Col N="799" /> of not sufficiently rapid movement or of too late a start, other Deputies very wisely pointed out that it is not feasible to move rapidly in this matter.  But all of them were complimentary and did appreciate what is, I think, generally accepted now, namely, that training at all levels on the technological side is absolutely essential to future progress and to our maintaining our position in the world as an exporting country whose economic expansion is entirely bound up with continually increasing exports.</P>
    <P>Those who thought we are not moving rapidly enough in regard to AnCO's development and expansion will appreciate that AnCO got underway only a short time ago.  I should like here to pay tribute to the foundations laid in the Department by my predecessor.  He was wholly dedicated to the Department; it was a Department to which he attached great hope and I do not like to hear Deputy Donegan describing his work in the Department as dilly-dallying.  Because of the foundations he laid the Department will give, I believe, a very good account of itself in the years immediately ahead and its success will be due in no small measure to the foundations laid by my predecessor.</P>
    <P>The training of workers is being taken very seriously by the Department. Three centres have already been set up &mdash; Shannon, Waterford and Galway. These are worth visiting.  Some Deputies &mdash; I think it was either Deputy Moore or Deputy Dowling&mdash; said it would be a good thing if arrangements could be made for Deputies to see these centres.  I would like every Deputy to visit these centres. Deputy P. Belton honoured us by coming to Galway on Monday when we officially opened the third centre there. He must agree, no matter what criticism may be levelled against AnCO, that we found in Galway young and middle-aged men being taught skills which will be of infinite benefit to the economy as well as being of tremendous advantage to themselves in their future careers.  The more of this that can be done the better.</P>
    <P>There is systematic training of <Col N="800" /> apprentices under a very carefully prepared programme.  Those in charge admit that they are not perfect, but they are prepared to be guided to some extent by trial and error.  The curriculum they operate in these centres deserves the highest commendation. The clamour for more such areas is in itself proof of the general realisation, particularly in the industrial sphere, of the need for training people in skills. There is not an unemployed skilled man or woman in the country today. In fact, there is a shortage.  If skilled people are available they can be easily fitted in.</P>
    <P>We must try to produce more and more skilled personnel.  The day is coming when there will be little opportunity for the unskilled man or woman at any level.  That is why the Department is pinning so much hope on its industrial training schemes, whether within industry itself&mdash;I would like to see industry avail more of the schemes we have&mdash;or whether it is in industrial management.  The Irish Management Institute is gearing itself for the tremendous task of top level management, without which it would be impossible to make essential progress. I attach the highest hopes to these schemes and I will give all the support I can to anything which will make for better industrial relations, better job satisfaction, indeed a better industrial society, because the social side is equally, if not more, important in any scheme of industrial development.</P>
    <P>I am naturally biased towards industrial development in the west.  It is a good thing to see so many industries moving in that direction now.  I was very interested in the Calder and Lucey publication on the effect of rural industrialisation on a farming community. I was heartened by the conclusions drawn because they coincide with what I myself have always believed and what I myself have always found from personal experience to be true: where you have industrial development you also have simultaneously successful agricultural development over a wide radius around where the industries are established.</P>
    <P>That is proved abundantly in this publication after an examination of two <Col N="801" /> rural towns&mdash;Scariff and Tubbercurry; in neither of these can it be said that industrial development is excessive.  It is, in fact, a little limited, but the effects of industrialisation in these two areas have clearly demonstrated that not merely does the immediate population benefit but the surrounding agricultural area shows a remarkable improvement. The reason for that is because the workers in industry in the towns or villages are bringing home weekly pay packets which enable the father of a family to continue his agricultural activities without any compulsion to dispose of stock to meet certain payments or commitments when they fall due.  The two activities are complementary.  This is most encouraging. By decentralising industry it will be possible to assist agriculture.  Perhaps this is getting away somewhat from the workings of my Department, but it does bring me now to what Deputy O'Leary said.  He said I should not concern myself with wages and salaries because many reputations have perished in this field and it is a matter that should be left to those whose duty it is to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I do not think we could be involved in manpower services in the Department of Labour without being deeply concerned with the whole question of salaries and wages.  It would be impossible to consider our other work in isolation.  While the whole Government, particularly some Department such as Finance, should be deeply involved in this question, we cannot be divorced from the important question of salaries and wages and making reference to the general state of things whenever we feel we should.  I should like to approach these things, again, without incurring the displeasure of or creating a feeling that we are taking any one side or another.  I shall come back to that question again when I go over some of the more fundamental things regarding the Department.  I shall come back to the question of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>On the manpower side, I was glad that people like Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy O'Donovan supported our manpower survey schemes, gave us the necessary encouragement to carry on <Col N="802" /> with them.  I had a feeling that not all Members of the House are with us in the importance of this.  It is essential to move in an organised way.  While the Drogheda and Waterford manpower surveys were comprehensive studies in depth, giving, perhaps, more information than we required, as I said in my opening speech we propose to get more information of a more suitable type without going into the same depth and in a less costly and a less time-consuming way as incurred in these other very useful reports which are of immense value to us as reference works, anyhow.</P>
    <P>We hope to get a complete survey of a more superficial type in the shortest time that will, perhaps, give the necessary information towards co-ordinating our services as between training and placement as well as classification of workers generally.  In this connection, in the manpower service, our forecasting has come in for some criticism.  I think most speakers were prepared to appreciate our problem and difficulties in this connection.</P>
    <P>One of the things that I should like to say to the manpower service myself &mdash;I think I have already conveyed it to them&mdash;is that, if they are going to strive for accuracy they will never get anywhere very fast.  I think everybody is prepared to accept that accurate forecasting will be very difficult, if not impossible.  The best we can hope for is a good estimate.  Already, the service, in classifying workers in their different skills and categories, is proceeding to a very useful degree.  I think it was Deputy FitzGerald who said that classification can be a useless exercise if it is done in a superficial way&mdash;by sending out questionnaire forms, to be filled up by persons, asking if they are engineers, whether they are skilled in this, that or the other trade.  You can take it that the classification that will be done by the manpower forecasting will be as accurate and as authentic as is possible having regard to the degree of knowledge and the depth of the skills the people have. It is essential to have classification done on a very reliable basis if it is to be of use and it can be of great benefit to us in that way.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I want to assure the House that our classification will be more authentic and it will be of real use to our manpower service. While I am on the subject of manpower I should like to refer to the placement service which we are now establishing.  Deputy Lenehan was concerned about the image of the dole office: he had a very good point here. We find that in the placement service we have got to get away from the image of the dole office.  While our employment exchanges and our employment offices in many centres will have to become placement centres, with the necessary changes built-in, we shall have a placement service separate from the benefit-paying part of these offices. It will be a separate service: that is already decided.  As the House knows, we are proceeding to find the necessary offices in many areas.  During the debate, some speakers said it would take years to build these offices.  Some of the offices we are acquiring are already built.  We are not just setting out to build them.  We should like them to have the right image from the start. Above all, they will have to be established and organised in such a way that they will command the confidence of the employers and that the employers will use them.  If the employers will use them and if we can give them the necessary service through our national employment service, as established, it could be of tremendous benefit in the placement of our people in suitable employment and I hope it will dovetail with our trainee schemes, generally.</P>

      <P>Consider the progress we have made in a short time. I think we have made real good progress. Somebody said that the first step is the most important one.  I do not think it is necessary either, to elaborate on the Cert training.  Every speaker who referred to it understood and was favourable in his approach.  I do not think that our people in general fully understand the importance of the training in this particular field.  I hope the generally favourable attitude of the House towards our efforts in that direction will permeate right down to the most remote areas in the country. Some of them are yet not fully aware of the importance of what this question of Cert is all about.  We train people for an industry where it is most needed, where there is great demand, where high standards are called for and where the status of the people working in this industry will be raised by the very training that we shall give them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general, favourable approach to my opening speech, which covered so much of the entire work of the Department as it was possible to outline without taking up too much time of the House, was most satisfactory and encouraging to me.  I must say in his absence that the contribution of Deputy Desmond was the type of speech that gives me encouragement coming, as it did, from the Labour Benches, with his knowledge of this subject.  Even when he had criticisms to make his approach was reasonable and he did not introduce any acrimony. <Col N="805" /> Acrimony should be completely ruled out as far as any effort in this sensitive field is concerned.  It is so easy further to aggravate feelings in this sensitive field of labour relations.  Deputy Tully, who was quite constructive, all the time took the 1913 attitude which is dead and gone so far as workers and management are concerned.  I do not think that any worker feels, to use the words Deputy Tully used, that he is being &ldquo;ground into the earth&rdquo;.  Indeed, that is something which by no means can be attributed to anything that is happening at present and nobody would wish that it should be.  This approach should be forgotten and it is a pity that it was revived.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond's coverage of the entire working of the Department and of the whole field of industrial relations was a valuable contribution to the debate.  While he did not agree with some of the things we are doing or the way in which we are doing them, he gave a very reasoned account of why he did not.  In most cases he expressed a very sensible approach and a complete realisation of what we would all like to be the approach of everybody concerned with this important problem of industrial relations.  In my opening speech I tried to show as best I could that industrial relations, good industrial relations, will not be established unilaterally in this country or anywhere else by the Government, by the unions or by the employers.  It is something in which everybody is concerned and to which everybody can make a contribution.</P>
    <P>While Deputy FitzGerald deplored &mdash;and I thought he made a very able contribution also&mdash;the fact that we had not by now established a prices and incomes policy and that we were sorely lacking in our approach to this important work, Deputy O'Donovan pointed out that this is something which cannot be brought about easily and Deputy FitzGerald is one man who knows that that is so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very good to hear these divergent views because it <Col N="806" /> immediately demonstrates what my problem is.  Deputy FitzGerald was quoting from the NIEC report on this matter, and indeed it is very valuable in one way but very confusing in another way.  It is perfectly obvious that there must be a change of attitude and the acceptance of a whole lot of things which we have not got now before we can even get down to the basics of establishing a prices and incomes policy.  Without mentioning any names, a very important political figure across the water said to me very recently, when we were talking about this matter, that he sometimes thought that the best prices and incomes policy was to have no policy. While that might sound paradoxical there might be something in what he said.  It would be better to have none than to have the wrong type.  We all agree to a prices and incomes policy if it suits our particular outlook; if the trade unions find in it a means of complete freedom to increase wages at any time, then that will be good policy; if the employers see it as a means of having no demands for increases and having a complete standstill, I am sure they would agree with it.  However, if we are going to guide ourselves towards some workable formula one of these days I hope it will be one that will be acceptable, that all attitudes will be such that they will be prepared to accept its inevitable outcome.  I think this is the basis of any effort at industrial relations.  If we could adopt the attitude, the outlook and the acceptance that would make a proper prices and incomes policy work, then we would actually need no prices and incomes policy at all because no policy or scheme in this sensitive field is enforceable unless you have acceptances and that attitudes are geared towards that end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am merely saying something that has been said thousands of times before.  I am not trying to say anything original.  One of the essential things in any effort at improving industrial relations is to get everybody to understand that we cannot go on forever taking out of the economy more than we are putting into it and that if there are inordinate demands there must be some compensation in the way of increased <Col N="807" /> production or a reasonable assurance of stability and industrial peace over a long period.</P>
    <P>Speakers here referred to different disputes which had been highlighted and dealt with them in their own way. Some sought to justify the outcome of the maintenance dispute while some saw it as a disaster, but no matter what our attitude may be, and while everybody who gets up always has something nice to say about the working man, we must agree that if too much is sought at a particular time it is bound to throw things into disorder for the producer.  This is a point on which I should like to take Deputy O'Donovan to task.  He said that wages did not affect exports very much and, in fact, that they had no effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  I said that our exports had little wage content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Immediately, he sought to prove this by referring to livestock but that is only one portion of our exports.  I am thinking in terms of industrial exports.  I can see in Donegal tomorrow a weaver in a factory producing cloth sold six months ago for next spring's trade and his wages have gone up £3 in the week meantime.  That necessarily must be reflected in every yard of cloth he produces, with the result that, probably, the manager must cancel the order he had for the spring.  Increases affect exports to the extent sometimes of making it impossible to export.  To say that wages do not affect exports is not facing up to the realities of the situation. I have given what is to me an obvious, everyday example but one could give hundreds of others equally good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is to have increases so arranged or pre-arranged that we know when they come they will be contingent on a set of circumstances, that they are part of other changes in the economy and for that reason the industry is never caught on the wrong foot and is in a position to make the necessary provisions and sell their goods in a foreign market in anticipation of any increase in cost in the meantime.  These <Col N="808" /> are elementary considerations in production and manufacture but to get these problems across to everybody concerned is a prerequisite to proper industrial relations.  I cannot yet fully comprehend this fact in regard to industrial relations: when speaking to individuals deeply concerned on either side, they are fully aware of all the problems and ready to agree with the facts of the situation.  They are most considerate, whether on the employers' or employees' side, but when they come together collectively, the psychological effect seems to make them entirely different.  They then seem to be guided by only one consideration, to do as well as the other fellow did.</P>
    <P>In a recent discussion with the FUE some members assured me that in any agreements they negotiated the effect of increased wages on the economy was given little or no consideration and hardly entered into the matter at all.  It was a question of why should we not get as much as the other fellow got when we are doing similar work. That is a problem we must face in negotiating future agreements and in having procedures established to provide better guidelines.  People sometimes may be doing the same kind of work but may not be worth the same amount to the employer.  He may not be in a position to pay the extra money if he is to survive and make sufficient profit to enable him to carry on and plough back portion of the profit for expansion.  These matters are important in the whole field of negotiation.</P>
    <P>The maintenance increase has already got partly into the economy and in some of the strongest areas agreements have been negotiated and I am sure that people who have negotiated agreements feel that they will be able in some way to withstand the impact and eventually pass it on to the consumers.  But there are other firms that will not be able to stand up to the same thing, firms that are just getting on their feet.  They could not stand such an increase.  What applies in one case need not be of general application.</P>
    <P>I was warned by one speaker that this was a field in which the Department and the Minister should not be <Col N="809" /> too deeply involved but it is so closely bound up with the working of our manpower service and the other services which we are establishing and seeking to accelerate that one cannot divorce oneself from it.  I do not wish to deal with it in such a way as to prejudice anything now being attempted.  Today, the Minister for Finance and I had continuing talks with the Congress of Trade Unions.  We had a full and frank expression of views and a full understanding of what lies ahead.  We shall meet the FUE tomorrow to continue talks which we had with them in the past and I hope that eventually, as a result of a fuller understanding of the problems generally, a pattern will emerge, not any tight formula&mdash;which I do not think is possible&mdash;but at least, a loose-knit scheme or formula which will give us in years ahead, please God, the necessary stability to enable the economy to expand even more rapidly than in the past.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Desmond who, in his very able and reasoned contribution, pointed out that while we had reasonably satisfactory expansion in our economy in recent years, if we had had a more favourable industrial climate the rate of expansion could have been much better and we could now be much nearer the goal at which we all aim&mdash; full employment.  We, as distinct from other countries that have achieved full employment, should never fail to keep in mind when we are trying to improve our conditions and our rates, that we are a developing country striving towards full employment and that we have an unemployment problem and, as Deputy FitzGerald pointed out, an emigration problem, which you can add to the emigration figure if you like.  I will not quarrel with that at all.  It is a problem we have got to face.</P>
    <P>We must keep in mind, no matter what else we do, that that is one of our problems.  If I were sitting around the table with the FUE tomorrow or with the ICTU today in a country where there was already full employment, we could talk in very different terms.  There are very many great things we could do.  We cannot lose sight of the fact that we have this problem.  It is the one <Col N="810" /> desire of every party in this House that we should move as rapidly as possible towards the attainment of the goal of full employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald asked, and I could not agree with him more&mdash; Deputy Desmond in particular elaborated the point&mdash;why should we have so many man hours lost through strikes which had to be settled eventually anyway, and most of which could have been settled before they ever took place.  This has been said often, but it could not be said too often.  We have got to get sanity back into our thinking in this respect.  The strike weapon should be looked on as the last resort only.  I have been taken to task in this debate about not introducing the promised legislation to put right the High Court decision regarding the Educational Company.  I gave the reasons for it.  I inherited the reasons from my predecessor and I agree with him.  I am prepared to introduce this legislation. I have invited the unions to come in and see me, to see what more we can put into it with regard to this whole question of picketing.</P>
    <P>The trade unions must now agree that it will be in their interest to have some recognised limitation on picketing, and lighting strikes, and unofficial strikes.  It will be to their advantage.  If I can do anything through legislation to strengthen their hand and improve that situation, I am prepared to meet them to do it.  It is not right that a few people can throw a few thousand others out of work&mdash;some of them who are not concerned with the particular strike, and not even in the same union.</P>
    <P>Surely there must be a sensible approach to this?  It is not taking away any God-given powers from any worker to ask him to do something which is ultimately for his own benefit and that of thousands of his colleagues. We had stupid strikes that escalated and spread to unions that were not in any way involved.  The same result could eventually be got without involving the thousands who were involved and who suffered so much&mdash;and the economy as a whole also suffered&mdash;as a consequence.</P>
    <P>If we are to make good, to amend and restore the situation with regard <Col N="811" /> to the Educational Company ruling in that court case, I want to speak to the trade unions and ask them about a number of other things that I should like to do which would be to their benefit, to the undoubted benefit of the worker, and to the benefit of the economy as a whole with regard to this question of picketing.  Picketing is looked upon as being sacrosanct and, if anyone attempts to refer to any restriction on picketing, he is accused immediately of wanting to take powers from the worker, such as his right to withdraw his labour.  This is nonsense. No one has any intention of ever doing so.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I think the power of the picket would be strengthened by its less frequent use and by being used only as a last resort.  I will very seriously consider any suggestion that could be written into a Bill that will restore the situation in regard to the Educational Company ruling.  I think Deputy Donegan confused the Educational Company ruling with the Trade Union Bill, because he said we promised to introduce a Trade Union Bill and ran away from it because of the election, and that we were now forgetting about it.  The Trade Union Bill was before the House before the election and fell only when the Dáil was dissolved.  I hope to resurrect it.  It is in course of being resurrected now, as the union members know and the FUE.  Any amendments which were found necessary on Second Reading are being written into the Bill now.  We will get it through as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>We have other important pieces of legislation, too, and this brings me again to the point that we have much to do in our Department for the benefit of the worker: to give him a charter to which he is entitled, to give him better entitlement to a statutory period of notice of the termination of his employment, holidays, conditions, safety conditions, working conditions, everything that affects his employment. These are fundamentally of much greater benefit to him than spiralling demands for wages being chased by prices, being chased by wage demands, being chased by prices, going on the <Col N="812" /> seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh rounds.  In what round are we to be knocked out?  The economy will go down for the count some time.  It cannot go on for ever.</P>
    <P>I should like everyone, workers and employers, to look on our Department as the focal point for co-ordinating a better understanding, a better set of conditions and a charter for the workers which would give them something which mere unreal money incomes do not procure for them.  If there is anything I can do in the Department while I am in it, I will spare no effort to bring about that situation.</P>
    <P>When the changes in the Cabinet took place the political correspondents found some interest in referring to those changes.  Most of them were silent about the Department of Labour except the occasional correspondent who ventured to say it was a pity that Deputy Dr. Hillery was transferred from it, which I took to mean that I would do nothing in it except maintain the <i>status quo.</i> I should like to prove the opposite.  I should like to make the Department of Labour live as the most important Department in this State, which it is bound to be if it carries out the functions which it is there to carry out.  I can do that only if I can bring with me the people on different sides. I think we are moving towards a better understanding every day in this respect.</P>
    <P>I want to say something about the Labour Court before I finish.  Most people who referred to it did not venture to go into it deeply, and I was anxious to hear the views of speakers on the Labour Court.  Again I must give Deputy Barry Desmond my commendation for his approach to this subject. Deputy FitzGerald was quite good, if he had not been so anxious to score some political points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a particular view of the Labour Court.  It may not be original but it is supported by what I regard as every right-thinking person I meet on the workers' side and on the employers' side.  If the Labour Court is to be the institution that it should be, it must be supported by everybody. <Col N="813" /> When a thing is new it is great, but it is not established one year until somebody suggests that there should be a council or a committee or a co-ordinating body, which do not work either.</P>
      <P>The Labour Court should be the last resort in negotiating settlements or agreements in any dispute.  Unfortunately in recent times it has come to be regarded as only another step in the process.  Although there have been quite a number of acceptances, the number of rejections have increased.  I am prepared to admit there is much we can do to improve the standing and the image of the court.  I do not think there should be any easy approach to any other body, either the Government or anybody else.  It is an independent body representative of both sides, and if there is a shortage of personnel and further appointments are needed, I am quite prepared to see that they are made. But let it operate as the last ditch in the matter of making settlements in any dispute.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the functions of the Labour Court could be extended.  Perhaps the conciliation side could be extended to get into the field of potential unrest. Perhaps it should become more involved in the early days of trouble or, indeed, in the areas of potential trouble.  I am prepared to investigate every possible aspect of this in order to give it all the teeth it can possibly have to be accepted as the final arbiter that would be seen to operate without any bias whatever and with complete understanding.  We should strengthen the Labour Court rather than think up new institutions.  In my time and at the earliest possible date I shall endeavour to strengthen the Labour Court by every means and I am open to any suggestions I can get in this respect.  I was disappointed that there was no deeper discussion of this point in the debate.  I do not like those people who denigrate the efforts of the court by making cynical remarks and treating it as something of no importance.  This tends to weaken the image of the court and eventually its whole effectiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not said anything regarding the emigrants' committee which I set up.  Most speakers accept that it was a <Col N="814" /> Deputy O'Donovan referred to the question of emigrants coming home.  He talked about the number of emigrants we were able to bring back who were already qualified in certain skills.  This brings out my point about the need for acquiring these skills early in life without having to procure them in difficult ways.  I remember when Aer Lingus was established a great many Irishmen, working abroad, returned home, having obtained during the war years the necessary skills in that field, to find themselves lucrative employment</P>
    <P>The question of mobility of manpower within the country was raised by a number of Deputies, including Deputy Dr. FitzGerald.  One speaker attributed this lack of mobility to the history that Dublin is regarded as the Pale, but I thought that suggestion a little bit extravagant.  My experience, coming from the West of Ireland, is that emigration is orientated in a particular direction.  A potential emigrant in Donegal is more inclined to join his friends in Birmingham than he is to go down to work in Youghal, Roscrea, Galway or Dublin.</P>
    <P>step in the right direction, but Deputy Dr. O'Donovan considered that the £10,000 was not enough.  The £10,000 is not a lot of money when one considers the work this committee might do.  The committee is more of an exploratory one to come up with suggestions as to what is necessary and to probe into the areas where things most need to be done.  I look on the £10,000 like a barium meal that a radiologist gives to a patient about to be X-rayed, that will show up the weak spots requiring treatment, and I think the £10,000 is adequate when it is looked at in that light.</P>

      <P>When we talk about mobility of labour in the country we are thinking of areas other than Dublin to which people could go and work.  We have a peculiar situation in Dublin, which is escalating, where there is full employment in the building industry.  We have workers coming in from all parts of the country, but particularly the west, to engage in it.  They get married and go to live in one room, the next day they are looking for a house.</P>

      <P>Deputy J. Lenehan made a fairly good contribution today in relation to the exchanges and what is happening with regard to people signing on and yet being unable to work.  This is something we must accept as a fact and I have already mentioned it in my opening speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy M. O'Leary referred to factors which contributed to the increase in imports, increase in prices and the increase in wages.  Even the most elementary economist agrees that the price increase is composed of a number of <Col N="816" /> factors and likewise so are increased wages; but there are other sides to the increase in wages and incomes which stimulate extra imports and in that way contribute to the balance of payment problems as well as to the prices problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody said this method of wage increases generally benefits the better paid workers rather than the lower paid workers, and to deny that is to deny a fact which is self-evident.  It is not the lowest paid worker who gets the biggest increase. He gets £1 and the other fellow gets £6.  That has been happening and perhaps it will continue, although it should not.  The fact of the matter is that it has the serious effect of stimulating purchasing power, increasing imports and sending up prices.  This has been said for a very long time and there is no point&mdash;as I have only been a few months in the Department of Labour&mdash;in my saying that again. What I do want to say is that, while I have been there only a few months, I should like to see the Department get the full support of everybody in order that it might do a job which is of importance to everybody, irrespective of where they are sitting in this House.  It is not an area in which we can afford to have people driving wedges, it should be a coalescing influence for people who may have suspicions and doubts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot legislate for industrial peace unless I have the proper attitudes and the necessary acceptances. These can only be given by the full support of all sides of the House.  I am prepared to be patient whenever I may be provoked and to work as hard as anybody can in order not to create any further acrimony or belligerency between these different sets of people but to endeavour to bring them together and to create more harmony, thereby getting, as soon as it is possible, a measure of agreement that will give us stability.  Such stability would, I think, contribute more to our drive towards full employment and the <Col N="817" /> economic expansion of our economy than any other incentive we could create.</P>
    <P>We in this House can play a bigger role in this than in anything else we might do in our endeavours towards bringing about economic expansion and full employment.  I am prepared to consider every worthwhile suggestion but I cannot do it on my own; neither can my Department nor the Government; it must be a tripartite effort.  It must be an effort by everybody, but particularly by the Government, the workers, and management.  We are a most patriotic people&mdash;a few weeks ago we wanted to go out and fight.  We were prepared to lose everything for the country.  All I now ask is that we be prepared to co-operate and work for our country because in that way we can go places very fast.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £4,328,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of <Col N="819" /> payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1970, for the salaries and expenses of the Offices of the Minister for Lands and of the Irish Land Comission.</P>
    <P>In line with the agreed procedure adopted for the last few years, I propose to take the Votes for Lands and Forestry together this year also. Accordingly, in my opening remarks I shall refer to Votes 34 and 35 and at the conclusion of the debate the motion in respect of Vote 34 will be put to the House.  Vote 35 will then be formally moved.</P>
    <P>The Lands Vote, No. 34, shows a net increase of £305,000 compared with last year.  I shall commence by explaining the salient features of this Estimate&mdash; especially those items which reflect a significant change from last year's provision&mdash;and continue with a review of the principal activities of the Land Commission during the year ended 31st March last.</P>
    <P>Provision for salaries, wages and allowances is made under subhead A. The amount required this year, £1,215,000, represents a slight decrease on last year's provision.  Last year reference was made to the fact that in order to deal with the new work arising from the pilot areas the inspectorate staff was being strengthened. Additional posts have been sanctioned in connection with this reorganisation to provide necessary reinforcement for a field force geared to meet the demands of the current situation and in particular to tackle effectively structural reform problems in the pilot areas.</P>

They represent the taxpayers' contribution in the current year towards the service of land purchase debt accumulated, since 1923, on both tenanted and untenanted land.  The total contribution this year, viz. £1,234,100 constitutes the biggest individual item in the Vote and represents nearly one-third of the entire net Estimate. Of the total subhead provision, some £1,072,000 will be utilised to make good deficiencies in the Land Bond Fund arising from the statutory halving of annuities under the Land Act, 1933.  Indeed, the overall increase of £31,200 in the subhead this year is attributable mainly to the halving of purchase instalments payable by new allottees as land settlement proceeds. All allottees in congested areas, together with migrants and displaced employees getting holdings in non-congested <Col N="821" /> areas, get the benefit of the halving of annuities.</P>
    <P>As subhead G.1 is in four separate parts, I think I can best deal with it by referring to each part individually.  The subhead involves two items, viz., the purchase of land by the Land Commission for cash in the open market and the provision of life annuities under section 6 of the Land Act, 1965. Up to 1965, cash purchases under section 27, Land Act, 1950, were restricted to lands required for migrants' holdings or for rearrangement of fragmented holdings.  As Deputies are aware, however, these limitations were set aside by the repeals section of the Land Act, 1965, and purchases for cash are now open to all the general purposes of the Land Acts.  During the year ended 31st March last, a total of 168 properties, aggregating 6,748 acres, were purchased for cash under section 27 at a price of £468,328.  In order to cater for a substantial expansion in the volume of purchase for cash, particularly in the case of smaller estates and also in order that the scheme for life annuities shall make worthwhile progress, provision for subhead G.1 is being increased this year to a record figure of £600,000.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Land Act, 1965, provides basic authority for the scheme of life annuities for elderly, incapacitated or blind persons who voluntarily sell their interest in land to the Land Commision.  This scheme and the scheme for self-migration loans, to which I shall be referring later on, were brought into operation early in 1967.  The objective of the life annuity scheme is to facilitate land structure reform by encouraging elderly, incapacitated or blind farmers to retire so that their lands become available for active farming by younger able-bodied persons.  This scheme is having moderate success and I can say that we now have 22 persons on the life annuity payroll following the sale of their lands to the Land Commission. Most of these people availed themselves of the very attractive feature of the scheme whereby the vendor may, if he so wishes, retain a right of residence for life in his existing dwelling-house. As this scheme, which is entirely voluntary, is designed, in the <Col N="822" /> main, for elderly people, progress is necessarily slow but the results to date are by no means unsatisfactory.  I would hope that, as the number of life annuitants grows, they themselves will provide the best stimulus of all to others to participate in the scheme.</P>
    <P>For the information of the House, the overall position in relation to the scheme to a recent date is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A total of 375 firm applications have been received under the scheme and, of these, 349 have been investigated. Some 159 applications had to be eliminated at an early stage, mainly because the lands offered were not considered suitable or required for Land Commission purposes, and a further 71 were withdrawn, the owners preferring to offer their lands to the Land Commission in the ordinary way for cash or land bonds.  In all, 119 applications developed into potential life annuity cases and advanced to the stage where price negotiations with the landowners concerned were authorised.</P>
    <P>Price agreement has, in fact, been reached with 35 landowners and, as already stated, life annuities have actually been set up in 22 cases.  In all other cases, the necessary legal requirements as regards title, etc., with a view to setting up life annuities for the landowners concerned, are proceeding. In the remaining two cases, the Land Commission are awaiting a decision by the vendors as to whether or not they will opt for a life annuity in lieu of all or part of the agreed purchase price.</P>
    <P>The cases already completed have released about 1,000 acres for land settlement purposes and it is expected that a further area of some 600 acres will be made available when the other 13 cases mentioned are finalised.</P>
    <P>The second part of subhead G stems from section 5 of the Land Act, 1965, in which resides authority for the scheme enabling the Land Commission to make loans to progressive farmers in congested areas for the purchase of viable farms of their choice, subject to making their existing lands available to the Land Commission for land settlement purposes.  This in fact is really a banking or credit service, with an overall limit of £10,000 including the price paid for the owner's old holding; <Col N="823" /> it is intended to augment existing land settlement schemes and is, of course, additional to and again is not in substitution for the traditional migration programme carried out by the Land Commission.  The primary objective of the scheme is to facilitate the Land Commission programme of land structure reform in the scheduled congested areas, as defined in the 1965 Act&mdash;Counties Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo and parts of Clare and West Cork.  The scheme is intended to encourage initiative by providing necessary capital, through the Land Commission, to enable progressive small-holders in the scheduled congested areas to improve their status by purchase in the open market of viable farms suitable to individual requirements, subject to making their existing lands available to the Land Commission as part of the loan arrangements.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme, a total of 143 applications has been received to a recent date.  Of these, 127 have been investigated and, perhaps not surprisingly, a high proportion failed at an early stage&mdash;chiefly because either the applicants and/or their lands were considered unsuitable for the purposes of the scheme.  In all, 54 applications progressed to the price negotiation stage and, in 14 of these cases, agreement on price has, in fact, been reached.</P>
    <P>This is a vital stage in the procedure as price agreement is an essential prerequisite to acceptance of an applicant and to making him an advance under the scheme.  It is only when agreement on price has been reached with a landowner that he knows the extent of financial assistance which he may expect from the Land Commission, thus enabling him to shop around for a suitable new farm on the basis of what he will receive for his own holding and the amount of loan available to him.</P>
    <P>Of the 14 cases in which price agreement was reached, seven have been provided with self migration advances and have now gone into possession of their new holdings; in one other case, the necessary legal formalities are being completed and in the remaining six <Col N="824" /> cases the Land Commission are awaiting proposals from the approved applicants regarding the new farms selected by them and the amount of loan they will require.</P>
    <P>The seven completed cases&mdash;for which advances and free grants totalling approximately £29,000 were made by the Land Commission&mdash;have provided an area of 300 acres for land settlement.  The holdings purchased by these seven successful applicants contain, in aggregate, 840 acres.  The other seven cases involve the Land Commission in a potential maximum commitment of some £37,000 by way of advances and free grants and, if these transactions can be successfully concluded, they will release a further aggregate area of about 390 acres for the land reform programme.</P>
    <P>The results from this scheme to date are, I am afraid, rather disappointing, even allowing for the fact that the scheme is restricted to landowners in the scheduled congested areas and that approved applicants are allowed a period of 12 months in which to shop around for new holdings.  I am having another look at the scheme to see whether anything can be done to increase its attractiveness.</P>
    <P>Informal booklets have been prepared for the guidance of landowners interested in the schemes and any Deputy who wishes can obtain copies by getting in touch with the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Subhead G.3 provides £10,000 for payment in cash of compensation for tenancy interests resumed on the small outstanding residue of Congested Districts Board estates.  The fourth and final part of the subhead relates to the payment by the Land Commission of auctioneers' commission on relevant purchases of Land for cash and land bonds.  It is anticipated that £80,000 will be required this year.  Perhaps I should explain here that up to 1963 the practice was to pay auctioneers' commission only in respect of lands purchased by the Land Commission for cash under section 27 of the Land Act, 1950.  This was extended in 1963 to properties purchased on a voluntary basis for land bonds.  The extension of payment of commission on the lines indicated has proved a decided incentive <Col N="825" /> to auctioneers to offer lands on their books to the Land Commission thus facilitating an acceleration in land acquisition for the relief of congestion. My own preference is for voluntary rather than compulsory transactions and I freely acknowledge the co-operation and assistance of auctioneers in this matter.</P>
    <P>Subhead H provides the funds for payment of gratuities pursuant to section 29 of the Land Act, 1950, to persons displaced from employment on estates taken over by the Land Commission for distribution.  Last year, gratuities totalling £4,670 were paid to 19 ex-employees, an average of £245 each.  Perhaps I should emphasise that displaced employees who are deemed competent to work land are automatically considered for allotments&mdash;indeed, this is only right and proper&mdash;but, where they are not found to be suitable for allotments, they are considered by the Land Commission for a cash gratuity, depending on such factors as length of service, personal and family circumstances, availability of alternative employment and so on.  It is difficult to make an accurate forecast of commitments under the subhead in any particular year because this depends on the level of acquisition activity and the extent to which estate workers become displaced from employment through these activities.  Last year's figure of £15,000 is being repeated for the current year.</P>
    <P>Subhead I provides, in the main, the funds required to meet the cost of the various estate improvement works which are such an important feature of land settlement.  These works include the erection of dwellinghouses and out-offices; the provision of access roads; fencing and drainage; the provision of water supply for domestic and stock requirements; turbary development; the repair and maintenance of embankments.  These are all costly amenities and expenditure for last year totalled £865,500 including £518,600 on building works.  Some 410 men were employed on the various improvement works and their wage bill amounted to almost £239,000.</P>
    <P>For the current financial year the amount proposed under the subhead <Col N="826" /> is £1,050,000 which represents an increase of £60,000 over last year's provision and amounts to about 25 per cent of the entire Estimate.  This increased provision will, I feel sure, be welcomed by Deputies, particularly those from rural areas, having regard to the importance of estate improvement and development works.</P>
    <P>Last year reference was made to an important new development being undertaken by the Land Commission in relation to lands earmarked for migrants and intended for distribution to tenants whose holdings are being rearranged.  All such lands are now being rehabilitated prior to allotment, the rehabilitation consisting of lime and fertiliser application.  In addition, the Land Commission are also doing the preliminary (reclamation) work on these lands such as drainage, removal of scrub, eradication of rushes and so on.  The aim is to give these allottees the best possible start on their holdings. The major portion of the cost involved is being borne direct by the Land Commission, a small proportion being charged to the allottee by means of an addition to his annuity.</P>
    <P>The question of improving designs for houses and out-offices being built by the Land Commission continues to receive full consideration.  As Deputies are, no doubt, aware, dwellinghouses provided by the Land Commission are fully serviced as to water supply and electricity, where practicable.  The design and construction of these houses have recently been revised and many progressive features have been added to fit in with modern needs and trends. Improvements include greatly increased storage space and a utility room which can be used as a fourth bedroom to provide extra accommodation as the family expands.</P>
    <P>Modern out-offices now being erected by the Land Commission represent a considerable advance in quality and layout and reflect the most up-to-date thinking on farm accommodation. These provide a good basic set of out-buildings which can be readily adapted for expansion and development if the allottee chooses.</P>
    <P>In addition, yard areas have also been increased and black-topping of <Col N="827" /> yards, approach roads and access roads is now being undertaken as a standard feature of improvement works associated with the provision of buildings on new holdings.</P>
    <P>The sub-item entitled &ldquo;Housing Loans&rdquo; refers to the scheme under which advances up to £500 are made to farmers to supplement grants from the Department of Local Government for the erection of new houses and for reconstruction work on existing houses. During the past year the total amount paid out by way of loans for this purpose was £52,000 to some 120 applicants.  The provision for the current year is £70,000.</P>
    <P>The application of work study techniques to the estate improvement works of the Land Commission continues. The work study section of the management services unit, through method improvements and the incentive bonus scheme, contributed to maintaining a very high level of productivity on outdoor works.  The amount set aside under subhead L for game and wildlife development, £100,000, is an increase of £5,000 on the sum provided last year.</P>
    <P>Grants for the preservation and improvement of game resources will continue to be available to assist regional game councils, representative of all appropriate interests, in carrying out approved locally organised schemes of direct improvement of game stocks and habitat.  There are now 26 regional game councils active in the country.</P>
    <P>During the past year the sum of £48,587 was paid out in respect of 25 schemes of game improvement and a further £1,335 was paid in respect of some previous years' schemes.</P>
    <P>Under the guidance of the Department's game advisers, the regional game councils made satisfactory progress during the year, especially in the important work of habitat improvement and the provision of sanctuaries for native and migratory wildfowl.  A simplified method of disbursing grants was applied, with success, to some councils during the 1968-69 season and it is hoped to extend the application of the system to other councils in 1969-70.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" /> In addition my Department has commissioned An Foras Talúntais to carry out research on two important features of game development&mdash;the rehabilitation of mallard and grouse stocks. Grants totalling £10,440 were paid in the past year.  This research is necessarily a long-term project but it is already showing promising results.</P>
    <P>The development of the tourism aspect of game-shooting proceeded satisfactorily in the past year and the joint committee of my Department and of Bord Fáilte has sponsored a number of shoots throughout the country to meet the demands of out-of-State visitors.</P>
    <P>Conservation of our heritage of wildlife is coming in for increasing and deserved attention on the part of the State and of the community at large. My Department is going steadily ahead with measures for the preservation of habitats of wildlife, in particular of wetland areas vital for our native and migratory wildfowl.  The preparation of legislation for the conservation and management of wildlife on modern principles is in hands.</P>
    <P>In the context of European Conservation Year, 1970, about which I will speak later, the Department has commissioned the making of a film on the theme of nature and wildlife in Ireland by an Irish artist of international standing.  The film will reflect the understanding and feeling for nature and wildlife which feature so largely in our heritage of saga, poetry and folklore.</P>
    <P>I have dealt in some detail with the more important subheads of the Lands Vote.  As the remaining items are either unchanged from last year or else are token provisions, they do not seem to call for specific comment, but if Deputies wish to obtain further information about them I shall, of course, gladly supply it.  I propose therefore to continue by reviewing the principal activities of the Land Commission during the year ended 31st March last.  In some instances the statistics are still provisional but they are unlikely to vary to any significant extent from the final returns.  The overall results are quite satisfactory.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="829" /> On the acquisition side, the aggregate area inspected during the year was 60,000 acres while the total intake of land amounted to about 33,000 acres. As the total area in the acquisition machine at 31st March, 1969, amounted to some 83,000 acres, acquisition prospects for the current year are good.</P>
    <P>As regards land settlement for the year the total area allotted amongst some 1,582 allottees was in the region of 30,700 acres.  The acreage distributed included the provision of 55 fully-equipped holdings for migrants and the rearrangement of 348 fragmented holdings.  In all 125 new dwellinghouses and 118 new out-offices were provided for tenants and allottees during the year.  With the increased funds which are now being made available I am hopeful that an accelerated rate of land division can be achieved in the present year.</P>
    <P>The vesting of holdings and allotments was continued and, in all, about 2,600 holdings, parcels and rights of turbary were dealt with.  Tenanted land&mdash;including residues of CDB estates&mdash;outstanding for vesting at 31 March, 1969, comprises approximately 5,700 holdings.  These residual holdings, situated for the most part in western congested counties, now represent the remaining hard core of difficult tenanted land cases: they are being released for vesting according as the necessary rearrangement, enlargement or other improvement is carried out.</P>
    <P>The position as regards collection of land annuities continues satisfactory. Out of a collectable total of £2,772,120 for the year, the amount actually collected by 31 March, 1969, was £2,650,352.</P>
    <P>When replying to the debate on last year's Estimate my predecessor referred to the fact that he was examining how we can strengthen the economy of the small farmer by encouraging more co-operation.  For some time past the idea of a system of group farming has been under consideration and study in my Department. Group farming can range from a simple arrangement for the joint purchase of materials, such as time or <Col N="830" /> fertilisers, to a more integrated system involving the pooling of land, labour, equipment and resources.  The experiment in group farming which has been initiated will involve the pooling of all resources of the group, including the land itself.  The participants will form themselves into a company and the land as well as the livestock, machinery etc. will be owned and managed by the company.  The envisaged arrangement is entirely voluntary.</P>
    <P>Experience elsewhere indicates that group farming is not devoid of inherent problems and careful appraisal of the advantage to be gained is necessary before embarking on the system on a wide scale.  I am satisfied, however, that the potentialities and possibilities of promoting this type of farming project can be rewarding.  Should it prove to be so, I am hopeful that a new dimension can be added to the scope of Land Commission activities and that group farming will prove a useful means of raising farm income and rural living standards, particularly in areas of small-scale farming.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know there is now in operation a system of direct control by the Land Commission over the purchase of rural land by persons who are not &ldquo;qualified persons&rdquo; as defined in section 45 of the Land Act, 1965&mdash; principally non-nationals.  The position generally now is that no interest in non-urban land can vest in a person who does not come within the categories of &ldquo;qualified person&rdquo; as defined in section 45 (1) of the Act except with the written consent of the Land Commission.  In general permission is not granted to non-nationals to purchase land in order to engage simply in those forms or lines of production commonly practised by our farmers; &ldquo;white-elephant&rdquo; properties unable or unlikely to attract Irish purchasers in the market could be entertained for sale to outsiders.  A non-national who could illustrate that he was going in for some special line with expertise and capital to back it up, and with export possibilities, could very well be acceptable.  During the past year&mdash;apart from what might be called unobjectionable transactions, that is to say those (a) arising solely from mortgage <Col N="831" /> interests, (b) involving areas not exceeding five acres and (c) representing transfers between one non-citizen, individual or company, and another&mdash;the total acreage in respect of which the consent of the Land Commission, pursuant to section 45 of the Act, was given to the vesting of interests in land in non-qualified persons as individuals or companies controlled by non-citizens was 4,767 acres.  A substantial proportion of the acreage involved consisted of the types of property which could hold no attraction for the ordinary Irish purchaser.  The corresponding area for the previous year was 4,500 acres.</P>
    <P>The improvement of farm structure in western areas commands a key position in the Land Commission order of priorities.  The structural reform of sub-standard holdings coupled with the elimination of fragmentation and rundale is a prerequisite to the development of any purposeful agricultural programme in the west.</P>
    <P>The overall ambition of land policy is to establish sound and worthwhile agricultural units, satisfying to the owner, in which productivity can be raised and which in turn will yield their quota in the campaign for competitive export of farming produce.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Forestry Vote there is a net increase of £403,000 in the amount being provided for 1969-70 compared with that provided for 1968-69.</P>
    <P>The Estimate as framed provides for a full planting programme of 25,000 acres.  There was uncertainty when the Estimate was being framed as to whether this target could be achieved. It is now clear that we cannot reach that figure and this year's programme will be of the order of 22,000 to 23,000 acres.  The difficulty continues to be the inadequacy of our plantable reserve and, while the tide appears to be turning, as will be seen when I deal later with subhead C.1, it now seems probable that we will not be able to get back to the full 25,000 acre programme until 1971-72.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of Deputies to a new head of subhead C.2 &mdash;Forest Development and Management&mdash;entitled <Col N="832" /> Amenity Development. It is subhead C.2 (4) for which £75,000 is being provided in the current year. We have become increasingly conscious of the fact that in the process of developing State forestry as a form of commercial investment, we have developed at the same time a priceless amenity asset.  State forests are attractive and as they mature they increasingly attract both local residents and tourists.  In recent years we have been actively seeking, in consultation with Bord Fáilte and county councils, to foster this by opening suitable State forests to an increasing extent for public use.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, of course, be aware of the existence of Gougane Barra Forest Park, of the John F. Kennedy Park, County Wexford, of substantial public facilities at Glengarriff and of the major Forest Park construction in progress at Lough Key near Boyle, County Roscommon. They may not be so well aware that scattered throughout the country are many other forest areas in which facilities are being developed to enable the public to enjoy their amenities to a greater extent.  For the most part these have been provided as part of the normal forest programme.  Roads are necessary for all forest traffic; it costs no more to let people walk on them. What is necessary is the addition of footpaths, picnic facilities, access to particular viewpoints and so forth.  The multiple use concept of the forest is now well established and it can be realised without interference with the main object of the forest undertaking which is the production of commercial timber. I foresee a steadily growing emphasis on the use of State forests for recreation, conservation and amenity purposes and the provision of £75,000 under this new head gives formal recognition to the development work required to provide for these activities.</P>
    <P>Turning to the detail of the Estimate, there are no significant changes in subheads C.3, D or F.  So far as the remaining subheads are concerned the following is the position.</P>
    <P>Salaries, wages and allowances&mdash; subhead A&mdash;at £1,099,990 shows an increase of £64,990 over the provision <Col N="833" /> for 1968-69.  The increased provision covers the normal growth of the inspectorate and forester staff in line with the expansion of the State forests and some strengthening of the administrative and engineering staff.  It also includes provision for expenditure arising from the 11th round of pay increases.</P>
    <P>Travelling, and incidental expenses&mdash; subhead B.1&mdash;at £227,700 shows an increase of £26,700 over the 1968-69 provision because of increased travelling arising from the continued expansion of the State forest area and provision for some increase in travel costs and miscellaneous expenses.</P>
    <P>Post office services&mdash;Subhead B.2&mdash; at £66,600 shows an increase of £15,000 over the 1968-69 Estimate arising from the increased cost of postage and handling of stores and the extension of forest telephone services.</P>
    <P>Subhead C.1 is the grant-in-aid for the acquisition of land.  The balance in the fund on 1st April, 1968, was almost £262,000; with a new provision of £175,000, a total of £437,000 was available for purchase of land in 1969-70.</P>
    <P>Expenditure in 1968-69 was £123,261 in respect of a productive area of 12,231 acres acquired in 288 transactions. This was completely inadequate against a planting target of 25,000 acres per annum.  The nominal plantable reserve now stands at about 53,000 acres but, as this includes many areas which for one reason or another are not immediately available for planting, the true reserve is about 35,000 acres.</P>
    <P>The House has already been advised in previous years of the problems arising from an inadequate land reserve which have prevented the forestry service from maintaining its target of 25,000 acres per annum for the last few years.  While one cannot with certainty look into the future, I am happy to inform the House that there are now good grounds for hope that we have at last turned the corner on the land acquisition problem.  Present indications, including the amount of lands on offer in the pipeline, are that the new price structure for forest lands coupled with the streamlined procedure for offer and inspection have had the <Col N="834" /> desired effect and that the land reserve position is likely to improve substantially over the next few years.  Deputies will realise that such an improvement is not alone necessary as a basis for resumption of the full 25,000 acres per annum planting programme but is critically important as an aid to better planning of forest work programmes and the maintenance of steady employment levels.</P>
    <P>Forest Development and Management&mdash;subhead C.2&mdash;at £3,766,000 is, of course, the main expenditure subhead in this Vote.  The work funded out of the subhead includes amenity development, which I referred to in my opening remarks, but the major provisions in the subhead relate to the raising of nursery stock in the State forest nurseries, the establishment costs of all new planting including ground preparation and fencing, road and bridge construction, the purchase and maintenance of all forest machinery and the hire of suitable machinery from outside sources, the general cost of maintaining and protecting all our existing acreage of forest plantations, now standing at over half a million acres in extent, and finally the cost of such timber felling and conversion as we now undertake by direct labour in our forests.  The provision in the subhead shows an overall increase in cost of £493,000 on the provision for 1968-69.  The increase includes provision for the cost of 11th round of wage increases for forestry workers as negotiated in 1968 as well as for the cost of a reduction in working hours. It also included provision for a service pay scheme for forestry workers.  The total sum provided for labour under the various heads is £2,773,000.</P>
    <P>In framing the Estimate no allowance was, of course, made for the extension of the 11th round which has this year been granted to forestry workers.  This represents £1 5s 0d per worker from the 1st June of this year and a further £1 per worker from the 1st October as well as an adjustment in the rate of incentive bonus payable to workers and will involve additional expenditure of £300,000 in the current year on this subhead.</P>
    <P>These increases in labour costs make <Col N="835" /> it necessary to pursue with increasing vigour the aim of cost reduction which has over the years been a primary concern of the forestry service.  The pioneering of work study on a large scale in forest establishment phases has been progressively extended into method improvement and at the present juncture there is no aspect of our field operations which has not been subjected to rigorous scrutiny in regard to specifications and objectives&mdash;the overall aim being that every pound spent should yield a return in terms of volume or quality of timber in the long term.</P>
    <P>Nursery practice has benefited considerably from improved technology and very substantial improvements in unit costs have been achieved.  Overall expenditure on planting has fallen in sympathy with the fall in planting programme but costs have also been affected significantly by the absence from recent planting programmes of any considerable content of scrub clearance on old woodland areas, an operation which has a very high labour content.  Such areas in private hands are now commonly being reclaimed under land project grant and are less readily available than formerly for acquisition for forestry; where such areas are still acquired, we have been cutting our preparation costs by new methods.</P>
    <P>Progress on road construction is maintained to keep pace with timber extraction requirements but, so far as practicable, expenditure on road construction is normally deferred as long as possible to conserve capital and to ensure that the planning of road systems will be carried out with the best knowledge of technological improvements and will take into account improvements in extraction machinery on which a lot of development work is being done in the big timber-producing countries.  In maintenance operations, the area of plantations requiring maintenance is growing from year to year but improvements in techniques, particularly in the use of chemical herbicides, have made possible some substantial reductions in unit costs of labour.</P>
    <P>The balance of all these factors has <Col N="836" /> tended in recent years towards a gradually reducing requirement of labour in real terms although the absolute cost of labour has risen very considerably.  The net effect is that average employment in the current year will be at a somewhat lower level than last year's figure of 3,677 men but the reduction is almost entirely in casual employment.  There is, in fact, a continuing trend towards more stable and, therefore, more useful employment in the State forests.  Of the gross total being provided for forestry in this Estimate, 73 per cent is being spent on labour, including salaries, wages and allowances.</P>
    <P>The rapid extension of State forests in recent years has meant that well over half of the 500,000 acres now under State forests are vulnerable to fire danger.  It is, of course, in the early years of growth that forests in this country are most vulnerable.  The extension of a multiple land use policy, to which I have already referred, while mainly associated with more mature forests inevitably brings the public into contact with the younger forest areas, and therefore increases the hazard of accidental fire.  We have been heartened by the increased consciousness of people of the usefulness of the State forests and of their potential as a pleasant environment.  We believe that this consciousness is growing and that recreational facilities for the public in our forests is our best fire insurance. Nonetheless every year several hundred acres of State forests planted at the people's expense are destroyed through acts of carelessness or negligence.  May I use this forum to appeal again to every member of the community to exercise that little extra care in or near State forests that will ensure that no act of theirs will leave a scarred, burnt-out area which can only be restored with time and at heavy cost to the tax payer?</P>
    <P>Forestry education&mdash;subhead E&mdash;a minor increase on this head was needed to cover increases in allowances to forestry trainees and the full expenditure requirements of the new Avondale Forestry Extension School.</P>
    <P>The new extension school is a very important addition to the forestry service's <Col N="837" /> staff training system.  In recent years, forest authorities throughout the world have found it necessary to reappraise critically all the accepted norms of traditional forest management in order to meet the impact of rising costs and keen competition in world trade.  We, as a country engaged in large-scale capital investment in new forests, saw the warning lights at a relatively early stage and we have been progressively overhauling our whole approach to forestry over the past decade or more.  We pioneered the application of modern work study methods to the crop establishment phases of forest work and there has been a continuing forward movement both in forestry techniques and practice and in the introduction of modern management techniques.  With continuing change and development, it is critically important to have constant provision for updating staff-training and the new extension school is already providing a very valuable service here.  The school is used continuously for short refresher and intensive courses for forest service personnel at all levels.  It will play a very important part in the management structure of the forest service.</P>
    <P>The John F. Kennedy Park&mdash;sub-head G&mdash;at £26,000 shows a reduction of £103,000 on the provision for 1968-69. The provision for 1968-69 included major capital charges, whereas the current provision is, in the main, in respect of plants and labour.  It is expected that actual expenditure will exceed the provision by some £18,000 mainly because of charges that did not mature for payment last year.  The excess will be met by economies on other heads of the Vote.  Considerable progress has already been made in extending the range of trees and shrubs in the park which, apart altogether from its scientific importance, is becoming a major tourist attraction.  It has already become necessary to double the size of the large car-park originally provided there.  The need for a catering facility to provide light meals has also become apparent and plans are in hand to provide this.  In its first year since opening, the park attracted over 100,000 visitors and very many of these visitors have written to the Department making <Col N="838" /> favourable comment on the park and on the facilities provided there.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the nucleus of the fund for the development of the park came from the Kennedy Memorial Committee in America&mdash;an organisation representing most of the Irish-American Societies in the United States.  They undertook to provide a fund of $100,000 towards the park and this they had achieved before the park was formally opened in May, 1968.  The American Committee have in fact exceeded their target and within the last few weeks I received from their representatives a further contribution of £19,000 representing about $45,000. I am sure the House will join with me in expressing appreciation of the support given by the Irish-American Societies concerned to this important project.</P>
    <P>Under subhead H, Appropriations-in-Aid, allowance has been made in the Estimate for an increase of £129,500 in revenue from timber sales. Markets for both sawlog material and pulpwood continue buoyant and I am hopeful that this additional revenue will be secured.  The indications for the future continue to be of a steady increase in output of small dimension material for which markets are available for some time ahead in existing processing industries.  In sawlogs we expect to maintain and slightly increase present production over the next few years.</P>
    <P>As to future prospects for industrial development in the timber processing field, H.A. Simons Ltd. of Vancouver, a firm of consultants in pulp and paper commissioned jointly by the IDA and the Minister for Lands, have reported that expansions by the existing mills in the fields of chipboard and hardboard production for export markets and newsprint for domestic consumption provide the most promising outlets at this stage for our expanding production of pulpwood.  Expansions planned by these existing industries will absorb the growth in pulpwood availability up to about 1975 and the study made by the consultants suggests that a review of the position should be carried out in the early 1970's; the consultants advised that no <i>ad hoc</i> or piece-meal <Col N="839" /> industrial projects should be encouraged in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The Forestry Division has in hands a new long-term production forecast which will be available next year and this forecast will provide the necessary background for a further review of progress and possibilities in this field of industrial expansion.  The report by the consultants contains information on the present activities and expansion projects of the existing industries which is confidential to the individual companies concerned and was supplied under conditions of confidence.  For this reason, the full report is not being published.</P>
    <P>An undertaking of significance in relation to the future marketing of our timber is the research into the properties of Irish-grown timber which is being carried out for my Department by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, the cost of which is borne on subhead F of this Estimate. Reports on some of our timber species have already been published and, in relation to strength properties and other essential characteristics, the results have been most encouraging.  The programme of testing is continuing and will cover all species which are of importance in our planting programme.</P>
    <P>I made reference in dealing with the Lands Vote to European Conservation Year 1970.  Responsibility for the organisation of Conservation Year has been assigned by the Government to my Department and very satisfactory progress has already been made in building up contacts and establishing a National Committee with various working committees to co-ordinate the programme for the year in this country and to plan activities on a national scale.  A provision for expenditure in connection with Conservation Year will appear in the Forestry Estimate for 1970-71.  No expenditure of any consequence will arise during the current year and such incidental expenses as may be incurred for preliminary promotion work can be met from appropriate subheads of this year's Estimate.</P>
    <P>The basic aim of European Conservation Year is to make the people of Ireland and of every other European country aware of their fundamental <Col N="840" /> interest in preservation of the natural environment&mdash;soil, air, water and plant and animal life.  Here, as in other countries, such awareness is the first requisite if the community as a whole is to learn to co-operate in maintaining and fostering the many values of its natural heritage now and in the years to come.  This is an aim to which the Government give their full support and the Taoiseach has accepted an invitation to act as Ireland's representative on the European Board of Patrons for Conservation Year.</P>
    <P>During 1970 activities will be organised at national and local level and I would ask Deputies to lend their full support to the efforts being made.  The importance of nature conservation has been highlighted by recent examples of damage to scenery and environment and by the attention directed to some bad cases of pollution.  The object of Conservation Year, let me emphasise, is not to seek out scapegoats or to indulge in recrimination against anybody. Rather is it the purpose the better to equip people at all levels in the community with an understanding of the basic values of the environment, the ways in which it may be damaged and the ultimate cost to the community of such damage.  In that way we can lay a firm foundation on which to base decisions as to protective measures which will themselves cost money and can only be justified if the expenditure is seen to be necessary and worthwhile. It is an inescapable fact of life, too long unrecognised throughout the world, that modern civilisation with all its economic and technological advances, enormously increases the sources and extent of environmental damage.  Economic and technological advance is necessary to survival but it must be so orientated as to minimise and, where possible, eliminate damage. I believe the programme of activity which is being prepared for Conservation Year will take us a major stride forward.</P>

      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for re-consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not satisfied with the progress that has been made to date, and we are <Col N="841" /> not satisfied that the Irish Land Commission as organised at present can accomplish the work which remains to be accomplished between now and our entry into the EEC.  The land of Ireland, on which the prosperity of each and every one of us and, indeed, the nation, depends, for far too long has been made the plaything of party politics and party politicians.  Cumainn and clubs have been kept alive for as long as 20 years by Deputies promising to divide So-and-So's farm.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister for Lands here last week again showed political bias when he stated that, as far as Fianna Fáil were concerned, auctioneers attached to the party got the jobs in particular counties or particular areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be.  It is very hard to know.  The people who are looking for land would not agree with Deputy O'Donovan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Second Programme for <Col N="842" /> Economic Expansion published a few years ago, it was envisaged that 70,000 people would leave the land of Ireland between then and 1972.  So, we may take it that roughly another 40,000 will leave the land of Ireland inside the next three or four years.  We know that about 10,000 people are leaving the land each year.  Unfortunately, the people who are leaving the land tend to be the young and the ambitious, those who are, I suppose, less likely to accept lower living standards or limited opportunities.  At the same time, they are the people who if given a chance could contribute to the building up of a healthy rural community.</P>
    <P>I agree that many of our farms are so small and so infertile that no conceivable level of commodity prices could provide the potential owners in the 1970s with an acceptable standard of living.  The young people today are not prepared to put up with the drudgery that their fathers and mothers did for years. They see their brothers and sisters going into the towns and getting good employment and having money to jingle in their pockets.  It is not surprising that they are not prepared to stay at home and work hard.  I think it is the ideal of all parties here that we must have a bigger rural community with a vigorous rural family as the basis of the rural community.  This can only be achieved if the State can provide the rural community with an acceptable standard of living and adequate outlets for their talents and ambitions.</P>
    <P>The conclusion is inescapable: that a major reorganisation of the structure of the Irish Land Commission is necessary to ensure that the maximum amount of land is acquired within the next few years.  The Irish Land Commission as at present constituted has outlived its usefulness.  Major reforms of State activities in the rural development field are necessary.  The Irish Land Commission is too conservative; it is lacking in drive and initiative.  The time has arrived for the establishment of a rural development authority, controlled perhaps by farmers and other rural interests, who would take over many of the operational functions of <Col N="843" /> the Department of Lands and of the Forestry Division.</P>
    <P>This national rural development authority would act as the top level advisory group reporting direct to the Minister in person.  Secondly, in order to get the co-operation of all, there would be county or regional organisations run jointly by the rural development authority staff, representatives of such organisations as the NFA, Macra na Feirme, Young Farmers' Clubs, as well as any other bodies or individuals with a special contribution to make. The local organisation would have full executive power within its own area.  It may be interesting to point out that the suggestion I have just made is fully supported by the Devlin Report from which I quote:</P>
    <P>There is a number of clear logical reasons why the Departments of Agriculture and Lands should be combined, the principal of these which are (a) the opportunity of securing closer co-ordination and planning with the agricultural functions of Government and the possibility of co-ordinating more closely and managing more effectively the many field activities involved.</P>
    <P>The report also follows closely the lines I have suggested by recommending that the executive work of both Departments should be separated from the central authority by assigning to it executive units which would be decentralised with large regional staffs.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that local enthusiasm and initiative are essential for any successful programme of land division. Such initiative and enthusiasm can only be stimulated by delegating to farmers and their advisers at local authority level to take decisions about the development of land and farms and also control of the funds needed to do it.  We all agree in this House that as many as possible of the 10,000 to 14,000 young boys and girls who are leaving the land every year should be given employment in their own country. They are the cream of society.  It is the desire of each and every one of us to provide employment for every able-bodied person in this country. Because our resources are limited many <Col N="844" /> people have no alternative but to emigrate.</P>
    <P>If we look back over the past fifty years since we got control of our own destiny, we see that things do not proceed as was envisaged by the people of 1916 and others who fought for our right to govern ourselves.  From figures I got last year from the Taoiseach it is evident that even since 1932, 1,300,000 people have left this country, and over 1,000,000 of those came from the land of Ireland.  The Government have dismally failed to recognise our national responsibility to provide those who no longer wish to continue in farming with an alternative career within the country.  The Land Commission have also failed.  I do not want to say that any Government or any Minister could in a short time provide full employment for all our people, but I do suggest that the Land Commission have not done all they could have done and have not worked fast enough in that direction.</P>
    <P>We are at a slight disadvantage because we did not get the Minister's speech until he was almost finished dealing with the Department of Lands, so I hope that if we quote some figures that are not absolutely correct he will understand.  The Minister spoke about the cash payment for farmers.  I should like to quote from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 22nd November, 1966, in which there is a report of a press interview with the Minister at which that scheme was announced:</P>
    <P>A scheme under which the Land Commission would offer a cash payment or pension in exchange for small farms throughout the country is being worked out by the Department of Lands.  It is expected that about 15,000 people over 65 years of age will take part in the scheme. The Land Commission plans in this way to be able to take over and utilise small farms, to enlarge other farms and make them into economic units.  The broad outlines of the scheme were announced by the Minister for Lands in the White Paper and were again discussed during the Estimates for the Department. The figures are now being revised and it is thought that more <Col N="845" /> precise details may be ready within the next few months.  It is estimated that there are about 60,000 farms occupied by people over 60 years of age, about 6,000 of whom are living alone.</P>
    <P>We were informed, there, that the figure was 15,000.  The officials in the Department must have given very bad information at that time.  The Minister gave figures in his speech here today which indicate that in the first year, 1967, only one person surrendered his land.  In the next year there were 17 and up until now the total number of people who have surrendered their lands under this scheme is 22.  Something drastic will have to be done in regard to this scheme.</P>
    <P>In his speech last year the Minister for Lands was inclined to pat himself on the back about the progress being made in the scheme which was introduced under section 6 of the Land Act, 1965, for an annuity scheme to encourage elderly, incapacitated, or blind farmers to retire.  The figures given at that time, and the figures I have just given, suggest there must be serious weaknesses in this scheme.  The Minister told us today that, of between 375 and 380 applicants received under the scheme 138, almost half, were eliminated.  I will quote the Minister's own words that the reason for this elimination was because &ldquo;the lands concerned were not found suitable&rdquo;.  If suitability is to be the criterion of whether or not an applicant will be accepted for an annuity this will mean that the most urgent cases, the cases which it should be our prime object to deal with, are going to be eliminated. Furthermore, I think it needs to be accepted that in many cases the price to be paid in the form of an annuity will have to be somewhat more than the actual market value of the land to the Land Commission.  The fact is that a scheme of this kind should be considered not strictly as an economic operation but as a social welfare one as well.  It is desirable that a significant number of people no longer effectively able to earn a decent living on their farms be helped to retire.</P>
    <P>The aim of the scheme was to increase the pool of land available for division amongst uneconomic holders. <Col N="846" /> I think the Minister will have to alter this scheme.  I am not certain if he mentioned his intention to do so in his speech, but I would suggest that it needs to be altered and that he should provide more attractive pensions, or some other compensation, for these people.  The pensions or the compensation envisaged in the scheme must have proved completely inadequate because instead of the 15,000 people we were told would avail of the scheme only 22 have done so.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the market value of the holding is an adequate basis for a scheme of this kind since it is those whose holdings have the lowest marketable value who need&mdash;as the Minister will agree&mdash;most assistance. For the younger people who wish to pursue alternative careers in the rural community a new drive to provide employment opportunities in industry, tourism and forestry should be started. This programme should include better special training schemes, resettlement allowances and the provision of houses. Some of the grants have not been changed for a number of years and they certainly need to be increased at the present time.</P>
    <P>I agree that it is the duty of this House to furnish the Land Commission with different ways and means to be used in a determined effort to build up basic farm structure.  It is also our duty to ensure that the powers and the finances of the Land Commission be adequate to meet the needs at home and abroad at the present time.</P>
    <P>The farmers in this country are entitled, as are all other sections of the community, to a fair deal and a fair standard of living.  Many of the small landowners in the congested areas in the past have not received this.  We have to ensure that the small landowner no longer remains the hewer of wood and the drawer of water.  When the Minister for Lands was speaking on the Land Bill in 1963 he said:</P>
    <P>...that voluntary bodies addressed themselves in workmanlike fashion to a study of the structural problems of Irish land-holding and they submitted very informative papers to the Taoiseach and to the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="847" /> I should like to know what has happened to this because we do not seem to have changed or to have made the desired progress since then.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to bear in mind the necessity for carrying out as much of the groundwork as possible during the next few months in an effort to build up as big a pool of land as we possibly can before we join the European Economic Community.  The fact that there has been a delay in our entry in the last few years should be a Godsend as far as land division is concerned, but we must make the fullest use of the breathing space afforded us to acquire as much land as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be interested to hear the Deputy's views of what the likely effects on land structure our entry into the EEC would have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I may deal with that later on.  I think it must be agreed, as far as we are all concerned and as far as the future structure is concerned, that it must be based on the traditional family farm.  In the 1920s and 1930s a 20-acre farm was regarded by the Land Commission as an economic unit.  In the 1940s the minimum acreage required to be regarded as an economic unit was increased to 30. In the 1960s it was increased to 45 and, by present standards, it could be argued that the minimum acreage required to give farmers an opportunity of earning a decent livelihood is 50 or 60 acres.</P>
      <P>I agree that the available pool of land is limited and that the Irish Land Commission must do the best they can for the greatest number with that pool of land while at the same time making the family farm capable of giving the family a standard of living comparable with that available to similar families engaged in non-agricultural pursuits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the minimum size of family farm now aimed at is 45 acres of good land or its equivalent in land of mixed quality but it can be argued that this is an unrealistic target having regard to the kind of figures recently <Col N="848" /> published by the Irish Agricultural Institute on farm incomes.  For example, assuming that a man has one of these 45-acre farms, that he was using it averagely efficiently and that he was engaged in creamery milk operations, according to the figures we have seen recently, he could expect a farm income of £650 per year.  We know that at the present time an agricultural labourer is entitled to almost that amount.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>More.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>He is entitled to £150 more a year.  In the light of returns from other occupations and the standard of living which the young farmer expects and will increasingly demand in the 1960s, this is a completely unrealistic figure.  This target is not only meaningless but is mischievous. It means that the Irish Land Commission is working away at the present moment establishing farm units which even now are uneconomic in terms of the income they produce and are likely to be less viable in future as standards and expectations rise.</P>
      <P>It is also interesting to note that the Devlin Report states that the original objectives of the Land Commission are now virtually achieved.  I am not inclined to agree with that. There is a great deal of valuable work for the Irish Land Commission to do in the next few years.  I suppose this is a problem facing the whole country. Unfortunately, as regards farm incomes we seem to be losing ground. The gap is becoming larger and larger as between those engaged in industrial and other pursuits and those engaged on the land.  A few years ago I got figures from the Taoiseach which indicated that the gap was around £3 10s. Now it is moving to £5 or £5 10s. per week.  Therefore, it will be much more difficult in the years ahead to get people to stay on the land.  The same problems arise universally.  The late Holy Father, Pope John XXIII, writing of the depressed state of small landowners a few years ago had some pertinent questions to ask.  I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What can be done to ensure that agricultural living standards approximate as closely as possible to <Col N="849" /> those enjoyed by city dwellers who draw their resources either from industry or the public services in which they are engaged?  What can be done to persuade agricultural workers that far from being inferior to other people they have every opportunity of developing their personalities through their work and can look forward to the future with confidence?</P>
    <P>The answer to these questions cannot in the nature of things be simple but in order to ensure that agricultural living standards approximate as closely as possible those enjoyed by city dwellers we must have larger family farms, we must aim at farms nearer to 60 acres than to 40 acres.</P>
    <P>There is no use in making that case without admitting that in achieving this there is bound to be a reduction in the number of families engaged on the land because, as I said earlier, it is admitted that the people on the land will not tolerate the conditions that their fathers and mothers experienced. Therefore, many small farms may come on the market.  The Department should give every help to uneconomic holders to purchase such farms so as to make their holdings viable or, alternatively, the Irish Land Commission should acquire them and divide them amongst uneconomic holders in the area.  This is desirable but I want to impress upon the Minister that there is a very dangerous trend creeping in, that business people and professional people, doctors, solicitors and others, are at present bidding for and are acquiring land to the detriment of smallholders.  I suppose very little can be done in that respect.  I am not certain if anything can be done about it.  As I stated earlier, an increase to 60 acres means that there will be fewer people on the land of Ireland.  Nobody wants deliberately to reduce the number of families engaged in farming so as to bring about some arbitrary increase in the acreage size of farms but the Department and the country will have to face up to this problem. The aim of all should be to achieve social justice through economic progress and economic progress through social justice.  We all want to see an end to drudgery on the land.  We all <Col N="850" /> want to see established on the land of Ireland sound economic family units who will work the land in their own interest and in the interest of the country and that the people living on the land will live in ordinary frugal comfort. They ask no more and they seek no less.</P>
    <P>I admit that there is a huge problem facing the Department at the present time.  I got figures last week from the Minister for Lands.  While there are now 353,000 farms in Ireland, leaving out farms of from one-quarter acre to one acre, we find that in the province of Leinster there are still 31,230 farmers who have less than 30 acres of land and every one of those can certainly be regarded as an uneconomic holder.  In Munster, we find that there are 31,076 farms of from five to 30 acres.  In Connacht, there are 49,333 farms of between five and 30 acres and these are certainly all uneconomic holdings.  In the three counties of Ulster there are 25,086 such farms.  Therefore, there are 136,725 farms of between five and 30 acres of land out of a total of 353,845 farms.  In other words, almost 45 per cent of the farms in Ireland can be classified as uneconomic holdings, because, as I stated, generally speaking all holdings under £20 valuation and roughly 30 acres of land are uneconomic and, according to this criterion. we have today this enormous figure of 136,000 uneconomic holders all looking for whatever land is available for division.  Even if we were to get the Six Counties in the morning, uninhabited, there would not be enough land to solve our congestion problem Though these holdings are uneconomic their owners have not been idle or lazy.  If they were lazy they would have disappeared long ago like so many of their countrymen, who had bigger resources but who, nevertheless, left the land.</P>
    <P>We would like to see all farmers with a maximum of 55 to 60 acres but we are all aware of the scarcity of land.  The solution to the problem lies in intensified production, higher capital investment and more intensive agricultural advisory services.  Farmers in Rush, five or six miles from the city, can make a good living on five or six <Col N="851" /> acres under glass or farmed intensively. If a great many more farmers engaged in the same kind of intensive production there would be a glut and it would become uneconomic to continue producing.  We know there are very small farms with large enterprises and very large farms with very small enterprises. That cannot be denied.  We know, too, that the man with 30 acres carrying on intensive dairying, combined with an efficient pig or poultry unit, may have a larger output than the man with 100 acres producing cattle.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the new designs for houses and out-offices.  We all welcome these.  For too long it was possible to identify the Land Commission house.  That was quite wrong. The Land Commission should move with the times and keep abreast of developments in architecture and engineering. Houses and out-offices should be designed to such fashion as to enable the farmer and his wife to do their work with the maximum of efficiency and a minimum of labour. These houses should be showpieces, places to which young farmers could come when they want to build houses for themselves and their wives.  This is a welcome trend.  The Department and everybody concerned are to be congratulated on the improvement in design in both houses and out-offices.</P>
    <P>Last year, the Minister's predecessor stated at column 1135 of volume 236 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>It has been decided that all such lands are to be rehabilitated prior to allotment.  The rehabilitation consists of lime and fertiliser application and the cost is about £8 an acre.  In addition, the Land Commission are also doing the preliminary reclamation work on these lands, such as drainage, removal of scrub, eradication of rushes and so on.</P>
    <P>That is good work, but is there overlapping? Is the work done in conjunction with the land project or have the Land Commission their own trained staff?  I suppose there is a certain amount of overlapping, but the money is money well spent.  I thought <Col N="852" /> the sum last year a modest one and I think more money could be allocated for this purpose because it is, as I say, money well spent.</P>
    <P>I understand directions have been given that land is not to be held by the Land Commission beyond a certain period.  I think it is a year or two years.  At the end of that period it must be divided.  I trust that policy will be carried out in all counties.</P>
    <P>I have some criticism to offer with regard to water supply.  There seems to be some breakdown in liaison between the Land Commission and the ESB.  In January of 1968 six farmers came to Archerstown in Delvin.  They were told they would be supplied with water. They got in touch with me and I got in touch with the Department of Lands. I was told they would have the water as quickly as possible.  On 27th April I got in touch with the ESB and they told me the pump had not yet been ordered.  In the meantime these families were without water for over seven months.  The Land Commission should have notified the ESB of the requirements and placed their orders.</P>
    <P>There is an even worse case.  I have raised it with the Minister and with his predecessors.  This relates to the Whitehall Estate in Edgeworthstown. There are seven families there without water since 1962.  Wash handbasins and toilets have been installed but there was no water.  There is no water for domestic purposes and no water for stock.  I have raised this several times and each time I have been told the Land Commission is doing its best. Pumps were sunk but they proved ineffective.  Everyone should appreciate the hardship inflicted on small farmers who are left completely without water, even for human consumption.  Picture the position this year! There was no water for stock.</P>
    <P>In this particular case they had to travel three and four miles.  One or two families had tractors but others had to draw the water with the horse and cart.  That is completely wrong. I would ask the Minister to see if anything can be done about that particular case.  I do not like mentioning individual cases in this House but that has gone on for so long that I thought <Col N="853" /> the time had certainly come to mention it here.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention to the Minister the question of this double annuity structure imposed on all land distributed outside the congested area since the passing of the Land Act, 1963. In my opinion, it amounts to a rack rent annuity placed on newly-divided land. The Land Commission are finding it very hard in certain farms to get people despite the fact that the majority of small farmers are anxious to get extra land.  I know from land commissioners and from neighbours that in some cases they have had to bring five, six and seven families from Counties Mayo, Galway and other places to show them the land but when they heard the price they refused to take it.  They are getting away with the old annuity.</P>
    <P>There are many other people in the county who are asked to pay&mdash;some of them have accepted it and are paying it&mdash;as high as £17 per statute acre for land.  I know that some of this land for which they are now paying £17 was set for as low as £5 and some of it for £8 per acre.  It was put up in the open market for eleven months and that is the price it went for.  Some of those people are unable to pay this rack rent.  It is placing a real hardship and indeed an unbearable burden on many small farmers and especially on many small farmers who come from parts of Counties Longford, Cavan, Monaghan and from my own county because they are still outside the congested area.</P>
    <P>I think that portion of the county was designated a congested area by a British Act of 1906.  I do know that when the Bill was going through the Dáil the Minister for Agriculture did get power and permission and did inform us that other areas would be designated congested areas.  Certainly there are parts of Longford, Cavan and Monaghan where the land is much inferior to land in say, Roscommon, in parts of Galway and even in parts of Mayo which are in the congested area. I would ask the Minister, as regards those farmers who are getting this land outside the congested area and have to pay this rack rent annuity, even to <Col N="854" /> increase the number of years for repayment. I know many who have handed it back to the Land Commission. Others in my own county are about to hand it back.  They would dearly love to hold on to it if they saw any future.  If the Minister extended the period of repayment, the rent could be reduced.</P>
    <P>There is an Article in our Constitution which guarantees equal rights and equal opportunity to all our citizens and which speaks of being resolved to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the nation and of cherishing all the children of the nation equally.  Therefore, why should the small farmer from Longford, Cavan and Monaghan have to pay twice the price and the rent for land as the farmer coming from Roscommon, Galway or the counties in the congested areas?  I fully agree that there is a problem from Cork to Donegal, especially in Connacht.  Indeed, I believe it is not the fault of the people of the west.  They have a long and rugged history.  Perhaps, in the past, history has militated against them. But, in recent years, there is no denying that the tide seems to be running against them.</P>
    <P>Take a farmer from Longford who gets, say, 40 acres of land in Westmeath and has to pay £400 for that land.  A neighbour beside him, who comes from the congested area, has to pay only £200 for his 40 acres.  It is very hard to explain to those people the justice of the Department of Lands. I know that a case can be made for it but it is very difficult to explain it to them.  I think that the Department of Lands, indeed in co-operation with other Departments, will have to move faster perhaps in providing small industries and perhaps in planting more land to supplement the income of those particular people whom I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word about the mile limit.  In my opinion that mile limit should be abolished.  The aim and object of the Irish Land Commission should be to give land to people who need it most, who will make the best use of the land in their own interest and in the national interest.  The <Col N="855" /> mile limit may have had some relevance in the past when farmers were trying to do their work with the ass and cart and the horse and cart.  It is different nowadays.  Many of them have tractors and some have cars.  In any case, they have up-to-date machinery. I think that limit could be extended to three or four miles.  Under the present system, it is a game of luck. It is like winning the sweep as far as some people are concerned.  Unless a person in the midlands&mdash;in Westmeath, Meath, Kildare or any of those counties&mdash;happens to be living within one mile of a farm which is about to be divided he is ineligible.  In Westmeath, I have seen it happening: it can be very hard luck.  I have seen a young married man with six children who, because he was 100 yards outside the mile limit, could not be given a farm by the Land Commissioners.  A bachelor of 60 years of age who was living 100 yards inside the mile limit got the farm.  If the aim is to give the land of Ireland to those who will make best use of it, that mile limit rule should be abolished so that those people who would make first-class use of extra land, and have families, would qualify for it.  I also believe&mdash;it is a suggestion that cannot always be fulfilled&mdash;that local people in the majority of cases should be catered for when an estate is being divided and that migration within the counties should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>We know that at present farmers' sons and labourers are very far down the list of priorities.  I do not want to suggest to the Minister that he should open the sluice gates now.  I do not want to see every Tom, Dick and Harry eligible for land and getting it &mdash;in present circumstances&mdash;from the Irish Land Commission.  At the same time, the officers of the Irish Land Commission should have power and authority in certain cases.  A farmer's son or a labouring man who has availed of the Farm Apprenticeship Scheme or a young man who, through his own initiative and hard work has bought a tractor or jobbed in cattle and has built up a herd of 15, 20, 30 or 40 cattle should be entitled to a farm.  The Department should have a <Col N="856" /> scheme to help him purchase the farm or if not the Department should be able to supply money at a low rate of interest.  As I said, however, I do not want to see the sluice gates opened because that would leave far too many people eligible, but at the same time people who have shown this initiative are entitled to consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to game and this is something which could become a very valuable national asset.  We should consider the question of landowners securing these game rights. Much could be said about that.  Last year the Minister said that there were game councils for all counties but one and that by the following year he hoped to have one for all of the Twenty Six Counties.  I think that the Minister said that there are councils now for all of the Twenty Six Counties and that they are active and are receiving grants. They can do valuable work and they can assist tourism in the future.  Last year we were told that legislation regarding the conservation of game and wild life was proceeding and could the Minister tell us how far that legislation has proceeded and when will it be introduced?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that.  Another matter with which I should like to deal briefly is the matter of roads which are built by the Land Commission.  The Land Commission should do a better job in this regard than they are doing.  The majority of county councillors would be prepared to take them over if the Land Commission did a first class job but unfortunately they do not.  They are doing an inferior type of job and many of our engineers are afraid to touch the roads.  There has been an improvement in the past few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We dealt before with the question of land bonds and I do not want to go back over the same ground.  In reply to a Parliamentary Question the Minister did state last week that he intended to do something about land bonds.  Certainly I think that the operative date should be changed.  The present system is unfair and unjust, it <Col N="857" /> leads to delays and hinders and frustrates the acquisition of land and very few people have faith in it.  I instanced a case a few months ago of a man who sold his farm for £10,000. That was in December, 1967, and he was paid in September, 1968, and by then the land bonds had fallen to such an extent that when he went to cash them he only got £8,000 and thus lost £2,000.  I have a further case now in which the price was agreed in June, 1968.  The case involved a small farmer who agreed to facilitate the Land Commission, but if he had held out he could have got a much better price from local farmers.  The price agreed upon was £3,200 payable in 7½ per cent land bonds and the Land Commission paid the auctioneer's fees.  When the farmer sold them on the 14th August, 1968, they realised only £2,622 18s, involving &ldquo;Mr. A&rdquo; in a loss of about £578.  The bonds had fallen to £82 10s by early August.  Naturally this man is very aggrieved at this enormous loss, but he is only one of many.  I have suggested to the Minister that the operative date should be the date on which the land is handed over and not the date on which the agreement to purchase the land is made because a man could sell land on the 1st January, that is the date now operative, say the 1st January, 1968&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the date of possession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I want the date changed to the date on which it is finally handed over.  If there is a delay in handing over, as has happened in numerous cases, the bonds will have dropped by as much as £10 or £15. As Deputy O'Donovan has said they have dropped by 80 per cent in the last two years.  Is the Minister prepared to meet the people in that way?  Another hardy annual is that if land could be paid for in cash this would facilitate the creation of a bigger pool of land. On Wednesday 29th October, 1968, I asked a question about the total acreage of land which had been purchased each year since 1930 and so on, and the reply was that in 1964/ 65 it had been 43,000 acres and in the year before that 37,000 acres; in the <Col N="858" /> year after it was 38,000 and for four or five years around that time it was hovering around the 37,000-40,000 mark.  For the last few years it has been around 28,000 to 32,000 or 33,000.  I should like the Minister's comments on what is being done now to ensure that more land will be acquired in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>In regard to forestry, it may be the Cinderella of the Department of Lands but as far as rural Ireland is concerned it is of major importance.  Afforestation provides national wealth as well as permanent and worthwhile employment. At one time there were great forests in this country and thousands of acres were devoted to plantations.  I believe that we could accrue more wealth and give more employment through afforestation.  I am sorry to say that last year the Minister told us that 3,667 people were employed in forestry but the Minister did not quote the figure for this year but he did admit there had been a drop in the number of people employed.</P>
      <P>That is a pity because we have thousands of acres of cut-away bog every acre of which could be planted. They would be richly productive under forestry.  As it is, the bulk of this land is of little use.  We should go straight ahead and take the economic and financial steps necessary to develop all the natural resources of the country as quickly as possible.  We could double the output of our land if we utilised the whole of the bog and mountain land not suitable for agriculture for afforestation.  All our land not suitable for agriculture should be planted as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that the committee on Irish forestry appointed many years ago claimed at that time that our capacity to grow timber was as good as that of any other country, that our climate and marginal land were suitable.  Timber can produce valuable employment.  The full productive period for the wood pulp industry can be reached, and is reached here, in about 30 years.  The first thinnings for woodpulp actually begin at 20 years and, therefore, 20 years after planting waste land we get a return and we can also give employment <Col N="859" /> which is so necessary.  Timber for industries, I think, takes 40 to 45 years to produce.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about this in his speech in relation to future prospects for industrial development in the timber processing field.  He said that H.A. Simons Ltd. of Vancouver, a firm of consultants in pulp and paper, jointly commissioned by the IDA and the Minister for Lands had reported that expansions by the existing mills in the field of chipboard and hardboard production for export markets and newsprint for domestic consumption provide the most promising outlet at this stage for our expanding production of pulp-wood.  I am glad the Minister and the Department are taking action in that respect because we all agree that extra employment can be given in our mills, in the woodwork industry and in paper mills.  All this could be within our reach, in the use of woodpulp in the manufacture of paper, in the production of celluloid from pulp-wood, in the artificial silk industry which goes hand-in-hand with the textile industry, and in other industries arising from the utilisation of waste products of pulp mills such as ethyl-alcohol which is used in Sweden and Germany.</P>
    <P>Another and very desirable advantage relates to drainage and prevention of flooding.  Trees retard the run of water and forests act as a great sponge and make a river flow more equitably and prevent wastage of floodwater. Large-scale afforestation in this country could lessen the amount of public money that has to be expended each year on drainage.</P>
    <P>We have about 3,600 employed in forestry.  In Sweden, 150,000 men, of whom the majority are small farmers and agricultural workers, are employed in the forests in winter and return to farm work in the early spring.  Transport of timber from the forests to the saw-mills employs about 30,000 in the summer.  Some 50,000 are employed in saw-mills and in joinery factories and in wood pulp factories they employ another 20,000.  In all, about 250,000 people are employed in forestry work in Sweden.  Others are employed in <Col N="860" /> the manufacture of tar, wood tar, oil and many other valuable products. What has been done there could be done here.  Many people claim that with an ambitious programme we could double the number at present employed in forestry.</P>
    <P>Our rate of acquiring and planting land seems to be decreasing, which is a pity.  We did aim at planting 25,000 acres and in 1961-62 we acquired 31,781 acres.  In 1963-64 we acquired 29,000 acres; in 1968-69 we acquired only 14,108 acres or 17,000 acres less than we acquired seven years earlier. I should like to know from the Minister if the pool of land is running out. Those who travel through the country cannot believe that: wherever you go there are mountains and hills, and Bord na Móna seem to have much waste bogland.  Is there any consultation at present between Bord na Móna and the Irish Land Commission so that preparations could be made to ensure that when Bord na Móna hand over the bogs, forestry work could begin immediately.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;14,000 to 20,000 acres, in Japan they are planting at least 500,000 acres every year. <Col N="861" /> In Italy, where they had a great scheme of afforestation, some 16 per cent of their land is at present covered. In Sweden and Finland where there is great forestry wealth they are making an all-out effort and we need to do the same.  Even in England they are at present planting 60,000 acres of land. If we are to undertake the progressive programme which we would like to see, those engaged in forestry must wake up.  There will have to be more co-operation between the Department of Lands and the Forestry Division, Bord na Móna and others charged with this work because we seem to be falling down in this respect.</P>
      <P>I believe the Government and the Department could produce a very ambitious programme which would change the appearance of our unused slopes and valleys.  By doing that we would provide employment and financial returns which would help the nation and we would also improve in many ways this country's climate.</P>

      <P>Let me deal now with the Mayomen as Ministers for Lands.  Beyond question the best Minister for Lands in this country over the past 30 years was the late Deputy Seán Moylan, because he was against land division.  He did not believe in i at all.  He put into operation the job of revesting the hundreds of thousands of holdings and allotments that had been left there by previous Ministers.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties about men from County Mayo is that a large number of holdings in Mayo were not anything like economic holdings.  The average holding in that county 15 or 20 years ago was something like 14 acres.  In the 30s to be a landowner meant that you could eat when other people might not be able to eat, but 14 acres of land still provided a miserable living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="862" /> I have a few queries for the Minister on the way he tackled the Estimate. I certainly want to make a complaint at his joining these two Votes together. There is no resemblance whatever between them.  It would have been much fairer to the House for the Minister to deal first with lands and then with forestry.  In fact, he did that in his statement but it would be much better if he let the House discuss the Lands Vote first and then the Forestry Vote. There is no connection whatever between the two except that they are both in the same area of Government.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission have been fidding around with the land of this country&mdash;even if we go back to the Land Act of 1923&mdash;for 46 years, and they have raked over some of it two or three times.  I want to remind the House and the Minister that the Romans divided all the land of Italy in six years.  A large part of this Vote is just slush.  I am talking about the Vote for the Department of Lands and not for the Forestry Division.  That is why I object to the two of them being linked together.  There is one item in it which is essential.  This is the contribution of £1¼ million to the Land Bonds Fund.  The country would be much better off if the rest of it were not there at all.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister how does it come about that there is a deficiency of income from untenanted land.  Normally this used to be a token sum. Last year it was under a token subhead of £5.  This year there is £5,000 in for it.  I do not understand how you could have a deficiency of income from untenanted land.  I notice that in the Appropriations-in-Aid there is a surplus in the rent and interest account of £29,000, but even that is down by £1,000 compared with last year.</P>
    <P>I also want to ask the Minister how it comes about that there should be an increase of ten in the staff of his Department at this stage of their operations.  I notice that the purchase branch is down by seven people as I would expect, but the Commissioners and secretariat is up from 163 to 199.  Whatever for?  What is the purpose of having these extra 36 <Col N="863" /> people?  I notice that the Land Commission inspectorate is up by 17.  What are they doing?  What purpose do they serve?</P>
    <P>There is a reduction also of 129 in the collection branch.  There are many people who believe that the Land Commission today should be only a collection branch.  I notice a job I had something to do with a long time ago is very nearly completed.  This is the job of revesting the purchase holdings. I notice, too, that over the past 20 years the number of purchase cases is down to 5,750.  I have the report for the year 1956-57.  In 1968-69 it went down from 6,750 to 5,750, as the Minister told us.</P>
    <P>As regards the allottees, in the year 1966-67, 139 holdings containing 4,900 acres, and 945 allotments containing 14,700 acres were revested under the Land Acts, 1923 to 1965, in tenants and allottees, respectively.  In addition, four allotments comprising 27 acres on registered holdings taken over in exchange for default were finally transferred to the allottees.  There are a number of these kind of figures through the report that really caused me considerable amusement.</P>
    <P>During the year 1966-67, 118 new dwellinghouses and 119 new outhouses were completed.  Repairs to seven existing houses were also effected.  This report contains a great deal of matter involving millions of pounds, yet there is paragraph after paragraph here and there with the most extraordinary figures.  The Land Acts 1923 to 1965 are referred to at page 16, paragraph 26, and it is stated that during the year ended 31st March, 1967, the number of additional holdings vested in the Land Commission under the Acts was six; these included two holdings comprising an area of 23 acres, representing a rental of £10, and a total purchase price of £102, vested under section 9 of the Land Act, 1931; three holdings comprising an area of 180 acres, representing a rental of £66, and a purchase price of £669, vested under section 44 of the Land Act, 1931, as amended by subsequent Land Acts; one holding comprising an area of six acres, <Col N="864" /> representing a rental of £7, and a total purchase price of £69, vested under section 10 of the Land Acts, 1927, as amended by section 38 of the Land Act, 1939.</P>
    <P>As a piece of precision writing it would be hard to beat that, but as a genuine contribution to anything it is worth just nothing.  It costs a certain amount of money to produce it, to print it and so on.  That money might just as well have been thrown into the Liffey.  The report is full of those types of oddments.  There are four main items in this report.  The total expenditure by the Land Commission is £5 million this year.  That is gross expenditure this year.  As I said, the only worthwhile part of that is the £1¼ which has to be provided for the Land Bonds Fund.  There is £1¼ million roughly for staff, and £800,000 for the purchase of land for cash.  That was started by Deputy Blowick&mdash;one of the Mayomen&mdash;with the sum of £20,000 under the 1956 Act, I think.  I am not quite precise about it.  At that time he put in £20,000.  He said there were cases where land was very cheap.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a figure for the average price for land last year as £75 an acre.  What are the Land Commission doing at present, buying land at a time when the price of land is sky high?  In other words they are adding to the inflated price of land. The other item is the item of over £1 million on the improvement of estates.  I notice again that the total amount of employment given in that was comparatively small.  Some 410 men were employed on the various improvement works and their wage bill amounted to £239,000.  Of course, I appreciate that the materials bought by the Land Commission gave employment also.  I do not want to overstate the case but, the only thing to do with the Land Commission is to wind it up as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>We had a number of Parliamentary Questions here over the last couple of weeks inquiring about whether a farm of nine acres, another of 22 acres or 23 acres and so on had been offered to the Land Commission.  If we are serious about our work, this is just fidding around.  I would hope now <Col N="865" /> that the Minister has become Minister for Lands, instead of, as Deputy L'Estrange suggested, doing more and more of this kind of thing, that he would get rid of the whole thing over the next three or four years.  Deputy L'Estrange read out some figures about the size of holdings.  I looked at these figures on one occasion and I noticed that the effect of the Land Commission in the west in adding to the size of holdings was less than the movement of people themselves off the land from the west, and, of course, instead of that movement declining, if the land is bad and the farms are small, it will increase.</P>
    <P>Why can the Land Commission not make up their minds as to what is an economic size of holding?  Before the war it was 22 acres and, of course, that was not really an economic size of holding.  It might be all right down in County Mayo but in County Meath where you needed two horses to do the ploughing because the land was heavy, it took about half the land to feed them.  Then it became 32 or 33 acres and now it is 45 acres.  What is the sense of this kind of thing?  If you think of the 22 acre holdings obviously they are now either uneconomic or they are sold to somebody else.</P>

      <P>You certainly have, I quite agree.  When land division was on a large scale during the Thirties, the idea the President, Mr. de Valera, had was that the halving of the annuities would pay for the cost of the land division.  Of course, it did for many years, because that sum of £1 million on the improvement of estates used to be £250,000, but the £250,000 was worth the £1 million now.  Many of the Land Commission bungalows&mdash;and I remember well the contracts going through&mdash;were built for £300.  They are now being built, I understand, for about £1,500.</P>
      <P>The whole thing is a hopeless exercise. It does not even give a worthwhile amount of employment.  Taking off the £1,250,000 that has to be put into the land bond fund to make up the halved annuities, you are left with something under £4 million.  Surely that sum could be used to better effect than providing employment for 1,000 civil servants?  The land would find its own level, like water, if it was left to the natural forces of the market.  All the Minister is doing is aggravating&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When the late Seán Moylan became Minister for Lands at the end of the war he decided to put <Col N="868" /> an end to land division and he did, in effect, put an end to it.  He used up whatever was in the pipeline and subsequent Ministers, being mainly from County Mayo where land is scarce and poor in quality, think that by dividing up land which should be kept in larger farms they are improving the economy of the country.</P>
      <P>Having said that much about the Vote for Lands, let me come on to a more pleasant task, that is, the task of talking about forestry.  It is a great pity the Land Commission did not get the land project.  It was taken into the Department of Agriculture when it should have been in the Department of Lands because there was a tall talker in charge of the Department of Agriculture at the time, the man who thought that when he had coined a beautiful phrase that he had solved the problem, and who took it over from that gentle Mayo man who was in charge of the Department of Lands at the time.  The land project was a suitable project for this Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it never was, that is what I am saying, that it was taken over by a tall talking individual out of the Department where it should have been, but a fair number of staff were taken out of the Department of Lands who established it.  That is some proof of my point.  There was no question but that the first two Governments neglected forestry.  It was one of the worst errors they ever made. I am, of course, talking about the Government from 1922 to 1932 and the Government from 1932 to 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total area in the State forests in 1948, to the best of my recollection, <Col N="869" /> was something of the order of 8,000 acres.  Mr. Seán MacBride, who was the Minister for External Affairs, brought a programme of 20,000 acres into what was called the long-term programme, the programme that was sent to the Americans in connection with the Marshall Aid money.  I suspect he had no authority from the Government to do that but he did it, and it has never been departed from since, although there was one Minister for Lands who did feel the figure of 20,000 acres was rather accepted.  We now have this magnificent asset of half a million acres of forestry.  There is no point in Deputy L'Estrange talking about forestry in Finland and Sweden where they have enough natural forestry to last them a hundred years.  There is no use comparing it to ours.  I met some Finnish students a few years ago and when I asked them what they saw in Ireland they said: &ldquo;Baby forests&rdquo;. Of course, our forests are baby forests compared with the Finnish ones.  Some of them are over comparatively small areas but at least we have them and they are a growing asset.</P>
    <P>I remember a committee being established about when we should set up a newsprint plant in this country.  This seems to have been postponed continuously. I understood at the time that there would be enough thinnings to manufacture newsprint by 1960.  It has been taken up by various existing private enterprise firms and there is a serious problem here.  We have a monopoly producer of the timber, the State; and we have monopoly purchasers, the private firm.  I would like to ask when we will have this newsprint plant.  Perhaps, the Minister can convey my question to the Minister concerned.  We are paying somewhere in the region of £5 to £6 million a year for newsprint at the moment.  I know when the plant is first set up here there will be terrible grouses about how newsprint is deteriorating and all the usual teething troubles will have to be solved, but they will be over in a few years.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the newsprint plant should be set up in the same way as Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta in Arklow as a semi-State body.  I cannot see any <Col N="870" /> method by which a price can be agreed between a private firm where there are monopoly producers and purchasers. At this stage the production of newsprint is the most promising outlet for our expanding production of woodpulp. I should like to know when the Government are going to establish this newsprint plant because it is obvious to me that the second thinnings of the first worthwhile planting of forests are due.  They were started in 1950 and we were told they would be available after 20 years.</P>
    <P>If we want to be critical we can say that the results so far have been very disappointing.  We have spent nearly £6 million and we have received just under £1 million for sales of timber. Of course, the real crop of timber comes in about 40 years time when, in the case of pine which we have been talking about, they mature.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what has happened about the commercial accounts for forestry.  Are they still operating on the basis of whatever rate of interest was agreed at the time?  I do not suppose the Forestry Division agreed to anything more than four per cent.  I remember the argument and the suggestion that was made that it should be 2½ per cent.  The Department of Finance was suggesting it should be five per cent.  There is no doubt that with a rate of interest of something of that order these accounts will in the end show a reasonable return for the moneys invested in the forests, particularly having regard to the way the value of money has gone up.  The result should be a good one if the rate of interest has not been altered in the interval.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary position to find that we have one Vote which is worthless and another Vote which is of immense value.  Of course, this is the reason why the Minister brought them in together.  He expected the Vote for Lands to be criticised severely but he realised that most people in this House are in favour of the afforestation programme.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that I hope the Minister will follow the pattern set by his able predecessor, the late Deputy <Col N="871" /> Seán Moylan, and stop the land division. As far as I am concerned, I hope he will be able to keep the land available for forestry up to target and keep the annual planting figure up to 20,000 acres a year.  It is too late to get the land project back.  It was not an agricultural project and it should have been under the control of the Department of Lands.</P>

      <P>About 20 years ago both Deputy O'Donovan and I happened to be members of the Fine Gael Party.  I am glad that both of us left it.  It was the best thing, not only for Deputy O'Donovan, but also for me.  It was the first right turn we ever took.  I hope that Deputy O'Donovan continues in the way in which he is now going.</P>
      <P>The Estimate is one which concerns me because when the present Minister for Justice was made Minister for Lands it was suggested that the general attitude was that he was going to lead the people of the West of Ireland into the promised land, that he was going to take them to Meath and Kildare and give them all the free and soft lands that he could get for them.  That, of course, did not happen. It was not my fault but it just did not happen.  I am sure that the present Minister will not succeed in getting them all there either.  The allegations made against Mayo Deputies who have been Ministers are unfair.  They have not been unreasonable.  Mayo Deputies who have been Ministers for Lands have been most fair.</P>

      <P>It could be a coincidence but they have not brought the people of the west into the promised land or anything like that.  I am not going to make a long-playing record but there are a few points that I want to make.  One very important matter as far as we in the west are concerned is the question of commonages. A great deal of land is held in common by many people.  It is often very difficult to get all the holders to agree with one another.  For instance, a brother <Col N="872" /> and sister will not agree with each other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J. Lenehan Mr. J. Lenehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lenehan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is this land that is held in common, as Deputy O'Donovan knows.  He is an expert. I am not.  These lands represent a problem. I should like to point out to the Minister that if he decided to take one small farmer from Erris to the midlands today the cost of the whole transaction would be in the nature of £12,000 to £15,000.  On the other hand, in the Aughleam Gaeltacht more than 20 tenants got ten to 15 acres each and the total outlay was £12,000.  The 20 persons concerned are well fixed up now.  This is very important.  If the Land Commission officials would come down to earth&mdash;some of them are nearer to the moon than to this world &mdash;we could solve many of our problems. The Minister cannot deny that it would cost £12,000 to take a person from Erris to the midlands, whereas a transaction involving more than 20 person, each of whom got an addition of ten to 15 acres in the Aughleam Gaeltacht, cost only £12,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is absolute lack of co-operation as far as Land Commission officials are concerned.  They seem to imagine that there will be a law case in regard to some matter.  That does not arise.  The Minister should be able to send officials to help local people who want land that is held in common divided.  The people concerned are not millionaires.  Neither do they come from the county home.  If they had to bring out an engineer at their own cost, that would involve a great deal of money and the question is: who would pay him?  The Land Commission have engineers, some of them doing damn all, and I see no good reason why they should not be sent out to <Col N="873" /> give us and the tenants the necessary information.  To suggest that they do not come because a holding is vested is the arch joke.  I may as well be honest about it, but I think the Land Commission should have been abolished years ago.</P>
    <P>If it is put before the Minister that there are ten or 15 tenants who want to divide and partition their lands, the Land Commission should send out capable men to deal with the matter and to help these people.  There could be tremendous improvements by this means, more than would be obtained by taking one man to the midlands, which would cost more than improving a whole townland.  This matter probably has not been brought to the Minister's notice before.  Now that it has been brought to his attention it will be up to him to deal with it.</P>
    <P>There are some other funny things that go on.  For instance, a man who is not within a mile of a certain holding is not entitled to get land.  I suppose there is something to be said for that because if he were more than a mile from the holding it is quite possible that he would let it to somebody else or do something else with it.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous amount of land down in the west which would be quite suitable for afforestation.  One thousand years ago there must have been trees growing on that land.  They are under the ground now.  Would it not be a good idea for the Forestry Division to purchase this land and plant trees on it?  The Germans are prepared to take a long-term gamble on this type of land and, if it is a good investment for the foreigner, then it should be an equally good investment for an Irish Government.  It is a-matter which should be considered.  A great deal of land is lying derelict.  It should be purchased by the Land Commission and developed as a forest.  I suggest the Minister should send his officials down to have a chat with some of the local people.  It is very rarely a Land Commission, or any other official, calls on me but, if officials did call on me, or on others like me, it is amazing the kind of beneficial information they could get.  I believe this land could be purchased very reasonably.  It is an <Col N="874" /> investment that would be well worth making.  It would give a reasonable amount of employment initially and in 20 or 30 years time it would give more employment.  I know the trees in Mayo do not grow as fast as they do on the plains of Kildare, but they do grow.  They may take a little longer. In the years to come someone will have to establish a factory to deal with woodpulp.  Here is an area in which we could produce the raw material for such a factory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief.  There are just a few points I should like to bring to the Minister's attention. Deputy Lenehan referred to a problem in his constituency.  It is also a problem in my constituency.  It is the problem of commonages.  Has the Minister and his Department power to divide these commonages between interested parties?  In my constituency there are as many as ten or 12, sometimes more, with a common interest in a vast tract of mountain land.  In recent years there has been a growing awareness of the value of reclaiming mountain land and improving mountain pasture.  Unfortunately, progress can cause a considerable amount of ill-feeling; in some cases it has actually resulted in court proceedings.  There may be ten or 12 people interested in a commonage and one or two of these will hold up the division of the commonage.  While the commonage is held in joint ownership and some disagree there can be no attempt to reclaim the land or improve the pasture for sheep grazing.  If there are compulsory powers to acquire such commonages then these powers should be used.  I would be in favour of compulsory acquisition because it would lead to better farming in many cases. It would lead to more economic holdings&mdash;a subject in which I am very interested as it concerns quite a number of people in my constituency. I was very interested in what Deputy O'Donovan had to say in relation to the acquisition of land by the Land Commission.  We all realise that land acquisition and division is a very complex and vexed question.  No doubt the reason for that stems from the fight for the land in this country.  At <Col N="875" /> present, we have between 70,000 and 75,000 uneconomic holdings.  The time has come for the Minister for Lands or, perhaps, even the Minister for Finance to say how many small farms and small farmers this country can afford.</P>
      <P>Many Mayo Deputies have held the office of Minister for Lands.  When Deputy S. Flanagan was appointed Minister for Lands I felt that, coming from Mayo, an area which has the problem of land congestion, he should be familiar with all aspects of it.  There are a lot of small and uneconomic holdings in Mayo similar to those in parts of the area I represent.  The apparently deliberate go-slow policy of the Department of Lands in acquiring land for subdivision is appalling.  I see no indication in the Minister's opening statement on the Estimate for his Department of any change in the policy that has been pursued in this respect down through the years.</P>
      <P>I suppose that every public representative and certainly every Member of this House has from time to time made representations direct to the Minister for Lands or to his Department or to the district office in connection with holdings in a congested area that are offered for sale.  My complaint is that the Land Commission take so long before they become interested in a property&mdash;a farm large or small&mdash;which is for sale that, before they even reach the stage of inspecting it, it is sold to somebody else.  It would, indeed, be well if we had a land acquisition drive.  It would be particularly beneficial in congested areas where we could create the greatest possible number of economic holdings.  We should acquire the land not by compulsion but through voluntary sale by the vendors to the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister states that section 6 of the Land Act, 1965, provides the basic authority for the scheme of life annuities for elderly, incapacitated or blind persons who voluntarily sell their interest in their land to the Land Commission. He says that this scheme and the scheme for self-migration loans were brought into operation early in <Col N="876" /> 1967.  The objective of the life annuity scheme is to facilitate land structure reform by encouraging elderly, incapaciated or blind farmers to retire so that their land will become available for active farming by younger, ablebodied persons.  This is, indeed, a very worthwhile scheme and I wish it greater success.  The Minister says it is having moderate success.</P>
    <P>We now have 22 persons on the life annuity payroll, following the sale of their lands to the Land Commission The Minister tells us that most of these people avail themselves of the very attractive feature of the scheme whereby the vendor may, if he wishes, retain a right of residence for life in his existing dwellinghouse.  This is very desirable.  However, since early in 1967, when the scheme was introduced, only 22 persons have availed of it.  I fear the Land Commission have not sufficiently brought the advantages of the scheme to the notice of people likely to be interested in it, and explained it to them in detail.  It is a worthwhile scheme which could help to solve the problem of uneconomic holdings.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that this scheme, which is entirely voluntary, is designed in the main for elderly people and that progress is necessarily slow.  If progress continues to be as slow as it has been we should consider whether we should abandon the scheme altogether.  We require a substantial improvement in the numbers availing of it.  The Minister admits that, to date, the results are unsatisfactory.  A survey should be made in parts of Cork county, in Mayo and in other areas, particularly along the western seaboard, of holdings where families cannot now be sustained although, in other times, families were reared and educated off the same holdings. The Land Commission advisory service should explain the details and merits of this scheme to people on holdings which have no economic future.  I am disappointed with the progress so far in this respect.</P>
    <P>I agree with portions of the Estimate: if I think anything has merit, I have no hesitation in saying so, no matter what Minister may introduce an Estimate.  Likewise, if I think it should be criticised, I shall criticise it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> In page 11 of his brief, the Minister refers to the tourist aspects of game shooting and says it proceeded satisfactorily in the past year.  He tells us that a joint committee of the Department of Lands and Bord Fáilte sponsored a number of shoots throughout the country to meet the demands of the out-of-State visitor.  This is a project which could be developed to the benefit of the nation.  In areas which I have mentioned, where you have congestion or small uneconomic holdings, there is no doubt that the development of tourism can play an important part in increasing the standard of living of the people in those areas.  Even though it is not relevant to discuss it I should like in passing to mention the importance of the farm guesthouse holiday scheme.  This is something which can also contribute to improving the standard of living of the people if they are made aware of what is involved.</P>
    <P>In regard to land acquisition my experience has been that people who have land or farms to sell are dubious about land bonds and it would be easier for the Land Commission if they came to an agreement with the landowners and made a cash down payment. The normal and the human reaction is that if you are selling something you are anxious to get the cash in your hands when the sale has been concluded.  Today people are demanding a better standard of living and will not be satisfied with what satisfied their forefathers, and farms which in the past provided a living are now no longer viable units.  In areas where there are small farms there is no alternative but to provide the farmers with the acreage of land which will make for a viable holding.  While we can introduce emergency measures of unemployment assistance or something of that nature, every farmer and particularly the small farmer, is anxious to have sufficient land.  These people have proved themselves to be the most hardworking section of the community and they do not easily accept hand-outs.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the afforestation drive and to the difficulty of having a reserve of land.  It has been my experience that when the Forestry Division go to purchase land they are <Col N="878" /> very niggardly about paying for it.  On occasions I made representations to the Minister's predecessors about cases where there was very little difference between the price offered and the price asked, and in all such dealings there is always room for some bargaining, but as far as the Department were concerned they were very slow to reach any compromise.  I want to emphasise that, while afforestation is necessary and while there is nothing nicer in a barren countryside than a growing forest, I would hate to see even one perch of arable land being planted and I am afraid that a number of arable acres have been planted.  The Forestry Division may purchase a farm on which there may be six or seven acres of arable land which would contribute to making an adjoining holding an economic holding and I have seen such arable land being planted.  The Minister should ensure that under no circumstances should even one acre of arable land be planted because we have ample quantities of waste or barren land and mountain land to plant if we so desire.</P>
    <P>I can never understand why when the Land Commission or the Forestry Division buy a farm they hold it for three, four or maybe five years before they divide it.  What is the purpose of buying a farm and then letting it out at conacre or for grazing or to some speculator or cattle dealer?  Why not go ahead with its division as soon as it is acquired?  I do not see much liaison between the Forestry Division and the Land Commission.  I have one particular case in mind where the Forestry Division 2½ years ago bought a farm of which about 50 per cent was arable land and it has not yet been transferred to the Land Commission. The people who expected to get the land are still waiting for it because it has not been handed over</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the increased expenditure in his Department and I want to bring to his attention one matter which is of interest to Deputies, particularly southern Deputies, the fact that transport is not provided for forestry workers.  I am sure the Minister understands the position clearly.  In the winter months you <Col N="879" /> have forestry workers leaving their homes at 6 or 7 o'clock in the morning in all weathers and perhaps going by bicycle to the top of some barren mountain.  Where possible they should be paid a travelling allowance or provided with some form of transport. It is very necessary and it is something about which every forestry worker feels aggrieved.  It is certainly necessary in this day and age.  It is not right that forestry workers should be asked to endure such hardship on their way to and from work.  The Minister should bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>I live near the town of Macroom. The area all around that town is planted.  I do not know the acreage, but planting had continued there each year.  Vast acreages of afforestation are now mature.  There is great unemployment in this area which is one from which people have emigrated.  Some of these people are anxious to return.  The area has not been developed industrially in the past few years as other areas have been.  There is mature timber in an area around the town of Macroom and within a radius of 20 to 30 miles of it.  This timber is being drawn at great expense and cost to two different factories.  One of the factories is at Scariff, a distance of 50 miles, and the other is in Waterford which is almost the same distance away.  This is ludicrous.  The local people, and particularly the development association in the area, have come to Dublin several times requesting the Minister for Industry and Commerce to site a woodpulp factory in the area.  This may not be relevant but it is only a passing reference.  Experts on afforestation and on the raw materials necessary for a woodpulp factory have stated that there is an unlimited supply of raw material in the area.  The Forestry Division have spent a year or more preparing an estimate of the amount of mature timber in the area.  So far as I know, this estimate is not available to date.  At the same time, there is the ridiculous situation whereby mature timber is drawn from the area at great cost.  If a factory was sited in the area, which requires it from the employment point of view, it would be a great improvement.  I would ask the <Col N="880" /> Minister to see whether there is anything he can do.  Any help he can give would be very welcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his Estimate also referred to the migrants who were given land in other counties and the type of house provided for them.  He states that the farmyards are equipped in a modern way and that the houses are up to average standard or at least reasonably good.  I disagree with the Minister here.  So far as these houses and farmyards are concerned, one would know from passing along a road that a particular house was a migrant's house and that the land was given by the Land Commission.  The layout is very skimpy.  The farmyards particularly are skimpy.  I should like the Minister to do something about this</P>
    <P>With regard to roads, there are a few cases where farmers are living in a roadway and the roadway is also used by the Department of Lands because they have a plantation in the area and right of access through this road to their property.  From time to time we have made representations to the Minister and to the Department in connection with paying a contribution towards the upkeep of such roads where the Department of Lands are using roads for their own benefit in order to remove timber and for planting trees the great problem is that farmers have no redress for damage done to the roads.  I have at least three or four such cases in my area and I would urge on the Minister that the Department should pay a contribution towards the upkeep of such roads.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to places like Gougane Barra where there are State forests.  I live nearer to this forest than anybody else in this House.  It has become the greatest tourist attraction in the south.  It is a great tourist amenity and it could be developed further.  Many people travel to see this plantation.  It is a very worthwhile project, which indeed could be copied in other areas.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to do something with regard to the plantation of land.  The Minister could see vast acreages of barren mountain if he were <Col N="881" /> driven through parts of this country. This land should be acquired for forestry purposes.  It is very necessary for the provision of employment.  There are many places in my area where land is held by the Department for years before planting commences.  We all agree that planting is not an easy job. Roads, and perhaps bridges, must be constructed.  Fencing must be laid out. Quite a lot of work is involved.  But there is great delay at present which is not quite necessary.  I would appeal to the Minister to look at this situation which has annoyed people in an area where there is great unemployment.  It has annoyed people looking for forestry work that land is available which could be planted if arrangements were made to do so, but no arrangements for planting have been made.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Adjournment Debate: Ballyfermot (Dublin) Post Office Facilities.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of this opportunity to raise on the Adjournment Question No. 104 of the 6th November regarding the lack of proper and full post office facilities for Ballyfermot, Dublin.  I asked the Minister to have these provided. The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in his reply said:</P>
      <P>The establishment of a branch post office in Ballyfermot would not be justified.  The full range of postal counter services is available at the two sub-offices in the area, which are adequate to deal with the amount of business normally transacted.</P>
      <P>The question of proper post office facilities at Ballyfermot dates back to 1957.  Mr. Blaney was then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  He initiated an investigation into it and found that facilities there were not adequate.  In reply to a question on 30th October, 1957, he said:</P>
      <P>An inquiry has been held.  The congestion was caused by a temporary shortage of staff.  Steps are being taken to avoid a recurrence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years this question has been raised time and again.  Ballyfermot has a population roughly <Col N="882" /> equivalent to Waterford city.  It has no telegraph office and the present post office facilities are most inadequate. There are queues of people constantly outside the post office.  It is not adequate to accommodate them and they must queue in the rain.  This is what the Minister says is adequate to meet the needs of the people of Ballyfermot, an area equivalent to Waterford city, and Waterford city has five telegraph offices.  The Minister stated in his reply that the provision of a telegraph office was not related to the population of an area but to the demand and he said that investigations showed that in Chapelizod and in Inchicore there did not seem to be the demand.  The Minister is obviously not aware of where Ballyfermot is situated.  He must not be aware of the fact that it is over a three-mile walk to Inchicore post office.  I live at the corner of Ballyfermot and I know how far it is to this post office.  The people of Ballyfermot are demanding proper facilities.  They are not satisfied with the facilities they have at present where one must put money in a coin box to send a telegram.  When a person wants to send a telegram he goes into a post office and gets change.  He comes out and probably finds he has not got enough change and must go back for more.  This is the kind of inconvenience these people are suffering.  We all know the difficulties involved in using a coin box for anything.  Time and again these people lose their money.  It is easy for the Minister who has full facilities here and in his office to send a telegram and I do not think these people should be deprived of the right of sending a telegram from their local post office. If Galway or Waterford can have five telegraph offices Ballyfermot should have at least one.  I do not know what vested interests are involved; I am not concerned.  I am concerned that facilities should be provided for this community.  As far as I could ascertain from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach there are nearly 34,000 people in the area.  If we take into account just the people north of the Grand Canal there are 25,000 people there.  This is equivalent to Galway municipal borough which has five telegraph offices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an increase in population in that general area.  I would like the Minister to tell us exactly what the increase has been since this question was raised in 1957. Facilities have not improved but the population has increased.  He said that it is a built-up area and that expansion is outside rather than within it.  That does not alter the fact that it is a community of almost 30,000 people needing services which are not being provided. There are telegraph offices at Drumcondra, Donnybrook, Drimnagh, Dundrum, Harold's Cross, Raheny, Phibsborough, Terenure, Milltown and Glasnevin but we cannot provide them in Ballyfermot.  I should like to know what it would cost to provide these services.  The Minister says that there is no need for them or no demand. How could he know this?  Has he a means of ascertaining this?  Would he know exactly the figures from coin boxes?  He could not tell from the number of telegrams sent from Inchicore because he must realise that Inchicore is not on that bus route. Chapelizod is away from Ballyfermot. The tendency is to go towards town and not away from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look again into this matter and to see why he cannot provide proper services.  We have two problems here.  The sub-post offices are not adequate to meet the demands of the people.  We see queues outside, not just on children's allowance day but on days when people are using the post office for so many facilities that should be available to them.  The Minister has been adamant on this since 1957.  There was a question by my late colleague, Deputy Seán Dunne, on this matter and the Minister said that there should not be much <Col N="884" /> difficulty in getting change for use in the telephone kiosk.  I am sure the Minister has sent telegrams and has altered the wording time and again.  He would not know exactly what the telegram was going to cost.  This is very awkward when one is using a telephone kiosk.</P>
    <P>The tenants' association has brought this to the Minister's attention time and again.  I would suggest that he should attend a meeting and they will very quickly tell him all about it.  The time is over for bluffing and saying these facilities are not needed.  The people will demand them more and more.  I do not think it is fair to say that the type of offices provided for an area is determined by the need for the various facilities and is not specifically related to population.  I cannot accept that the number of telegrams sent from Chapelizod or Inchicore would show the Minister that there is no need for telegraph facilities for Ballyfermot.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and ask him sincerely to investigate this and to meet the wishes of these people so that we will not have to raise the matter again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised the Deputy feels that this is a matter he should raise on the Adjournment. I have no objection at all to being brought in on the Adjournment to discuss this matter, but I think it is abusing the privileges of the House to find a Deputy who is so worried about this situation that he put down this Question No. 104 on the 6th November but could not be bothered to attend to hear the answer and only got the answer when it was supplied to him subsequently by the Dáil Office or when he read about it in the Dáil Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I took Question No. 104 along with a question on the same lines from Deputy Burke from the Fine Gael side of the House.  Deputy Burke followed up this question by supplementaries on that day.  I was more than surprised to find at a later stage, when the matter was raised by him through a written reply, to find Deputy O'Connell developing some sort of a late interest in it in view of the fact that he could <Col N="885" /> not be present to follow up the original question.  However, that is only by the way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is typical of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has said that something is typical of me.  Let me develop that by saying that the Deputy's remarks here this evening are typical of him in that he said, in the course of the argument he made, that the tenants' association have been on to me and my Department time and time again asking for the provision of those facilities; but having discovered, or probably having decided, that this statement was not correct, he immediately followed that up by saying, &ldquo;The Minister will probably deny this&rdquo;.  The Deputy also acted in this way about 12 months ago when he made very false allegations on another Post Office question.  I have checked in my Department and I have not found any approaches from a tenants' association for those facilities.</P>
      <P>I did concede, in reply to the questions of both Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Burke on the 6th November, that the facilities in that post office were overtaxed on days on which children's allowances are payable.  I think the same situation prevails in any post office in a populated area.  I have no doubt&mdash;I do not know because I have not checked on it&mdash;but that in the post offices in Waterford and Galway on children's allowances day there is normally a build-up of people waiting to have their allowances cashed.  I did accept when replying to the question previously, that it is not too easy for the sub-postmasters in both the sub-post offices in Ballyfermot to be in a position to provide the facilities on call on the first Tuesday of each month. There are upwards of, I think, 5,000 children's allowances payable each month between the two offices, and this imposes an inordinate demand on the sub-post offices there.  This would not be overcome or lessened in any way by the provision of a departmental office in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned the fact that a number of people had to queue up <Col N="886" /> there and painted a picture of people having to stand in the rain.  I resent the Deputy's statement that I do not know the area.  As a matter of fact, I travel daily into the city very close to that area and I have been in the area; but naturally I would not claim to know the area as well as a Deputy who represents the area and is expected to know it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>And who lives in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying the Deputy is not living in it.  I am saying he represents that area and I agree that I would not know the workings of the office to the same extent as the man with the local knowledge.  I agree it is far easier to send a telegram by calling into an office, handing in the written form, having the words counted and paying the amount due, rather than having to have the proper change for use in a telephone kiosk.  On the other hand, if there were no telephone kiosks there, that lack of facility would be very much criticised.  On the basis of the use made of those kiosks for the sending of telegrams, I do not think there is the necessity for the provision of the service sought in either or both of the offices at Ballyfermot.  The Deputy asked if I have any way of checking.  Of course, I have.  In coin box telephones in kiosks every telegram sent is recorded on a slip and it is no problem for my officials to supply me with this information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have.  The Deputy had the opportunity of asking supplementary questions.  However, he brought this matter up on the Adjournment and I propose to deal with it in the manner appropriate to an Adjournment debate.  I am aware of the use that is made of the various coin boxes in that area and I am satisfied from a study of this that there is no degree of demand, except as expressed by the Deputy, for the provision of those <Col N="887" /> facilities.  The only way this can be determined is by the normal usage of the coin box in this regard.</P>
      <P>While I accept that it is not as convenient to send a telegram from a kiosk as it is to send it from a post office, one would expect that anyone needing to send a telegram would normally be able to have the convenient change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not withdraw it from other areas so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asked how much it would cost to provide this service. The telegraph service of my Department is run at a pretty sizeable loss, and that within a postal service which itself carries an annual loss.  I have not the figures here but there is a loss of something like £250,000 per annum on this over-all service.  Where the services are at present being provided in areas in the city to which the Deputy has referred, those are services which have been there for a very long time. New sub-offices do not have this facility.  They are money order offices, but they are money order offices without telegraph facilities.  Any new suboffice we have opened in the fringe <Col N="888" /> growth areas around Dublin is without the telegraph facility.  Our experience has been that in offices where this facility is available very little use is made of it.  We are satisfied that it is a facility that is not required in the new offices.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that it is a matter on which the Deputy found it necessary to raise a question on the Adjournment, I, for my part, will take the opportunity of looking further into it. However, it would be wrong if I were to give the impression that by looking further into it there is any great likelihood of providing this facility because it is a facility that has not been found to be necessary in this developing part of Dublin.</P>
      <P>If a further investigation of the use being made of coin boxes for the purpose of sending telegrams shows a need for this facility there is no problem as far as I am concerned in providing the service.  The difficulty is that it is a costly service and it would mean the payment of a greater amount of money for the provision of a service which I do not consider to be necessary.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, November 13th, 1969.</P>
