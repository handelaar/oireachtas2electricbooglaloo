    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach (a) the estimated number of people on the land at present, (b) the number who left the land last year and (c) what plans the Government have to provide employment for people leaving the land each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of people engaged in agriculture, forestry and fishing as at the latest available date&mdash;in April 1968&mdash;was 313,000. This represents a decrease of 9,000 as compared with the corresponding date in 1967.  The latter figure cannot, of course, be equated with the number leaving agriculture etc., to take up employment elsewhere since the rate of decline is also affected by deaths and retirements and the number of new entrants.</P>
      <P>In regard to the final part of the Deputy's question, it is expected that the rise in non-agricultural activity during the period concerned will more than outweigh the drop in agriculture, forestry and fishing.  The Government's plans to maintain and improve this favourable trend in non-agricultural employment will be contained in the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development, which it is intended to publish shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that over 130,000 people left the land in the last ten years? Surely he will have to admit that his plans for <Col N="1500" /> the last ten years have failed? Does he envisage that he will have anything new in the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development so that the people may be retained on the land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to face the fact that people are leaving agricultural employment not only in this country but in every other country.  In this country they are leaving it at a significantly lower rate than in many other countries.  The figure is something less than three per cent while in Denmark, for instance, it is about nine per cent. However, the fact that they have to leave the land does not mean that they are leaving rural areas because alternative employment is being provided for people who leave the land in rural areas.  Furthermore, there has been an increase in the numbers engaged in non-agricultural employment in excess of the decrease of those engaged on the land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>On what does the Taoiseach base his information? Over 350,000 people have left the country in the last ten years and there are 70,000 fewer at work today compared with ten years ago.  On what does the Taoiseach base his information, then, that the people leaving the land are getting alternative employment? Does he mean alternative employment in Birmingham, Coventry or London, or somewhere abroad, because they are not getting it here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures which will be published shortly will indicate that there is an increasing number engaged in non-agricultural employment and that increase, in fact, is in excess of those leaving the land.  The Deputy will see the figures very shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose we take a conservative figure of 100,000 having left the land over the last ten years, does the Taoiseach say that we provided 100,000 new jobs for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that.  I said that last year&mdash;and in the <Col N="1501" /> years henceforth&mdash;those in gainful employment will exceed those leaving the land.</P>

      <P>I am not going to go back over the past year, but does the Taoiseach assert that the 9,000 people who left agriculture and fisheries, mainly from the western counties, were provided with alternative employment in those areas?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach be more specific and indicate what alternative employment is available because I have a reasonable knowledge of my own county and of other counties on the western coast and little or no alternative employment has been provided there in recent years, except possibly employment with a content of not more than 500.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach the value and weight of all shellfish including cockles, crayfish, crabs, lobsters, prawns, periwinkles, whelks and scallops exported from the ports <Col N="1502" /> of Arklow, Baltimore, Balbriggan, Burtonport, Bunbeg, Cahirciveen, Clogherhead, Castletownbere, Dingle, Dunmore East, Dungarvan, Galway, Greencastle, Howth, Killybegs, Schull and Moville during the year ended 31st December, 1968; and the weight and value of all salmon, grilse and trout exported from the same ports during this period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not available for 1968.  Export figures for individual ports are complied for only one year in every five years.  The last year for which the information requested by the Deputy is available is 1964 and, in that year, no exports of shellfish or of salmon, grilse or trout were recorded for any of the ports mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach say why we have not more recent statistics than for 1964? It seems extraordinary that we can get them only when they are no good to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer indicates that specific statistics are available in respect of specific ports only once in every five years.  I think that is the reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tokyo Convention which deals with offences committed on board aircraft was signed on behalf of Ireland on the 20th October, 1964.  Legal problems arising out of some of the provisions of the Convention are in process of being resolved and I am hopeful that it will be possible to introduce legislation to ratify the Convention soon.  The Convention is not yet in force internationally as only eight countries out of the necessary twelve have so far ratified it.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the necessity to increase security against the hi-jacking of aircraft and my Department is cooperating at present in studies by the International Civil Aviation Organisation to find other possible solutions to this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think a great many other countries have had difficulties. That partly arises from the fact that only eight countries out of the necessary 12 have so far ratified the Convention. The International Civil Aviation Organisation is also trying to discover ways and means of preventing hi-jacking by security measures which do not necessarily involve legislation. That is the most important element in the whole matter.  I might add that at the moment, I am glad to say, no planes are landing at Shannon which would be liable to be hi-jacked.  We are not directly involved; we are only trying to contribute to the international scene.</P>

        <i>(Cavan)</i> asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware that television reception in the Swanlinbar area of Cavan is very poor, and if he will take the necessary steps to have proper reception provided in this area, particularly in view of the fact that it was intimated some 12 months ago that a survey of the area was being carried out with a view to improving reception.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The improvement of television reception is primarily a matter for Radio Telefís Éireann.  I understand that the area referred to by the Deputy is one of a number of areas where the quality of television reception is below the normal standard and that it was included in a national survey of such areas which was made by Radio Telefís Éireann.  I am advised by the Authority that their immediate <Col N="1508" /> plans for the improvement of reception are based on giving priority to areas of maximum population and they cannot say, at present, when the Swanlinbar area will be reached.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Is the intention in putting this rural area on the long finger another method of driving the people out of rural Ireland? Will the Minister agree that in an area between Swanlinbar, Cavan, and Ballinamore, Leitrim, there is no television reception, that reception is actually nil? If the Minister accepts that, as apparently he does, will he agree that he is extracting licence fees of £5 from the holders of television sets there by false pretences? Would he consider accepting the radio licence fee of £1 5s until such time as a transposer is installed to rectify the position and provide normal television reception in and around Swanlinbar?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with people whose television sets are unable to get proper reception but I do not know of any country that reduces the television licence fees in whatever may be areas of defective reception.  It is a matter for decision for the people in the area whether they get a television set or not.  As the Deputy probably knows, this is an immensely complicated problem.  There are 900 widely scattered areas in which a tremendous amount of testing of a purely technical character has to be undertaken. Testing very often has extremely baffling results in this and other countries. Furthermore, we are limited in the number of wavelengths we can adopt under international regulations.  That further complicates the problem.  Radio Telefís Éireann are undertaking a campaign to ascertain what areas require improvement in reception and they are bound to do it in rotation. They naturally take the areas where there is the greatest population to be attended to.  Transposer stations have to be erected and Radio Telefís Éireann have to provide the capital for these stations.  They are doing the best they can under these circumstances.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> It is a short question.  Arising further out of the Minister's statement that he proposes to devote his attention to the thickly populated areas and neglect the sparsely populated areas, would he not agree that the amenity of a television service is much more important in a remote rural area than it is in a thickly populated area in which there are other amenities, such as picture houses, etc., etc., and will he not devote his attention instead to those areas which are much more in need of this amenity than are towns or thickly populated areas?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said this concerns towns.  It concerns the extent of the area and the population living within it.  It does not necessarily mean that the areas in which priorities are being given are towns.  That is very far from being the case.  However, I will ask Radio Telefís Éireann to look again at the area to see if they have the population figures correctly, if that is what the Deputy has in mind.</P>

      <P>As regards the first part of the question, figures are not available as to the number of itinerants in the country at present.  The latest available figures are those given in the Report of the Commission on Itinerancy.  The answer to the second part of the question is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Information in regard to the third and fourth parts of the question is not available in my Department. Local authorities are not now required to submit to the Department particulars of the categories of tenants to be catered for in a housing scheme.</P>

Is the Minister satisfied with what has been done over the past ten years by the Government to house these unfortunate people? We have heard plenty of talk but very little has been done so far.  Has the Minister any plans for the future?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Arising out of the Minister's statement that he is not satisfied with the progress made so far in solving the problem, would he consider appointing what might be described as an itinerant officer or itinerant officers, or would he encourage local authorities to do so so that these people might be educated in advance of being housed and brought to a state at which they would be more acceptable as neighbours in an effort to expedite the housing of these people?</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any undue delay in the Land Registry in replying to correspondence.  If, however, the Deputy has a particular case in mind where a reply was delayed for six months, and if he will let me have particulars, I will have it investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there are unacceptable delays in dealing with applications that involve mapping and that, in some cases, where urgency has not been established by applicants, delays of up to six months are occurring.  These delays are caused by an accumulation of arrears arising from (1) an increase, in 1968, of 20 per cent in the number of applications received as compared with the previous 12 months, coupled with staff shortages, (2) the necessity to enlarge existing 6&rdquo; maps to 25&rdquo; to comply with the Land Registration Rules, 1966, (3) some Ordnance Survey <Col N="1526" /> sheets going out of print and (4) maps damaged by usage over the years.</P>
    <P>Since I replied to a previous question on the subject, on 29th October, 1968, all but one of the then existing vacancies in the mapping branch have been filled.  It will be some time, however, before the impact, on arrears, of the additional staff will be apparent.  In the meantime, I have arranged for the working of full overtime, including Saturdays, by experienced staff to clear existing arrears.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in replying to the question on 29th October, 1968, I appointed a study group to undertake a critical examination of the organisation and procedures in the Land Registry.  I have now before me the first report of the group, which deals with the overall organisational structure of the office.  The group will now proceed to study in detail the organisation and procedures of the mapping branch.  It will take some time, of course, to complete the far-reaching reorganisation proposed, but I hope that by the end of the year a reorganised Land Registry will have emerged, which will be geared to deal expeditiously and efficiently with the growing volume of current business and the additional business which the gradual introduction of compulsory registration will generate.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if his attention has been called to the statement issued by the General Council of the Bar of Ireland with regard to statements reported in the Dáil Debates of 10th December, 1968, as having been made by him concerning a member of the Bar; and (a) why up to the 17th February, 1969, no reply other than the letter of the 10th January, 1969, from his private secretary was sent by him <Col N="1527" /> to the Council's letters of the 13th December, 1968, and 8th January, 1969, and (c) having regard to the Council's letter of the 3rd February, 1969, and (c) having regard to the findings of the Council and the opinion expressed in the said letter of the 3rd February, 1969, what action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions 56 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>My involvement in this matter arose from a series of slanderous statements made in the Dáil by Deputy L'Estrange, in relation to a Member of the Government, which were devoid of all truth, which Deputy L'Estrange himself retracted on two occasions but again repeated by innuendo.</P>
      <P>Deputy L'Estrange showed a knowledge of the facts of the case in question which could have been got only from the documents submitted to the High Court by the parties in a civil action. These documents were available only to the litigants, their legal advisers and the Court.  The action was settled out of Court and the pleadings were not published.</P>
      <P>On the 7th March, 1968, the day that the matter was listed for hearing in the High Court, Deputy L'Estrange mentioned the matter in the Dáil and, again on March 13th, when he quoted the High Court reference on documents containing an amended defence of 29th February, 1968, and an amended claim of 5th March and he gave intimate particulars which could not have been obtained otherwise than from those documents.  He also gave the actual monetary terms of the settlement of the case which were not even disclosed in the final Court Order striking out the action.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied from the information in my possession that Deputy L'Estrange was given access to the documents in question but I am not in a position to state categorically how he received them, that is&mdash;whether it was from one of those directly concerned or from a go-between.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Mr. Cooney, a counsel in the case, has denied that he was involved in any way in Deputy L'Estrange's <Col N="1528" /> machinations I accept his denial and offer him my apology for naming him.</P>
    <P>I also accept Mr. Cooney's denial that he or his family were associated with the Locke's Distillery case or that he is a brother-in-law of Deputy L'Estrange and I offer him my congratulations.</P>

      <P>This stems from a debate on 10th and 13th December. This arises from a law action arising out of an agreement between two parties that, on payment of £3,000, approval would be given to a particular planning application.  It is due to that problem&mdash;&ldquo;problem&rdquo; is rather a mild way to describe it&mdash;that this question has arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

The allegation was made that he was party to taking a bribe for planning permission.  This is part of a slanderous campaign carried on from time to time by the Fine Gael Party when they are in the doldrums.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister deal with some of the matters raised in my question here as to his non-reply to the letters issued to him by the Bar Council?  It seems to me from the statement made by the Bar Council that the Minister was afforded every opportunity by that body of submitting whatever case he wanted to submit for investigation in the assurance that it would be fully investigated. Would the Minister explain why it is only now, towards the end of February, in response to two Questions tabled here in the Dáil, that the information the Minister has given in his reply has been given when a letter was sent to him by the Bar Council containing their findings as early as 3rd of this month?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, we could stabilise the CRA, that is the ration allowance.  We could stabilise that but in fact it is calculated on the cost of rations in the six months prior to the six months in which it is payable.  In the early part of last year it was reduced by a penny. It was not the first time it was reduced by a penny.  In the second half of last year it was raised by 5d. because of the fact that the cost of rations had gone up by that amount in the first six months of last year.  I have not got any great complaint in connection with this matter.

    <P>¹A breakdown of the net receipt of Income Tax under each Schedule is not available.  For the years up to and including 1962-63 figures showing the net produce of Income Tax under each Schedule have been given.  Net produce of tax is the estimated ultimate yield from the tax assessed in the year, whether actually collected in that year or later, after deducting all discharges and remissions and setting off all repayments.  Net produce figures are not available for 1963-64 and subsequent years in consequence of legislation introducing the system of &ldquo;one taxpayer, one charge&rdquo; in 1963-64 following on recommendations in the Second Report of the Commission on Income Taxation.  However, it is possible to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the net receipt of Schedule E tax since it consists almost wholly of tax collected under PAYE and under Rule 5 (official pay) of the Rules applicable to Schedule E.  The approximate net receipt of Schedule E Income Tax has been given for the years 1963-64 to 1966-67.  The balance of the total net receipt for those years is regarded as referable to Schedules A, B, C and D.</P>
    <P>²Excludes an amount estimated at £4,150,000 in respect of the abatement provided for by section 14 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1959, in respect of emoluments coming within PAYE.</P>

      <P>It is not the practice to disclose the amount of commercial rents payable in respect of individual properties and it would not be in the public interest to do so.  In total, commercial rents payable for premises occupied by Government staffs amount to approximately £387,000 a year at present.</P>
      <P>For the year 1967-68 a sum of the order of £1,000,000 was paid to local authorities by way of rates and bounty in lieu of rates in respect of properties in State occupation.  As the bounty in lieu of rates which constitutes more than 80 per cent of the sum referred to is calculated on the basis of the gross totals of the valuations of all of the State occupied properties in a local authority's area it is not possible to furnish the information sought with respect to individual premises.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The purpose of this amendment is to <Col N="1577" /> unite the administrative area of County Carlow and the administrative area of Kildare to form a five-seat constituency.  The various other amendments will make possible certain arrangements in the other constituencies, and there will be sufficient population in Kildare and in Carlow to provide a five-seater under the Constitution. There would be no breach of county boundary or of local authority boundary, and it would be a reasonable constituency.  It is also proposed in the amendments here that the administrative area of County Cavan and the administrative area of County Monaghan be united to form a five-seat constituency. Here, again, the united population of both counties is satisfactory to provide a five-seater constituency within our constitutional law, as interpreted by the Budd High Court decision.  There is no need for me to say anything about that decision.  That is the decision the Minister has accepted and the one he has advised is the correct one.  At least it is the one he has accepted.  That one joins Cavan and Monaghan and meets the consitutional requirements.  I think the Ceann Comhairle has suggested that we go on from that to amendment No. 10.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> Amendment No. 10 is to delete the entry relating to Kildare on page 11. That is the entry in the Bill as drafted by the Minister.  He has proposed that Kildare be a three-seater constituency to consist mainly of the administrative county of Kildare, except the part thereof which is comprised in the constituency of Meath.  In order to meet this amendment it was necessary to put in that the proposals the Minister had in respect of Kildare as a three-seater constituency with some parts of Meath should be deleted.  That is all that is implied here.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 11 is an adjustment to the Minister's proposal in regard to the traditional Carlow-Kilkenny constituency whereby Kilkenny has to be treated as a single administrative area if we accept the idea in my amendment that Kildare be treated as a five-seater and Kilkenny treated as a three-seater. That is all that is implied in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion in regard to amendment No. 13 is that Louth should be treated as a four-seater.  This amendment suggests that the four-seater <Col N="1579" /> constituency should include the administrative area of County Louth and the district electoral division of Grangegeeth, Mellifont, St. Mary's Julianstown and Stamullen in the administrative area of County Meath. In this respect, if Louth is treated as a four-seater by virtue of the distribution of population in the counties of Louth, Meath, Kildare, Cavan and Monaghan Meath may become a three-seater by the transfer to Louth and then Kildare, being a three and a half seater, must be joined to Cavan to form a five-seater, leaving Kilkenny as a three-seater, as I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Louth has a population of 69,519 and to form a four-seater Louth would have a deficit and would need at least 6,593 to 14,593 to become a four-seater. The neighbouring county of Meath has a population of 67,323. Therefore, that means that Meath has a surplus of from 4,239 minimum to 10,239 maximum as a three-seater and the proposed transfers from Meath to Louth to enable Louth to become a four-seater as suggested here would be Grangegeeth, 463, Mellifont, 454, St. Mary's 2,003, Julianstown 2,369, Stamullen 1,355, that is a total of 6,644.  The result of this switch of population would be 76,163 for Louth and 60,679 for Meath.  Those figures would allow for Louth to be a four-seater and Meath to be a three-seater. Amendment No. 14 is merely a counter to that.  The transfer of the population which I have mentioned from Meath to Louth is the only transfer that would be necessary in that area, leaving Louth a four-seater and County Meath to become a three-seater. Monaghan could be a five-seater and Carlow-Kilkenny a five-seater, allowing the return of about 4,000 people back to Wexford.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 16 is to delete the entry relating to Monaghan in page 12. The Minister has devised and suggested that Monaghan should be arranged with a huge transfer of population.  He proposes to take this huge transfer of population from both Counties Louth and Meath and put them into Cavan and Monaghan.  He has suggested a transfer from Meath to Cavan of 5,656 <Col N="1580" /> people and from Meath to Monaghan of 6,426.  In the case of Louth, he suggests transferring a population of 7,532 from Louth to Monaghan and a population of 5,041 from Kildare to Meath.  The total transfer of population there is 24,655 resulting in a tremendous breach of county boundaries and also, of course, there must be included in that the implied transfer of 4,398 persons from Wexford to Carlow and Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>In the arrangement which I have mentioned, making Meath a three-seater and Louth a four-seater, it would be possible to obviate the transfer of these 24,655 persons which the Minister's plan envisages.  It would also be possible, under this arrangement, to reintegrate in Wexford County the 4,398 persons who are at present being taken out of that county.  The total transfer of population that my proposal entails is 6,644 as against the Minister's figure of 24,655 and if one takes the additional advantage of the return of 4,398 persons from Carlow-Kilkenny back to Wexford and subtracts that from 6,644, there is only a net transfer of 2,246 in that whole eastern constituency complex spreading from Carlow-Kilkenny to Wexford, Kildare, Meath, Louth, Cavan and Monaghan.</P>
    <P>The total transfer of population in that eastern area is 29,053 and the net transfer of population under the system which I have outlined is 2,246 as against the figure of 29,053.  There is a tremendous difference here.  If there is any validity in maintaining county boundaries or local administrative boundaries and if they have any value &mdash;the Minister has said that they have &mdash;then this is a classical example of the type of area which might be evolved if the Minister would depart from his notion of trying, under a pre-conceived plan, obviously introduced for his own purposes, of gerrymandering the entire country in so far as the Constitution permits him to do so.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 21 is merely the matter that I have mentioned already. The constituency system which I have outlined here would allow a return of 4,398 people to Wexford and would, therefore, allow the whole of Wexford to be conterminous with the local authority council area of Wexford so <Col N="1581" /> that from the point of view of population transfer this is a far more sensible arrangement than any other suggested by the Minister.  It does mean the creation of a five-seater, and the creation of the five-seater in the northern part of it, Cavan with Monaghan.  It does mean making a five-seater of Carlow-Kildare and the abolition of the five-seater in Carlow-Kilkenny.  Carlow-Kildare is a five-seater already.  Cavan-Monaghan would not seem to be a good five-seater.</P>
    <P>All in all, on balance, it would appear to be a far more equitable arrangement than that proposed by the Minister.  It would be free of any suggestion that this is being done purely for political purposes and purely for the purpose of getting an electoral advantage, which, I believe, is the purpose behind the Minister's arrangement of practically all these constituencies. The very general plan he has adopted of three-seaters all over the place, irrespective of county boundaries, is an example of the type of thinking that has been operating in the Minister's mind in this whole complex of constituencies along the eastern part of the country.</P>
    <P>I put these amendments to the House and recommend them as being far superior to anything which the Minister has suggested.  I have given the figures from the point of view of transfers, with which there is no comparison.</P>

      <P>I do not know who suggested that the people of Carlow-Kildare now want a divide and that we want a new constituency of Carlow-Kildare. In his opening remarks Deputy Hogan said we had a former constituency of Carlow-Kildare.  It was not the administrative area of Carlow. At that time Carlow was divided into three parts.  The south of the county was attached to Wexford to make Wexford a five-seater constituency.  Portion of the Tullow area was attached to Wicklow to make it a four-seater.  The northern portion of Carlow was with Kildare.  There was a constituency called Carlow-Kildare, but the little county of Carlow was butchered into three parts.  The normal constituency in that area down through the years was <Col N="1582" /> Carlow-Kilkenny.  I do not know if representations were made by anybody&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to have this made into a Carlow-Kildare constituency. As well as that, allegations have been made that the Minister in preparing this was trying to ensure that more Fianna Fáil Deputies would be elected than Opposition Deputies.  An Opposition man from Kilkenny, not a member of this House, said to me before the Minister introduced this Bill &ldquo;I bet that a portion of South Kilkenny will be added to Waterford and Waterford made into a four-seater, and Carlow with the remainder of Kilkenny will be a four-seater, whereby the Fianna Fáil Party will win two out of each of these four seats&rdquo;.  If the next election is similar to the last one the position would be three out of five.  I should like to compliment the Minister on not disturbing Carlow-Kilkenny which has been, except for a few years in the late 1930s, partly attached to Wexford, Wicklow and Kildare.  Possibly his Fine Gael colleagues may have been approached by this man.  I do not see Deputy Sweetman here.  I am sure Deputy Governey or Deputy Crotty do not want this divide-up.  So far as I am concerned as a Deputy from that constituency these people whom I know are quite happy and quite satisfied with Carlow-Kilkenny as it is.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hogan is to be congratulated on these amendments. The Minister, as we all know, is gerrymandering the constituencies in this Bill.  He has transferred 29,000 voters from one constituency to another. Deputy Hogan has made a very simple suggestion that the figure of 29,000 be brought down to a matter of 2,000, and that county boundaries should be retained so far as possible.  I have not made any representations nor have I discussed the situation with Deputy Hogan.  These are his amendments.  He is not taking this thing piecemeal.  He is not looking to see what would suit myself, Deputy Nolan or anybody else. He has gone into this Bill very closely and taken a broad look at the whole Bill.  He has done very fairly for the <Col N="1583" /> Party whom he represents.  He has done fine work on this.  He has only transferred 2,000 voters as against the Minister's 29,000.  The Minister, assisted by expert officials, transferred 29,000 while Deputy Hogan has adjusted the constituencies with something like 2,000 voters transferred.</P>
      <P>I myself represent Carlow-Kilkenny. I will be very happy to be a representative, or a candidate at least, for the county of Kilkenny as it was some years before I came into the Oireachtas. The Minister should look very closely at Deputy Hogan's amendments.  He has made a very fine study of this Electoral Bill.  I am sure the people of Wexford, like every other county, would like to be re-united with their own people in Wexford.  Likewise Carlow is being transferred as a constituency to Carlow-Kildare.  The people of Carlow would have no more objection to being joined with Kildare than they have with Kilkenny.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> These amendments have been put forward by Deputy Hogan in a genuine effort to improve this measure before it leaves the House.  Listening with attention to Deputy Hogan's case it is <Col N="1584" /> not surprising that the Minister did not rise to refute it, that he has intimated to the House he does not intend on this Stage to refute the case made by Deputy Hogan but that he intends to rely on the number of heads in his Party and the capability of the feet of the Members of his Party to walk through the Division Lobbies in order to steamroll this measure through the House?  His attitude on Committee Stage when he sought to deprive the House of a Report Stage in reality&mdash; though he has called his Party the Party of reality&mdash;is in keeping with his attitude here this afternoon.</P>
      <P>During the discussion on the referendum the Minister made the case&mdash; indeed so did the Taoiseach&mdash;that there was no merit in moving unnecessarily vast numbers of people from one constituency to another.  In the course of his arguments he went on to say that if his Third and Fourth Amendments to the Constitution were not accepted it would be necessary to carry out the wholesale movement of people from one constituency to another.  We in Fine Gael told him that no such wholesale changing of people from one constituency to another would be necessary. We were right and the arguments put forward by the Minister, his advisers and his colleagues on the referendum have been proved in more ways than one to be quite unsound.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hogan, in moving these amendments, has proved the Minister's arguments to be unsound, but to emphasise the point I draw the attention of the House to the fact that on the referendum debate the Minister for Local Government said that proportional representation would lead to a multiplicity of Parties.  We said that was not so, but the Minister went on to say that under the straight vote you would not have multiplicity of Parties. I am merely making a passing reference to this, but we have seen what has happened in Northern Ireland, where there were no fewer than 12 Parties under what the Minister calls the straight vote&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries put the Nationalists out. <Col N="1585" /> That is typical of the argument put forward by the Minister in support of his constitutional changes.  He has put forward the argument that the wholesale changing, swapping about and mutilation of county boundaries would be necessary.  We said then, and I repeat it now, that we do not regard county boundaries as sacred.  I do not believe county boundaries are something that cannot be changed, but they are something that should not be unnecessarily changed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hogan has, in the series of amendments which he has put before the House on behalf of Fine Gael, demonstrated that, instead of changing 29,053 people, it is necessary only to change 2,246 people.  If the Minister was serious in the case he put before the House last year, he should accept those amendments.</P>
      <P>We know if the Minister created a three-seat constituency in Kilkenny he could hope to get only one seat, and that would not appeal to the Minister. Deputy Hogan has, in an efficient way, made the unanswerable case that, instead of changing nearly 30,000 people from one county to another, it is necessary to change only about 2,500 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back to the constituencies of Monaghan and Cavan, it is indeed regrettable to note that neither of those counties is in a position to form a constituency on its own within the Constitution. Neither Cavan nor Monaghan has now, on its own, sufficient population to justify three Deputies&mdash;the minimum required by the Constitution. Cavan cannot afford three Deputies because its population has fallen and the same applies to Monaghan.  That we must admit, but it is not the fault of the people of Cavan or Monaghan. It is a fact that in 1936 the population of Cavan was 76,607 and in 1966 the population had dropped to 54,022; in other words, the population of Cavan, largely under Fianna Fáil, had fallen by 22,648 in the 30 years from 1936 to 1966.  Therefore, under the last census it ceases to qualify for three Deputies. That is something for which Cavan cannot be blamed; the flight from the land cannot be blamed for it.  If the Government had a policy, they would <Col N="1586" /> have seen to it that industries of one kind or another in the towns would have provided employment and a way of life for the people who were driven from the land under the ridiculous policy of Fianna Fáil in the '30s and afterwards.</P>
    <P>The same situation applies to Monaghan.  In 1936 the population of Monaghan was 61,289; in the census of 1966 that had fallen to 45,732.  Here, in this comparatively small county, we had a drop of 15,557 between 1936 and 1966.  Something has to be done for Cavan and Monaghan, but we as a Party think that the ills of Cavan and Monaghan are being cured in a rather unrealistic and unnatural way.  We find that it is being done at the expense of the wholesale butchering of County Meath.  People are being changed out of Meath into Monaghan; they are being moved into Cavan.  As a Deputy for Cavan, I welcome the people of Meath into Cavan if they wish to come. I am quite prepared to offer myself to them in common with the people of Cavan as a representative.  But I know that the people of Meath are reluctant to be joined with either Cavan or Monaghan and that they would much prefer the solution put forward in this series of amendments by Deputy Hogan.</P>
    <P>I cannot find any good reason for the drafting of people from Meath in two directions.  According to the Minister, in the earlier debates on electoral reform, the craziest thing that could happen was that counties should be unnecessarily divided, that was something to be avoided if at all possible. On the Committee Stage the Minister was given a method of avoiding this unnecessary mutilation of Meath.  He would not accept that.  At this stage he is given another method of avoiding unnecessary disturbance of the people of Meath but, again, he finds it unacceptable.</P>
    <P>In so far as the constituencies of Monaghan and Cavan are concerned, I do not think that the people would have any real objection to forming one constituency.  As I said on the last occasion, they would much prefer, of course, that their population was sufficiently large to afford them individual <Col N="1587" /> representation; they would much prefer that their economy had been looked after by the Fianna Fáil Government in the last 30-odd years in such a way that the population of each county would support at least three Deputies. Indeed, Monaghan supported three Deputies for as long as I can remember until recently and Cavan could afford four up to 1961.  The population has so declined that Cavan cannot now qualify for even three Deputies.  I do not think these counties would have any real objection to forming one five-seater constituency, letting the people of Meath go where it would be more natural for them to go.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that Cavan and Monaghan have a great deal in common. They engage in the same type of farming&mdash;dairy farming, pig rearing, potato growing, grass seed production until recently and during the war years flax was grown in Monaghan, a thing unheard of in the rest of the country with the exception of parts of Cork and Donegal.  I pointed out that there is a joint hospital board on which members of each local authority have served for 50 to 70 years and they have got on reasonably well in the administration of that board.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made the case that it is a long, unwieldy, unnatural constituency. Deputy Mooney rushed into the House on the last occasion that the Bill was being considered and told us that from one end of the joint constituency of Monaghan and Cavan, from Dundalk to Dowra, was a distance of 198 miles.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> From Cavan town, for example, to Dowra is a distance of slightly over 50 miles.  From Cavan to the town of Dundalk is about 50 miles, if it is that. Therefore, in this unwieldy constituency the town of Cavan is in the approximate centre of the constituency. The Minister is probably right when he says it is about 100 miles&mdash;it may not even be that&mdash;from the Louth border to the Leitrim border at Dowra. As a matter of fact, it is about 50 miles from Cavan to Dowra and it must be something in the neighbourhood of 30 to 40 miles from Cavan town to the Meath border&mdash;the furthest end of the constituency.  That is the very unwieldy constituency that we have been talking about.  As I have said, I have no personal axe to grind in this matter.  In so far as the constituencies are concerned, I am quite prepared to offer myself with confidence to the old constituency of Cavan, the constituency proposed in the Bill or the constituency proposed in the amendment moved by Deputy Hogan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry at having to raise this matter again but I think the virtue of having Monaghan and Cavan combined is that it does provide the religious minority with about a quota between the two constituencies.  The Fianna Fáil Party have in the past seen some merit in giving representation to the religious minority where it suited them because they did nominate Senator Cole for the Seanad.  But I say, and went on record here before as saying, that I know it was in an effort to deprive the religious minority in Monaghan and Cavan of representation, if they chose to seek it, that a determined effort, a belated and last-minute effort was made within the Cabinet to separate these two constituencies. <Col N="1589" /> I really see the hand of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in this, in view of his recent wild statements.  As a matter of fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

        <i>(Cavan):</i>&mdash;&mdash;the Minister might be regarded as the Dr. Paisley of the Fianna Fáil Party.  In view of his recent mischievous statement and mischievous assertions he could be regarded as the Dr. Paisley of the Party because Dr. Paisley violently disagrees with his Prime Minister and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Blaney, violently disagrees with his Taoiseach over the same matters.  If he was the man who succeeded in keeping these two constituencies separated, and if they were separated for the unworthy motive that I have suggested, then he has done a bad day's work.  That would be bad enough were it not for the fact that these 5,000 people in Meath have to suffer because they are being driven into an area with which they have nothing in common and which they do not normally visit unless on the odd occasion of an important football match.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose it is really a waste of time appealing to the Minister to be reasonable and to adopt this series of amendments, amendments which are calculated to assist the Minister in complying with what he regards as the provisions of the Constitution and at the same time disturbing the minimum number of people.  Instead of disturbing the minimum number of people the Minister has set out to disturb, inconvenience, transport and change the maximum number of people.  Of course, all this is done for political purposes.  I do not think that the ulterior purpose the Minister has in mind will work.  Politically and electorally I have no real fear that the Minister's plan will succeed.  I feel that the last stage of the Minister could be worse than the first because in Cavan and Monaghan I am convinced he will end up with two out of six.  He knows that if it was a five-seat constituency he would only get two out of five, but surely that would be better than two out of six?  Therefore, I say that the <Col N="1590" /> Minister's plans will not succeed. Nevertheless, it is our duty to try to prevent the Minister punishing people and inconveniencing people, as he is doing here.  I say that he will not succeed because he is a bad judge and his opinion of electoral reform is not worth a lot.  In the last 12 months it has been proved to be unsound.  On the 16th October his opinion on electoral reform was proved to be an opinion that one would not seek or, if one did, one would not act on it.  The Minister should forget about this political playacting, about his efforts to attempt to gain unfair political advantage by this unnatural and, what is more important, this unnecessary chopping up of constituencies and sending people in unnatural directions, and set out honestly to produce a reasonable scheme of constituencies.  Indeed, in the heel of the hunt it might be to his own advantage as well as being for the convenience of the electorate.</P>
    <P>We did appeal to the Minister time and time again throughout this debate to seek independent advice and now I might make a last appeal to the Minister to seek this independent advice in the drawing of constituencies and to let justice be seen to be done.  I appeal to the Minister to admit that he has prejudged the whole position, that his vision is jaundiced as a result of the long drawn out debate on the Amendments to the Constitution and that he could not be expected to go about this business with an open and an unprejudiced mind.  I brought in a Bill, with which I am not at liberty to deal in detail at the moment, which provided for the setting up of a commission. The Minister marched that Bill out of the House and gave as his reason that he could not accept it in light of the Constitution.  Of course, he could have appointed an independent tribunal and put on it people like Deputy Booth, Deputy Hogan and others, and let them bring in recommendations.  Having received their recommendations he could either have accepted them or rejected them.  Of course, the danger from the Minister's point of view was that, if he set up an independent committee and invited the members to make recommendations and they <Col N="1591" /> recommended a scheme which did not appeal to him politically, he would have been in a very awkward position if he rejected it and would have had to put forward very sound reasons for rejecting it.  If those reasons did not hold water he would be well and truly exposed to the public for what he was at, political playacting for political purposes.</P>
    <P>If that is the Minister's reason for not seeking independent advice, and I believe it is, it is all the more reason why an independent committee should have been set up, all the more reason why we should have had the benefit of at least an independent committee of Members of the House, presided over, if necessary, by a judge to bring in a recommendation, and only a recommendation.  If the Minister says that constitutionally he could not entrust the drawing up of the constituencies to a committee without another referendum, and I know the reluctance of the Minister to embark on that again, he would certainly have done a good day's work if he had done what I suggest and he would have produced a much more reasonable scheme than he has produced.  Justice would probably have been done between the political Parties.  The electors of the country would have had convenient constituencies and convenient polling places provided for them.  Above all, justice would have been seen to have been done and democracy, as we know it, would be the better for it.</P>
    <P>I make this last appeal to the Minister even at this stage before the Bill goes to the Seanad, or when it goes in to the Seanad, to have some sort of independent committee to advise him on it.</P>

      <P>Seeing that the first item listed in the amendments here is the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency or the proposed Carlow-Kildare constituency, as a Deputy for Carlow-Kilkenny I wish to say that I have an open mind on this matter.  Since I came to the House I have represented Carlow-Kilkenny and that portion of Wexford which was brought in some years ago.  Whether it be Carlow-Kildare or Carlow-Kilkenny I do not mind, but we must look at the overall picture.  Deputy Hogan proved here quite definitely that in his amendments he is changing something in the region of only 2,000 or 2,500 people whereas the Minister is changing 29,000 or 29,500 people.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Esmonde raised the question of Carlow-Kildare and Carlow-Kilkenny here, I think the Minister mentioned that it would involve so many changes that it could not be done.  Deputy Hogan has put down the facts clearly for the Minister.  There are arguments as to why Carlow-Kildare should be one constituency.  They are under the same county manager and we have the Carlow-Kildare Mental Hospital Board, all under one administration. As was pointed out, some years ago it was the constituency of Carlow-Kildare. Admittedly, Carlow at that stage, was divided.  The one unfair thing I see is the position of the number of people in County Wexford who have been brought into the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency.  I think this was mentioned by Deputy Emonde.  We represent them in Dáil Éireann, but when it comes to local elections they are completely separate from us.  This should have been taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that there should have been some kind of independent committee set up in the House in order to draft these constituencies. It is only human nature&mdash;I am putting it mildly in saying that to the Minister&mdash;that the political head of a Department when drawing up constituencies will try to draw them up to the advantage of his own Party. That is why there should have been an independent committee to do this job. The Minister should consider the <Col N="1593" /> amendments that have been put down by Deputy Hogan and I think he should come to the conclusion that at least he would be disturbing fewer of the population by accepting these amendments than by proceeding with the plan or the divisions he has already drawn up.</P>

      <P>We have been a great team in County Dublin.  Each one of us will lose friends.  I am losing a pocket of friends.  The Minister is also losing them.  They are not going into his area but into South-West Dublin.  This is an area in which we got about 70 per cent of the votes in our time together.  As I said on the Second Reading, if Saints Peter and Paul came down they would not satisfy everyone. We must accept these things.  This is the third time since I came here that constituencies have been changed and in these changes I lost many old friends and dear colleagues.  I ask the House to realise that, no matter what commission we had and even if it had supernatural powers, we would not all be satisfied.  I am not satisfied because I do not want to lose old friends.  We are all human.  We have discussed this matter at great length.  The constituencies will be reviewed again in another few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister had a very difficult job in drawing up the constituencies and trying to satisfy his own people as well as the Opposition.  Nobody wants to be disturbed, especially if he has been representing the area for a while.  One may make enemies but one also makes many friends.  This affects all of us and not merely the Opposition.  The Minister could not do anything else.  I have great sympathy <Col N="1594" /> with whoever is trying to divide up constituencies, knowing that he has all sides to cope with.  For that reason alone I think we should give this Bill a chance.  In another few years we will be revising constituencies all over again.  That may not worry some of us, but I will be sorry to lose my dear colleague this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I support these amendments.  They are fair, just and reasonable and they involve the minimum of disturbance and the minimum of disturbance should be the aim of any Minister who really cherishes all the children of the nation equally.  I agree with Deputy Burke that the Minister has a hard job to satisfy his colleagues&mdash;that was the word Deputy Burke used&mdash;but he certainly made sure he went as far as he possibly could to satisfy his colleagues.  There were at least five or six Fianna Fáil Party meetings and a great deal of argument and wrangling went on until they eventually decided on a Bill which satisfied the maximum number of the Fianna Fáil Party and ensured, through gerrymandering and manipulation of county boundaries, etc., that Fianna Fáil would come back, if at all possible, with the maximum number of of seats from the minimum number of votes.  If that is not gerrymandering, then I do not know the meaning of the word.</P>
      <P>The Minister set out to gerrymander and he should get 100 per cent for his work.  Deputy Hogan pointed out that by taking six pieces of territory and transferring only 21,199 voters we could evolve a scheme of constituencies within the Constitution and within the interpretation of Mr. Justice Budd to whose judgment the Minister has referred so often here.  But the Minister was not satisfied to do that and his scheme involves disturbing 14 pieces of nine counties and 101,100 people.  The Minister has admitted there are alternanatives and any one of those alternatives would be better and fairer than the Minister's proposed scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, under his proposal, is disturbing 29,050 people in the eastern portion of the country.  Deputy Hogan's amendment would involve the disturbance <Col N="1595" /> of only 6,640 people.  For political reasons the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment.  On Committee Stage the Minister told us three-seat constituencies were the most desirable. We claim that some constituencies flout the wishes of the people spoken out loudly and clearly on 16th October last.  The Minister forecast that the &ldquo;yeses&rdquo; would carry the day by over 100,000.  The Minister's proposal, on the contrary, was defeated by over 234,000 votes.  That was the biggest vote ever against any Party.  That was a humiliating defeat for the Fianna Fáil Party.  If, as the Minister now claims, three-seat constituencies are the most desirable, why were there only 17 three-seat constituencies under the 1961 revision?  Under this measure there will be 26 such constituencies. For PR to operate properly it is most essential that there should be four-seat and five-seat constituencies.  I am sorry the Minister is going because I should prefer to say what I have to say to his face.  I know the Minister is not able to refute the case made by Deputy Hogan.  I never thought I should see the day when a man who spoke for seven hours, for six hours and for five hours on occasion would suddenly become mute.  That is the man who refused to sit down one evening despite two Ministers coming in and ordering him to sit down, on a direction from the Taoiseach.  On the last evening before the Adjournment, by agreement between the Whips and with the approval of the Fianna Fáil Cabinet, the Minister was confined to one hour to reply because the Taoiseach fully understood that the longer the Minister went on speaking the more harm he was doing to the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fianna Fáil cause.</P>
    <P>Someone referred to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries as the &ldquo;Paisley&rdquo; of Fianna Fáil.  I suppose the Minister for Local Government can be described as the &ldquo;Major Bunting&rdquo; of Fianna Fáil.  Some of us are glad that the Taoiseach has at last succeeded in silencing him because the Minister has stated here this afternoon that he will not reply to any of the arguments being made here.  Of course, the real reason why he will not reply is that he <Col N="1596" /> is not able to reply.  The arguments are irrefutable.  It is a great pity the Taoiseach did not take the same action with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries two or three days ago; had he done so the Nationalist cause might have gone better in Northern Ireland. This Bill is just bloody vindictiveness on the part of the Minister.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i> argued on the last occasion Cavan and Monaghan could be joined together.  Indeed, had we not suffered the dead hand of Fianna Fáil over the country in the last 20 or 30 years there would be sufficient population in Cavan and Monaghan today to justify making each a three-seat constituency.  Of course, the real reason why Cavan and Monaghan were not combined as a five-seat constituency was that the people came up from the grassroots and, despite all we hear about ecumenism, they asked that Cavan and Monaghan should not be made a five-seat constituency because, if it were, &ldquo;the Protestants would get a seat.  We cannot put the Party Whip on them and make them toe the Party line&rdquo;. That is well known.  It was spoken about in the restaurant the evening those people were up here making representations to the Minister and to members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is regrettable that such a thing should happen.</P>
    <P>We know why the Minister will not agree to make Louth a four-seater, as proposed by Deputy Hogan.  He knows, or thinks in any case, that by leaving Louth as a four-seater he has the possibility of getting two out of the three seats.  He knows that if Louth were a four-seater Fianna Fáil would get only two seats, and it would be either Fianna Fáil two, and Fine Gael two, or Fianna Fáil two, Fine Gael one, and Labour one.  By making Cavan, Monaghan, Meath and Louth three-seat constituencies he hopes to get two out of the three.  It might be no harm to point out that before the 16th October the Minister forecast that he would win the referendum by over 100,000 votes.  This could boomerang on him in the same way.  The eyes of the people are open.  They love justice and fair play, and they will not stand for the type of vindictive butchery <Col N="1597" /> which has been done in County Meath to try to take the seat there from Deputy Farrelly.  His own home area was put into Cavan, part was put in Monaghan, and then part of Kildare was brought into Meath to make up the population for a three-seat constituency.</P>
    <P>We know why that portion of Kildare was put into Meath.  At that time it was envisaged that Deputy Crinion would change from Kildare and stand for County Meath.  We now know that the Minister for Defence has no intention of retiring.  Deputy Crinion knows quite well that he is not wanted in Meath, and he is thinking of going up for Kildare or perhaps he is thinking of coming back into Longford-Westmeath. That is the latest.  Whoever goes up, we will get two.  I am quite certain of that. We do not fear Deputy Crinion or anyone who is brought down from the city or anywhere else and planked on us.</P>
    <P>We have listened for a long number of days to a spate of misrepresentations from the Minister.  The Minister believes that if you say something long enough and often enough some people will believe it.  Even at this late stage, I appeal to him not to kick the people of this country in the teeth and not to continue with this vindictive action in this vindictive Bill.  I appeal to him to listen to the voice of reason and to agree to the amendments proposed by Deputy Hogan.  If he is not in a position to reply to these amendments I should like to know why.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister believe that because he has a majority in the House he can&mdash;and we know he can&mdash;steamroll his proposals through the House? While he may steamroll these proposals through, the eyes of the Irish people are open.  They have found out the present Government.  They know the Ministers are arrogant, that they are dictatorial and interested in self-preservation. They know that a Party fighting for self-preservation will fight to the last ditch.  The people have found them out and when they go to the country they will get as rude an awakening and as big a defeat as they got in the referendum on 16th October.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short contribution <Col N="1598" /> I have to make on these changes I shall endeavour to persuade the Government to exercise reason.  Electoral changes always lead to difficulties, but those difficulties can become aggravated and exaggerated and quite impossible when the issue is clouded by a desire for Party gain.  I do not often gratuitously commend Deputies in this House, but I think Deputy Hogan of my own Party deserves commendation from the House because he has tried to produce, in a most objective fashion, a solution to difficulties that have arisen.</P>
      <P>In his Second Reading speech the Minister paid pious lip-service to the idea of a minimum amount of change and a minimum amount of disturbance in order to try to hold together various ancient associations.  Never did a man succeed in going so far away from his alleged objective as the Minister did in this Bill.  Looking through the Bill generally we find that there has been a fantastic amount of mutilation, a fantastic crossing and linking of unnatural boundaries.  Take my own constituency.  Not only did they carve it up and give some to Kerry and more to mid-Cork, but they also sub-divided parishes and sections of parishes and townlands in the area.</P>
      <P>When one looks objectively at that type of butchery one must inevitably come back to the underlying suspicion that is dominant and paramount in the whole thinking on this Bill, that is, using the juxtaposition of population for the purposes of Party gain.  There is no doubt at all about it&mdash;and let no one have any illusions about it&mdash; this Bill is designed to do as much as possible for as many as possible of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Maybe that is good politics, but it is done so crudely that the country is very properly up in arms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not surprised that the Minister does not want to reply to this series of reasoned, proportioned and balanced amendments suggested by Deputy Hogan.  If you are throwing 100,000 voters around like snuff in the wind, it takes a lot of wind out of your sails when objective and reasoned proposals can come from Deputy Hogan showing where natural alignments and affinities can be pretio <Col N="1599" /> served with a minimal movement of people.</P>
    <P>Now, let us ask ourselves, in the cool deliberation of this quiet Chamber this afternoon, why the Minister cannot address his mind in a rational way to this proposal.  Deputy Hogan has gone to great trouble&mdash;in population analysis, in voting analysis and in constituency analysis&mdash;to get a comprehensive plan that is not only workable and practical but, as I have said before, objective in its fairness.  I know perfectly well that this Bill will ultimately boomerang on Fianna Fáil. They are a long time due for a drubbing from the Irish people.  They got a taste of it in the referendum.  They will get a much bigger taste of it in the next general election.  It is because they cannot preserve objectivity and create an image in Government of an objective approach to and an interest in all sections of the community that they will get this drubbing and ultimate annihilation.</P>
    <P>I rise to speak here not in any spirit of animus.  I shall fight for my new constituency, fight for it well.  I shall be pleased to fight for continued representation of the people of my native county, unafraid of the result.  The people are the jury.  We must accept their verdict.  I am not a bit afraid of it. We should be able to get a reasonable approach to, and some realistic basis for, changes if we want to give the electorate the feeling that their electoral system is secure and that the basis of election is sound.  We cannot do that when we have counties interposed and superimposed on each other with fragmentation of other counties to add bits here and there to bolster up lack of population.</P>
    <P>We know perfectly well that Fianna Fáil are terribly worried about the West.  Forty years of neglect must take its toll.  Therefore, we now have a breaking-up and a divide in the West which can be described only as both catastrophic and idiotic.  Anybody looking at the design of the new constituencies can see at once the imprint of the esoteric mind, the rapacious, grabbing hand and the tenacity of power-cling in the design of the <Col N="1600" /> scheme.  The people in the West know full well now why so many changes were necessary and why seats must be lost.  The denudation of the West of its population is the greatest single indictment&mdash;sustained, unanswerable, everclamorous indictment&mdash;of the failure of this Government to do anything but sweet damn all for the West.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to it but I want to get it in the perspective of the damning situation in the West which is now sought to be changed by the use of the East as the cushion against the inevitable loss that must come from the West.  The manner in which the eastern area has been carved up was aptly epitomised by the very words of the gracious and avuncular Deputy P.J. Burke when, with suspect tears, he was regretting the departure of his colleague, Deputy Boland, the Minister for Local Government, from his own constituency.  With the unctuous humility of a Uriah Heep washing his hands in crocodile tears for the loss of such a colleague, he told us, in effect: &ldquo;We must lose old friends and we must make new ones&rdquo;. Deputy P. Hogan of South Tipperary seeks to minimise the eastern problem and to keep intact, in the strongest possible way, old associations and borders that have been built up over the years with regard to constituencies &mdash;affiliations that have become copperfastened by the passage of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy L'Estrange dealt with one aspect of constituencies, on which I have little to say, and that is one of the other esoteric purposes behind this Bill.  The Irish people, in an overwhelming way, said: &ldquo;We want the preservation of proportional representation.&rdquo; That will and that desire of the Irish people should have been of paramount importance to anybody who was framing an Electoral Bill under that Constitutional rebuff.  He should have been perfectly aware of the fact that the way to stymie and to stultify and, indeed, to try to defeat the proper working of proportional representation <Col N="1601" /> is to get the maximum number of three-seat constituencies because, in a three-seat constituency, there is less effective spread of the proportional representation idea than in any other type of constituency.  The Minister is well aware of that and is equally well aware that there is fundamental thinking in opposition to Government today that would allow, under the proper exercise of proportional representation, a gradual build-up of a transfer against the Government to ensure their effective and sudden demise as a Government after the next election.</P>
    <P>I am deliberately charging the Government with using this Bill for the purpose of off-setting to the greatest possible degree the effect of the catastrophic &ldquo;No&rdquo; they got from the Irish people in their attempt to abolish proportional representation.  I say that with complete conviction.  I say that the reason the Minister is not prepared to consider as a basis for logical discussion the proposals by Deputy Patrick Hogan is because they are unanswerable in the light of Fianna Fáil's running away from the answer of the Irish people on their Constitutional belief and on their Constitutional support for proportional representation in this country.</P>
    <P>Let us take the matter in the fairest possible light.  An assiduous Deputy proposes, as does Deputy Hogan, a series of amendments designed to minimise from 100,000 odd down to something just under 7,000 the movement of people in relation to constituencies and in relation to electoral areas.  Yet the Minister has the effrontery, the audacity and the ignorant arrogance to say that he will not answer it, that he will make no contribution.  Some people might say &ldquo;mute of malice&rdquo;, I am putting it down crudely and bluntly as &ldquo;mute of ignorance&rdquo; because the argument for the amendments is irrefutable. It is a disgrace that anybody has the effrontery to treat this House in that way.  If the situation was reversed and there was a Fianna Fáil Deputy over here prepared to make that type of an assiduous, objective contribution it would be welcomed and analysed.  Not now.  The shutters are down, the doors are locked: &ldquo;I will not answer debates.&rdquo;<Col N="1602" /> He could weary the House here &mdash;and, my heavens, he can weary the House when he tries, the same Minister for Local Government&mdash;he could weary the House here with marathon runs of eight hours and seven hours and six hours of verbosity and tripe but he cannot come into the House to deal with a series of reasoned, logical, properly symmetrical amendments that take in the whole eastern area and show what is practical, what is reasonable and what can be effective, preserving as much as possible of county bounds, of natural associations.</P>
    <P>Again, I say the amendments make for having a number of larger constituencies in which the full force of proportional representation could work naturally and effectively.  The Government are going to strangle that effort and this Bill, in the light of the Minister's refusal to discuss reasoned amendments, must now become nothing other than a measure steamrolled through the House for one purpose only, the most shameful and miserable of all purposes, that of trying to bolster up the last agonising days of a onetime mighty political machine that has broken down, that is now dying of exhaustion choked by the tentacles of its arrogance, patronage and abuse of power, that has reached the limit of its power and is now suffering from the reactions of those who have found them out for the unthinking, inept, incompetent Government that they are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The Minister, I regret, has not seen fit to make any comment on these eight amendments.  It must be almost without precedent in the House that a Minister has not seen fit to speak or is unable to provide an adequate defence or answer to a battery of amendments submitted to him affecting a Bill which he is piloting through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the difficulty in a matter like this.  I agree at once that no Minister or no single individual could devise a system of electoral areas to please everybody.  Somebody said he would need to have 144 Bills to please the 144 Deputies but one would need more than that.  One would need a few <Col N="1603" /> more Bills to satisfy a few Senators who have aspirations to this House and more Bills to satisfy the host of county councillors who are looking over all our shoulders all over the country.  It would, therefore, be clearly beyond the ingenuity of any man to even attempt to produce any kind of electoral Bill that would meet any kind of general acceptance.</P>
    <P>It is, nevertheless, the duty of a Minister to produce a Bill, if not in conformity with the wishes of everybody, at least in conformity with certain guiding principles.  The Minister has set aside the principles by which he should have been guided and principles to which he professes still to adhere.  He has refused to speak on this matter on Report Stage today.  He has intimated to us that he has said all he had to say on the opening Stages of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister believed in the preservation of local authority boundaries before the referendum.  He says he still believes in that.  I believe in that also. However, he maintains now that the referendum, as he interprets it, gives him the right and authorises him to discard completely county boundaries. He maintains that the Irish people by their vote in the referendum said: &ldquo;We do not care a damn about county boundaries any more.  Do what you like with them.&rdquo;  I contend that the Irish people said no such thing.  This is too facile, too glib an interpretation of the referendum result.  The Minister is merely putting that interpretation on it to suit his own purposes.  The Minister is not naive.  He moves around the country and he must be quite well aware of the fact that in all pockets of counties which have been transferred into other counties there is dissatisfaction. I am perfectly satisfied of that from my experience in my own constituency.</P>
    <P>The Minister has come up with a new line of reasoning, again to justify what he is doing.  He has now come up with the notion that if you are transferring population from one county to another there is a simple way by which you can do it, that the transfer is justified provided the number of people is big enough to make an entity <Col N="1604" /> of their own or a county entity within the new constituency.  He has not told us what size that type of transfer should be but judging from what he is doing in this particular area I submit that he has transferred a very unsuitable number.  My personal view is that if you must transfer people from one county to another you should aim at transferring only a very small number of people, as small as possible. Another type of transfer that would be justifiable would be the transfer of a whole county or the greater part of a county so that the transferred population could elect a Deputy from each Party to represent them in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>In my own electoral area of South Tipperary there was a transfer of 11,000 people from Waterford.  In effect, that is slightly more than an electoral area.  We have five electoral areas in the constituency which roughly amount to only one-sixth.  When a convention takes place these people are completely dissatisfied; they feel submerged and have no say even in the selection of a candidate for Dáil Éireann.  I cannot see how the Minister can draw the conclusion that a transfer of 12,000 or 15,000 people will, of necessity, make them secure in any single constituency he may devise.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned just before the debate adjourned on the last occasion the ever-increasing demand for better services and better systems.  This demand is always evident when a system has been in operation for a period.  The ever-increasing demands on the health authorities for new drugs and new services are noticeable each year during the estimates period when an assessment of the situation in respect of the coming year's services is made and given to members of the health authorities.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to understand this motion particularly when it is in the name of the Fine Gael Party.  I referred to it as a cleansing of conscience, because at the last estimates meeting of the corporation when this matter was discussed a motion was moved by two Fine Gael members, one of whom, Deputy Ryan, seconded the motion, that there be a reduction in the Dublin Health Authority demand for £789,106 on 5th April last year.  This gives some indication of the thought given to the problem by the people who have put down this motion.  On the one hand, they seek to have better services, and, on the other hand, they have little concern for the people who are really affected.</P>
      <P>The system that is in operation must be worked until such time as an alternative system is devised.  If the motion had been accepted and implemented it would have meant that less money would have been available to the widow, the orphan, the sick, the unemployed and the disabled.  This substantial reduction of £789,106 would have meant that a considerable section of the citizens of this city would have to suffer because of the Fine Gael motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a reduction in the demand.  Our function on that occasion was to strike the rat for the health authority and the Deputy sought a reduction of £789,000 in the demand. However, when the matter was finally put before the city council it was carried with the Fine Gael Party voting against the estimate.  I am sure the weaker sections of the community are aware that the real intention behind the Fine Gael motion is publicity.  In relation to health and other problems of our citizens we are seeking services for the lower income groups, but this motion clearly indicates the mentality of the Fine Gael Party and shows that they have no regard whatsoever for the people who are in need and in dire need in some instances.</P>
      <P>The need for change is both evident and necessary.  The Minister is drawing, to some degree, on past experience in a desire to bring into effect a system which will have lasting advantages when the changes come.  The first Coalition Government collapsed as a result of trying to implement a Health Act.  This shows the need for a cautious approach and a comprehensive study of the problems which arise in the alteration of an existing system. The amount of work which the Minister is doing is unknown to the great majority of people either in the House or in the State.  He has made untiring efforts to acquire the information which can be shown from past experience to be both necessary and desirable in making changes which will be accepted and of benefit to the nation as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many defects in the present system as operated by the Health Authorities.  In some cases there are people getting services, who in my opinion are not entitled to them; while, on the other hand, there are many people who are entitled to services and who are not obtaining them.  The position must be spelled out clearly so that citizens will be fully aware of their entitlement and will not be discouraged by Fine Gael speakers who have described people seeking services as &ldquo;paupers&rdquo;.  Citizens are as much entitled to health services as to any <Col N="1607" /> other service provided by the central or local authority.  When you refer to people who apply for medical services under the Health Act as paupers it only leads to people depriving themselves by not wanting to be classified in this particular manner by some sections of the community.  They are entitled to them by right and for that reason there is no reflection on anyone who has to seek assistance from the health authority.  If what Deputy Ryan has stated is correct, that his desire was to see the maximum amount of money made available, this £789,000, which he sought to have the Health Estimate reduced by, I wonder would he have had the courage to come into the Division lobbies and vote for the necessary financial resolutions if a tax increase was necessary in order to provide this money. We have seen, when going into the Division lobbies, that on no occasion have the Fine Gael members ever supported financial resolutions which would make money available to finance health services or any other services of that kind.</P>
    <P>The question of relieving the ratepayers was mentioned.  We know there are ratepayers in this city who are finding it difficult to meet the additional demand in rates but we also have groups in this city, big business concerns, petrol companies, cigarette companies, breweries and other people making contributions to the rates who cannot be allowed off the hook in any way.  Those people have an obligation to our city and to our citizens in whatever section of the city or the country they operate.  They must make their fair contribution.  However, I agree there are some ratepayers who, unfortunately, are finding it difficult to meet those increased demands.  The Minister made his views known to the members of the health authorities, to the members of the three rating authorities when we met him recently in the Custom House. He was frank and his views were met him recently in the Custom House. He was frank and his views were accepted by all the members of the deputation which met him on that occasion when he explained in great detail the problems there were and he explained the cost of the necessary <Col N="1608" /> alterations and indicated at the same time that the examination was proceeding and when it did come he would then be in a position to make his statement.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins mentioned that since 1957 this has been the Fine Gael approach.  It is amazing that he did not refer to the years before 1957 when he was then in a position to carry out alterations and to introduce a new health system.  When he was Minister for Health Deputy O'Higgins failed to live up to his responsibilities.  He failed during that period to devise a new system.  He failed to do anything other than implement a system which he then considered satisfactory.  As I said before, there is no doubt that change is necessary, change is desirable and change must come.  The Minister is bringing about this change and I am sure when he has his examination completed, when he has reached satisfactory conclusions with all the Parties concerned, he will introduce something which will be satisfactory to all.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his work and assistance to the aged in this city.  Most of his work is done without any publicity whatever. It is only people close to the Minister and to the organisations, both voluntary and local, who are aware of the wonderful work done without any trumpet sounding in order to publicise himself.  He is always seeking improvements and he is one man we can be sure will bring into operation an effective system, when he is in a position to do so, one that we can be proud of and even if it takes some little time longer it is just as well to ensure that all the facts have been correctly gathered and that the mistakes made by a previous Government will not be made on the next occasion.</P>

      <P>The motion under discussion in this House for the last few evenings will in my opinion do good whether or not everybody agrees with it by highlighting the weaknesses <Col N="1609" /> in the existing services.  I am afraid, like some of my colleagues who spoke, I am not quite clear what Fine Gael mean by saying &ldquo;a comprehensive health service based upon insurance principles&rdquo;.  If that means that the people through insurance are to bear the whole cost, then I think it would not be a scheme which would be very acceptable or very easily worked.  I am sorry it was not possible to have the Labour amendment discussed because I feel sure Fine Gael will agree that a system &ldquo;Financed by the State from taxation and graded social welfare contributions from all earning members of the community and operating in conjunction with the social welfare services&rdquo; would be a much better system. It always puzzles me, when something like this is being discussed by the House, to find people on the Government benches prepared outside this House to criticise the system, the Minister and everything else and to throw bouquets here at the Minister.</P>
      <P>I am quite sure that the Minister for Health, like his predecessors, is anxious to do everything he possibly can to provide good health services for this country but Ministers are part of the Government and they can only provide the service which the money they get will allow them to provide. The present Minister is on record as having stated that he preferred the Labour approach to this than the Fine Gael approach and I think he even said to that of the Government.  That showed he is a very intelligent man because the approach which we have to health services is, first of all, that we must realise that the health of the people is the important thing, secondly, that in order to ensure that the health of the people is properly looked after money must be found and, thirdly, we state how we consider the money should be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time and again I have heard people inside and outside this House referring to the number of man days lost through strikes.  It seems to me a favourite comment of those who want to criticise the workers of this country that they lose more man days in strikes than any other country in Western <Col N="1610" /> Europe.  I think that is the usual expression they use.  Nobody ever seems to bother counting the number of man days lost through ill health which could be and I believe should be prevented.</P>
    <P>I have noticed, as a trade union official, that since it has been possible during the past few years to negotiate sickness payments on a fairly wide scale for workers in various types of jobs, the number of man days lost through ill health has dropped considerably. The reason is quite plain; before sickness payments were introduced, these people had to work as long as they could and eventually, when they became ill and if they had not a medical card, they were not able to get the medicine they required.  Now that they know they will be paid if they are away from work for a relatively long period they can leave off work and obtain the medicines they require.  A result of this is that they are back at work in a much shorter time than was possible before the sick pay scheme was introduced.  This matter can be easily checked with employers and doctors.</P>
    <P>The existing scheme is a very slight improvement on the old red ticket scheme, which still operates in some areas, in that people who are entitled to treatment just cannot take it.  For instance, I spoke to a man last night who is a son of an aged and widowed mother.  This man can work only in the area where his mother lives as he is not in a position on her account to go away to work in Dublin or elsewhere. As a result of this, he is as often unemployed as he is at work.  He has no medical card and when he recently developed a rash on his face he went to a doctor who charged him 15/- and gave him a prescription.  When he took this prescription to the local chemist he was told that it would cost 18/- to have it compounded.  As he could not afford to pay this, he is still going around with the bad rash on his face and wondering what kind of health service we have in this country. This type of case can be repeated over and over again and, whether we agree or disagree with the motion before the House, the mere fact that the various aspects of the health services in this <Col N="1611" /> country can be debated and that the shortcomings can be pointed out makes it a worthwhile motion.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to refer to the present system where the Minister is in the position that he has notified health authorities that estimates which they submitted in October last of the requirements for health services for the coming year must be pruned because of the fact, he says, that the money is not easy to get or some such phraseology. The plain fact is that under the existing scheme which is a very poor one most local authorities will be unable to finance it from the amount coming from the rates and the 52 or 54 per cent from the State unless the State comes up with some more money because there has been an increase in costs of approximately 25 per cent since last October.</P>

      <P>Sometimes my heart goes out in pity rather than in anger to Deputy Dowling because he is to be pitied.  He is the first person who will be rejected by Fianna Fáil when they are on the slippery slope.  The poor unfortunate individual comes in here and to other assemblies trying to do the bosses dirty work.  A sample of this was given here today when Deputy Dowling suggested that in the Dublin Health Authority last year, in common with my Fine Gael colleagues, I endeavoured to reduce the amount towards health serwhat I wanted was that the £789,000 be paid, not by the ratepayers of Dublin, but by the Minister for Health in accordance with the undertaking given by the Government in the White Paper published by them three years ago when they said that the cost of health services on the ratepayers would not exceed that which was borne by the rates in the financial year 1965-66.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year, we have repeated that again in the Dublin Health Authority and I am sorry to report that our efforts to make the Government fulfil their obligation of three years ago was defeated on the casting vote of the Fianna Fáil chairman because, without his vote, we would have succeeded <Col N="1612" /> in placing the responsibility for the increased costs of the health services on those who had undertaken three years ago to pay it&mdash;the Government.</P>
    <P>If they will honour their often repeated undertaking to the ratepayers of this country, not alone the ratepayers of Dublin but the ratepayers of the whole country, to relate the cost of the health services borne on the rates to what was borne in the year 1965-66, then every ratepayer in the country and that, of course, includes every rentpayer whose rent includes a percentage of the rates, the rate for the forthcoming financial year will be about 7s 6d less in the £.  That undertaking was given by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the White Paper which was published more than three years ago the Government accepted that local rates were not a form of taxation suitable for collecting additional money to pay for health services.  Twelve years ago, we asserted that the rates were not a suitable system for collecting money to pay for the health services. Indeed, as far back as 1951, Deputy John A.  Costello who was then Taoiseach, speaking in Kilkenny, said that it was his view that the rates were not a suitable form for financing the health services and that it was feasible to construct a system of national health insurance which would provide for this country the type of health service that the people want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Be that as it may, the Government set out deliberately on a policy to prevent the people getting the health service and the system of financing it that they wanted until, as I say, in January, 1966, they published their general confession and admission of having been wrong up to then.  They said that they did not regard the rates as a suitable form of financing the health services and they undertook not to put the health services on the rates. If they had honoured their undertaking, every ratepayer and rentpayer would be paying about 7s 6d less in the £ in the forthcoming financial year.  The Minister has been rather blandly indicating <Col N="1613" /> during recent months that he had apparently at least got the members of the Government to accept that a proper health system is necessary. Here, a Cheann Comhairle, I would like to interject that we in Fine Gael are in favour of graduated contributions. We believe contributions towards the health services and social services should be related to a person's capacity to pay.  This scheme, now accepted as a respectable scheme and a scheme of insurance contributions, was violently, viciously and persistently attacked during the last general election.  The then Taoiseach, Deputy Seán Lemass, speaking in his own constituency in which this Dáil is situated, stated that the Fine Gael health scheme was &ldquo;a typical, harebrained Fine Gael scheme&rdquo;.  He said that the Party had committed itself to an ill-conceived scheme to finance extension of the service by what he calls a poll-tax. Again, at Ardee, County Louth, on 3rd April, 1965, and I quote from the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 4th April, 1965, which bears, <i>inter alia,</i> a photograph of yourself, a Cheann Comhairle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure.  It is certainly under the heading &ldquo;Scope of health services improved&rdquo;.  It says that Deputy Childers, a member of the Fianna Fáil Administration, refused to believe that the people would want the Fine Gael health scheme, one-third of which was to be collected by means of a poll-tax levied on all insured persons. Here we have scorn and condemnation being heaped on the basically sound, truly Christian, and financially respectable Fine Gael scheme of insurance contributions.  I fail to understand how the present Minister could have dared, last week, to criticise the Fine Gael Party for what he described as the articulation of a health policy without stating how it was to be financed.  There is not time, in the few minutes allowed to us in proposing and replying to a debate of this kind, to spell out the details of the system of financing the services; but we have <Col N="1614" /> given the detailed figures time and time again in written memoranda to the Select Committee of this House which met for years and never published a report.  We have given them to the Department.  The Minister admits he has the Fine Gael memorandum.  That memorandum has been seen and examined by financial and insurance experts throughout the land and has never been found wanting because it is basically sound and is based on the tripartite contribution which we think to be proper&mdash;one-third from the employee, one-third from the employer and one-third from the State.  This is the way in which we in this country can build up a fund to finance the personal health services, to provide that we will have what we apparently need, which is a proper system of health care outside hospitals and costly institutions.</P>
      <P>At the moment five per cent of the total maximum health bill is in respect of services provided outside hospitals and costly institutions.  That five per cent of the total bill is applied to only 30 per cent of the population.  All it needs to bring sanity back into the health services and to get away from a system which is unduly costly, because it is based on costly institutions, is an increase of ten per cent in the total health cost.  That is a sizeable sum.  It is £5 million.  If brought into operation it would reduce the flow of unnecessary entrances to hospitals and costly institutions which at present is maintained at flood peak because we are the only nation in the developed world which has a health service based on institutions instead of basing it on the needs of human beings, most of whom are well all the time, and most of whom are capable of being looked after when they are ill in better surroundings and with greater possibility of recovery in their own homes at substantially less cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister was contributing to this debate he was at pains to emphasise that he was not anxious to take over ownership or control of the voluntary hospitals, which hospitals contribute the greatest amount of institutional care and skill, particularly <Col N="1615" /> in urban areas, to the health of our people.  It seems to me he is embarking on the same slippery slope which the Minister for Education embarked on in relation to secondary education.  The Minister wants to acquire the voluntary hospitals by stealth.  He wants to provide that the religious orders and others in charge of them will be no more than caretakers without power.</P>

      <P>The Fitzgerald Report at page 42, chapter 4, provides for a Consultants' Establishment Board which makes it clear that the primary function of the board should be to consolidate consultants' appointments and to approve the creation of necessary new consultant posts.

      <P>It would take away from the consultants and from those who have conducted the voluntary hospitals for years an effective say in the appointment of consultants in the voluntary hospitals.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was proposing to require the submission of names to him so that he might have his say in the appointments being made. We regard this as an endeavour to take over control and ownership and management of the voluntary hospitals and to take them away from the devoted care of those who have successfully operated these institutions for many years.  We think there are things far more urgent requiring Ministerial attention and to which the Minister ought to be directing his influence and power, and that is, basically the organisation of a developed health service which would meet the real needs of our people.  We do not have to change this whole structure of our health institutions in order to have a proper and fair health service.  We do not have to endeavour to create difficulties with the hospital managers, owners and the medical profession to bring about radical and much-needed improvements in our health services.</P>
      <P>What we need is a totally different frame of mind on the part of the Minister and the other members of the Government. What we need them to do is to base a health service on what Fine Gael believe to be an essential matter of principle&mdash;on the capacity of the people to pay when they are earning and not when they are without income, and also on the basic principle that our health service should be so orientated that it will give relief and assistance of the first resort to people when it can be of most value, so that the Government will not continue to do as they have done in the past, delay it until the unfortunate victim has fallen over a cliff, when he is no longer in need of ambulance and hospital services.  That has been a daft, stupid health policy and we in Fine Gael are firmly opposed to it.</P>

      <P>I move the following motion:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann welcomes the statements of the Minister for Local Government that land buying and high profits had put burdens on the home-seeker; that the private sector must not unduly exploit the social needs and that while reasonable returns to landowners are acceptable it is inequitable that house prices should be unnecessarily inflated through individuals making exorbitant and totally unearned profits from the community's investment; and calls upon the Government to take steps, if necessary, by the introduction of amending legislament <Col N="1619" /> tion to enable immediate effect to be given to the principles contained in these statements.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The motion put forward by the Labour Party refers to the remarks made by the Minister for Local Government in connection with the high price of land in city areas.  The sentiments expressed by the Minister were very relevant. Anybody who is concerned with the problem of housing in Dublin and throughout the country is aware that a very big factor in the spiralling costs of building, causing the prohibitive cost to the purchaser, the newly-married couple, is the cost of land, and this is particularly true in the present inflated state of the market.</P>
    <P>We are aware that individuals who have come into possession of land on the perimeter of the larger urban centres have reaped very high dividends, indeed, out of the need of those areas for more building space.  We know that municipal authorities throughout the country have had to pay extremely high prices for land for building purposes and that as a result the community, through the municipal bodies, is paying a very high price for land for their building programmes. There is an extraordinary difference between the price per acre for building land near cities and the price for similar acreages of land for agriculture elsewhere in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>One element of cost is the high price of land in urban centres.  This cost arises in the direct schemes operated by various corporations, but the person who is today lucky enough to be able to purchase a house or who attempts to purchase a house is bitterly aware of the fact that a large element in the price he has to pay for that house is the original site price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's statements gave us hope that the Government were serious about doing something in this regard. They suggested that the Government, <Col N="1620" /> by legislation or otherwise, would attempt to stabilise land prices, would attempt to intervene with a view to ensuring that land prices would not continue their present spiral and that, as a result, the person purchasing his home could anticipate that prices, which are at present rocketing, could at least be held down to a certain level.  But so far we have had no action from the Minister in this regard and we are now reaching the stage at which Dublin Corporation are finding it more and more difficult to get the wherewithal to continue a building programme that would break the back of the present housing shortage in Dublin.</P>
    <P>A favourite Government statement is to the effect that we will always have a housing shortage and that it is a mark of a prosperous economy to have a housing shortage.  We would say that while it may be bearable enough to have a housing shortage, the extent of the housing problem in Dublin at present, and elsewhere in the country, is such that we can no longer tolerate it.  As a community, we cannot continue to tolerate a situation in which a man prudently puts aside his week's saving in anticipation of being in a position to buy his own house and then finds that deposits continue to go up and the cost of land continues to advance upwards at an astronomical rate. He finds, too, that the man who invested in land in certain parts of the city three years ago can now look forward to that investment being practically trebled in that three year period.</P>
    <P>The question we ask the Government is: is it fair that the needs of the community should be held up to ransom because a group of people, already possessing too much capital, have capital to invest in land which is essential to the expansion of the city, at a time when the city continues to look for favourable land for building, and who are at liberty to say to the city authorities &ldquo;£X&rdquo;&mdash;naming any figure they please&mdash;&ldquo;is the price we require for the land you need for your building programme&rdquo;?  We ask is it fair to the city authorities and to the community that the Government should stand aside and see this highway robbery being perpetrated, because that is the only <Col N="1621" /> way it can be described?  In my opinion no moral authority can stand over the making of money on this basis, where the community's needs for housing are held to ransom because somebody is in the possession of land which he bought as a speculative investment. The defence usually advanced for the making of a large profit in an undertaking is that there was a risk involved for the man's capital and, therefore, it is morally right that he should have some return for the risk to his investment, but where is the risk for the man who invests in land near a city?  He can go to Havana or to any place in the world and relax for a few years and that investment will accumulate while he is on the broad of his back in any portion of the globe.</P>
    <P>We say that it is immoral, in the correct sense of the word, to allow that kind of investment to accumulate, especially when we remember that on the other side of the coin we find vastly increased prices in regard to the person who is attempting to purchase his own house from his savings, because the enhanced profits to the man who invests in the land as a speculation comes from the purchaser, the small individual who wishes to build his own home.  Repeatedly we have asked builders to make their house building prices more competitive but they have replied, and justly replied, to many critics by asking &ldquo;What can we do? The price of land continues to go up and seemingly nobody can halt the rising prices.&rdquo;  What makes land near a city centre valuable?  What makes land on the perimeter of a city valuable?  It is because of its proximity to a large community, to a large centre of population. Was this large urban centre the creation of any one man?  No, it was the creation of a whole community involved in business activity.  Therefore, we can turn justly to the man who expects to double or treble his money in a few years by getting the title deeds of a section of the land near a city and tell him that, because the efforts of a community, with its many businesses, have gone to make that city an important centre of economic activity, it is wrong that he should expect a continual rise in the price of that land.</P>
    <P>Increasingly, also, we find that investors <Col N="1622" /> from overseas are becoming involved in this kind of land speculation and the question which the Labour Party are asking themselves is: may we as a community permit this to continue any longer?  May we continue to see the price of land constantly increasing, with consequent repercussions on the cost of houses, both in the private and in the public sector?  Can we continue to afford the increased prices being asked by private individuals or must we, as other countries in similar situations have done&mdash;as in Britain and elsewhere&mdash;put a ceiling on the price of land near city centres?  We think it is high time that that was done.  The Minister's statement had given us hope in this direction but it seems to have been made, like many other ministerial statements, just for newspaper consumption. We have been waiting for action since that speech.  It seems to us that we are not serious about the housing problem unless we tackle this problem of land prices.  If we do not tackle it, then we are not determined to break the back of the housing problem that exists, because we would need to get money from Heaven if, as a community, we are to continue to pay, without protest, the present prices for land near the city centre.</P>
    <P>This is a totally different question from the question of agricultural land throughout the country.  What we are dealing with is the question of land near the city which the city requires for its development and whether we should allow the free force of market prices to obtain in regard to this land, and we are pointing out that in a similar situation Britain and other European countries invoked power to hold down land in such areas to a reasonable price.  We do not believe that anybody owning such land should be at a loss.  We do not suggest that anybody should be expropriated from such land, but we suggest that these people should not hold up the community to ransom. We all know that the price of a three bedroomed house is steadily going up to between £4,000 and £5,000 and we know that there are people who are attempting to buy their own houses who will be paying off mortgages for the rest of their working lives.  Are we to permit a situation in which hundreds <Col N="1623" /> of families in our cities will, in effect, be paying, for the rest of their lives, a bonus to absentee landlords of the description mentioned in our Bill? It seems to me that the absentee landlord of Land League days deservedly came in for a certain amount of odium and dislike from the people amongst whom he lived.  But here is an absentee landlord in our city areas who is definitely a parasite in the complete sense of the word.  What we have asked the Government to do is to intervene to ensure that land prices are kept at reasonable levels and that we do not allow the free force of the market to be invoked here, especially in the area surrounding our city.</P>
    <P>Looking around Dublin at the moment we can say that there is a great deal of land which, naturally, in the future, in the case of immediate surrounding areas, will be needed for the development of the city.  Is it right, therefore, that we should allow persons at this time with this advance knowledge to invest in such land and merely wait a few years before they can ask of us any price they desire?  This is the question before the community.  It is not a question that can be side-tracked as a Labour Party irrelevance.  It is a question that we fairly ask of every Deputy in the House of every political persuasion.  It is a question the community itself must answer, a question that none of us can afford to avoid by mere sloganising.  Above all, we would not like to see our opinions and suggestions described as merely another example of the Labour Party's dislike of private property.  It is not Labour Party policy to take the property of any man in this country but what we do say is that where, as in this case, a private individual engages in a frank land speculation in the full knowledge that this is a speculation and an investment in which his money need only be held for a short term, two or three years or a shorter period in certain circumstances, it is totally wrong that such an individual should be free to invest in such a nefarious speculation.</P>
    <P>However, I believe that our many enemies up and down the country at <Col N="1624" /> the moment and our many enemies in the public press, our many enemies who see their only purpose at this time to be to misrepresent Labour Party policy, will again try to do so.  I have no doubt that tomorrow morning we shall see scare headlines and hear rumours going out as a result of this motion being discussed here tonight.  Let that be so. This country has always been held up by such people.  They have always attempted to hold up the advance of a democratic Labour Party and put the community and its progress behind their own particular prejudices.  I have no doubt that they will do so in this case also.  We believe it is worth risking the commentaries and the judgment of these mudslingers.  We believe that the matter at issue here is important enough to risk even another few pints of red paint being thrown at us from that direction.  We have received enough of it, God knows, in the past month and presumably they will be liberally dishing out more pots of red paint in the months to come.</P>
    <P>But we turn the question back to them: have they any answer to this problem of spiralling land prices?  Have they any answer for the person who cannot meet the price of a house, for those whom the corporation cannot house at present, for the young married couple who can get no decent accommodation? Will empty slogans of their prejudices fulfil the need in the cases of these people or can they deny that this motion in our name is an honest attempt to grasp a very hot nettle, indeed, but one that I believe any community must grasp if it is serious about the housing problem.</P>
    <P>We believe that the Minister should live up to his reported statement because it is on this statement that we produce this motion.  He gave evidence of a realisation of the kind to which we refer.  The Minister in his speech appeared to realise that there are private buccaneers at liberty at present holding the community up to ransom in the matter of land prices.  He appeared to suggest that the community must take action against these buccaneers.  But he has taken no action in the intervening period.  Whether this has arisen because of the Minister's Party's rather close connection with <Col N="1625" /> people who engage in land speculation is not for me to say.  We appreciate that the Fianna Fáil Party, being the Party of reality, is in very close touch with these speculators in one form of reality, the reality of the increase in a land investment over a very short period.  We want the Minister to overlook these connections of his Party and to tackle the problem courageously because we believe it must be tackled if we are to proceed with the building of houses.  I do not see any hope of the small builder being able to offer houses at a reasonable rate if, in looking for sites, this small builder is to be at the mercy of somebody who went into the land venture in the first place to get the highest possible price.  What the builder must pay for the site and include in the cost of the house is inevitably passed back to the private consumer, the person looking for the house, the young married couple.</P>
    <P>This is one need that nobody in the community can ignore.  None of us can do without shelter.  May we ask one more question of our critics up and down the country at present&mdash;how can we abide a situation in which the community can permit, in the matter of housing, large profits to be made by a small number of people?  Can we permit this situation to continue?  Should we not see to it that housing is dealt with like any other social service and that we take action to see that it is delivered at a reasonable price to our people?  Any country owes it to its citizens, those adults who are working at full productive capacity whether in an office, a factory or a profession, that they should be enabled to get houses at a reasonable price and this should be ordained by the laws of the community. As a community we are not doing all that could be done at present because we are taking no action against these land speculators.  The press is full of denunciations of anti-social pickets and strikers.  Is nothing to be said, therefore, of these people, equally or, indeed, far more anti-social, who neither sow nor reap but who, by putting so much money into a certain parcel of land, which ultimately must be developed, can gather profits at the expense of the community?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1626" /> May we, as a community, continue to ignore the empty social activities of such individuals?  Could we suggest to our opponents that they should examine the activities of these fellow travellers&mdash;that is what they are; fellow travellers in a domain in which they can make very easy money indeed? Can we ignore their activities at present when they are having a very sunny time while we as a community have taken no action against them?  We have stood with our arms folded and seen them invest in land.  We are all aware of the type of price at present being charged in the Dublin city area for sites and land for development.  All of this must ultimately be paid for by the ordinary couple, or young families attempting to build a house, or it must be paid by the corporation.  We do not think this situation can be permitted to continue and we invite other Deputies here to speak their minds and to support this particular motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion and I support what Deputy O'Leary has just said.  I do not think people really appreciate what is happening with regard to building land at the present time.  We are always hearing people commenting on the high price of houses.  The price is going up day by day and very few stop to think that one of the factors in the increased cost of housing is, as Deputy O'Leary said, the cost of the site.  It is not alone in Dublin city and in the bigger towns that this is happening. Quite recently Meath County Council tried to buy a site in Dunboyne to build labourers' cottages.  The price they were asked was £2,000 per acre. It is quite a common occurrence in the country where labourers vested cottages are up for sale, with an acre of land, to find the cottages, originally built for about £70 and possibly in a very bad state of repair, sold for anything from £1,000 up to £2,000 because the speculator knows he can recover the cost and a good profit by simply demolishing the cottage and selling the site as building land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem was mentioned by the Minister quite some time ago but, since then, he has been very silent <Col N="1627" /> about it.  We believe the time has come when somebody must bring the whole matter out into the open.  That is the reason this motion is before the House tonight.  Not alone is the cost of building land going up, but these people&mdash;whether they are native or foreign matters not&mdash;are making a fantastic profit on land which they sometimes get by very dubious means. These same people are also buying up old houses in this city, knocking them down and converting the sites into building sites of various kinds and then selling those sites for about ten times what it would cost to repair the old houses or to build new premises. We found some of these people talking about social justice over the last couple of days.  I agree with Deputy O'Leary when he talks about the people who decry the social injustice that occurs in this country but, for some extraordinary reason, they always seem to be very careful about saying anything critical in regard to those who have plenty of money.  I suggest that, now that they are in a mood for social justice, they might start at the top on the people we are talking about in this motion.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that when the Town Planning Act was introduced a few years ago certain individuals seemed to find out&mdash;I do not know how, but presumably they had some way of doing it&mdash;what the likely development plans for certain areas would be.  Mark you, when you find these people buying up land which everybody seemed to think was of very little value and two or three years later, by some miracle, a sewerage and water scheme is run right along beside that land, one wonders was it Divine inspiration&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or was it somebody with a big mouth who spilled the beans and told these speculators something like this was about to happen.  Before ever Taca was formed we had these people, not alone here in Dublin, where they seemed to be quite well in on it, but all around the country, buying up land.  Indeed, it <Col N="1628" /> reached the stage at which some of us took a very active interest in small portions of land which might be for sale in an effort to find out what was likely to happen if some of these gentlemen appeared on the scene and started to bid for the land.  There is no reasonable reason at all why the State should allow this to continue.  Not alone are they allowing people to enrich themselves, as Deputy O'Leary said, immorally and illegally at the expense of the community but, at the same time, they are preventing people who are trying to help themselves by providing their own housing accommodation from doing so.  All are affected right along the line: the man who has just got married, the man married for a long time, living in bad housing conditions, and putting by a few pounds every week to purchase a site and build a house for himself, and the local authority which wants to build houses to meet the housing needs of its area, all are affected by these smart operators who seem to know everything.  When one examines what has happened it is a saddening experience to discover that, again and again, the one group appear on the scene.  Just as the vultures appear when the animal is near the point of death these smart guys appear when the goose is about to lay the golden egg.  They pick up all the golden eggs and they become &ldquo;big shots.&rdquo;  Perhaps, some of them become respectable people, the wealthy of the nation.  Then they start telling the world how the country should be run. Thank God, we have not sunk to the level of accepting all their advice yet. We have accepted some of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is just too bad that this sort of thing should be allowed to continue. Again, as Deputy O'Leary said, we do not claim in the Labour Party that somebody who owns a farm of land and who, because development has occurred in the area, is anxious to sell sites is not entitled to a fair price for such sites.  There is absolutely no question of our objecting to that.  But we object strenuously to somebody who appears on the scene, buys a site and disappears until water and sewerage are laid on, and then comes back and succeeds in getting any price asked. <Col N="1629" /> Maybe, as was pointed out to me before, these are good business people with good business heads.  I believe the same was said of people long ago who knew the stage coaches on which the wealthiest passengers were travelling; they were good business people. They knew where to be at the right time and they robbed just as certain people are robbing and others are being robbed at the present time.</P>

      <P>How many people have been left living in hovels throughout this country because of the machinations of these speculators?  Mark you, there are not many of them.  The group is very limited in number.  I suppose the news cannot be spread too widely because, if it were, they would no longer reap the dividends they do. The Minister for Local Government appreciated that this was happening and he made a statement which led everybody to believe that something was going to be done.  That is what <Col N="1630" /> makes the matter so doubly urgent now.  It is quite evident that, knowing that this was happening, the Minister gave out his story and said: &ldquo;We will do something.&rdquo;  While that might satisfy the newspaper people who look for scare headlines, it does not satisfy the ordinary people in town and country who are awaiting a chance to buy a house or a site at a reasonable cost. Something more must be done and, in this motion before the House, we are asking for something to be done.  There is no point in waiting for another six months.  If we wait much longer all the building land will have passed into the hands of this gang who will proceed to collect a rich dividend on it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> In dealing with these amendments, of which there are eight applicable to the eastern counties from Carlow-Kilkenny to Cavan-Monaghan, I mentioned my disappointment at the fact that the Minister had not seen fit to make any contribution on the amendments on this Stage of the Bill.  He probably found himself unable to offer any reasonable refutation of the amendments which deal with the counties of Cavan, Monaghan, Meath, Louth, Kildare, Carlow, Kilkenny and Wexford.  As I mentioned earlier, the amendments have been designed to secure the minimum transfer of population outside county boundaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that there are many alternative methods by which this could be done.  Perhaps there are methods superior to the one I suggest.  The only transfer of population involved here is the transfer of five district electoral divisions involving a population of 6,640 from Meath to Louth.  That is the sole transfer of population in the whole eastern section of the country.  If my <Col N="1631" /> suggestion were accepted by the Minister it would obviate the breaching of five counties which he has put in motion.  There would be no transfer from Meath to Cavan of 5,656 persons; no transfer from Meath to Monaghan of 6,426 persons.  It would not be necessary to transfer 5,041 persons from Kildare to Meath.  It would not be necessary to transfer 7,532 persons from Louth to Monaghan.  It would not be necessary to transfer 4,398 persons from Wexford to Carlow-Kilkenny. These transfers from five different areas, embracing a total population of 29,053, would be unnecessary and only one transfer need be made.  I should think that the transfer would be smaller.  From Meath to Louth it would be 6,640 persons.  That was the smallest transfer I could work out so as to leave reasonable constituencies.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of regret to me that the Minister has not seen fit to accept any amendment on those lines.  In the amendments, I have concerned myself entirely with local authority areas.  I have not dealt with the other gerrymandering efforts on the part of the Minister which undoubtedly have taken place.  Those are matters which, I suppose, should be properly dealt with by each individual Deputy in respect of his own area.  Deputy Collins mentioned that parishes and townslands were juggled in his area in County Cork.  The same type of juggling has been done in Mayo, Dublin and elsewhere. I am conscious that this type of exercise has been carried out in the multi-constituency counties but I have not dealt with that.  It is part of the general pattern of gerrymandering in which the Minister has indulged.</P>
    <P>This entire exercise along the eastern part of the country has been carried out for one purpose and one purpose only, that is, to secure the maximum advantage for the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is gerrymandering pure and simple and can be called by no other name, and no argument on the part of the Minister and no play with words will convince any objectivelyminded person that that is not the purpose of the exercise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1632" /> It is regrettable that politics should have come to this level.  I appreciate that, in the ordinary course of events, a political Party will try to preserve its own fortunes but, in this case, the Minister has leaned over backwards and done everything he possibly could to secure the maximum political advantage for his own Party, and he has thrown aside all considerations of justice and the rights of the ordinary people.  I believe this will boomerang. It is bound to boomerang.  I cannot understand what the Minister hopes to gain ultimately by this abuse of the power which the Irish people have given to his Party and to him.  In this exercise the Minister is prepared to cart nearly 30,000 in these eight counties in the eastern part of the country outside their counties and throw them into constituencies in other counties, an exercise which is completely unnecessary and which could be obviated by adopting amendments on the lines I have suggested.</P>
    <P>The Minister accused us of wasting time and of trying to prolong the debate unnecessarily.  In my opening remarks on these eight amendments I spent exactly half an hour.  I do not think I can be accused of wasting time as there was an amount of factual material to be covered.  The Minister spent six hours talking about nothing but the Budd judgment and repeating himself dozens of times.  It is not my purpose to waste the time of the House.  There is no conspiracy to stonewall so far as I am aware and I do not know what purpose would be served by it.  The Minister can have the Bill as soon as he wants it.  I have merely taken sufficient time to try to put across the ideas behind the eight amendments and that is all I have to say on the matter.</P>

      <P>This amendment merely suggests a transfer of some population from Galway into Clare with a view to giving sufficient population to Clare to preserve Clare as a four-seat constituency. The Minister, on the other hand, has proposed the formation of a new constituency which involves Clare-Galway or Galway-Clare.  It means part of Clare is to be transferred and joined up with Galway.  He proposes to transfer 14,765 people from North Clare into Galway to form a new constituency of Clare-Galway.  My proposal is the transfer of these five electoral divisions I have mentioned in the amendment to Clare so as to enable Clare to be treated, as heretofore, as a four-seat constituency.  I believe this is a better arrangement than the one suggested by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 relates to Donegal and the purpose of this amendment is to form a three-seater in North Donegal leaving sufficient population in South Donegal to form a three-seater without encroaching too much on the county of Leitrim.  The Minister has been too liberal in his transfer of population from Leitrim to Donegal.  As a consequence he has produced a rather awkward constituency.  I believe a smaller transfer of population from Leitrim would suffice and still leave two three-seat constituencies.  The transfer of population from Leitrim will be dealt with later when I come to deal with the amendment for South Donegal.  The rural districts of North Donegal which I have listed will give sufficient population to have a three-seat constituency within the terms of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>South Donegal embraces the administrative area of County Donegal except the parts mentioned in the previous amendment in respect of North Donegal, and also embraces certain district electoral divisions in the county of Leitrim, these divisions being <Col N="1637" /> Tullaghan, Gubacreeny, Kinlough, Aghavoghill, Aghanlish, Aghalateeve, Melvin, Glencar, Glenade, Ballaghameehan, Manorhamilton, Kiltyclogher, Glenfarn and Glenboy.  The position as regards these two amendments in respect of North Donegal and South Donegal is that Donegal needs extra population to provide either a six-seater or two three-seaters.  It needs 5,619 extra population, and Sligo-Leitrim can spare, at most, only 5,703 population and remain a four-seater.  I have suggested the transfer from North Leitrim to South Donegal of the population of these district electoral divisions mentioned in amendment No. 6, and that population will amount to 5,641.  That would increase the population of Donegal to 114,191 and leave sufficient population in Sligo-Leitrim to form a four-seater and in Donegal to form a six-seater.  Then Donegal could be divided into North and South with three seats each.  This means there would be less encroachments on North Leitrim than is envisaged in the Minister's Bill where he divides up Leitrim roughly into three parts.  There would be North Donegal and South Donegal and a much more limited transfer of population.  The final position would be: South Donegal with a population of 57,094 and North Donegal with a population of 57,097.  This would leave a good part of Leitrim intact to be dealt with later.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 deals with East Galway.  The suggested constituency of East Galway is:</P>
    <P>The administrative area of County Galway except the part comprised in Galway West and the District Electoral Divisions of Taghboy, Ahascragh, Ardamullivan, Gort, Beagh, Kilbeacanty and Ballycahalon.</P>
    <P>These are the areas around Gort.  It is proposed that Taghboy and Ahascragh be put in with Roscommon and that the other areas in the vicinity of Gort be added to Clare.  That has been mentioned in amendment No. 1.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 proposes that West Galway as a three-seater would comprise the rural districts of Clifden, <Col N="1638" /> Galway, Oughterard and Galway borough.  That would be slightly larger than the West Galway three-seater suggested by the Minister.  The Minister's suggested constituency would have a population of 58,481.  This administrative area would have a population of 62,605 and would have seven extra electoral divisions, namely, Aughrim, Belleville, Clarinbridge, Deerpark, Lackabeg, Liscananaun, Lisheenavalle on the eastern side of Galway added on, comprising a population of 4,124. This would give a balance in that you might regard Galway as the centre of the three-seat West-Galway constituency. These seven electoral divisions would be quite well placed on the eastern side of Galway and would, I submit, be not unreasonably joined up with Galway city in this constituency.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 proposes that the four-seater constituency of Longford-Westmeath shall comprise the administrative county of Longford and the administrative county of Westmeath. Deputies are familiar with the fact that the Minister has transferred population from the Athlone, West Urban Area, some 4,024, into the western complex.  In fact, he has added on considerably to Roscommon.  In the amendment which I have submitted here covering this western constituency this transfer of population from Longford to Westmeath is not necessary.  As I said, it consists of 4,024 persons who traditionally belonged to Westmeath. While the rural area is part of Roscommon, Athlone, West Urban, belongs to the town of Athlone in County Westmeath. It was transferred purely for political purposes; so I understand.  It could always be available if the western population were found to be down at some later stage.  If it was found in future years that the population of West Galway had gone down this extra population here could be used to bring up the population there.  This transfer of population is not necessary.  The constituency of Roscommon can be formed much more simply and without any breach of the constituency of Longford-Westmeath.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 17 deals with the administrative area of County Rossiderabl <Col N="1639" /> common and the District Electoral Divisions of Taghboy and Ahascragh in the administrative area of County Galway.  We are all familiar with the fact that Roscommon has been very badly butchered by the Minister.  He, on the one hand, has added on Athlone, West Urban, but he has also taken 1,975 from Roscommon and put them into this new hybrid creation of his own called Clare-Galway and he has also transferred 7,938 from Roscommon to East Galway.  This is bad enough but to make the thing more ridiculous he has added 11,072 from South Leitrim to Roscommon.  The Minister has completely butchered Roscommon as a county.  The new constituency which now emerges will be completely different and completely divorced from the administrative area of County Roscommon.  The transfer of population which I am now suggesting here is comparatively small.  It is merely the transfer of two small areas of Taghboy and Ahascragh to Roscommon which would leave it a three-seater constituency.</P>
    <P>Now, amendment No. 18, which is the last one of those various amendments dealing with the western counties, is an attempt to preserve, so far as one may, the political identity of Leitrim.  The Minister has practically wiped Leitrim off the political map.  In order to make some kind of peace offering to Leitrim sentiments he introduced a series of amendments whereby the people of different counties are given to Leitrim.  Those new areas are called Donegal-Leitrim Roscommon-Leitrim and Sligo-Leitrim. This is purely window dressing. The fact of the matter is that Leitrim has been roughly divided into three parts.  You will find a large part of it added into Donegal, the middle part of it thrown in with Sligo and the lower part of it thrown in with Roscommon.</P>
    <P>When dealing with the first set of amendments I made the point that if it is deemed necessary to transfer population from one area to another I believe one should aim to have the transfer of population as small as one can or to transfer a whole county or <Col N="1640" /> the greater part of it.  It is only by those two methods of transfer of population that you can preserve the political viability, if I may use that word, of a county.  When you transfer 10,000, 11,000, 12,000 or 13,000 it is a futile exercise.  A population of that amount is no bigger than an electoral area.  I mentioned earlier an illustration in regard to my own county of South Tipperary, to which was added portion of County Waterford with over 11,000 people.  That area is no more than a county council electoral area so far as population is concerned.  That is about the strength of it in comparison with the rest of the county.  It is only about one-sixth of the rest of the county and that county council area is seldom heard of or listened to.  It often happens that a Deputy who lives in that area is not known to the rest of the county at all.  They very seldom elect a Deputy in that area, be he Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil or Labour.  The chances of doing so are very poor.</P>
    <P>That is one of the reasons why I object to the Minister transferring such small areas of population.  The amount he is transferring is really too small. In special circumstances that may work but in average cases, unless it approaches the same population of the part to which it is added on, it tends to lose its political identity and its political viability.  That is what happens in any complex like this which is created and that is what the Minister has done too often all over the country. I have already given the townlands in Sligo-Leitrim which would be transferred to Donegal and I have given those district electoral divisions and they comprise a much smaller population than the Minister's transfer.  I think the Minister's figure is 8,997, whereas the figure I have suggested to him regarding the total population of North Leitrim that it seemed necessary to transfer would be 5,642, leaving two three-seaters in Donegal.  That is cutting it rather fine but it is sufficient and meets the requirements of the Constitution.  It is not necessary for the Minister to take the very liberal figure of 8,997 from North Leitrim and put them into Donegal; to take 10,532 from mid-Leitrim and put them into Sligo <Col N="1641" /> and to take 11,072 from South Leitrim and put them into Roscommon.</P>
    <P>Apart from doing an injustice to the people of Leitrim, it renders the constituency of South Donegal more awkward on account of the geographical factors because these people would have to go down into Leitrim.  By transferring the relatively small population of 5,000 people instead of his approximate 9,000, the Minister could leave intact about 25,000 people in Leitrim.  This reasonable bulk of population would make its presence felt politically and it is a far more suitable method of dealing with the situation than by dividing Leitrim into three parts which virtually wipes the county off the political map.</P>
    <P>It will be poor consolation to the people of Leitrim to know that when an election is in progress the name of Leitrim will still appear on the ballot paper because it will be increasingly difficult for them to have a Leitrim man representing them in Dáil Éireann. It is very clear that the purpose of the exercise is to secure that Leitrim, which is one of the counties that has misbehaved&mdash;it is a bold county&mdash;will be wiped off the map.  These people are to be put into Donegal where there are very good people and also into Galway because these two latter counties have largely supported the Government Party; undoubtedly, East Galway has misbehaved in recent times and they may be punished a little but this transfer of population which the Minister has embarked on is completely unnecessary.</P>
    <P>For all of the western seaboard counties &mdash; Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Clare and Galway, the Minister has made a total transfer of population of 59,274.  The figure of 9,399 which I have suggested in my amendments would give him reasonable three and four seat constituencies and he would have the same number of Deputies elected along the western coast from Donegal to Clare.  This would entail a transfer of no more than 9,000 persons or over as against the Minister's figure of 60,000 odd. This is a tremendous difference.  The method proposed by the Minister will entail the breaching of 14 constituency <Col N="1642" /> boundaries while the amendments I have proposed would mean the breaching of only seven constituency boundaries.</P>
    <P>There are other methods by which this could be done but I am merely dealing with those which I have put down in my amendments.  I have not dealt at all with Mayo which has been re-adjusted but as regards those counties I have mentioned a much more equitable job could be done if the Minister were prepared to do it but, obviously, he has proposed these adjustments purely and entirely for the purpose of securing as much electoral advantage for his Party as the Constitution will permit.</P>
    <P>The proposals I have made in my amendments are much more reasonable and would leave most of the traditional counties as they were.  It would leave Leitrim more or less intact.  I admit there is a problem here.  If my amendments were adopted, it would mean a better type of constituency in Donegal North and South.  It would give a more balanced constituency in West Galway. It would leave the county of Clare&mdash;a county from which we have never got much support &mdash; a traditional county. The people of Clare have their pride and their emotional associations; they have their own local authority control and I believe that such a county should be left intact instead of creating this constituency of Clare-South Galway or whatever the Minister calls it.  Under the Minister's proposal a third of Clare is taken and put in with some area in Galway drawn up entirely by the Minister on the political advice of the Fianna Fáil Party in that part of the county.  It contravenes the rights of the local people.</P>
    <P>It is strange that since the foundation of the State we have been able to survive with most of these counties like Clare as four-seaters, but now when I suggest that a small transfer of population from Galway, which would still leave Galway as a three-seater and four-seater&mdash;a small population transfer would rectify that&mdash;and still leave Clare as a four-seater, the Minister rejects any suggestions on these lines. It is obvious that the Minister is only concerned with dividing the country in such a way as to secure as many Dáil <Col N="1643" /> seats for his Party as he can secure by way of any gerrymandering method available to him.</P>

      <P>A LeasCheann Comhairle, I should like to say a few words about amendment No. 3 which deals with the Clare constituency. Deputy Hogan has given as his reason for this amendment, which is to transfer part of the area around Gort into Clare, his anxiety to preserve Clare as a four-seater.  We would all like it if this could be the case, but the people of Clare realise that because of the result of the referendum they would have to revert to a three-seat constituency. This was explained to them during the recent campaign.  The Minister has proposed to put a large area of North-East Clare into this new constituency known as Clare-South Galway. It is estimated there are more than 9,000 voters in this part of Clare going into Clare-South Galway.  This surely will ensure that a Clare man will be elected in this constituency.</P>

      <P>I contend that, instead of having three Clare men in the next Dáil, we will have four Clare men representing Clare.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hogan seems very familiar with what Senator McHugh was saying since the referendum.  He even called a meeting of the Clare County Council to express his ideas.  Senator McHugh has been saying that part of East Limerick should be transferred into Clare to preserve it with four seats.  It seems to me only fair to say that he is at variance with his colleague, Deputy Hogan.  They should get together and decide which is the proper cure for the Clare constituency.</P>

      <P>I am glad some of the people on the Government benches decided to interest themselves in this debate.  I would like to congratulate Deputy Barrett.  With regard to the line Deputy Hogan adopts and the line</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1644" /> Senator McHugh adopts outside, I can only accept it one way.  One day we hear the Taoiseach talking one way and the following day we hear the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Blaney, talking another way.  If they are allowed to do that, I cannot see any reason why Deputy Hogan and Senator McHugh should speak with one voice.</P>
    <P>I will confine my few brief remarks to amendments Nos. 6, 17 and 18. They involve three counties which I know very well, Roscommon, Leitrim and Sligo.  Since 1961 I have represented the constituency of Roscommon in this House.  For years prior to that my mother represented Sligo-Leitrim and at one stage she represented Leitrim on its own.  Prior to that my late father represented Sligo-Leitrim.  These are three counties of which I have a fair knowledge.  As Deputy Hogan has said, these counties have committed a mortal sin in the eyes of the Government, the sin being that they are counties in which, for a number of years past, the trend of the electorate has been away from the Government Party.  For that reason the present Minister for Local Government has decided to gerrymander them.  He has divided Leitrim into three, putting a portion into Donegal, a portion into Sligo and a portion into Roscommon.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have tremendous trouble in convincing the people of any of these three counties that his intention is anything other than gerrymandering. The motive behind it is to move the electorate into Donegal, which is favourable to the Government Party.  If not able to get them into Donegal, he intends to get them into Galway, which again is favourable to the Government Party.  He will do anything but leave them as a unit, or a near-unit, because, if he did that, the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party know that they would probably lose even more seats in the next general election than they lost in the last general election.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons given by the Minister for what he has done.  He tells us it is due to the result of the referendum.  During that referendum campaign he told us on numerous <Col N="1645" /> occasions that if the single seat constituency with the straight vote were accepted it would mean there would be no more than two or three Parties contesting elections and that the whole thing would be much easier for the electorate to understand.  Maybe he might be able to tell us now how that worked out in the general election held on Monday last in Northern Ireland. They have the straight vote there, but there were 13 Parties contesting that election.  It just shows how ridiculous the statements made during the referendum campaign were.</P>
    <P>Another reason given for the revision of these constituencies is that it is due to the drop in population.  The Government cannot shut their eyes. Even today we had the Taoiseach answering a question and saying that the population in the west of Ireland was not dropping.  If the Ceann Comhairle will bear with me for a few minutes, I will deal with the figures for these three counties.  In 1926 the population of Roscommon was 83,566. At the last available Census in 1966 the population was 56,228, a drop of population was 56,228, a drop of 27,338 people.  Approximately 700 people per year were leaving the county.  The Minister may convince himself they were going to the graveyard but the big percentage of these people were emigrating and finding work for themselves in Birmingham, Manchester, and many other English cities.  The population of Leitrim in 1926 was 55,907.  In 1966, the last available Census, it had dropped to 30,572. There was a total drop of 25,335 people, or, again, 652 people left that county every year since 1926.</P>
    <P>Sligo, also, has suffered very heavily. In 1926, its population was 71,388.  In 1966 it had dropped to 51,263, a total decrease in a period of 40 years of 20,125 persons.  In other words, approximately 500 persons per year left that county.  Again, that may be the other reason why these constituencies have to be revised but most blame can be laid on the shoulders of the Government because they have not done anything to stem the flow of emigration from the west of Ireland. They make up their minds, and then they change them and say these are <Col N="1646" /> not viable units&mdash;that they are this and that.</P>
    <P>They are the counties who have been voting strongly against the Government Party and I should like to say, honestly and sincerely, whether the Minister for Local Government likes it or not, that there will be two Fine Gael Deputies returned for Leitrim, no matter how they try to gerrymander the area, because from Leitrim they had no Deputy in the House and they had no Member of the Seanad for the area until after the death of the late Miss Pearse: she was not cold in her grave when they appointed Senator McElgunn, preparing him to contest the next general election.  However, I can tell the Minister it has been a pure waste of time.</P>
    <P>We know the motive behind all this. They added a number of electoral divisions to South Donegal from the northern part of Leitrim.  The amendment suggests that these areas be substituted by the following: Tullaghan, Gubacreeny, Kinlough, Aghavoghill, Aghanlish, Aghalateeve, Melvin, Glencar, Glenade, Ballaghameehan, Manorhamilton, Kiltyclogher, Glenfarm and Glenboy.  That would mean that only 5,431 people would be moved from Leitrim to South Donegal to give it a three-seat constituency, but the Minister when he was making the change, decided to move 8,997 people, 3,656 more than were necessary.  Anybody who looks at this honestly and sincerely will see why the Minister has decided to move these people: he wants them in County Donegal, a county which has been inclined to support the Government.  However, when one looks at the result of the recent referendum, I do not think the Government can be too happy about this plan.</P>
    <P>Now I come to Roscommon.  Leitrim has been badly enough done by, but Roscommon is not much better. Roscommon has returned two Fianna Fáil Deputies, one no less than the Minister for Education and the other, Dr. Gibbons.  I do not know how either could agree with this gerrymander.  The Minister has decided to move 1,075 people out of Roscommon into Clare and 7,938 people to North East Galway.  They have taken 11,072 from South Leitrim to add to Roscommon <Col N="1647" /> and approximately 3,000 from the Athlone area.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how these two Deputies, sitting on the Government benches, can agree to the butchering of their own county to that extent.  Portion of it has gone to Clare, portion to North East Galway and a further bit of Longford-Westmeath has been added.  The motive behind this is quite obvious.  The portion which the Government have decided to move to North East Galway is fairly convenient to Castlerea and Fianna Fáil have two budding prospective candidates for the next general election who will contest the Roscommon constituency.  One of them has told me about it and I am prepared to accept his word for it. However, the Minister for Education decided that he would not have him in his constituency&mdash;he could be a danger to him&mdash;and in order to secure himself, the Minister decided to move that portion of the county into Galway to protect his own seat.  Any Minister or Deputy who is prepared to allow his native county to be butchered to that extent in order to secure his seat in this House is not acting in the best political tradition and I am surprised that it should have happened in this case.</P>
    <P>We come, of course, to Sligo-Leitrim. It would have been easy to make this a four-seat constituency.  It would have been the normal trend and if the Minister were prepared to accept these amendments we should have Sligo-Leitrim a four-seat constituency involving the movement of only 5,341 people into Donegal.  We should then have an administrative county of Roscommon with the addi-tion of two electoral divisions from County Galway, Taghboy and Ahascragh and we should have a unit which would leave Roscommon with three seats and the county virtually intact. If the amendment in this connection were accepted, instead of the Minister's proposal we should have had to move only 5,000 people out of Leitrim instead of the 8,000 which he proposes. For those reasons the Minister should accept those amendments.</P>
    <P>I conclude on the suggestion that the Minister's motive behind this <Col N="1648" /> gerrymandering revision of constituencies is to remove people from antiFianna Fáil areas into Fianna Fáil areas in order that Fianna Fáil may secure an odd extra seat here and there so that they can be returned to Government.  However, when the Minister interferes in this way with the rights of people, he is treading on dangerous ground and I have no doubt that as soon as the people get the opportunity the Minister will be given his answer.</P>

      <P>I wish to say a few words on these amendments. The last occasion on which I spoke on this matter I said we had come to the stage when we had only 25 counties left.  The Minister decided that we would need Sligo carrying the name of the Sligo constituency, with 11,000 people being brought in from Leitrim.  He decided that he would leave Roscommon constituency with a further 11,000 people being put in from Leitrim; and that he would put 8,900 voters from Leitrim into South Donegal.</P>
      <P>It would appear that the Minister felt rather embarrassed at all those people coming to meet him.  He paid a visit to Carrick-on-Shannon and gave them the concession of having the name of Leitrim added to three constituencies to make them Donegal-Leitrim, Sligo-Leitrim and RoscommonLeitrim. I can tell the Minister for Local Government that the Fianna Fáil people boasted of the concession that he granted them on his visit to Carrick-on-Shannon. Many people thought it amounted to a great change and said to some Deputies that there was a big change being made in the constituency. The Minister granted merely a name simply because if Leitrim were not mentioned there would be only 25 counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must compliment Deputy Hogan on the research he has done in order to produce the figures that he has given us and to be in a position to inform us that the constituencies could have been arranged by the transfer of 9,399 voters instead of 60,000 voters.  That would have resulted in very few changes in the constituencies.  Instead <Col N="1649" /> of 9,399, as suggested by Deputy Hogan, groups of 9,000, 10,000, 11,000 and up to 12,000 of the population are being transferred from one constituency to another.</P>
    <P>In the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, in the gerrymandering that is being done on the Leitrim side, townlands and parishes are divided and the location of polling booths is altered with the result that the county council has to revise the whole machinery for elections on the basis of the new boundaries determined by the Minister.</P>
    <P>All this is being done, as the people all know, because in those areas the people did not yield to the pressure being put on them by Fianna Fáil. All down the years Fianna Fáil have been most anxious to get the people to do what they wanted them to do and held out every inducement possible in order to sway the electorate.  The people of Sligo-Leitrim in every general election, in local elections, in the referenda, gave their decision against the Government and for that reason the Minister saw fit to divide the people and to create splinter groups so that, with three-seater constituencies, his Party would stand a better chance.</P>
    <P>On 1st October, 1968, the people of this country decided by an overwhelming majority of 260,000 voters for the retention of PR.  That was a clear indication to the Minister that the PR system of election would remain.  The Minister realised that the only hope for survival of a Fianna Fáil Government under the PR system of election was to have three-seater constituencies.  The Minister will discover in the next election that the people will not bow to the gerrymandering that is taking place in the revision of the constituencies.  The population of Leitrim in 1966 was 30,500, which represents a drop of over 25,335 since 1926.  The population of Sligo in 1966 was 51,262 as compared with 71,388 in 1926.  The Minister may tell us that this revision of constituencies had to take place.  He should remember that it is necessitated by the fact that the west of Ireland has been sorely neglected.  The flight from the land that is taking place in the west of Ireland even today is deplorable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the best for the Party, not the best for the country. If the Minister were sincere he could easily have left Sligo-Leitrim a four-seater constituency.  Since I was a schoolboy Sligo-Leitrim has been known as one constituency and it was taken for granted that that would continue to be the position.  In his final revision the Minister has divided the constituency in three parts.  As Deputy Hogan has pointed out, the Minister could have added 5,345 people to South Donegal and have left Sligo-Leitrim as a four-seater and have Donegal a six-seater.  There would not be anything very wrong about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hogan has indicated how easily Roscommon could be fixed. Instead, the Minister and his advisers decided on taking away all of North Leitrim&mdash;four centres that were the main centres in the county plus the rural areas Kinlough, Kiltyclogher, Manorhamilton and Dromahair in the centre of a rural area and that part of North Leitrim that stretches almost into the <Col N="1651" /> village of Drumkerrin, quite convenient to the village of Ballintubber, wiping out all North Leitrim except for a few polling booths stretching to Drumkerrin.</P>
    <P>That is the position and nobody can take any meaning from it than that it was designed to improve the lot of Fianna Fáil candidates and in the hope that it would get rid of the Fine Gael candidates in the next general election.  There was an all-out effort made in the last general election to do that and I expect that there will be a similar effort made at the next election but I think that when the results of the next election are announced the Minister will discover that the people did not yield to his wishes.  The people will decide for themselves that they are not going to accept the administration which is forcing the people from the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim.  How important it would have been for that constituency if the same amount of money had been spent providing employment there instead of telling the people what they were going to do with the single-seat constituency, how they wanted a TD to be convenient to his constituents and how everything would work much more satisfactorily if we would only accept Fianna Fáil's advice. That did not succeed and now 80 miles or 100 miles is a common enough distance to be removed from your Deputy. However, I expect that after the next election all that will be changed.  I hope that the Minister will consider this before it is too late and give the people an opportunity of having their representatives where they wish to have them and of having a more compact constituency than having Sligo-Leitrim stretching from Newtowngore at the Cavan border down almost to Bundoran in Donegal and from that across to Enniscrone, a journey of about 100 miles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McLaughlin was worrying about the distance from Newtowngore in Cavan to Bundoran and Enniscrone but this amendment would shove him nearly into Longford. Anybody with a knowledge of past history knows that we were doing very nicely&mdash;all political Parties&mdash;with <Col N="1652" /> our interpretation of the Constitution until Fine Gael decided that what was done in 1960 was not constitutional and they obtained a new interpretation of tolerance for us.  Again, only a few months ago they rejected tolerance and the one-seat constituency.  Of course, looking at the three counties in question, Roscommon, Sligo and Leitrim, and having regard to tolerance and the ambiguity about it&mdash;whether it is going to be 1,000 below or as near enough as possible to a national average&mdash;the Minister has one responsibility and that is to ensure that what he is doing should at least be constitutional and that when this Bill has passed through the Dáil and Seanad it will not be brought before the High Court as being unconstitutional.  The Minister has endeavoured to come as near as possible to 20,000 population per Deputy. This is what the Constitution requires. Leitrim has a population of just over 30,000 or a representation of one Deputy and half a Deputy.  Sligo has 51,000, or about 2½ Deputies, and Roscommon has 56,000, plus some hundreds. Is it more wrong to transfer a bit of Roscommon into Galway than to do the reverse and transfer a bit of Galway into Roscommon?  Is it wrong to have Roscommon-Leitrim as a constituency rather than to have Sligo-Leitrim?</P>
      <P>I, too, remember that it used be Sligo-Leitrim and it continued to be that until the 1961 election.  The breaking up of Leitrim arose entirely from an action by a member of the Fine Gael Party in having that formula for a constituency declared unconstitutional in the High Court.  We can make many variations and in the long run one is as good as another.  One detests the idea of any county being broken up into divisions.  One never likes that because we all look upon the county as an administrative area and we would like to see it kept that way.  However, because of two actions, one being the rejection by the people of the referendum&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I said, it is sad that any county must be broken up, but at least there is an effort here to solve the problem of Deputy McLaughlin.  At least the distance to travel has been reduced somewhat. With the present layout of Sligo-Leitrim from Newtowngore to Enniscrone or from Bundoran to Newtowngore, whichever way you like it, this amendment would bring one right up to the Longford border which is far more distant.  I have nothing to add except to say that I think that dividing the western region of Donegal and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1654" /> Clare with Connacht into a ten-seater is at least a step towards more workable constituencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment Deputy Hogan on his homework.  He has done a good job and, as far as it affects my constituency, I say he is perfectly right and that his proposal could be applied.  I refer to the constituency bordering the Clare-Galway area where we have Liscananaun, Lisheenavalla and Lackabeg adjoining.  Further south you have Clarinbridge, Belleville East and Aughrim East also.  Figures for these areas total 4,124 and I think the proposal is quite acceptable.  I say that because Galway city is, and has been for years, the focal point for the people of this area.  I was in the High Court at the time of this case and there was a gentleman with a wig who tried to walk me into a corner but I brought him in along with me.  That finished it. I was able to point out that I could accept this area as representative, even though it was outside the actual constituency at that time.  I was able to take evidence out of my pocket that 50 per cent of the people I was dealing with were coming from these adjoining areas.  It is quite easy for these people to get to Galway city, much easier than it is to go to Tuam, Loughrea or Ballinasloe.  There are main roads leading to Galway city from these areas that I have mentioned.  People can travel in by bus and get home by bus in the evening, having got their business done with either myself or the Fianna Fáil representative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the experience I have for the past 15 years I could go into these areas and I might &ldquo;shake&rdquo; the Minister if they were added on.  I suppose the Minister knew that.  I &ldquo;shook&rdquo; Fianna Fáil in areas that he thought previously were 80 per cent Fianna Fáil.  Overnight, when I went up, they became 85 per cent Fine Gael.  Perhaps that is one reason why the Minister is not prepared to allow in these areas. Thank God, the Minister is not a Land Commissioner because he would have the country tied up in knots if he was to approach his job in this &ldquo;Find-the-Lady&rdquo; card trick fashion he is using in the division of <Col N="1655" /> constituencies.  I wonder, on the day of an All-Ireland final, how some of these people would cheer, whether it would be for East Galway or Roscommon? I know it does not arise on this Bill but it can arise: there is such a thing as pride in one's county.  The Minister is not taking that into consideration.</P>
    <P>The whole Bill is an indictment of the Government for the state of the West.  It is a sort of cover-up.  It is something for which, like Tom Dooley, the Minister should bow his head in shame.  All we got from this House over the past year was talk about saving the West.  That is how they are going to save it now.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the areas of Claregalway.  I may confuse some people.  Claregalway is a parish in west Galway.  There is a Clare-Galway &mdash;I think it is Clare-South Galway the Minister mentioned&mdash;which is quite a different thing, a combination of both Clare and Galway.  Claregalway adjoins these areas in my constituency, and if the Minister likes to ask any questions on it, I shall bring him to the church gate next Sunday where I often held good meetings.  I would also be prepared to bring him down to Gort and the area of Kilbeacanty, Skehanagh Beagh Hill and around that country.  It might be no harm that Gort should be brought in there.  It might cultivate them since the hero in the Park, with respect to the Park and the seat that is there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Thank God, I shared this House with one of the best representatives Clare ever produced, the late Deputy Bill Murphy&mdash;Go ndéana Dia trocaire ar a anam.  I knew much of the problems of Clare through the late Deputy Murphy and I know much of the <Col N="1656" /> problems of South Galway.  I did a share of courting down there.  It might be a blessing if this Bill goes through. It might get these people from the wild parts of Clare which I canvassed into an area where there is some culture. We might let them know what a representative from Claregalway could do.  I hope I have not confused the parish with the constituency.</P>
      <P>I see no reason why Deputy Hogan's amendment cannot be accepted.  Instead of messing up borders, whether this refers to the area across the Border where Ministers are telling people how to vote or messing things up down here, the sooner Fianna Fáil throw in the towel and let them vote for themselves, the better.  I do not think anybody has done as much work on this as Deputy Hogan.  The Minister had the help of his Department and his personal sweat was not involved. Therefore, I compliment my colleague on his homework.</P>

      <P>These amendments comply with the provisions of the Constitution and come as near as it is possible to come to the figure of 20,000 per seat.  They are, as I said earlier, fair, just and reasonable.  They are a much better alternative than the provisions in the Minister's Bill.  The Minister envisages interfering with 14 pieces of nine counties and over 100,000 people.  These people will find themselves in constituencies with which they have never had any connection.  Deputy Hogan suggests interfering with only six pieces involving 21,199 people, barely one per cent of the total population. The Minister is not prepared to accept these reasonable proposals. He will not accept for one reason, and one reason only; the Fianna Fáil Party know that their support is dwindling and they are trying to hang on to the bitter end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt but that this Bill gerrymanders constituencies.  If we accept Deputy Hogan's amendments for the western areas only 9,399 people would be interfered with and each constituency would come within the provisions of the Constitution and Mr. Justice Budd's interpretation. The Minister, however, envisages disturbing 59,274 people, <Col N="1657" /> almost six times the number in Deputy Hogan's proposals.  There must be some very good reason why the Minister will not accept these amendments. The Minister is silent though we know from past experience here that he can speak for seven hours, six hours, six and a half hours in Seanad Éireann, and five hours on another occasion here.  Now he is mute of malice.  What has come over him?  Because these amendments are fair, just and reasonable he is not able to make a case against accepting them.  It is a pity the Taoiseach did not silence another Minister before last Sunday.</P>

      <P>We know there was gerrymandering in the past in the North and we know there is gerrymandering in this Bill, gerrymandering as good, if not better.  Even the Unionists could learn a lesson from it. The West will lost four Deputies.  These four Deputies will come to the eastern seaboard.  The West generally is dying because of Government policy, or lack of policy over the last 20 years.  Fianna Fáil are responsible for the decrease in the population of the West because over the past 30 years they have encouraged all the wealth to come to Dublin at the expense of the western seaboard.  When Deputy Gallagher says the West is losing Deputies because of</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1658" /> Mr. Justice Budd's judgment it is only right to place on the records of the House the fact that the responsibility for this loss rests on the shoulders of the Fianna Fáil Government.  That Government has driven out of Connacht and Donegal no fewer than 194,957 people since they came to power.  The boys and girls born since Fianna Fáil came to power numbered about 600,000; they, too, have been driven from the western seaboard because of the dead hand of the present Government.  If that population were still in the West it is the West which would be getting extra Deputies.  We were promised that, if we got rid of the British yoke, this country, instead of supporting 3,000,000 people would be supporting 10,000,000 people.  I remember a particular gentleman, our present President&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If there were the same number of people in the West now as there were in 1932 when Fianna Fáil came to power the West would be entitled to ten extra Deputies.  That is something that should be put on the records of the House.  Lovely Leitrim will now disappear from the map as a political entity.  We know Leitrim never supported Fianna Fáil.  Leitrim always elected a majority of Fine Gael Deputies.  The Taoiseach went down to Leitrim before the referendum and warned the people that, if they did not vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, Leitrim would be wiped off the map.  The people refused to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  The people rejected the referendum by 234,000 votes.  The Minister for Local Government told us the referendum would be won by 100,000 votes.  What is happening now to the county in which Seán Mac Diarmada was born?  Remember, the people of Leitrim are proud.  They love their native soil.  They withstood the ravages of Lord Leitrim and the evictions of that time, but what he failed to do, Fianna Fáil have done in a very short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 refers to Clare-South Galway.  In the past Galway had eight Deputies, and it is now proposed <Col N="1659" /> to give it nine.  Other parts are added on to Galway because Galway always remained faithful to Fianna Fáil. Instead of losing one Deputy, Galway is getting parts of Roscommon and Clare, and will now be three three-seater constituencies.  Fianna Fáil are hoping they will be able to win two out of three.  This will boomerang on them as the referendum boomeranged on them.</P>
    <P>Let us take Mayo.  In the past we had there a four-seater and a three-seater constituency.  In the four-seater there were two Fianna Fáil and two Fine Gael Deputies, and in the three-seater there were two Fine Gael Deputies and one Fianna Fáil Deputy. Because it is a Fine Gael constituency Mayo has to suffer.  In the past a horizontal line was drawn across it, but now it is a vertical line.  The Minister for Justice and the Minister for Health have to be separated.  These constituencies have also to suffer and we see the bloody vindictiveness again because the people there rejected the Third and Fourth Amendments of the Constitution Bills.</P>
    <P>Roscommon is being butchered and mutilated in a vicious fashion.  At present there are two Fine Gael Deputies there, Deputy Joan Burke and Deputy P.J. Reynolds.  They are excellent Deputies.  The Government have taken as much of Leitrim as they possibly could from Deputy Reynolds, and to the good area surrounding Deputy Burke's home place they have added 4,000 votes.  For the past 40 years Athlone has not been butchered or dismembered.  It has always been kept together but because the great promiser, the Minister for Education, comes from Athlone 4,000 voters are being transferred from Athlone into Roscommon to bolster up his waning fortunes.</P>
    <P>The Reynolds family have represented Leitrim very well since the foundation of the State.  The late Deputy Burke and his widow, Deputy Joan Burke, gave Roscommon excellent representation.  Those two Deputies are proud to be the servants of the people of Roscommon and Leitrim. No matter how the Minister may gerrymander or use the knife on those constituencies, the people of Roscommon <Col N="1660" /> and Leitrim, who love justice and fair play, will see that this vindictive effort by the Government to put these two Deputies, or at least one of them, out of Leinster House will misfire. When the election comes, and come when it may, both those Deputies will be returned to Leinster House.</P>
    <P>The Minister deserves 100 per cent marks for clever work, work well done by an avaricious political Party bent on riveting themselves in power.  They are now flying in the face of the people because the people spoke out loudly and clearly on 16th October and, by a massive figure of 234,000, defeated the Government's proposal despite the fact that money and Taca and everything that could be assembled was used to terrorise the people and try to sway them.  The Government failed and today they stand condemned and discredited. They are trying to hold on to the reins of office and, therefore, we have this Bill to gerrymander the constituencies to try to get the maximum number of seats with the minimum number of votes.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I wonder does the House fully appreciate the performance of the Minister for Local Government on this measure. We had a long discussion here on Second Stage but, of necessity, it had to be a very general discussion.  On Committee Stage we went into the Schedule constituency by constituency. We tried to get from the Minister his reasons for drafting the constituencies as he had done.  It then transpired and was very clear that the Minister could not justify the scheme of constituencies which he proposed for the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the conclusion of the Committee Stage we made it perfectly clear that it was necessary for us to put down amendments on Report Stage and the Minister endeavoured to prevent Report Stage being taken, or wished to have it taken on such a date that it would be impossible for this Party to put down amendments.  We had the disgraceful performance at the conclusion of Committee Stage of the Minister doing his damnedest to prevent Report Stage.  It should go on the record that it was only under pressure from the Minister for Finance, and <Col N="1661" /> presumably the Taoiseach, that the Minister yielded and accorded the House the customary courtesy of giving a reasonable time between Committee Stage and Report Stage.  We had the unprecedented performance of having a debate lasting a couple of hours on a date for Report Stage and it was only when it was apparent to the Minister that this Party would not be deprived of their rights that the Minister, under pressure from his more sophisticated colleague, the Minister for Finance, yielded and agreed to have Report Stage taken to another date.</P>
    <P>In accordance with our intentions and the requirements of the Bill we put down 21 amendments on Report Stage to try to force the Minister to amend this measure as it should be amended and to improve it as it should be improved.  We are now dealing with a number of amendments.  What do we find?  We find Deputy Hogan putting forward, on behalf of this Party, a reasoned case substantiating and justifying these amendments.  When the Minister for Local Government is beaten in his efforts to deprive us of the opportunity of putting down amendments, he sulks and leaves this House, runs out of this House, refuses to listen to the arguments, refuses to refute the arguments and behaves like a spoiled child.</P>

It is his duty to come in here and to listen to these reasoned arguments put down by a responsible Deputy, after much thought and consideration without the assistance of civil servants or anybody else. <Col N="1662" /> The Minister for Local Government cannot get out of it by saying that he dealt with all this on the Committee Stage because this is the first time and today is the first day that these amendments ever came into this House.  On the Committee Stage, he challenged us to put down amendments when, on that Stage, we were simply and solely trying to find out what the Minister was at and whether he had an answer for his ridiculous scheme.  He now refuses to listen to these amendments, refuses to give his reason for marching his troops through the Lobby in opposition to them.  I say that that is an insult to democracy.  It is an insult to Parliament. It is an insult which would make even certain people in other countries blush.</P>
      <P>Let us look back at these amendments in a particular way&mdash;the amendments we are dealing with&mdash;and see what the Minister for Local Government has refused to come in here and listen to.  Amendment No. 3 which stands in the name of Deputy Hogan of South Tipperary proposes to restore Clare to a four-seater constituency.  Is there anything wrong with that?  Is that an unreasonable proposition?  I say it is not.  I say that the only reason the Minister for Local Government will march his troops through the &ldquo;Tá&rdquo; Lobby, in opposition to this amendment, is because he wants to reduce Clare to a three-seater constituency for selfish political purposes, namely, in order to deprive the Labour Party of a seat there, a seat that they have held for many years.  Why does the Minister not come in here and justify his opposition to this amendment?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The next amendment deals with Donegal. Deputy Hogan has provided, by taking a small portion from Leitrim, two three-seaters in Donegal, although, indeed, we might have put down an amendment to give Donegal five&mdash;that is all that Government policy, over the years, has decreed that Donegal is entitled to.  However, Deputy Hogan <Col N="1663" /> is prepared to give the Minister a bonus and, instead of taking a seat from Donegal, proposes to give them two three-seaters.  However, the Minister is not here to say what is wrong with that.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos 7 and 8, dealing with Galway, propose to divide it into two constituencies and to give it a four-seater and a three-seater.  At the moment, County Galway has eight Deputies.  The population of Galway has dropped from 168,198 in 1936 to 148, 340 in 1966.  In other words, in spite of the fact that it has lost 19,858 in population, the Minister has decided to increase the representation in Galway county from eight to nine.  I think that if seats are to be lost and if, because there is a drop in population, certain seats must go from certain areas, it is only reasonable that the county which has lost the population and has lost the right to the seat should suffer the loss of that seat.  But that is not what we are having here. We are having this political manoeuvre in Galway of dividing a county into three three-seaters, thereby giving it a bonus of one seat, instead of reducing it by one.  I say that that is political trickery.  I say that the proposition put forward by Deputy Hogan to divide the county into a three-seater and a four-seater is a more reasonable, more rational and more equitable representation for the county.  Again, I ask why the Minister for Local Government is not here to let us have his views on the amendment as drafted. The reason is that he has no answer and, of course, when he could not silence us on the Committee Stage he has refused to listen to us on the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So much has been said about SligoLeitrim that it is not necessary to say a lot more.  In this debate, it has clearly been pointed out that it is not necessary to mutilate Leitrim and to divide it up into three sections, giving one section to Donegal, one section to Sligo and one section to Roscommon. It has been stated here that a much more rational constituency is Sligo-Leitrim. I wish to repeat that.  County Leitrim is entitled to permanence on the map of Ireland for a number of <Col N="1664" /> reasons.  I have said here before that the philosophy of Sinn Féin was first known throughout the length and breadth of this country as a result of an action taken in Leitrim as far back as 1907.  Sinn Féin was founded in 1905.  Very little was known about the Party or the philosophy behind it until 1907 when Charlie Dolan, who represented North Leitrim at West-minster&mdash;he was then in his early twenties&mdash;as a member of the Irish Parliamentary Party in the House of Commons, contested North Leitrim as a Sinn Féin candidate.  That was the first time that Sinn Féin really got under way, that Sinn Féin got off the ground.  He did not get elected there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> With the greatest respect, Sir&mdash;and I will bow to your ruling if you rule after what I have said that I am out of order&mdash;I am trying to establish the right of this ancient county of Leitrim to retain its identity and I will not be very long doing it.</P>
      <P>It was only as a result of Charlie Dolan's resignation from the British House of Commons and his contesting North Leitrim as a Sinn Féin candidate that, in those days of bad communications, Sinn Féin became known throughout the length and breadth of this country.  As I said, he did not get elected but he got about one-third of the votes that were cast for his opponent, a member of the Irish Parliamentary Party who won the seat. But, as from then, Sinn Féin was established not alone in Leitrim but throughout the length and breadth of Ireland.</P>
      <P>As Deputy L'Estrange has said, Seán MacDermott was born and reared and spent a lot of his life in County Leitrim.  Indeed, a much more fitting tribute to Seán McDermott than calling Aras Mhic Dhiarmada after him, would be to maintain the identity of his native Leitrim, the county which he served so well and which he loved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to go on record as saying that if ever a case could be made for preserving the unbroken boundaries of a <Col N="1665" /> county that case can be made for Leitrim and if ever a county should be left to enjoy its own identity that county is Leitrim.</P>
    <P>Deputies McLaughlin and Reynolds have said what does not need saying: Sligo and Leitrim are like love and marriage, you cannot have one without the other.  They have been coupled together down the years and when you speak of Sligo you immediately think of Leitrim, because they have been a unit for as long as most of us can remember. They have a joint county manager.  A manager resides in Sligo and manages, under the Local Government Acts, the Counties of Sligo and Leitrim.  They have a joint Mental Hospital Board for the two counties and members of each local authority have served on that year after year for many years and have worked in complete harmony. The people of Leitrim do not regard Sligo as an outside county or as a stranger.</P>
    <P>Where is the Minister for Local Government to answer the case that has been put forward here in support of leaving Leitrim and Sligo alone? Why does he sulk and run out of this House and refuse to listen to concrete arguments in support of concrete amendments which are here to be debated?  Why is he not here?  As Deputy Corish has said, that is what he is paid for.  God knows he wasted enough of the time of his Department and of his own time last year on the futile referendum debates.  Of course, the difference between the referendum debates and this debate is that he could not treat the people with contempt. He knew that his referendum proposals could not go through or go on the Statute Book unless he could persuade the sovereign people of this country to give their support in the ballot box on 16th October last, but he knows perfectly well that with his majority in this House he can steamroll this measure on to the Statute Book without any reference to the people.  That is why he huffs and sulks and runs out of the House and refuses to listen to these arguments.  He could not do it last year because he had to try to carry the people with him but he can do it now because he has his <Col N="1666" /> forces behind him and he can march them through the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; Lobby in support of this.  But I venture to say, as Deputy L'Estrange has said, that when the day of reckoning comes, on the day of the next general election, the people will not forget this effort and this performance of the Minister for Local Government in his efforts to get his way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher spoke earlier in the evening on this set of amendments. I was rather amazed at his approach. His argument seemed to be that these amendments were not any better than the Minister's proposals but by that he seemed to concede immediately that they were an adequate alternative.  I want to go further and say that they are an equitable alternative.  If that is so and if this set of proposals carry out the constitutional requirements just as well as the Minister's proposals, why is the Minister not here to argue in favour of his proposals as against these?  That is what I want to know and it is what the people of the country will want to know when they read the newspapers tomorrow.  They will not be satisfied with the manner in which the Minister for Local Government is treating this House and the manner in which he is dealing with this measure.  The people are entitled to pose the question: &ldquo;How would the Minister for Local Government behave if he had&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The plain fact of the matter is that these amendments proved beyond yea or nay that the Minister could have produced a worthwhile alternative had he so desired.  There is no refutation or argument of any value which has been advanced or which can be advanced at any stage against the substance of these amendments. The Minister here has thrown in the sponge.

He stated that he would not waste time answering any of these things.  There is no man more ready to waste time than the Minister concerned. I do not think, if he had a worthwhile answer, there is anyone more ready to give that answer.  He likes the party and thrust of debate; it is part of his life.  However, he does not like to be made a punch bag of and that is what has been happening to him here since this Bill was introduced. On the committee Stage he was like a punch-drunk boxer rolling around the ring.  All he was able to say was &ldquo;Budd&rdquo; and &ldquo;referendum&rdquo;.  Today he has taken the knock-out, and he has lain down and he cannot get up at all.  There is not much satisfaction in pursuing an opponent of that type.  The Minister has the full help of his Department behind him.  He has had ample <Col N="1670" /> opportunity to study these amendments and see if there is anything statistically or geographically wrong with them, as obviously there must not have been. I am reasonably sure that when these amendments were put before the Minister&mdash;and even before the amendments were formulated, the substance of them was discussed at length here on Committee Stage&mdash;the subject matter of these amendments, and the amendments themselves afterwards drafted by me, were passed by the Minister to his Department for comment.  I imagine that would be the usual procedure and, even if the Minister did not specifically ask for comment from his Department, these bright boys are always on the ball; that is their job&mdash; if there is something wrong, you can hit him on that.  The Minister has said nothing.  I feel like Cassius Caly in this matter.  I do not know what the poor Minister feels like.  Maybe he is like Jack Doyle, except he does not even sing.  However, I thought when the amendments were put down he was waiting around the corner with something to throw at me but, so far nothing has happened.  I am now trying to urge him into getting up at this late state&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i>&mdash;&mdash;to say something concrete about those amendments, something that will tear them to pieces.  He has not even made a small criticism.  I would consider it worthwhile if he made some criticism, but apparently neither he nor his Department are capable of coming up with one concrete argument whatsoever, apart from diffuse generalities, on these amendments.  Those amendments should stand some challenge.  All the Minister is doing is going into the Division Lobbies and with the numerical strength of his Party he will vote those amendments out.  He is quite happy to sit there and accept this role of not saying anything, which is rather unusual for him.  He is observing complete and abject silence.  We discussed in the earlier part of the day the eastern counties and on this occasion we are discussing the western complex of counties.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> Those counties, which spread from Clare to Donegal, embrace the counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Roscommon, Clare, Galway and Mayo.  The Minister has produced a very simple solution here for this whole western seaboard area, the ten by three solution, ten three-seater constituencies.  It must be obvious to anybody who has any respect for geographical considerations or for county boundaries that, in the normal order of things, it would be quite impossible to imagine that the complex of country-side west of the Shannon and up to Donegal could lend itself to such a simple and equitable solution.  Providence has not fashioned that part of this country, or indeed any part of the world, in such a nice, symmetrical fashion.  Despite this, our Minister has been able to go in, ignore those county boundaries and set up the constituency complex of ten threeseat constituencies.  He says this was the only solution be could arrive at, that it was a just and equitable soultion and was what the people wanted when they voted in the referendum. This is what he has produced as a result of his gerrymandering.  He was not able to receive the message which we gave to him and which the people of Ireland gave to him that they did not want any gerrymandering and did not want any of the peculiar things which are happening and have happened north of the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the message the people tried to convey to the Fianna Fáil Party.  Despite that, the Minister has completely ignored it in regard to this western seaboard area.  He is producing a beautifully balanced position of ten constituencies of three seat each. I have suggested reasoned amendments here.  Earlier today we discussed a group of eight amendments dealing with the eastern area and now these eight amendments deal with the western area.  These eight amendments hang together and have been discussed together.  The Ceann Comhairle ruled that, in respect of these eight amendments dealing with the western complex and the earlier ones dealing with the <Col N="1672" /> eastern complex, they would be discussed as one unit and we could discuss them in any order we liked.  Deputies who spoke did just that because, to use the Minister's words, those things are subject to a chain re-action and, if you discuss one, you have to discuss the other.</P>
    <P>When discussing these eight amendments the Minister will appreciate that I have made the suggestion that this matter can be dealt with by a single procedure.  If one reads the phraseology of the amendments the general purport and picture escapes one.  I will put it quite simply to the Minister that these amendments mean nothing more than the establishment of six three-seaters and three four-seaters.  The Minister wants ten three-seaters in the particular area, giving 30 Deputies to this House.  The adjustment which I have suggested is very little different and I think it is by no means unreasonable. We had constituencies represented by seven, eight and nine Deputies.  Even in my own county of Tipperary we had seven Deputies coming into this House from that constituency. In so far as we can, I believe we meet the Minister's whishes to establish smaller constituencies when we suggest three four-seaters and six three-seaters, giving the same representation to that part of Ireland west of the Shannon, including Donegal.  That is reasonable.  At the same time, an effort has been made to preserve the traditional county boundaries and the traditional local electoral areas.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> That can be done if the Minister studies these amendments.  It can be done without any considerable breach of county boundaries.  The Minister has mutilasted two-thirds of those counties in the western complex.  He has completely obliterated County Leitrim and he has breached Roscommon almost out of recognition.  He has transferred colse on 60,000 people, roughly, outside their counties into some other counties.  Those 60,000 people will be voting in their own counties for local <Col N="1673" /> authority purposes, for their county councillors, and they will be voting in another area for Fáil purposes.  They may have, and probably will have in many cases, to go to Deputies outside their area to get representation.</P>
      <P>I have already tabulated in the amendments the areas which I suggested might be transferred and it is not necessary for me to go over these particular areas again.  The figures, too, I have given to the Minister.  In the suggestions I make there would be only three breaches of constituency boundaries west of the Shannon.  The two District Electoral Divisions of Taghboy and Ahascragh in Galway could be transferred to Roscommon, making Roscommon a three-seater without any population transfer from anywhere else.  That would make a more reasonable constituency than the Minister's suggestion of taking 11,072 persons from South Leitrim and putting them into Roscommon.  My suggestion, with a transfer of only 953 persons, would make a more elongated and, georgaphically, as more manageable constituency.</P>
      <P>I have suggested to the Minister that the transfer he proposes to make from North Leitrim&mdash;unless he is making provision for the fall in population which he anticipates will occur under Fianna Fáil during the next five or six years&mdash;is excessive.  He is suggesting a transfer of 8,997, whereas I suggest to him that it would suffice to transfer 5,642 persons and I have already given in the amendment the District Electoral Divisions which may be used for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not much choice of district Electoral Divisions here as the population is rather close.  I admit that, from the point of view of national average, these amendments leave the nationa average very low in the western areas; but that is a pattern which the Minister himself has followed and a pattern which he has preached here in the House on several occasions on the agrument that the percentage of voters to population is higher in, for example, Clare and in Donegal and, indeed, in rural Ireland generally, them it is in Dublin.  The Explanatory Memorandum which accompanied the Bill shows <Col N="1674" /> that there are a number of minus signs when dealing with the western constituencies and a number of plus signs when dealing with the Dublin constituencies.</P>
    <P>I accept that there is some validity in the Minister's argument in that respect and the amendments I have put down are on the same lines in so far as the per Deputy representation that would arise if these amendments were adopted would be below the national average.  I admit that, if we brought in Athlone West Urban, we might raise it a little and if, at a future time, the population in the West of Ireland goes down further, it may be necessary and may be an inescapable exercise to bring in Athlone West Urban, but it is not necessary to do so at the present time to meet the tenets of the constitution.  The Minister has unnecessarily brought in Athlone West Urban.  He has also unnecessarily brought population from Leitrim to Donegal.  Not alone is that an injustice to the people of Leitrim but it also means that they must come down too far into County Leitrim.</P>
    <P>Regarding Clare and Galway, I have suggested that a transfer from Galway to Clare of 2,805 persons&mdash;the figure reached when dealing with District Electroal Divisions in the Gort area&mdash; would suffice to preserve the traditional county of Clare as a four-seater.  I do not think we need any special charm to deal with those areas I have suggested.  The Minister could move them westwards or he could move them eastwards; he could go into greater detail and depart from District Electorl Divisions.  He could get smaller units; he could get smaller maps and the population of the townlands from the Statistics Office.</P>
    <P>The Minister could divise several alternatives to what I have suggested. The point that I have made is that, merely by a comparatively small transfer of population from Galway it would be possible to leave the constituency of Clare intact.  I think that is by far a better solution than what the Minister has done is an endeavour to try and create a new constituency of Clare-Galway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins </NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I asked for permission to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 57 on to-day's Order Paper.  In case the Minister may think so, I want at the outset to say I am not raising this matter for the purpose of pillorying the Minister with regard to the particular remarks he made in connection with Mr. Garrett Cooney, B. L. The reason I say that is because, so far as Mr. Cooney is concerned, I think the Minister has done the right thing in the House to-day in apologising here in public in a courageous way to Mr. Cooney for the remarks he made concerning him in this House on the 10th December last.  Consequently, so far as Mr. Cooney is concerned, I think the Minister has made honourable amendment.</P>
      <P>So far as I go, I am quite prepared to applaud the Minister for doing that. It was the right thing to do.  I am glad the Minister did it and, if I have any comment to make with regard to it, it is simply to express my regret that the Minister's apology was not made until today and was not made until he was answering the questions which were tabled by Deputy Mark Clinton and myself.</P>
      <P>I am raising this matter, however, because I think it is necessary to do so in view of the attitude which the Minister has displayed towards the General Council of the Bar of Ireland, or the Bar Council as it is called for the sake of brevity.  The House may be aware that, following the statements which the Minister made in the House on the 10th December last in the course of which he himself invited the Bar Council to conduct an investigation, the Bar Council on the 13th December, 1968, wrote a letter to the Minister in which they referred to the remarks the Minister had made and in which they said this to the Minister in this letter which I am quoting from, a copy of which was published in the <i>Irish Times </i> of 18th February:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;These averments constitute a grave reflection on Mr. Cooney in his professional capacity, and would, <Col N="1677" /> if true, subject Mr. Cooney to severe penalties by his professional disciplinary body.  This Council, therefore, requests you to supply it with whatever information you may have on these matters, in order that it may carry out a thorough investigation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was the situation.  The Minister, having made certain statements in this House, and having himself suggested there should be an investigation by the disciplinary body of the Bar in Ireland, had the ball thrown back at his own feet by the Bar Council who invited him to submit to them whatever information he might have in order that that body might carry out a thorough investigation.  No reply whatever was sent by the Minister to the Bar Council following that letter and some weeks later, on the 8th January, a further letter was sent by the Secretary of the Bar council to the Minister in which he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed to say that the Bar Council has received no reply to its letter to you of December 13th, 1968. The Council regards the matter as urgent, and proposes to deal with it at its meeting on Friday, January 31st, 1969.</P>
    <P>The Council would therefore be grateful if you could reply to its letter as soon as possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That communication from the Secretary of the Bar Council elicited a reply, not from the Minister, but from the Minister's Private Secretary, who wrote on the 10th January, 1969:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by Mr. Ó Moráin, T. D., Minister for Justice, to acknowledge receipt of yours of the 8th instant which will be brought to the Minister's attention as soon as possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister, apparently, directed his Private Secretary to bring the letter to his, the Minister's, attention as soon as possible.  That, I think, is comment enough on that particular communication from the Minister.  However, having directed his Private Secretary to bring the matter to his attention as soon as possible, apparently nothing more was done about it.  That was on <Col N="1678" /> the 10th January, 1969, and ultimately the Bar Council met, conducted their investigation and came to their decision. I do not want to comment on that.  The Minister has done the right, decent and courageous thing in apologising, but when the Bar Council came to their conclusions with regard to this matter, and when their findings fully and completely vindicated Mr. Cooney, they communicated their findings to the Minister by letter of the 3rd February. The Secretary of the Bar Council wrote directly to the Minister on that day:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Mr. Ó Moráin, I enclose the finding of the Bar Council in the matter of Mr. Garrett Cooney, Barrister at Law, concerning which letter were sent to you on the 13th December, 1968, and the 8th January, 1969.</P>
    <P>The Bar Council is of opinion that you ought to withdraw your statements publicly and apologise to Mr. Cooney.</P>
    <P>The Council will meet on Friday, 14th February, 1969, at 3.30 p.m. to consider your reply.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the position on the 3rd of this month and as far as I am aware, and I think this is correct&mdash;and it was implicit in the Minister's reply to my questions today, though the matter is not dealt with specifically there&mdash;it is clear that no reply whatever was sent by the Minister to that communicaion.</P>
    <P>There are two things involved here. First of all, let me say that the General Council of the Bar of Ireland are an elected body consisting of practising members, senior and junior, of the Bar in Ireland.  They are a disciplinary body which investigate complaints made against any member of the Bar or made by any member of the Bar; they are completely non-policical, absolutely impartial in their dealings and, as I said earlier, an elected body.  To my mind, anyone in the position occupied by the Minister for Justice should, if necessary, go out of his way to ensure that as far as he can achieve it there will be complete co-operation and trust as between himself and a profession body of this sort dealing with one of the branches of the legal profession&mdash;a <Col N="1679" /> body which, to my mind, is entitled not only to courtesy but respect from any Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that he had asked his Private Secretary to bring the matter to his attention, the Minister did not deign to make any further reply, notwithstanding that he himself had suggested in this House that an investigation should be carried out.  In these circumstances, I think it is right to raise the matter on the Adjournment on that issue alone&mdash;that the Minister for Justice should extend what any of us would regard as ordinary courtesty when dealing with a body of this sort.</P>
    <P>When this matter was raised earlier today, there were certain supplementary questions.  In one of them, I asked the Minister if he would deal with some of the matters raised in my question about his non-reply to the letters issued to him by the Bar Council.  I said it seemed to me from the statement made by the Bar Council that the Minister had been afforded every opportunity by the body of submitting whatever case he wanted to submit for investigation on the assurance that it would be fully investigated.  I asked:</P>
    <P>Would the Minister explain why it is only now, towards the end of February, in response to two Questions tabled here in Dáil, that the information the Minister has given in his reply has been given when a letter was sent to him by the Bar Council, containing their findings, as early as 3rd of this month.</P>
    <P>In reply to that supplementary the Minister said&mdash;and I quote from the unrevised Official Report:</P>
    <P>As I repeat, I do not know what, if any, investigation the Bar Council made, which I think they should have made, to ascertain how Deputy L'Estrange came into possession of these pleadings, how he got them or who was the go-between.  It is their business to do that.  I do not know if they have done anything about that.  No doubt they will tell us. They have kept very quiet about that side of it which is the real issue in this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1680" /> It seems to me that the attitude of the Minister to this body, which, as I said, is an elected body, completely non-political, completely impartial, as demonstrated on this occasion in that respect, leaves a great deal to be desired.  I do not think there is anything that has been done or anything left undone by the Bar Council in relation to this matter which entitles the Minister to put them in the dock. Yet it seems to me that, from the Minister's attitude, that is what he has been trying to do.</P>
    <P>It may be that the Minister may have resented this somewhat embarrassiong position in which he was placed by the findings of the Bar Council, but the mere fact that the situation is as it is demonstrates the complete impartiality of that body in dealing with a matter of this sort; and I do not think it is right that the Minister should, a it seems to me he did in response to my supplementary questions, suggest that Bar Council had left undone something which they should have done.</P>
    <P>It is open to the Minister, should he desire to do so, to request the Bar Council to make any further investigations he feels they should make.  If he feels it necessary to do that, and if these investigations are undertaken, I express the hope now that the Minister will be very much more forthcoming with the Bar Council than he was in response to the communications they sent him in relation to the investigation they carried out.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter also on the Adjournment because I believe that when Deputies put down Parliamentary Questions for answer by any Minister they are entitled to get full replies to those questions.  In the course of my question today, I asked the Minister if he would explain why up to 17th of this month no reply, other than the reply of 10th January, 1969, from his Private Secretary, was sent to the Council's letters of 30th December, 1968, and 9th January, 1969, and I asked him if any reply had been sent to the Council's letter of 3rd February, 1969?</P>
    <P>I think I am correct in saying that <Col N="1681" /> in the course of the lengthy reply the Minister gave neither of these questions was answered by him.  A Deputy who puts down questions to a Minister on matters of this sort is entitled to get all the information the Minister has. They should be answered if for no other reason than to establish facts but also because Deputies have the right to elicit information from Ministers of State.  As I said earlier, I think the Minister acted correctly in certain respects.  I am glad, therefore, to have been able to make the statement I made at the outset.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran) Michael Moran">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran) </NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins is very concerned about the Bar Council and about people being entitled to respect and courtesy.  He does not, in his long 20-minute speech, express one word of regret about the unfortunate man, Deputy Blaney, who was so badly slandered in this House.  This slander was deliberately made for political purposes on the eve of two by-elections by Deputy L'Estrange.  Deputy L'Estrange knew in making these unfounded charges on that occasion that there would not be time for the Garda to investigate them, that there would not be time to expose these slanders for what they really were before the by-elections took place in Wicklow and in Clare.  He made these charges in the House on the eve of these elections which came on the 14th.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy L'Estrange, when the gardaí went to him, of course, would give no information but, as I have set out and put on the records of this House, it is quite clear that no sooner was an amended pleading filed in this particular civil action than Deputy L'Estrange was briefed chapter and verse on it.  Deputies will ask themselves how could that happen.  These documents are confidential documents. They are in charge of the High Court judge trying the case and the only other people who have access to them are the lawyers concerned in the case. I have never seen a client look for a copy of the pleadings in his case.  It is a technical matter that is explained to him by his lawyers.  From&mdash;I think the date was the 7th March&mdash;somebody was able to acquaint Deputy <Col N="1682" /> L'Estrange with these amended pleadings. They were no sooner filed when the charges of alleged mispropriety were made than Deputy L'Estrange was able to quote them chapter and verse in this House.</P>
    <P>I thought the Bar Council, with all due respect to them, would have investigated this part of the matter and, in fact, in their letter to me just immediately before Christmas&mdash;I think I got it on the 14th or 15th December &mdash;they asked me for information so that they could carry out a thorough investigation.  How thorough has the investigation of the Bar Council been in this matter?  Deputy O'Higgins assures us they are impartial.  I must accept that, although looking at the list I have before me one would imagine, reading it, one was present at the Fine Gael National Executive.  Be that as it may, they said they would conduct a thorough investigation into this matter.</P>
    <P>The nub of this matter is the fact that Deputy L'Estrange, before a case came to trial, was able to quote the pleadings in this House, was able to announce in this House the day it came to trial, was able to announce the actual amount of the settlement that was made and the amount of the money that was paid over, and these are matters that are only marked on a counsel's brief.  In this particular case the order striking out the action&mdash;and it was struck out by consent&mdash;did not give the terms of the settlement, but Deputy L'Estrange by divine inspiration was able to tell this House the exact amount of money passed, when it passed, how it was done&mdash;the lot.</P>
    <P>The Bar Council said that they were making a thorough investigation.  Why did they not investigate this strange matter?  Why did they not inquire as to how it was that Deputy L'Estrange could come in here at every twist and turn of this case and quote from the pleadings in this House and give this House particulars that the judge himself did not get as to the settlement made in this case?  If they got after Deputy L'Estrange, we have not heard, mark you.  They have been very silent on this.  They have told the world that they investigated the position of Mr. Cooney and that Mr. <Col N="1683" /> Cooncy had denied that he would have anything to do with Deputy L'Estrange but they keep strangely quiet about investigating as to how these matters came into the hands of Deputy L'Estrange and they could only have come to his hands in one way.  These are matters on the records of this House.  They might have a better opportunity or more influence with Deputy L'Estrange to get him to talk and to disclose the sources of his information but, as far as we know and as far as the public know, they have made no attempt whatsoever to investigate what really is the issue in this particular matter.  I asked Deputy L'Estrange to give us the information that he had.  He refused.  The Garda asked him to give the information that he had and he refused.</P>

      <P>Looking at the membership of this Bar Council, Deputy O'Higgins should certainly have great influence with them.  Might I ask Deputy O'Higgins to get them to do their share in clearing the character of the former Minister for Local Government, Deputy Blaney, and to find out who are the gentlemen down in the Four Courts who kept feeding Deputy L'Estrange with the pleadings in this action while it was before a High Court Judge and when it comes down to cases here, having proceeded with this character assassination, ably assisted by Deputy Lindsay opposite, he then runs away from it and withdraws the charges here when Deputy Blaney challenges him.</P>

      <P>This type of character assassination is something that that Party must get away from.  This type of character assassination, which is part of the Fine Gael policy, is something that must be exposed.  Deputy O'Higgins did not participate in this campaign but he has sidekicks there who deliberately do it and there was not one word of apology from Deputy O'Higgins tonight for that character assassination.  I think it is indicative of the interest that Deputy O'Higgins has in this whole matter.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 26th February, 1969.</P>
