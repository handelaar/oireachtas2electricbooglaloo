      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 4, 5, 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>The Secretary General of the United Nations is well aware of the reasons why, in the 1920 Act, the British Parliament partitioned Ireland.  During my interview with him on last Wednesday therefore, I concentrated upon advising him of the extreme gravity of the present situation in the Six Counties and the possibility of further deterioration.</P>
      <P>It was only in December, 1955&mdash;not 20 years ago&mdash;that Ireland's application for membership was accepted.  No resolution on the partition of Ireland has been tabled in the United Nations for the very good reason that none of our Governments was convinced that during its period of office the adoption of a United Nations resolution would contribute to the restoration of Irish unity.  However, as the Deputy should be aware all our delegations since 1955 raised the question of partition whenever it appeared relevant and useful to do so.</P>
      <P>I have placed in the Oireachtas Library extracts of 11 speeches in the United Nations, two by my predecessor, Deputy Cosgrave, one by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, and eight by myself in which we dealt with the partition of Ireland, its injustices and dangers and warned against the imposition of partition on other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Imports into France and Germany of the main agricultural products, especially cattle, beef and dairy products, are subject to EEC regulations.  Since 1966, the import levies on cattle and beef have brought our very valuable export trade in these products with EEC countries almost to a complete standstill.  Representations in the matter have been made to the EEC Commission and member states of the EEC but so far without success. In the case of dairy products, imports into the EEC from Ireland have ceased. The Community itself has a vast surplus of dairy produce, the disposal of which is affecting world markets generally.</P>
      <P>Certain agricultural products such as lamb and horsemeat are not yet subject to EEC regulations and trade in these products with France is subject to a bilateral Irish/French Agreement. In the annual negotiations on this Agreement, special attention is given to securing improved access to the French market for these products, and exports of both have been increasing in recent years.  There is an Irish/West German Trade Agreement also, and in the annual negotiations on it, special attention is likewise given to securing increased access for such agricultural products as are not dealt with under EEC regulations.</P>

      <P>Cattle prices recently have been at record high levels and, so far as can be judged at this early stage, the outlook for the cattle trade generally during the remainder of the year appears reasonably satisfactory.  The volume of exports to Britain, on the hoof or in carcase form, should be at about the same level in 1969 as in 1968.  It is expected that the US market will continue to provide an adequate outlet for manufacturing-quality beef but exports of cattle and beef to EEC countries will no doubt still be affected by the heavy levies and duties on imports into those countries.</P>

      <P>There is no specific provision for compensatory payments of the nature referred to in the question. However, if, in such a case as is described by the Deputy, a definite hardship was involved and an application was made to my Department in the matter, I would be prepared to consider whether the circumstances warranted a recommendation to the Minister for Finance for an ex-gratia grant.  Before making such a recommendation I would have to be satisfied that the innocence of the person charged was clearly established and that the unnecessary court proceedings were due to culpable mistake or omission on the part of the prosecution and in no way attributable to default on the part of the person charged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been some. Deputy Dunne does not take into consideration any question of court jurisdiction in the matter of giving expenses or costs.  Prosecutions fail for different reasons, not necessarily the innocence of the accused.  However, if there are cases of the type I envisage the Deputy has in mind, they are limited in number. In a case where it is obvious the person was never involved and should not have been charged, there is an existing practice whereby expenses are given with the sanction of the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <P>In regard to the latter figure, the rate at which these cases are disposed of by the court depends on the speed at which Dublin Corporation processes the claims as a preliminary to court hearing.  Because of this, the position is that up to the present only 80 claims have been listed for hearing at each fortnightly sitting for this class of business.</P>
      <P>On the 7th January last, the county registrar wrote to the corporation drawing attention to the arrears and indicating that he proposed to increase to 160 the number of claims listed for each sitting.  In a reply dated 9th January, the corporation asked the county registrar to defer action on his proposal pending consideration of the position by the corporation.  Nothing further has been heard from the corporation, but the county registrar intends to pursue the matter.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete subsection (4).&mdash;(Deputy M.J. O'Higgins.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We were dealing with amendment 5 of section 12. This is the section which purports to give the Garda power of arrest without <Col N="54" /> warrant.  When I was speaking on this amendment last week I made the case to the Minister that, as it seemed to me, the power of arrest which the Minister is seeking to give the Garda here may, in fact, be exercised, if this section goes through unamended, even where no offence has been committed. The Minister corrected me on that and at the time I was inclined to accept his correction.  However, on reading the section again I think the argument I presented to the Minister on that occasion was correct, and I want to take the point up with the Minister again on that account.  Section 12 (4), which I am suggesting by my amendment should be deleted from the Bill and which the Minister wants to amend purely from a drafting point of view, provides:</P>
      <P>A member of the Garda Síochána may arrest a person without warrant where&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>a number of things are applicable, the first being:</P>
      <P>(a)  he is satisfied that the person has committed an offence involving a breach of the peace or has engaged in conduct that was likely to lead to the commission of such an offence,</P>
      <P>I argued on paragraph (a) of subsection (4) that it was possible that this power of arrest without warrant could be triggered off even though no offence had been committed, and it was pointed out that the distinction I made at the time was that there were two parts in this paragraph: first, you had the case where a person has committed an offence involving a breach of the peace &mdash;that that was one set of circumstances in which under this subsection arrest without warrant would be justified&mdash;and, secondly, you had a different set of circumstances where a person has engaged in conduct that was likely to lead to the commission of such an offence, that is, an offence involving a breach of the peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that engaging in conduct likely to lead to a breach of the peace was in itself an offence.  I accepted that and I still do, but the whole of paragraph (a) is governed by the first few words, <Col N="55" />&ldquo;where&rdquo; a member of the Garda Síochána &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo;.  The point I want to bring to the Minister's attention is that, while a garda may be satisfied in his own mind either that an offence has been committed or that conduct has been engaged in that was likely to lead to the commission of an offence involving a breach of the peace, the garda may be entirely wrong, and in that sense I think I am quite right in arguing that under this subsection as it stands we are seeking here to give the power of arrest without warrant to a garda even in cases where no offence may have been committed at all.</P>
    <P>I want to give the Minister an example of the kind of thing I have in mind.  I referred on an earlier amendment to the charges of intimidation which were made from the Government benches, indeed, by Ministerial spokesmen, against the NFA some years ago. It seems to me that if, for example, the Minister for Justice, with all the weight and authority of his position behind him, goes on record in this House or elsewhere to say that some individual or some organisation has been responsible for engaging in conduct likely to lead to a breach of the peace or that they have engaged in the commission of an offence involving a breach of the peace, it would be perfectly normal and natural for a member of the Garda Síochána to accept the word and the opinion of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>There the garda would be entitled to say that he was satisfied that a person had engaged in conduct that was likely to lead to the commission of an offence involving a breach of the peace, and the reason he would be satisfied was that he was accepting the <i>diktat</i> of the Minister for Justice.  He is not required under this section to satisfy himself from personal, visual evidence.  He is not required to be present and see a person engaging in conduct likely to lead to a breach of the peace.  He is not required to be present and see the offence committed or attempted.  If he claims to be satisfied&mdash;I suggest he can be satisfied on the hearsay evidence of a person in authority&mdash;then, if this subsection is passed it can become <Col N="56" /> operative even though a Minister, or other person in authority, as the case may be, is simply making a political speech or giving an opinion, not as a lawyer but as a politician.  Now that is a very important facet of this subsection against which this House must be on guard; it can be triggered off merely by an expression of opinion by a politician or a Minister of State acting in his political capacity.</P>
    <P>Another important matter that has been dealt with only very briefly in relation to this subsection is the suggestion that has been made that this could bring into operation a system of protective or preventive custody.  I gather the Minister has no very great regard for that argument because, in the booklet which he issued in reply to some of the critics of the Bill, the Minister says at page 6:</P>
    <P>There are, however, more fundamental misconceptions in the text. The basic assumption in the criticism is that a power to make an arrest carries with it an arbitrary power to detain a person in custody (even in &ldquo;protective custody&rdquo;).  This is certainly not the law.  In a <i>habeas corpus</i> action, for instance, the question to be answered is not whether authority existed for taking a person into custody but what authority exists for keeping him in custody.  A power of arrest is not, and could not be, a power to detain in &ldquo;protective custody&rdquo;&mdash;or &ldquo;preventive custody&rdquo; either.</P>
    <P>Here the Minister is giving what seems to me to be a purely legalistic answer to a fear which is abroad amongst our people, a fear engendered by the wording of subsection (4) of section 12 of this Bill.  I do not think that that fear is entirely ungrounded.  I accept fully that it is not the Minister's purpose, or intention, in this subsection to set up a system of protective or preventive custody, but I think it is necessary that the Minister should examine very carefully what is being provided in this section.  If we scrutinise the subsection carefully we see that the fears that have been expressed may not be entirely groundless.  In paragraph (a) of subsection (4) the wording used is that <Col N="57" /> a member of the Garda Síochána may arrest a person without warrant where&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>he is satisfied that the person has committed an offence involving a breach of the peace or has engaged in conduct that was likely to lead to the commission of such an offence.</P>
    <P>The last half dozen words were all-important. The subsection does not say that the conduct engaged in by the person must be conduct which would necessarily involve that person himself in the likelihood of committing a breach of the peace or of committing an offence involving a breach of the peace; if the person indulges in any conduct which may lead, however far-fetched it may be to the commission by others of a breach of the peace, that person is liable to arrest, and to arrest without warrant.</P>
    <P>I want now to give the Minister and the House an example of how this could operate.  Again, I do not think this is far-fetched.  I remember occasions when from the front benches of the Fianna Fáil Government in this House the country was told that it was not the business of the Government to make people or causes popular: it could very well be that a person, because of the stand he takes on a political issue, may possibly inflame public opinion and find himself, although he is acting in a perfectly law-abiding, peaceful and honest manner, in a position in which his appearance at a particular time or on a particular occasion may give rise to conduct in others which is either rowdy or disorderly. Under the subsection as it stands, that person, whether he be a politician or anyone else, is liable to be taken into custody, to be arrested without warrant, on a member of the Garda Síochána forming the view that his appearance&mdash;he has done nothing other than appear&mdash;on the particular occasion was likely to lead to the commission of an offence by others involving a breach of the peace.</P>
    <P>What is that except a system of protective or preventive custody?  Surely that is what is involved in this subsection as it stands?  I should like to hear the Minister arguing against it.  I am quite prepared to accept that neither he <Col N="58" /> nor any member of the Government intend that that should be so, but there it is.  That is what the Minister wants this House to write into our criminal legislation and that is exactly the kind of thing about which fears are being expressed.</P>
    <P>I have said on more than one occasion that, so far as the Bill as a whole is concerned, the best thing the Minister can do is to withdraw it, to purge it of objectionable sections such as this, and to come back to the House with a new Bill which will find a ready acceptance, because there are some worthwhile provisions in the Bill.  So far, however, as this particular subsection is concerned, no matter how the Minister may endeavour to amend it, the fears it has provoked will continue and the only way in which the Minister can deal with the situation now is by getting rid of this subsection entirely.  I do not think it is unreasonable to ask him to do that.  The whole country knows that within a matter of months, if not weeks, we will have a general election.</P>

      <P>I should love to discuss the general election if the Minister would give us some information in regard to it.  It is a matter on which all of us would like to be far better informed.  Leaving jokes aside, I personally believe that this Bill is coming in here at an unfortunate time&mdash;the Minister might say that any time to discuss a Bill of this kind might be considered unfortunate&mdash;because it is true that certain people in Northern Ireland are pointing their hands across the Border and are saying, in effect: &ldquo;Why condemn the type of legislation that is in operation in the North?  Are they not trying to introduce legislation in the South which in some respects is slightly worse?&rdquo; For that reason, I consider it a pity that this Bill is being discussed in these weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I seriously suggest that the Minister should consider withdrawing the Bill. I am not saying this in order to try to embarrass him but because I think it is even being unfair to him.  He is aware that, on a previous occasion, a Bill came before this House known as the Succession Bill&mdash;somebody called it that and I think it was rather an apt description of it.  It was introduced <Col N="60" /> in this House and it was quite a mess and was withdrawn by a new Minister when he took over and it was reintroduced in such a way that it was a big improvement.  I am quite sure that if the present Minister got the job of drawing up this Bill he would draw it up in a different way&mdash;and he has given evidence of this by virtue of the fact that he has withdrawn two sections and introduced, instead, two new sections.  I think that, if he started to redraft the whole Bill from scratch, rather than trying to patch up what is in fact a very unsatisfactory attempt at legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The fact that there are so many amendments to this section proves that it is one of the objectionable sections.  The point I am trying to make is this.  The Minister changed two sections: why not change this one also?  I am sure he realises that this one is as objectionable as the others were.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The point of view which Deputy M.J. O'Higgins was putting for the past 25 minutes was that this particular section, if it is not amended as suggested, will give a power of arrest to the Garda which is over and above anything they are entitled to have.  Nobody has more respect for the members of the Garda Síochána than I have.  I have said on numerous occasions in this House, and particularly on the Second Reading, that I often wonder at the tolerance with which they treat the type of people who occasionally start out on a parade, a march, or what have you, in this country.  We are all in favour of giving the Garda Síochána necessary powers but when we come across a section of a Bill which suggests that because a meeting, parade, football match or something of that kind takes place and, at that meeting, somebody gets a bit excited a garda, looking on, might decide: &ldquo;That fellow would cause a row&rdquo; whereas, if somebody does not do anything about it, the fellow eventually goes away.  Months afterwards, the same fellow appears at a meeting, march or football match and seems to be behaving in the same way.  According to what is now proposed, the garda is entitled to arrest that man on the grounds that, previously, he showed signs of creating a breach of the peace and would, on this occasion, create a breach of the peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can call to mind now a well-known supporter of the Minister's Party in my constituency who was secretary of a Cumann there which eventually folded up.  He was the sort of fellow who, going to anything&mdash;a football match, a meeting, what have you&mdash;all he had to hear was something likely to be controversial and he immediately started to take off his coat.  The impression one got was that he was going to hit some-body&mdash;but it was just a mannerism. After a while people felt he was a bit of a fool and nobody passed any remarks. Seeing him for the first time, and seeing him take off his coat, a garda on the edge of a meeting might take a mental note of that fact.  A few months later, at another meeting or <Col N="62" /> football match or what have you, and seeing the man behaving in the same manner, the garda might think that that fellow should be arrested, brought to the barracks and brought before a Peace Commissioner and, if I read it correctly, that person could be kept for a week.</P>

The Minister would consider that. When he was talking here last Wednesday he made the case better for me than I could make it.  He kept repeating that there was no intention of dealing with the case of somebody who had in fact, over a period of months, been involved in some kind of fracas and that this was a question of a man who was at one meeting and then went to a meeting elsewhere and continued a row he had been attempting to start earlier on, or some words like that, I do not wish to be putting words into his mouth.  This was the impression I got and, if that is so and if the Minister meant it, he should accept the amendment to limit the period to 24 hours.</P>

      <P>I do not think I should waste much time on the arguments made by Deputy M.J. O'Higgins because, having said last week that we wanted a serious discussion on these sections and the matters involved, he has now served notice that he is purely <Col N="64" /> play-acting and that his Party is going to do this for the purpose of obstructing the passage of the Bill.  Non-lawyer members of the House should take cognizance of this and accept that every hairy old cat will be pulled out of the bag for the purpose of trying to obstruct and trying to create unrest outside in regard to something that is not in what is a simple section.  He has nailed his flag to the mast and we know what to expect.  I suspected this was the purpose of his tongue-in-the-cheek arguments on the section last week when he was trying to regurgitate arguments made against various sections by a certain organisation although these were answered and refuted and the existing law made clear.</P>
      <P>I must say I have a certain amount of sympathy with Deputy Tully in trying to follow the legal jargon which is passed around the House and the special significance of some words and expressions in connection with the criminal law because, as I have explained on another subsection, certain words and expressions have been judicially interpreted under other statutes and it is natural that this is taken into account by draftsmen who know they are using words with certainty which have already been judicially defined.  As far as Deputy O'Higgins is concerned it is nonsense to say that because somebody, some politician, I do not mind who it is, said that such a thing is an offence, that the Garda or the authorities would automatically act on an opinion so expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The absurdity of that is apparent immediately we look at it. When he dragged in the word &ldquo;intimidation&rdquo;. I explained again that that was judicially defined but that the judicial definition does not cover the ordinary everyday meaning of the word.  In respect of matters or offences under the existing law there are a number of things we would say in ordinary conversation, for instance that so-and-so was intimidated, when in fact the conduct involved would indicate intimidation in the layman's view but not <Col N="65" /> in the eyes of the law, which, as I explained, is a different matter altogether.  It is question of what a justice would convict upon for a breach of the peace.</P>
      <P>Let us get on with the subsection. Again, and I think deliberately, Deputy O'Higgins does not refer to my proposed amendment of the subsection but keeps talking about it as if this amendment was not there.  There are three paragraphs in subsection (4). Under paragraph (a) the garda may arrest without warrant if &ldquo;he is satisfied that the person has committed an offence involving a breach of the peace&rdquo;.  We will halt there for a moment.  Here is a definite offence already committed involving a breach of the peace.  In some way or other Deputy O'Higgins tries to put it over on whoever he thinks is so naïve as to accept it from him that because some politician said &ldquo;so-and-so committed an offence involving a breach of the peace&rdquo; the gardaí will act.  Was there ever anything more ridiculous?  Here the section says that the garda must be satisfied that the person has already committed an offence, an offence which involves a breach of the peace.  The second leg of that paragraph reads as follows: &ldquo;or has engaged in conduct that was likely to lead to the commission of such an offence&rdquo;.  That second leg also involves an offence as the law stands, as I have pointed out.  Now, paragraph (b) goes on to stipulate that the garda must have &ldquo;reasonable grounds for believing that the person is likely to engage in further conduct whereby the commission of an offence involving a serious breach of the peace may occur&rdquo; and paragraph (c) adds the condition that &ldquo;it is not reasonably practicable to apply for a warrant&rdquo;. This is where Deputy Tully's amendment comes in, because (c) qualifies (a) and (b).  There is no question of an arrest without a warrant unless you have these three conditions fulfilled, including that it is not reasonably practicable to apply for a warrant&mdash;in other words, that it is an urgent matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am putting to Deputy Tully is, and I will go further with the Deputy's argument, that these words &ldquo;that it is not reasonably practicable to apply for a warrant&rdquo; limit severely <Col N="66" /> and absolutely the time factor in this whole matter because, if it is reasonably practicable for the garda to apply for a warrant&mdash;if he has time to go to a peace commissioner and get it&mdash;then he could not exercise this power of arrest without warrant.  For Deputy Tully's benefit let me point out that if the garda sees a breach of the peace being committed the existing law is that he can arrest there and then without any warrant.  I should like the Deputy to appreciate that that is the present law.  This is a point&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking up in the clouds about this.  Of course he sees it.  Under this section he must satisfy himself first that an offence has been committed or, alternatively, that conduct has been engaged in that is likely to lead to a breach of the peace. All this storm in a teacup concerns a very, very rare occurrence.  I still want to impress on Deputy Tully that the qualifying time factor here is that the garda does not have time, that the offence has been committed or there has been conduct likely to lead to a breach of the peace, that the parties are going to get at it again and that to try and stop that happening he can, if he has not the time to get a warrant, use this power to arrest without warrant.</P>
      <P>There was on one occasion serious trouble between fishermen.  There was trouble out at sea.  One section of the fishermen landed and having armed themselves with certain weapons were about to go back to renew the fray.  There was a grave danger that, perhaps, lives would be lost.  But although the gardaí knew that there had already been trouble, no local peace commissioner was readily available and they could not arrest these men to prevent them from going out and engaging again in what I will call a continuing row without getting a warrant under the law as it stands&mdash;as it then stood and as it now stands.  That is the purpose of this section&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No. He cannot arrest them without a warrant, unless he observes them, but he is not clairvoyant; he cannot see fellows splitting each other's heads with oars out at sea.  He may have satisfied himself that there was trouble.  He may have a source of information when they came in, but, when they armed themselves for the special purpose of going out again, under existing law he could not, without a warrant, arrest these men so as to prevent them re-engaging in the fray.  It is a situation like that&mdash;a continuing running fight&mdash;that this provision is designed to meet.  The qualifying factor in time here is that it must not be reasonably practicable to apply for a warrant.  If there is time then the garda cannot arrest without a warrant.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully said that I argued&mdash; and I do not think there can be any answer to my argument&mdash;that the subsection as it stands was restricted and that it could only be used very rarely and that, when it was used, its use almost invariably had to be confined to incidents that had occurred only a matter of hours previously.  He says in that case why not put in a 24-hours limit.  If the Deputy has these fears on the score of interpretation I see no great objection to adopting his suggestion. I want to point out, however, that as the section will stand when it is amended in the way proposed in my official amendment&mdash;with the overall qualifying condition that the garda can only arrest without a warrant in these circumstances if he cannot immediately get a warrant, if a peace commissioner is not reasonably available&mdash;the operation of the power of arrest without warrant will be restricted to events that have occurred a matter of a few hours rather than a day or days previously.</P>

      <P>It is only in very rare circumstances that it could go as far back as eight or ten hours because the gardaí would probably be able to rope in a peace commissioner&mdash;they would have to do so if they could&mdash;and swear an information for a warrant.  In my view the Deputy's amendment would be restrictive on the amended section. That is my feeling, but if the Deputy believes&mdash;and I want to be fair to him since I know what he is aiming at but I think it would have the opposite effect&mdash;I think it could be done without any great difficulty in this way.  If I adopt his suggestion, paragraph (a) of my own amendment would then read: &ldquo;(a) he is satisfied that the person has, within the period of twenty-four hours immediately preceding the time of the arrest, committed an offence involving either a breach of the peace or conduct that was likely to lead to a breach of the peace&rdquo;.  If the House and the Deputy agree, that could be inserted in this way.  I think it is rather restrictive, while I understand that he thinks he is liberalising.  If he understands what I am saying about the effect of my amendment as it now reads, under which the idea is to spell out more clearly the intention behind the section &mdash;that the gardaí could exercise this power only where a peace commissioner was not reasonably available or where they did not have time to apply for a warrant&mdash;but it would, nevertheless, satisfy the Deputy and the House to insert these words in this way, I am prepared to agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister suggests there may possibly be some slight sugaring of what still remains a very bitter pill because we object to these powers being given at all.  I hope what I am about to say will appear sensible to those who are not lawyers and who want to keep as far away as possible from lawyers.  We are discussing the criminal law of this land and our statute law at the moment is the result of many different statutes that have been passed not only in this House but in the Imperial Parliament in the last century.  They were passed for the purpose of dealing with the extant and accumulated experience in <Col N="69" /> regard to&mdash;in this context&mdash;breaches and threatened breaches of the peace and so on.  Right through the last century and into this century the established position always was that power of arrest existed only in a situation in which an open breach of the peace had been committed in the presence of a constable or a Garda officer.  It was never suggested or thought, despite whatever difficulties the British Government had in trying to maintain what they regarded as the rule of law in this country, in spite of unrest and open defiance, that they should have this power.  It was never thought necessary. Nobody can suggest here that British authority in Ireland was benevolent; it certainly was not.  There was scarcely a period in which they were not amending and altering the law in order to extend the powers they could exercise in relation to people they regarded as offenders against the law.  This power was never sought.</P>
      <P>If we look at our own experience in the past 50 years there was from time to time a situation in which people acted collectively and individually in open defiance of the law of the land. These people had it as their objective and intention, deliberately conceived, to tear down this House and the institutions of this State.  There was a situation in which at times Garda officers took their lives in their hands if they went out to do their duty in accordance with their position.  Many of them were shot or murdered or killed.  Nevertheless, nobody in this House, no member of any Government here ever felt that a section of this kind was necessary or desirable.  The position has been for well more than a century of amendments and changes in the common law that this power was never felt to be desirable or necessary.  It is in that context and with that background that we on these benches look with the gravest suspicion on this proposal which so drastically enlarges the powers of arrest given to Garda officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy M.J. O'Higgins has proposed the deletion of the subsection.  I think that amendment is the best possible amendment to the section, to delete it entirely.  I do not think the section would suffer as a result.  The situation then would be that the existing <Col N="70" /> powers, for long regarded as adequate, would continue to be so regarded and I do not think anyone would suffer.  However, the Minister will not agree to that and obviously he has run away in some way from the original subsection as proposed.  He now proposes an amendment to subsection (4).  The Minister can appear to be reasonable when it suits him.  He is a very experienced Member of this House and he is as conscious as anybody else of the need to put some appearance of virtue on a Bill which has been, one could say, universally condemned.</P>
    <P>In this amendment, the Minister says that a member of the Garda Síochána may arrest a person without warrant if he is satisfied that the person has committed an offence.  That is fair enough but it is extending to a Garda officer a power that he did not have before.  The expression &ldquo;he is satisfied that the person has committed an offence&rdquo; is past tense.  Up to this the protective machinery and the ordinary good sense of successive generations required that to arrest such a person it was necessary to get a warrant from someone not involved in the fight so that no vengeance could be excercised by a <i>mala fide</i> garda and no opportunity would be given to the officer to do something wrong against any person.</P>
    <P>The Minister intends changing that and he intends according to a Garda officer a right which comes into operation on a decision by him the moment he is satisfied that such and such a person has committed an offence involving either a breach of the peace or involving conduct likely to lead to a breach of the peace.</P>

      <P>According to the Minister's amendment, the first condition for arrest is satisfaction by the Garda officer that the person has committed an offence involving either a breach of the peace or likely to lead to a breach of the peace.  The second provision is the non-availability of a warrant of a peace commissioner but it is the Garda officer who decides that it is not reasonably practicable to apply for a warrant; he decides there is too much trouble involved in seeking one.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, the garda has</P>
      <P>reasonable grounds for believing that, if the person is not promptly charged with the offence aforesaid, the person is likely to engage in further conduct whereby the commission of an offence involving a serious breach of the peace may occur.</P>
      <P>The point is that the officer is both judge and executioner.  Although successive British Governments sought to impose very rigorous legislation on the people of this country they never went as far as the Minister is going now. They always prevented a situation in which a limb of the law would be accorded rights which would appear, under examination, to be unreasonable. They always tried to have some independent person who would act semi-judicially in regard to the action of a constable in order to ensure that no wrong would be done but this protection is now being swept away in this subsection even though, as I say, it was never found necessary by British legislators, despite all the troubles of this country, to change the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy M. O'Higgins referred to the effects of this section if it is passed and it will not do any harm for me to emphasise an aspect of what he says which could be serious and is certainly <Col N="72" /> relevant.  It is the practice for us to be invited in this House, as, indeed, the Members of every Parliament are, to pass legislation proposed by a Minister. Very often the Minister proposing the legislation will tell us that the legislation is intended as a remedy to some exceptional and clear problem.  It has happened that legislation has gone through this House because people have been coaxed into doing so by reason of the fact that the Minister has told them that the legislation is intended only for a limited set of circumstances and an example is usually given to illustrate the particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposing the present legislation tells us that this section is designed to deal with a particular and exceptional kind of case and he instances an example of a row between two groups of fishermen when they proceeded to beat each other physically while out at sea.  They then retired to refresh themselves and then set out again and, of course, the Garda officer concerned, not having witnessed the breach of the peace but having reasonable grounds to believe it had taken place, had not the powers to arrest the men.  The Minister says that that is the kind of case he has in mind and he puts forward a reasonable proposal. I would have thought that if the Garda officer concerned had seen a militant team of fishermen having refreshed themselves and re-armed themselves proceeding to push their boats out to sea he would have known he was witnessing conduct likely to involve a breach of the peace and that, in fact, he would have arrested them.  Probably why it was not done was that there was only one garda on duty and it would have taken a team of gardaí to effect an arrest.  However, whatever the reason may have been we are concerned in this section&mdash;I am dealing with the Minister's amendment&mdash;with words which I may say are of general application.</P>
    <P>I want to indicate what is clearly covered by the Minister's amendment. The first condition is the satisfaction by the Garda officer himself that the person has committed an offence involving either a breach of the peace&mdash;<Col N="73" /> very well, assume that has not taken place&mdash;or committed an offence involving conduct that was likely to lead to a breach of the peace.  As Deputy M. O'Higgins pointed out that is conduct likely to lead to a breach of the peace.  By whom?  It is not necessarily by the person himself.  The words are sufficiently wide to cover the exercise by a person of his or her own legitimate rights, such exercise being opposed and obstructed by <i>mala fide</i> persons who want to prevent that exercise. We have many an example of it at the moment, currently and recently in part of our country.  People anxious in a democratic way to walk in an orderly and peaceful manner along the streets and the roads of Northern Ireland to proclaim a legitimate demand for the according of civil rights and exercising their legitimate right to do so may be opposed by another group, the Paisleyites, who <i>mala fide</i> with determination set out to prevent those people exercising their lawful rights.</P>
    <P>This may be improbable but it applies to the wording of this section. In those circumstances should such an event occur here within our present jurisdiction a Garda officer could well say that those people walking the roads to proclaim their demand for civil rights are engaging in conduct that is likely to lead to a breach of the peace, not by them but by those opposed to them, who wish to prevent them.  Under the Minister's amendment a Garda officer has merely to be satisfied about that.  There is no peace commissioner available.</P>
    <P>The third condition in this amendment is that &ldquo;he has reasonable grounds for believing that, if the person is not promptly charged with the offence aforesaid...&rdquo;  What is the offence?  The offence under this section is that the person was exercising his or her lawful rights but in the circumstances a breach of the peace could flow from it.  That is an offence. Secondly, if the person is not promptly charged with the offence he is likely to engage in further conduct.  In other words, the person is likely to continue to walk along in peaceful protest and, therefore, there would be a serious <Col N="74" /> breach of the peace and then that person is arrested.</P>
    <P>This is obviously wrong and unjust. It is obviously undemocratic and it is obviously suppression of the rights of the persons concerned.  If the Minister's amendment is passed some day in some circumstances some Garda officer under instructions possibly can arrest a person who is doing nothing more than lawfully expressing a point of view.  He can arrest that person merely because the State, the administration or the Establishment is not prepared to stand up to protect that person in the exercise of his or her rights.</P>
    <P>That is why we object to this general amendment.  We view it with suspicion. We see here a secret power being given to Garda officers which can lead to the negation of democracy and the abuse of people reasonably exercising their rights.  I would direct the Minister's attention as responsibly as I can to the general wording he uses in his amendment.  I would like him to indicate in what way my reasoning is wrong.  It is clear to me that the wording as it stands can cover conduct which, in fact, is no more than the legitimate exercise by a person of his rights.  The section comes into play if that conduct is likely to lead to an obstructive process by others which, in fact, is outside the law and a breach of the peace.  Therefore, this amended subsection is of general application and in my view is dangerous.</P>
    <P>May I end as I began?  What is the necessity for this?  Why is it now proposed so drastically to change the law of this country?  The Garda has been an exemplary force for the 50 years this parliament has been in existence and they are an example to many other police forces throughout the world, unarmed and disciplined.  By their presence, their action and conduct they have instilled in those who thought otherwise at one time a respect for the law of this land.  They have been able to do so without resorting to the use of force.  In the course of their so doing many loyal members fell, but the others carried on.  Having got over much difficulty and trouble in 50 years of our own rule a change is now proposed. <Col N="75" /> Why is it now necessary to change the law in this respect?  I believe this proposal has obviously been sponsored or sparked off by a limited experience in regard to a particular incident which the Minister mentioned. That is no crutch on which to base a proposal which can endanger the rights of legitimate protest in a democracy.</P>
    <P>We view this subsection as part and parcel of other proposals in other parts of this Bill.  It is part of the policy of this Bill which is aimed at fettering the ordinary safety valve of legitimate protest, preventing it and making it more difficult.  In that respect I should like to join with those who condemned this proposal, amended or unamended, as a dangerous one and one which should not be passed by this House.  I would urge upon the Minister to accept the proposal from Deputy M. O'Higgins to delete subsection (4).  I do not think it will endanger his Bill. Other proposals in the Bill are good ones and there are some there can be a debate about.  They can stand on their own feet, but the deletion of subsection (4) is not going to endanger this Bill.  Its retention can certainly cause a danger to the rights of the ordinary people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed by the contribution of Deputy T.F. O'Higgins. He certainly did not convince me of anything, and I very much doubt whether he even convinced himself. He went into a discussion on the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland and suggested that people engaging in similar activities under our jurisdiction would be liable to arrest without warrant simply because they were exercising their legitimate rights in the face of opposition. He tried to reason that their exercise of those legitimate rights would also be conduct likely to lead to a breach of the peace from those who were unfriendly to them.  If Deputy T.F. O'Higgins had taken the trouble as a lawyer to read sub-paragraph (a) he would have seen that what the Minister is suggesting in his amendment is that the garda must be satisfied that the person has committed an offence.  That is the first part.  The staging of a peaceful <Col N="76" /> demonstration is not and cannot be an offence in itself.</P>
      <P>The Minister suggests that the garda must be satisfied that the person has committed an offence involving either a breach of the peace or conduct that was likely to lead to a breach of the peace.  It is not a question of a Garda officer satisfying himself that the person had been guilty of conduct likely to lead to a breach of the peace by itself.  He has to satisfy himself an offence has been committed in the first place.  A civil rights march or a peaceful demonstration is not an offence.  We can entirely disregard all this high-sounding contribution of Deputy T.F. O'Higgins about the infringement of the rights of the individual or groups of individuals who stage peaceful demonstrations.  That does not come into this amendment or the subsection and if the Deputy does not know it he should make himself acquainted with it.</P>

He has stated categorically, as will be confirmed in the record of the opening part of his speech, that where a garda was satisfied that a person has committed an offence he has immediately a right of arrest without warrant.  It was only after I had made an interjection that the Deputy took the trouble to read the sub-paragraph, which made nonsense of his original argument.  The Deputy went on to say that the garda in this particular instance is the judge and executioner.  I would accept such a misleading statment without much surprise from a layman, but not from Deputy T.F. O'Higgins or any other practising lawyer because he knows in his heart of hearts that that is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda officer is not the final <Col N="77" /> authority.  He is the final authority in the initial stages as to whether an arrest shall take place or not but then he must come before the court and satisfy the court that the person whom he has arrested has committed an offence involving a breach of the peace or conduct likely to lead to a breach of the peace.  He has also to satisfy the court that it was not reasonably practicable to apply for a warrant.  The court will be very strict on that. Finally, he has to satisfy the court that he had reasonable grounds for believing that if the person was not promptly charged with the offence aforesaid the person was likely to engage in further conduct where the commission of an offence involving serious breach of the peace might occur.  Under no circumstances is a garda the judge and executioner in legal proceedings.  As I have said before last week, I have confidence in the court which I think, in his heart of hearts, Deputy T.F. O'Higgins has also. The defence of the individual is the impartiality of our courts of law, and the strict interpretation by those courts of the law as it stands is also his defence.  I cannot imagine any district justice, Circuit Court judge or High Court judge blandly assuming that a garda has acted in absolute good faith in arresting without a warrant.  Any occupant of the Bench would be at least as anxious as Deputy T.F. O'Higgins claims to be for the preservation of the rights of the individual. I believe that where the Garda officer must appear before the court and prove that he has acted reasonably throughout the whole incident he will be reluctant to exercise this power except in cases where there is no other alternative and where the peace cannot be preserved in any other way.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of pompous nonsense talked when discussing this subsection.  Deputy T.F. O'Higgins says that there has been no demand for this and asked why has nobody ever done it before.  We are always amending the law without there being demand for it.  No law is ever final.  No law is ever incapable of improvement. It do not believe this is an absolutely essential, necessary and vital part of this Bill but I believe it is highly desirable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> I cannot see any sinister, hidden motives behind it.  If we were to give power to the Garda to arrest and punish there might be something in it. There is no power of punishment. There is only a power of arrest under very, very strict conditions which must be satisfied before a court. I would ask members of the Opposition to treat this as seriously as Deputy James Tully has done.  I feel personally the introduction of some reference to 24 hours may be a slight improvement.  The Minister has suggested there may be something in Deputy James Tully's amendment.  I do not think it is necessary, but if it will help I should be happy with it.  I wish that members of the Fine Gael Party, in particular, would try to regard this as a serious effort to improve the law and that they would not try to use the Committee Stage of the Bill purely as a filibustering exercise to stave off the dissolution of the House.</P>

      <P>The purpose of Fine Gael is to try to make sure that the Bill will not go through.  Deputy Michael O'Higgins should make up his mind as to which side he is playing on. There has been no evidence to show that there is any sinister implication, even in the original sub-paragraph.  I do not think the Minister has made <Col N="79" /> anything more than a drafting amendment, a clarifying amendment.  The sub-paragraph now in the Bill clarifies the intention.  It discloses the intention more clearly and puts it beyond shadow of doubt that it is only in cases where a breach of the peace has occurred and where it is likely to recur, where somebody must act quickly and where a garda is prepared to say that in court, that such power will be exercised.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael lawyers should remember that if the garda cannot justify his arrest without warrant he is laying himself open to civil proceedings for unlawful imprisonment.  That will be in the garda's mind all the time and he will be darned careful not to exercise his power harshly or unreasonably at any time.  He must protect himself.  He will be acting under this sub-paragraph only where an emergency arises and where he knows in his heart of hearts that there is no alternative open to him to preserve the peace.</P>
      <P>I am completely behind the Minister in this amendment.  It is an improvement which might be improved still further by the inclusion of &ldquo;24 hours&rdquo;, not because it would make a better sub-paragraph but because it would clarify in the minds of the public some of the matters over which a cloud of suspicion and misapprehension has been cast by people who should know better.</P>

      <P>The last speaker forgot himself sufficiently to describe the contribution of Deputy O'Higgins as pompous nonsense.  I would not describe the contribution of Deputy Booth as pompous nonsense but as utter and absolute nonsense.  He accused Deputy O'Higgins of not having read the section.  I do not accuse Deputy Booth of not having read it. He read it and proceeded to misinterpret it and to express views based on the opening words of paragraph (6) (a) &mdash;that the garda is satisfied that the person is committing an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course there has to be satisfaction in respect of the committing of an offence but what is even clearer is that the person who is satisfied is the garda himself, not the courts.  Deputy Booth <Col N="80" /> completely misled himself in trying to mislead the House when he said that the great safeguard of citizens' liberties is the independence of the courts.  I beg leave to differ.  The greatest safeguard is this House, not the courts. The courts are charged with the duty of interpreting the law and here we decide the policy which dictates any enactment and here we are considering whether the policy behind this section is justifiable&mdash;whether it is an unreasonable and undue encroachment on the rights of the citizen.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth said that here there is no power of punishment, only a power of arrest.  Is there anything more undignified to the mind of an ordinary citizen who believes himself to be innocent than that he should be manhandled by a garda and thrown into a cell?  The Minister in his arguments, some of which were not powerful or cogent, underlined what I am saying. He insisted, by interruption as well as by statement, that power of arrest involved subsequently the coming to court.  It involves nothing of the sort. Many a man has been arrested, put into a cell and thrown out during the night by a garda who knew he had no evidence on which he could get a conviction.  The power of arrest stands by itself, therefore.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Higgins, and I come within the diatribe of Deputy Booth because I have been practising for some 53 years.  What Deputy O'Higgins has said agrees with what I have said on the interpretation which must be put on this section and which lays the duty on this House and on every Memeber of it, particularly on the Minister, to consider whether this section is not in contravention of the Constitution.  In the Constitution we have the guarantee of the rights of free assembly and free speech.  If it is not guaranteed expressly in the Constitution, the guarantee of the right from arrest is the citizen's most prized right.</P>
    <P>If the situation is that power of determining whether the person is to be arrested in the circumstances set forth in this section lies within the satisfaction of the garda, then it is wide open for consideration that citizen's rights under the Constitution are being infringed.  The right of a judicial <Col N="81" /> decision is based on the courts, not the Garda Síochána, and I think it is incumbent on all Deputies to determine and to decide for themselves as a matter of policy, whether we are not infringing the rights of citizens in giving power in this Bill to an ordinary garda to say: &ldquo;I am satisfied an offence was about to be committed and therefore I am arresting you&rdquo;.  That cannot be tested in court.  All the garda has to say is: &ldquo;I was satisfied an offence was about to be committed&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>No amount of interruption by Deputy Booth will get over the words expressed in this section. Once the garda is satisfied, he cannot be questioned and once the garda says he was satisfied, he cannot be cross-examined on the basis of his satisfaction, on the grounds of his satisfaction and no evidence of the accused can make the court inquire into that matter.</P>
      <P>I directed the Minister's attention&mdash; he said he would look into it&mdash;to the case of a man who was hanged because we put into the legislation the words &ldquo;he is satisfied&rdquo;.  That is what we have to consider.  The words are &ldquo;is satisfied that an offence is being committed&rdquo;. The garda must be satisfied that it is being committed, but he is the only person to say it.  He is, as Deputy O'Higgins said, judge and jury.  That is what Deputy Booth did not appreciate and did not know until I drew his attention to it.  If we pass this Bill, all a garda has to say is &ldquo;I was satisfied....&rdquo; He cannot be asked on what grounds he was satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>If the garda says he is satisfied, that ends the matter so far as his power of arrest is concerned. If, as Deputy Booth has suggested is possible, an action for false arrest is taken, that is the absolute answer that will be put forward by counsel on behalf of the garda&mdash;that the garda was satisfied&mdash;and under section 12 of this Bill that is the end of the matter.  That is a consideration <Col N="82" /> of paramount importance, and no amount of casual interruption by Deputy Booth will prevent me from making this case.  He has specialised in silly interruptions, and I want to make it perfectly clear that the contentions I am putting forward can be answered by him, if he likes, on his feet.</P>
      <P>I am giving my view on this section. I am making the suggestion to this assembly here, which has the duty, in accordance with what has been decided by the Supreme Court, to consider whether the Constitution is or is not being contravened.  You will find, if you look at some of the decisions of the Supreme Court on constitutional matters, they have laid down that anybody who alleges that an Act of this Dáil contravenes or is repugnant to any provision of the Constitution bears the onus of proving that himself.</P>
      <P>The onus is on him to prove it, because they assume that the Legislature, when dealing with the enactment, considered carefully the question of whether it was constitutional or not. We all know here what happens, just what is happening to me now.  Ministers and their back-benchers will throw their Order Papers at you and scoff if you raise a point about the Constitution.</P>
      <P>That is the law anyway and I am directing the Minister's attention and the attention of the House to their very serious duty to say whether or not if, as Deputy O'Higgins has argued and cogently argued, the position is that all a man is doing is exercising his legal, constitutional rights of free assembly or free speech and a garda has the power that we propose to give him now of saying: &ldquo;Although you are only exercising your rights under the Constitution I, a garda, am satisfied...and consequently I am arresting you&rdquo;. Whether that is constitutional or not is gravely open to doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having drawn the attention of the House to those matters I want to reiterate something which has in fact been amplified by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins this afternoon.  When I spoke here last Wednesday I drew the attention of the House to the fact that, so far as I could find out from the speeches of the <Col N="83" /> Minister, the pamphlet he sent out at public expense or any of the White Papers he has nowhere stated and certainly has not proved to my satisfaction that these powers are necessary to be given to the gardaí if they are to carry out their duties of preserving public peace.  No case has been made that these powers are necessary and that the gardaí have been unable to discharge their duties of keeping public order without them.  But there is this case and I want to repeat it again: the gardaí were able to carry on and have been able to carry on in this country even in spite of some very serious demonstrations and other tumultuous, riotous assemblies that have occurred in recent years.  They have been able within their powers to maintain the peace and they have not had to have resort to arbitrary powers of arrest.  It has not been stated that they were not able to do their duty because of the absence of these powers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not want these powers of arrest at all.  I want to say that the experience in this part of the country is that arrest has never been a deterrent to any action by demonstrators or people who wished to make their views known or to bring pressure to bear on public affairs by demonstrations, processions or anything else.  Arrest has never been a deterrent in the north in spite of the explosive situation that exists up there.  There have been arrests and it has never deterred people.  In France, where there were frightful riots last year, they have the power of arrest and even the power of shooting.  It does not prevent demonstrations where people feel keenly on something and wish to express themselves and bring pressure to bear on public opinion.  The power of arrest, therefore, is not necessary to be given in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I want to reiterate that there is no doubt whatever that one of the matters that are gravely affecting public opinion and causing widespread disquiet is the provisions of this Bill.  One of the main objections that the public in general have to this Bill is the arbitrary <Col N="84" /> powers of arrest, the additional powers of arrest, that are being given. The Minister may say he does not care for the Civil Liberties Association or any of those who have come together to maintain or preserve what they call civil rights.  He may maintain that they are of no consequence.  He may think that the particular association which proposes to hold a public meeting in the Mansion House to protest against the provisions of this Bill is a group of people who are to be treated with contempt, whose views are not to be regarded with anything except ridicule and even the basest motives are to be attributed to them for their views on this.  I would urge upon the Minister that those people are not individuals with chips on their shoulders or grievances or people who are going out with any axe to grind for the purpose of putting out the present Government or in any way to deal with the matter from a political point of view.  They do, in my considered opinion, represent the general view that is held in the country by people who not merely do not take part in politics but take a pride in that fact&mdash;the ordinary people who go about their business, not caring very much.  They are very seriously perturbed by the provisions of this Bill and the powers that are being taken.</P>
    <P>I urged on the Minister on the last occasion, I again urge on him and I will urge on him again before the Bill is finished, to take cognisance of that public opinion, not to be an engine running away without a train, not to go too far in advance of public opinion, to take account of the fact that the opinions we on this side of the House, both Labour and Fine Gael, are voicing, are opinions that are widespread in all sections of the community.  It is our duty in this House to take account of this.  It is incumbent on us and on the Government and Minister to take full account of that fact because we are the people who are making the policy, we are the people who are doing this and are putting this Bill into law, if we do so.  We are the people who must take account of public opinion, particularly if we find, as I think we will, from an examination of this section, from the facts and from all the Minister's speeches and documents that <Col N="85" /> there is no demand for this from the Garda.  There is no reason why the Garda cannot get on without it as they have done before, by handling groups with discretion and tact.  If we proceed with giving the Garda the additional powers that are sought in this Bill, even if they were logically, apart from factually, desirable, we are going a long way towards making the public disregard the Garda, we are going to bring the Garda into disrepute, to take away public confidence in them by reason of the fact that the people will not trust them and will be afraid of them.  That would be a bad day's work for this House to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear to the Minister that I have no apology, good, bad or indifferent, to make to him or to the Government for the remarks I made with regard to this Bill.  I want to repeat again that I speak for my Party, and, so far as we are concerned, we are not prepared to make any concessions to the Minister or the Government with regard to what we consider to be objectionable sections and provisions in the Bill.  I feel quite justified in doing what I can in this House to ensure that those objectionable provisions will not be passed by this House until the people have an opportunity of expressing their views on them.</P>
      <P>The Minister may regard this as filibustering if he likes.  That is my view and I believe that in doing that I am discharging a duty which rests on me as an elected public representative in this House.  I do not believe the Minister and the Government realise the extent to which they have inflamed public opinion by certain of the provisions in this Bill.  If they took time off to consider the feelings they have aroused by certain of these provisions they would feel as we do, that the only way to deal with them is to drop them completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In case the Minister spoke about my previous appeal that serious consideration should be given to some sections of the Bill and felt there was something in conflict with what I said about opposing this Bill, there is no conflict so far as I am concerned.  This Bill must get serious consideration from <Col N="86" /> the House.  As I said before, there are worthwhile provisions in it.  I do not want to continue in a general vein, but the Minister and the House may like to know that, so far as my Party are concerned, we have already decided that many of its provisions are not matters of Party controversy, but are matters which can be dealt with by a free vote of the House.  There are other provisions&mdash;and this is one of them&mdash; which we regard as objectionable and as inflaming public opinion to a degree which is altogether unnecessary, and unnecessary particularly for the reasons which have been set out by Deputy John A. Costello and other speakers this afternoon.</P>
    <P>Up to this the Garda authorities have been able to get along, and keep the peace effectively, and preserve law and order without these new powers of arrest without warrant which the Minister now seeks to give them under section 12.  Let us be quite clear about this.  These are new powers.  They are powers which the Garda have not had up to this.  I should like to know, as Deputy Costello inquired, has there been any demand from the Garda even, for these new powers of arrest without warrant which are contained in this section, and in the subsection we are discussing?  Certainly there has been no demand from the public that these powers should be given to the Garda, that we should alter our law and extend the power of arrest without warrant as suggested here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth said he did not believe this was a necessary or a vital part of the Bill.  He went on, I think, to say he thought it was desirable.  Let us ponder for a moment on those words of Deputy Booth, that he did not believe this was a necessary or a vital part of the Bill.  I accept that it is not a necessary or a vital part of the Bill.  The remedy I have suggested to the Minister is to delete this provision from the Bill. In the atmosphere which surrounds this Bill, when people and organisations all over the country are up in arms against it, surely if a provision such as this is not regarded as vital or necessary, the sensible thing for the Minister to do is to drop it from the Bill?</P>
    <P>If the Minister regards it as necessary <Col N="87" /> or vital, let him get up and tell the House why he considers it to be either vital or necessary.  If the Minister is armed with a demand from the Garda authorities that their hand should be strengthened by these new powers of arrest without warrant, let him stand up here and tell the House that, and tell the House the reasons why such a request has been made by the Garda, if it has been made.  If he does not want to fall back on that, let him stand up and argue why these powers are necessary.</P>
    <P>There is only one Deputy in the Fianna Fáil benches whom I know to be on record as arguing that these powers are necessary, and that is Deputy MacEntee.  According to a report in the <i>Irish Times</i> of 15th March he had a lot to say about this Bill.  We have heard the discussion here this afternoon on the reasons why this provision is suggested.  It might be worth while for Deputies to consider the reasons for this Bill, as seen through the eyes of Deputy MacEntee.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee addressed a Fianna Fáil meeting of the Dublin south-east constituency in the Grosvenor Hotel.  The entire quotation might be a little bit lengthy so I will spare the Minister that.  Deputy MacEntee is reported as saying:</P>
      <P>Ours was a true democracy, in which the Government derived its authority from the directly elected representatives of the people, elected on a franchise which gave every adult elector the same weight, the same influence as every other.</P>
      <P>It would not matter whether a mob were composed of students, of farmers, of industrialists or ambiguous social reformers, or be led by clerics or laymen, the issue would be the same; the mob should not be allowed to dictate policy to the Government, the mob must not be allowed to rule.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether or not the mob was to rule would be resolved by the decision which the Oireachtas would take on the Criminal Justice Bill that was now before it.  The root issue involved in the measure was clear-cut: Is the community to be ruled, is public policy to be shaped and determined by mobs in the street, or, on the other hand, is right and <Col N="89" /> authority in all such grave matters to continue to be vested in the Oireachtas and, as heretofore, to be exercised only by the Government which, under the Constitution, is responsible to Dáil Éireann?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does he see such a threat to the authority of this House as would warrant giving the Garda authorities power to arrest people without warrant?  I have argued on this section already and particularly on the subsection as worded in the Bill, and I think the only way to deal with this subsection is to take it out of the Bill completely.</P>
      <P>Here we have a provision where a member of the Garda may arrest a person without warrant where he is satisfied&mdash;and Deputy John A. Costello has already dealt very fully with the meaning of this phrase&mdash;that a person has committed an offence involving a breach of the peace or has engaged in conduct that was likely to lead to the commission of such an offence.  I think I have demonstrated, even to the satisfaction of the Minister, that under the provision which is proposed in subsection (4) of section 12 we may have in this country, if that were allowed to become law, a system of protective or preventive custody, and is there any more effective way of squelching opposition to Government proposals than to operate a system of protective or preventive custody? Deputy MacEntee continues with his expression of views on this Bill, and here he has gone further than the Minister. It is relevant in relation to this section and to the previous remarks I made on this section to call the Minister's attention to Deputy MacEntee's remarks in regard to the NFA.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nor should it be overlooked in relation to all this that the tide of lawlessness was set in motion by <Col N="90" /> men of property.  When the big landowners, the big farmers organised in the NFA, set themselves to defy the law by blocking the roads of Ireland and to cow and intimidate the Government and the Oireachtas by blockading Government Buildings and Leinster House, they blazed the trail for the forces of subversion that are now active in this country.</P>
    <P>Surely that is a kind of situation the Minister will argue can be dealt with by this section?  When we had, as we did have some time ago, Government speakers referring to intimidation by the NFA and when we have the same phrase used here by Deputy MacEntee in a quotation which I have given, when he referred to the NFA setting themselves to defy the law by blocking the roads of Ireland, surely if the Minister has any argument it is to say that that is the kind of thing he wants to enable the Garda to deal with by giving them the power of arrest without warrant.  I do not think that is good enough.  The laws that are there at the moment are adequate to deal with that situation.  I do not want to be diverted into a discussion on the events which led to the blockading of the roads to which Deputy MacEntee refers and consequently I pass on to another portion of his speech where he says:</P>
    <P>Recent experience had shown that the law must be strengthened.  That was why the Government had found it necessary to introduce certain provisions in the Criminal Justice Bill, now before the Dáil....</P>
    <P>Again, I want to ask the Minister is this one of the sections which there has been any demand for strengthening from anyone other than possibly Deputy MacEntee?  Is this one of the aspects in relation to which the law must be strengthened?  Why does he come to the House seeking to have these new powers of arrest without warrant vested in the Garda?  Deputy MacEntee goes on.  I had better read it in context:</P>
    <P>Recent experience had shown that the law must be strengthened.  That was why the Government had found it necessary to introduce certain provisions <Col N="91" /> in the Criminal Justice Bill, now before the Dáil, to deal specifically with the menace which widespread and organised disorder in the streets or elsewhere constituted to the State and all law-abiding citizens.</P>
    <P>Some worthy individuals had taken the view that the measures proposed were unduly restrictive. But the persons concerned had never had to carry responsibility for the maintenance of public order; they had never known how inadequate were the powers of Government in regard to it.</P>
    <P>Is that the justification the Minister will give this House for this extension of the right of the Garda to arrest without warrant, that the people had never known how inadequate were the powers of the Government in regard to the maintenance of public order?  I do not want to embarrass the Minister further, and I shall conclude with what Deputy MacEntee has to say in the last paragraph of this report:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I trust,&rdquo; concluded Mr. MacEntee, &ldquo;that the Government will press on with the Criminal Justice Bill.  The people want it: for they are weary of disorder.  And if the Opposition parties in Dáil Éireann have any doubt about that, let the Government take the issue to the country and they will come back triumphantly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is exactly the invitation I have extended to the Minister here this afternoon: Take this issue to the country. Do not try to force it through the House at a time when everyone knows there is going to be a general election. What is the hurry about it?  We have done for 100 years or more&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am dealing with them specifically.  We have done for 100 years or more in this country without these powers of arrest without warrant.  Let me emphasise that these are new powers, that this is not a case <Col N="92" /> where the Minister can stand up and say: &ldquo;We are really only putting into this section what is there already.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  I said the Minister cannot say of this that it is simply something that is there already and that it is merely appearing now in some new form or some new set of words.  As he has pointed out, the Minister has not said that because this is a new power and, because it is a new power, we want to know why does the Minister think it is necessary? Deputy Booth said that it is neither a necessary nor a vital part of the Bill. Does the Minister think it is a necessary or a vital part of the Bill?  If he does not, if he agrees with Deputy Booth, surely the sensible thing to do is not to go on with it remembering the way it has already inflamed public opinion and aroused fears amongst ordinary people?  The Minister has pointed out that the Garda power of arrest in relation to a breach of the peace at the moment is that the garda must see the breach of the peace being committed.  It must take place within his view.  I think&mdash;I am subject to correction in this&mdash;that there is a further limitation even under the present law: not only must the breach, or the conduct, if it is a question of conduct likely to lead to a breach of the peace, take place in the view of the garda concerned but there must be no other way in which the garda concerned can prevent that breach of the peace.  If those conditions are fulfilled&mdash;if the breach takes place in his view and there is no other way in which he can prevent that breach &mdash; then, at the moment, he has the power of arrest without warrant.  That is now being altered.  It is being extended in a very dramatic manner under the provisions proposed in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="93" /> The Explanatory Memorandum to which the Minister referred a moment ago shows the mind of the Government in relation to this.  In paragraph 44 we find the kind of situation envisaged by the Minister in relation to the operation of this section.  I ask the House to consider seriously if the kind of situation the Minister envisages in the Explanatory Memorandum is the kind of situation where vast powers of arrest without warrant should be given by this House to the Garda authorities. It is recited in paragraph 44 of the Explanatory Memorandum that this &ldquo;relates to a situation where there is, at the time, no breach of the peace...&rdquo;.  That is the first thing; at the time there is no breach of the peace &ldquo;but where there has been one&rdquo;&mdash;that is, has been one some time in the past; one of the biggest flaws in this particular subsection is that there is no limitation at all, even under the Minister's amendment, as to how far back in the past the breach of the peace may have been committed&mdash;&ldquo;but where there has been one (or a threat of one) and there is a probability that there will be a further, and serious, one.  The situation envisaged is one where it was known that persons who had already been involved in a fight or a scuffle would be likely to come across each other again at some particular time, or place, in the near future and to renew the fight on a serious scale.&rdquo; Here we have a situation in which the Minister envisages that a fight or scuffle has taken place and that it may be renewed on a serious scale.  It has taken place some time in the past; under the section as it stood, when it took place did not matter.  That position remains unaltered under the amendment proposed by the Minister. You have there the situation where, at some time in the dim and distant past, there has been a breach of the peace, or conduct likely to lead to a breach of the peace, to put it in the language that is ordinarily used&mdash;a threat of one is the phrase used in the Explanatory Memorandum&mdash;and a garda then, because he is satisfied that that has taken place and because he has reasonable grounds for believing there will be a further collision between certain people and a warrant cannot be <Col N="94" /> obtained, can go in and arrest without warrant.</P>
    <P>It is specifically set out in the Explanatory Memorandum that at the moment a warrant is necessary.  We all know that and we have got on very well under that situation.  As has been mentioned here, it is very easy for the Minister to apply the section to a particular set of circumstances and to say that, in those particular circumstances, it is only reasonable that these powers should be given.  It may be reasonable in one particular set of circumstances to get powers such as these, but it may be quite unreasonable to have these powers there available to be exercised in a host of other circumstances. Remember&mdash;I have pointed this out on more than one occasion here&mdash;we should be concerned now, and the country will be concerned in the future, not with expressions of opinion by the Minister or any other Deputy here but with what goes into this Bill and, if we include powers capable of being exercised by the Garda covering a host of cases and circumstances in which, so far as the Minister and the House are concerned, it was never intended they should be exercised, then the Garda authorities are quite entitled to use them and the fact that someone comes along and says that the Minister never intended they should be used in that way simply does not matter. As the subsection is worded, what I have stated could happen.  It may be debatable whether the Minister's amendment No. 6 remedies that situation. It has been argued, and argued convincingly, that it does not alter it and that the same kind of danger can exist.</P>
    <P>We must also consider in relation to this particular matter the fact that, if we allow the Garda power to arrest without warrant, then the arrest made by a garda on foot of these powers will be lawful; the garda will be lawfully arresting the individual concerned.  In section 14 of the Bill, we are also conferring on the Garda power of searching&mdash;clearing up, apparently, a doubt: I think the words in the Explanatory Memorandum are &ldquo;as a matter of course&rdquo;.  The point I want to make here is that not only does this section deal with the power of arrest but, in <Col N="95" /> fact, it goes on and, once the arrest becomes lawful, other things follow from it including the power of searching without warrant.  So, here we have a subsection which, in effect, conferring a power of arrest without warrant and then a power of searching the arrested person without warrant.  It is a very serious subsection and the only way to deal with it is to get rid of it entirely.</P>

      <P>It is amusing to listen to Deputy O'Higgins's talk about going to the country, running to the country, to seek the judgment of the people of the country on this Bill when every one of his Front Bench colleagues are runing like scalded cats from the country trying to find a political peg on which to hang their hats in this city.  I am used to those whistlings past the graveyard by the Fine Gael speakers before elections for the past 30 years and I think the results will be the same this time.  What I am quite sure is quite apparent to Deputy O'Higgins is that he has been wasting the time of the House for three-quarters of an hour on this filibuster which is utterly irrelevant to the amendments we are discussing now.  Section 12 (4) has nothing, good, bad or indifferent, to do with demonstrations of any kind.  The plain fact is that there are official amendments, not yet reached, which make it perfectly clear that there are to be no powers of arrest in relation to the organisation or holding of meetings, demonstrations or processions.  When we come to look at these sections, 30 and 31, the new sections, this will be quite clear.  I know quite well that Deputy O'Higgins is well aware of that fact but it suits his purpose to shout: &ldquo;Wolf, would&rdquo; and particularly it suits his announced purpose, and that of his Party, of holding up the progress of this Bill.  Little cares he about the man with the flick-knife little cares he for the man with the bicycle chain.  His only interest is a narrow political one&mdash;the hope that he can raise doubts in the minds of certain people outside this House and use them as political footballs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad that Deputy J.A. Costello referred to this meeting that is to be held this week in the Mansion <Col N="96" /> House by an association calling themselves The Citizens for Civil Liberties. Deputy Costello stated that this Civil Liberties Association are not people with chips on their shoulders and that they should seriously be listened to and that we should pay every attention to what they say.  But according to the posters they have issued&mdash;I am referring to the Citizens for Civil Liberties meeting in the Mansion House which Deputy Costello mentioned&mdash;this organisation, Citizens for Civil Liberties, is a non-political, non-sectarian organisation. I want here and now to nail that canard because, as admitted in a recent circular issued by Sinn Féin to all its branches, the organisation Citizens for Civil Liberties was launched at a meeting held between the members of the Ard-Chomhairle of Sinn Féin, the Wolfe Tone Society and other interested people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Of course, the organisation include some people not members of Sinn Féin.  They took care that it would.  That, in fact, is the whole purpose of &ldquo;front&rdquo; organisations&mdash;to rope in a few outsiders and give the impression that the organisation is a completely separate one.  The fact remains, on their own admission, that this organisation was, in fact, fathered by Sinn Féin.  Some other points from the same circular are of interest.  For instance, and I quote&mdash;this is from the Sinn Féin circular&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>You are instructed to organise public opposition to the Criminal Justice Bill in your area.  Public after-Mass meetings should be organised and, if possible, speakers from other organisations should be invited to address these meetings.</P>
      <P>Here, again, we see the tactic of using outsiders to front for Sinn Féin.  We find it again:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Organise your members to paint slogans &ldquo;Oppose Criminal Justice <Col N="97" /> Bill&rdquo; on the roads around your area. Members who are in other organisations should organise resolutions to be passed at their meetings.</P>
    <P>Good sound infiltration tactics&mdash;use these other organisations as propaganda tools.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that two of the speakers listed are Father Austin Flannery, O.P., Prior of Saint Saviour's, and the Reverend T. P. McCaughey, Lecturer in Trinity College, Dublin.  The two were amongst the original four signatories of a circular about this Bill which did the rounds last summer in Dublin.  This letter began with four signatories.  It was then circulated to numerous people prominent in various walks of life&mdash; the professions, the theatre, and so on. It was sent with a covering letter inviting all of these to sign.  The persons approached in this way were not asked to read the Bill or the explanatory memorandum in connection with it but they were given this circular, with its statements on a Bill, some of them false and others obviously tendentious.</P>
    <P>The circular, signed by about 40 people, was eventually released for publication&mdash;as you might guess, on the week-end before the referendum.  It contained the &ldquo;howler&rdquo; about section 32 of the Bill which relates to watching and besetting&mdash;they said it abolished the right to make peaceful protests, including, for example, a protest march to a foreign embassy.  That section in fact has nothing to do with protests and is no more than a re-enactment, practically word for word, of portion of section 7 of the Conspiracy and protection of property Act, 1875.</P>
    <P>I am saying this as a result of the reference by Deputy J.A. Costello to this meeting and asking me to take serious consideration of these alleged non-political people.  In view of these instructions sent out by the headquarters of Sinn Féin to organise people, to use them as fronts, I leave any impartial person to judge how non-political these people are.  If some other speakers are foolish enough to allow themselves to be manipulated by these subversive gentlemen for their own ends, that is their affair.  However, let the public take clear notice of how <Col N="98" /> this is operating and what is being done by alleged upholders of civil rights, many of whom have, as their sole object to disrupt democracy as we know it in this State.</P>
    <P>Having said so much in reply to what Deputy Costello had said here in connection with these meetings, and the attention that should be paid to these organisations, let me get on to this idea about the powers of arrest that already exist and the proposition that one must always assume, apparently, according to some interpretations here, that a garda is liable to act <i>mala fide</i> instead of <i>bona fide.</i>  It is both amusing for its illogicality to hear tributes being paid about gardaí in this House and what great men they are and at the same time to hear the same Deputies suggesting they are such thugs that they will utterly abuse the power the House is giving them here to try to stop rows developing.  Two important things should be held in mind. The first is that power of arrest cannot be exercised except where the Garda are in a position to follow up an arrest by charging the man concerned with a specific offence.</P>
    <P>The last day, and, indeed, today, to my amazement Deputy Costello&mdash;I know that his field is not criminal law&mdash;reiterated this untruth, or perhaps, that is not the appropriate word, reiterated this misconception of the law which some other Deputies have, that this was only the practice, to follow up an arrest with a charge.  It is not only the practise, it is the law.  Let me reiterate that when there is an arrest, the man concerned can insist that there must be a charge.  That is the law as it stands and it is fundamental and basic to the priciples of our whole concept of the criminal law.  Of course, as I said the last day there can be release with the man's consent.  Let us understand this basic principle because all this loose talk about preventive custody and about locking the people up without a charge is, legally speaking all boloney.  If there is an arrest there must be a charge.  If there is an arrest without a charge, the other side of the coin is that the man arrested has a case for damages for false arrest and false imprisonment.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of stealing a penny and if he must be trusted by the public and the community not to exercise <Col N="100" /> that colossal power arbitrarily&mdash;that he must reasonably believe the man has already stolen the penny&mdash;then what is the difference between trusting a garda to exercise this very wide power which he has under the law as it stands and trusting him to exercise, within the prescribed limits, the power we propose to give him under this amendment?  Remember, under the section, in order to arrest without a warrant there must be an offence committed which involves either a breach of the peace or conduct liable to lead to a breach of the peace.  In addition to that, it must not be reasonably practicable to apply for a warrant and thirdly he must have reasonable grounds for believing that if the person is not promptly charged he is likely to enagage in further conduct whereby the commission of an offence involving a serious breach of the peace may occur.  Why should the House assume or why should any Deputy argue, that the same police officer who under existing law can get you by the back of the neck and walk you into the station without a warrant, on suspicion of stealing a penny would act madly and run somebody in without having done any of these things?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say that Deputy Costello or any other Deputy is wrong to use the expression that the garda is judge and jury.  Of course, he is not.  He must keep within the limitations of this section.  Where this section says that if he is satisfied that the person has committed an offence involving a breach of the peace then he must have the facts on which to be satisfied.  This is a question of fact.  The garda must be satisfied that this man has already committed this offence and it simply will not do for him to come into court and say that he believed he had committed the offence.  There must have been reasonable grounds to show that it had been committed or that the conduct was there which would mean that it was about to be committed and he must also show to the court that he did not have a chance of getting a warrant. Thirdly, he must have reasonable grounds for believing that if the person is not promptly charged with the offence it is likely that he will engage in further conduct whereby a commission <Col N="101" /> of an offence involving a serious breach of the peace may occur.</P>
    <P>Let us come down from outer space to realities.  If any garda does not comply, in making his arrest without a warrant, with all the conditions set out here, then he is wide open to an action for damages for false arrest and false imprisonment.  The Deputies opposite know this well but they still want to pretend that this is some extraordinary power.  One would think that the powers of arrest without warrant were something that were very, very rare and very unusual.  When we talk about this very limited power, this very circumscribed power, in comparison with the power of arrest without warrant already there, it shows how ludicrous is the picture being painted by the Fine Gael Party in regard to the extraordinary things that could happen under this section.</P>
    <P>I gave only one example&mdash;that of the fishermen&mdash;on the need for the amendment but I could give several others.  Remember that this is a question of stopping possible serious injury, possible serious head splitting, possible serious spilling of blood, where a row starts in one place and the gardaí know that it is quite likely that the people involved are going to gather in a couple of hours at another venue and that because of the viciousness of the spleen the same thing is liable to be continued there and already, as I said, one offence has been committed.  It is in these limited circumstances, and again where they would not have time to get a warrant, that they may arrest.</P>
    <P>I will not waste much more time on what might be called the time gap in this section.  As I indicated to Deputy Tully, although I believe in restricting it rather than widening it, I would not greatly object if the 24-hour period is written into the Bill.  In other words, if the 24 hours had passed since the commission of the first offence, the garda would have to get a warrant.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear what the law is at the moment.  I think Deputy T.F. O'Higgins repeated virtually everything Deputy M.J. O'Higgins said about this section.  Some Deputy asked me was this section a vital part of the Bill.  It is not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certainly not prepared to withdraw it.  It is a minor provision but I am not prepared to allow people to get away with the kind of misrepresentation that we have heard.  If there is any unease among any section of the public the reason is that there has been a deliberate, calculated attempt to deceive the public, an attempt in which Deputy O'Higgins joined today.  I shall not allow them or him to take advantage of it.  They asked me why this provision is here. It is here because the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána advised me that it is required for the purpose of preserving order and preventing a continuation of fighting or violence in the circumstances I have described.  It is new because the Garda say they need it in those circumstances.  It is an utter misrepresentation to say that it is intended to have anything to do with demonstrations of any kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not weary the House by repeating all the conditions and the fact that an offence must first have been committed before it can operate and, secondly and vitally, that it is not possible or the garda does not have time to get a warrant, because of the situation with which he is faced.  I think Deputy T.F. O'Higgins is completely off the ball when he talks about getting a warrant entailing going before an independent party; surely the vital thing about warrants is that the garda must swear an information and on the basis that he swears it, he can expect to get his warrant.  The big difference is that in an arrest without a warrant the garda acts on whatever information he has whereas in an arrest with a warrant he must swear on oath to the <Col N="103" /> information he has as a reason for needing the warrant.  That is the difference. The garda swears the information, gets the warrant and makes the arrest under it and&mdash;let me repeat for the benefit of Deputy O'Higgins&mdash;once the arrest is made a charge must follow for, if not, the arresting officer faces the consequences.  I think that I have covered thoroughly any reasoned argument or any real point that has been made about this section and the amendments.  I certainly do not want to aid Deputy O'Higgins in his filibuster by wasting the time of the House.</P>

      <P>The Minister was kind enough to refer to my presence here.  I suppose he intended that to be a deprecating reference.  I should like to remind him that I took part in the Second Reading debate on the Bill. I am here today and intend to remain here throughout the Committee Stage, whether that will please the Minister or not.  Unfortunately, I was engaged in a murder case for the past fortnight. Otherwise, I should have been very glad to have taken part in the earlier discussions.  But, I am fortified by the very warm and sincere welcome I have received from the Minister now that I am here.  I shall continue to be here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the position is that when a person is arrested he must be charged or otherwise the arresting officer faces the consequences. This is part of the bureaucratic rubbish that is doled out here by Ministers occasionally when they want to deceive this House into giving them powers. The question in the courts is whether an arrest is lawful or not.  Under our present law generally speaking, with some exceptions which I shall come to, an arrest is not lawful if in fact it is not followed by a charge.  That refers to the pretty wide powers of arrest which exist at present entitling a garda officer to arrest a person on reasonable suspicion that he has committed a felony, that he has wounded somebody or that he has committed treason.  &ldquo;On reasonable suspicion&rdquo;&mdash;that is what the law now is.  The Minister says: &ldquo;Is it known that a garda officer may <Col N="104" /> arrest a person because he stole a penny?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was a time in the law of this country when a person who stole a penny could have been hanged and often people were executed because, out of starvation, they had stolen a loaf.  That is because the commission of any felony was a capital offence and stealing is a felony.  It continues to be a felony up to the passage of this Bill and the Minister blandly says: &ldquo;Do you know that a garda officer may arrest somebody for stealing a penny?&rdquo;  He was saying that to deceive people who are not as much alive to the niceties of the law as Deputy Booth is.  The fact is that the power of arrest today&mdash;to arrest on the basis of reasonable suspicion of having committed a felony&mdash;is lawful provided a court is satisfied that there was reasonable suspicion and the certain proof that there was no reasonable suspicion is if there is no charge.  So, if a garda today arrests somebody and brings him to a garda station, throws him in a cell and lets him out the following morning, of course that arresting officer will face the consequences because it is proof positive that he had no reasonable suspicion that a felony had been committed.</P>
    <P>Let us look at this section.  The Minister has been less than straightforward with the House.  Here, it is not a question of reasonable suspicion. Here, we are asked to give a garda officer the power of arrest without warrant if he is satisfied&mdash;the garda officer&mdash;that a person has engaged in conduct likely to lead to the commission of a breach of the peace.</P>

      <P>For the benefit of the Chair and in view of the interruptions I shall read what is there:</P>
      <P>A member of the Garda Síochána may arrest a person without warrant where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  he is satisfied that the person has committed an offence involving a breach of the peace or has engaged in conduct that was likely to lead to the commission of such an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is one or the other.  Does Deputy Booth understand that?  There are two alternatives, one is that an offence has been committed and the other is the engaging in conduct likely to lead to the commission of an offence.  In relation to the second alternative, no offence has been committed but there is conduct likely to lead to the commission of an offence.  By whom?  Not by the person who is to be arrested but <Col N="106" /> by anyone; by an officer opposed to the person.  That is the proposal in the subsection.  All that is necessary is that the Garda officer is satisfied that the person has engaged in conduct likely to end in the commission of an offence perhaps by somebody else. There is no requirement that a Garda officer must have a reasonable suspicion. He grabs the person, puts him into a cell and releases him the following morning without having charged him at all.  I should like the Minister to tell me in those circumstances who can question the action of the Garda officer?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy reads the subsection he will see it there.  There is no question of the person not being charged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Under subsection (4), as it stands, the machinery comes into operation.  I suggest that, if this power is given, arrests will frequently not be followed by a charge. These enhanced and enlarged powers were never considered to be necessary before.  The Minister says that the Garda authorities say they are now necessary.  Again, that causes me to view this proposal with increased suspicion. Why should the Garda authorities suddenly say they want these powers now?  What has happened during the last three years to suggest that these powers are now necessary?  Is it because, as Deputy MacEntee said, the farmers protested in Dublin?  Is it because people showed their grievances by way of protests in the streets?  If that is, in fact, what the Garda authorities are saying, we should say to them that the powers they had before were quite sufficient to maintain law and order throughout the country and, therefore, they will not be given these powers.  What is being sought now is an extension and I do not believe that any case has been made for the granting of these powers either by the Minister or by any Deputy who supported <Col N="107" /> him and we will certainly oppose this subsection as it stands.</P>

In other words, if, say, a small farmer or somebody like that is advocating the non-payment of rates in order to get a road repaired or some necessary improvement <Col N="108" /> carried out, can he be arrested without warrant?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned, I had made a special plea for spina bifida and hydrocephalus and cytology.  It is important that these diseases should be prevented rather than cured and that we should have preventive rather than curative medicine. This Bill fulfils a rather important function, particularly in relation to Part IV and onwards, in providing for thorough diagnostic services.  On Wednesday last I pointed out the special position in regard to the diagnosing of spina bifida and hydrocephalus.  Spina bifida is the condition of split spine and hydrocephalus is the condition of water on the brain.  If either of these ailments is discovered within 12 hours it can be dealt with adequately.  The importance of a quick diagnosis is to ensure that these terrible ailments do not take hold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gave many figures in relation to percentages.  I pointed out that in 1956 some 90 per cent of the children who were born with either of these ailments died purely because we did not know anything about the diseases.  Now this figure has been reduced considerably, due primarily to the medical procedures now being applied in the Richmond Hospital and Crumlin Children's Hospital, Dublin.  I do not wish to take up too much of the time of the House <Col N="110" /> repeating what I said on behalf of the victims of this type of illness.  My contribution is to be found in the Official Report of Wednesday last.</P>
    <P>I dealt with the special position of the parents of mentally handicapped or disabled children.  I urged the Minister that before Wednesday next he should prevail on the Minister for Finance to increase the disablement allowance for those mentally ill or disabled children who remain at home and/or to give some considerable tax-free benefits to the parents of such children who are kept at home.  I suggested that this should be done regardless of income. Mental illness, as we know, hits all strata of society regardless of whether the parent is poor, in the middle-income group, wealthy or very wealthy.  I urged that if it was at all possible the Health Authority in the city and county of Dublin &mdash; an excellent and efficient authority for which I have always the highest praise arising out of my experience with them&mdash;should issue a medical card to each mentally-ill child or disabled person, and not specifically to the family, because in some instances the family are well enough off to look after themselves in terms of medicine.  If they can afford it they can be members of the Voluntary Health Insurance scheme which is another excellent organisation.  Once more I would appeal to the Minister for Health to urge the Minister for Finance to recognise the special position of the parents of mentally-ill or disabled children.</P>
    <P>This also applies to adults.  If a family with an adult mentally sick keep him at home their work in maintaining him at home should also be recognised.  I was reading a series of articles by Mary McCutcheon in the <i>Irish Independent.</i>  It was a first-class series of articles and well worth reading. She pointed out that mentally-ill children have emotions and experience the usual disturbances recognised in normal children.  It has become fashionable to think that mentally-ill children are some type of vegetable, and I do not wish to use too harsh a word. This is not true.  Psychologists, psychiatrists and sociologists say that they have the same emotions as normal children, to some degree.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> We, as a society, have an important part to play here.  Our function is that in the first instance we should ensure that mentally-ill children should be kept at home and that parents should be encouraged to keep them there. We would be discharging our obligations as a society to the parents of those children in that way.  I do not think that at this point of time we are discharging fully our obligations to them.  This is not to suggest that nothing is being done.  Much has been done in the field of the mentally-ill and the disabled.  Much has been done for paraplegics and so on, but much more must be done and we must keep on pointing out the areas in which we consider that more should be done until the position has been reached in which everything has been done that should be done.</P>
    <P>I pointed out the need for an increasing awareness of the practice of cytology&mdash;the smear test on women. Some years ago I tabled Parliamentary questions asking that cyto-analytical centres be set up in which such women would be cared for from the point of view of pre- and post-maternity and so on.  A situation has now come about where we are discharging our obligations to these pregnant, and indeed non-pregnant, women in cyto-analytical centres.</P>
    <P>All of these are matters of which we are only now becoming aware.  If, in this House, and outside it in voluntary organisations, we keep on pointing out the areas of weakness in sociological medicine and health, and if we in this House make moneys available to ensure that everything possible is being done to sustain the good health of our community.</P>
    <P>We should become aware of the various ailments I have mentioned before, they run their terrible courses and before their consequences are felt in terms of human happiness.  If we did so it would be cheaper in terms of human suffering and financially it would be much cheaper to prevent them than to try to cure them.  This brings me back to the matter of cyto-analysis.  When we take a smear test and realise the existence of <Col N="112" /> cancer, would it not be cheaper to point it out at that stage rather than to cure or to attempt to cure terminal cancer at a later stage.  Terminal cancer, by definition, of course, has its own terrible consequences and that is what I mean by human suffering.</P>
    <P>These are points which must be made and I ask the Minister to remember them when he is replying. Deputy Dillon made the point that sometimes one has to keep on asking, to keep on urging, and that one may have the label of a bore, but I make no apology for mentioning some of the areas of health in which I am interested, and I take Deputy Dillon's advice.</P>
    <P>At this point I come back to my friends, the paraplegics.  The other day two of them came to me.  One of them experienced some difficulty in getting a grant towards the conversion of a car; the other had difficulty in getting a grant for the purchase of a car.  Both types of grants are freely available because of a very important provision brought in recently.  The availability of these grants should be made known to the people suffering from this terrible defect which arises primarily from accidents.  Such people are affected from the waist down and when people appreciate that, they will realise why cars have to be converted to suit such people.  I have given the Minister details of these cases and I hope he will treat both as being of extreme urgency.</P>
    <P>This applies to the blind also, though, of course, I am not suggesting that the blind should be able to drive cars.  We have given encouragement in this country to people willing to engage in gainful employment.  By engaging in gainful employment, such disabled people cease to be a burden on us. These people are entitled to involve themselves in gainful employment.  The State owes them assistance&mdash;it is their entitlement.  If we have paraplegics and blind people in gainful employment, therefore, why should we not realise our duty to them and put it into effect by way of encouragement, by giving them the various allowances to which they are entitled?  Why should we not give them recognition by extending to them tax-free allowances? Why should we not treat them like <Col N="113" /> normal persons when encouragement is the main thing they need?</P>
    <P>I have made several efforts during my short term in the House to bring about that situation but without much success.  I will follow Deputy Dillon's dictum and keep after it and it will come.  But, for God's sake, let us recognise the disability and let us appreciate that those of them who are in gainful employment are not a burden on the State.  Let us recognise their effort by allowing them something in terms of income tax.</P>
    <P>I wonder will the Minister tell us when the White Paper on mental illness is to be produced?  I look forward to hearing that from the Minister in his reply.</P>
    <P>The dispensary service has been dealt with at considerable length by many speakers.  The experience of a number of my constituents of the dispensary service has not been good, on the contrary. I always feel about State institutions&mdash;and imagine that a dispensary is an institution of a nature&mdash;that when you go into them they are dark and there is nothing welcoming about them. They are bare; they are clinical; they are mean.  Why the State do not apply their minds to the creation of decent dispensaries I do not understand.  They are used in the main by old and retired people.  Can we not make these people more comfortable while they are waiting? In some institutions the length of time these senior citizens have to wait for medical treatment can only be described as criminal.  I have on a number of occasions brought these matters to the attention of the Department of Health, with some little success I must admit but not very considerable.</P>
    <P>I believe that as many of these dispensaries as possible should be knocked down and new buildings erected.  However, we must recognise our priorities and we do not have that sort of money to throw around.  Failing that, could we not send a couple of squads of decent painters in to brighten up some of the dispensaries?  I do not suggest that we should have tassels and murals or anything like that around the place.  Brighter colours and even knocking out some of the ceilings and putting in glass would not be a costly <Col N="114" /> operation.  Indeed the placing of a couple of decent chairs would help, as would the provision of magazines. There are many voluntary organisations that would be only too glad to supply magazines for people visiting dispensaries.  I agree this affects constituents of mine, but the effect of this type of dungeon on the staff of the dispensary and on the medical profession is bad also.  I know that my personal feeling when I go into a dreary building is a sort of automatic turning in on oneself.  One thinks: &ldquo;How quickly can I get out of this place?&rdquo;  I believe that by creating better dispensaries people would be willing to wait longer than they normally would.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider these few points in terms of the creation of a better type dispensary, in the first instance, and the placing of some awful dispensaries in some sort of worthwhile, habitable condition until such time as they can be replaced.  Some of them must be replaced, as the Minister is aware.  The staff suffer in a badly laid out building and it has a bad effect on work.  I do not have to go into that; the Minister has paid people to tell us all that.</P>
    <P>I came home rather late last night from a meeting in my constituency.  I came in at the end of the Telefís Éireann sports programme.  There was a plea on by a Mr. McDonagh of Bord Luithchleas Éireann for increased grants.  I had already written to the Minister for Finance making a number of suggestions as to what he could do to give grants to finance sports activities, community centres and that sort of thing if he has the money available for it in the Budget.  I made some of these suggestions to him in a long letter and last night I heard this gentleman, Mr. McDonagh, repeating almost exactly what I had suggested.  I had no communication with him.  I welcome his statement.  If we examine it we will be doing a lot for physical education.  The physical well-being of the individual is very important.  I got a rather garbled version of it but I think what he was saying was consistent with what I had already expressed to the Minister for Finance in a long memorandum regarding assistance towards community activity and grants <Col N="115" /> towards sporting organisations&mdash;Comhairle le Leas Óige is one&mdash;to encourage young people to take an active interest in sport.</P>
    <P>In recent times this activity has been taken over by voluntary organisations and the more assistance we can give them in terms of capital the better.  A healthy nation is a wealthy nation. I do not know who said that&mdash;perhaps it is original&mdash;but it is true.  From health derives many consequences&mdash; active minds, active bodies&mdash;all for the betterment of the nation.  We are still not very conscious of the great outdoors in this country, of the advantages of getting out and about our beautiful countryside.  I would ask the Minister to examine Mr. McDonagh's statement, which probably appeared in this morning's newspapers, and do what he can.  I would look forward to some statement by the Minister for Finance in his Budget in terms of a comprehensive programme, a more professional approach to the sporting activities of the nation.  We are doing it piecemeal at the moment.  Indeed, some of the organisations could examine their consciences as to more co-operation between one and the other.  Coordination is very important.  Pull together rather than pull apart should be the motto for these organisations. They should be coming together for the reasons I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be political on this but I feel that the motion introduced by the Fine Gael Party which is a direct negative to the Bill is, to say the least of it, tragic.  Whereas some of us might suggest, rightly or wrongly, that this Bill does not offer as much as we had hoped it would, nevertheless it does a lot and to put in a direct negative to it is, in my opinion, obscurantist.  Let us go some of the way towards solving some of our many problems.  Certainly, a political Party that puts a direct negative into Part IV of this Bill deserves nothing but condemnation and pity in my opinion.  The wording of the amendment is:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Dáil Éireann refuses to give a Second Reading to the Bill on the grounds that: <Col N="116" /> (a)  it fails to provide a comprehensive health service available to everybody based upon insurance principles;</P>
    <P>(b)  it retains the injustice of financing half of the cost of health services out of local rates; and</P>
    <P>(c)  it gives, at the expense of local authorities and hospital administrators, excessive powers to central government.</P>
    <P>It is important that the good that is in this Bill should be recognised, and there is a lot of good in it.  There are improvements to be made on it, and I am sure the Minister would be the first person to make that point.  No one suggests it is perfect.  I will have a number of amendments to propose to the Minister on a number of sections. I always feel that the substitution of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in a section makes it far more definitive.  The Minister may say this is merely a matter of semantics.  If it is, &ldquo;you shall do something&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;you may do something&rdquo;, I think it is stronger.  The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is more demanding and more definitive. However, for what the Minister has done in this instance I should like to thank him, and I assure him that he will have my views on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, here is a Bill introduced by this angry old man, a Bill that is not intended to be operated until someone gives him money.  The Minister is going to erupt, but he will have to take his medicine.  I told him before and I repeat now that he is a fall guy, and a fall guy he is being made.  He is the fall guy for all the deliberate disowning of responsibility by successive Ministers for Health in Fianna Fáil Government. Deputy Seán Flanagan is carrying the can for them all.  He is put in now, in the dying days of this Dáil, to produce this mouse and expect people like Deputy Andrews to say: &ldquo;Thank God for this little thing&rdquo;.  The Minister has not got the money to operate it.  He has not the time to bring it in.  It will never be an Act of the Oireachtas.  It is only an act of deceit. That is all it is intended to be.  The Minister has invited me to scourge him and I intend to do so.</P>

      <P>Let us look at the Explanatory Memorandum written by this angry Minister who has a guilty conscience.  It states:</P>
      <P>The Bill is primarily based on the proposals for changes in the health services and their administration contained in the White Paper, &ldquo;The Health Services and their Further Development&rdquo; (Pr. 8653), laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in January, 1966.</P>
      <P>Shame on the Minister, and on his colleagues.  Shame on every member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Three years and four months ago a White Paper on the health services was circulated which was designed to say to the people as was once said by a foolish man to his horse: &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A White Paper was introduced by the then Minister for Health with a promise made solemnly in this House that it would be incorporated in legislation in the spring of 1966.  Of course it was not, and then we were told it would be incorporated in legislation in the autumn of 1966.  Of course it was not.  The man who made that promise then became Minister for Education. He scooped all the money and Deputy Seán Flanagan has been there holding the can for him ever since, battling away like Stonewall Jackson, battling away but doing nothing because he was not allowed to do anything.  We had the years 1966, 1967, 1968, and now, in the shadow of the dissolution, this Bill is produced.  It is no wonder that from the moment I got on my feet the Minister was anxious to shout me down.</P>

      <P>This Bill is not intended to be passed.  This is an amendment to the Health Act, 1963. What does it do in relation to the things that matter to the people?  It gives a choice of doctor for those who are entitled to full eligibility.  Notice the change of term&mdash;a choice of doctor. In 1957, when I was Minister for Health, I announced that it was my intention to introduce this change which is now in this Health Bill in 1969.  A Fianna Fáil Minister is now doing something which I announced as Ministerial policy 12 years ago.  I am not surprised that the Minister feels vulnerable on this score.</P>
      <P>There is to be a right of appeal in relation to eligibility for the health services.  That was also announced by me 12 years ago.  I announced also an intention to change the basis of eligibility. These decisions were taken by me within three years of the operation of the Health Act of 1953 but nothing was done.  Unfortunately, I was not there to see that it would be done.  I was succeeded by a Fianna Fáil Minister and there have been a succession of them there since.  Now, 12 years later, trotting in here comes this poor man pulling the lame duck which is the Health Bill of 1969 and we are all supposed to put our heads to the ground and say: &ldquo;Ah, Minister you are so kind.  It is a pity you have not a few shillings to be able to put it into operation but you are great to do it.&rdquo; We have often heard of the mountain being in labour, but this was a tough old mountain in labour for a long time and what a little mouse it has produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We intend to regionalise our health services.  It is amazing what the Department of Health can do.  We had the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act in 1947, the Health Act of 1947 and then the Health Act of 1953. County councils were changed to local authorities and then changed to health authorities, and then in 1960 there was <Col N="120" /> a proposal to have four unified health authorities.  All this was going on while, throughout Ireland, in order to avail of the health services a person had to scrub around, write to Deputies, touch the forelock to county councillors and all the rest of it in order to get a medical card.  If a person did not get the medical card then he was not entitled to general medical services. But there were great changes in the authorities presiding over him.  The county council became the local authority, became the health authority. There was the bunching of health authorities into different groupings, all these trappings and this facade, and here today there is more of it.  We intend to regionalise the administration of health services.  The health authorities are going and we shall have regional boards and then a whole lot of consultative committees under them. What a lot of rubbish and nonsense, all intended to provide a crutch for a health policy that has failed, all intended to bolster up the policy enshrined in the Health Act of 1953 which has been demonstrated to be a complete and utter failure.</P>
    <P>The Health Act of 1953 used divide people into lower income group, middle income group and higher income group. What wonderful change is now proposed? There is full eligibility, limited eligibility and no eligibility.  These are the new categories produced by this Minister on behalf of this Government. I suppose people will feel so much better off when they are told: &ldquo;You are a person of full eligibility instead of being a person in the lower income group&rdquo;.  That is a profound change. It will make people feel better off, I have no doubt, but what does that change of verbiage conceal?  It conceals the fact that we are continuing on a system of health services which depends on means, depends on segregation of people into income groups and demonstrates a recognition by the State of a responsibility merely to those who can establish lack of means.</P>
    <P>As an amendment of the Health Act, 1953, this Bill is all right.  Had the inter-Party Government not left office in 1957, this Bill, in this respect, would already have been known as the Health Act, 1957, for the Health Act was <Col N="121" /> being changed and the amendments had been announced by me to provide choice of doctor, to ensure that in relation to entitlement under the Health Act it was only the person's own income that was to be involved, to provide a right of appeal, and to make the various other minor detailed amendments which this Bill now contains.</P>
    <P>The pity is that Fianna Fáil thinking on health has only reached by 1969 the degree that we had reached 12 years ago.  Why I am angry with the Minister and why I intend verbally to chastise him is the very slow job it is for us to educate Fianna Fáil Ministers for Health.  This Bill, with these amendments, represents the needs of the moment as much as a walk on the moon would represent a pre-dinner exercise.  It is completely irrelevant. It has nothing to do with the changes now required&mdash;a few petty little amendments, but what remains?  A continuance of the daft system whereby the quality and standards of health services will continue to be financed 50/50 by local rates and the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>Does that not show what a bankruptcy of ideas is the condition of the Fianna Fáil Government?  Let every ratepayer throughout the country realise that under this proposal, introduced in the dying days of this Dáil, the Fianna Fáil Government intends to continue the financing of health services from rates.  So far as the law is concerned, the situation ordained in this amendment is that 50 per cent of the cost of the health services in each local area will be financed by the rate-payers. Let the people of Dublin appreciate what is involved.  Let the Dublin Deputies understand that.  This Bill represents a decision by this Government to continue on a health policy which has clearly and obviously failed over the 16 years it has been in operation.  Therefore, we have in this Bill, in so far as the health services of the people are concerned, the minor amendments within the Health Act code which were announced and decided upon 12 years ago.</P>
    <P>We have the abolition of health authorities.  We have the gathering in of areas of administration under a new <Col N="122" /> umbrella body called a health board. That, of course, means unscrambling the Dublin Health Authority, the Cork Health Authority, the Limerick and the Waterford Health Authorities.  All these eggs will have to be unscrambled again.  There will be health boards in place of these with all the multifarious assortment of advisory committees.  A huge administrative umbrella will be raised over a puny health service.  This is all window dressing.  This is so much make believe.  This is more of the deceit being practised in relation to this important matter of health.</P>
    <P>The Minister could well forget his boards, his regions and his consultative and advisory committees, and all that rubbish and tommy rot, if only he had the guts and the courage to appreciate that the one change the people need is the introduction of a really comprehensive health service based on insurance That will solve all the problems.  There will then be no need for a vast umbrella, a huge administrative machine parked here and there all over the country.  An insurance fund can be set up.  It can be administered.  The Minister can give people the same rights everywhere and he can ensure uniform services all over the country.  He can remove health services from the exigencies of local rates.</P>
    <P>All that, of course, involves one fearful step, the admission by a Fianna Fáil Minister that the Fine Gael Party was right, is right and will continue to be right.  Of course that admission will not be made.  Whatever the Minister for Health might like to do he will certainly not be allowed to do that. He will not be allowed to take the big step of admitting that Fine Gael have been right all the time and, therefore, the miserable deception continues.  The people are crying out for reform.  They are crying out for some equality of standards and for the kind of health services they see their poor, beleaguered fellow-citizens in the North enjoying. They are crying out for these and the cry has become so claimant that, for appearance sake, because an election is due, a Bill is introduced by a sleight of hand performance in the hope that people will believe that it represents a serious attempt at re-organisation of <Col N="123" /> health services and that it will in time become an Act.  The fact is that it never will become an Act because it was never intended that it should pass into law.  Even if it did, the money is not there to operate it.  This is as disgraceful an episode as I have ever experienced in my 21 years in this House.  It is making a charade of the needs and requirements of the people. It is done out of political expediency. The regrettable thing is that it is done by a man who is made the conduit pipe for this kind of performance.  He is the fall guy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure it is very difficult for any Minister for Health to bring in a measure which will please everybody, the more so when one remembers the hopes that were raised by the White Paper published in 1966.  If one compares the present measure with the 1953 Act it is true that there are certain improvements in the Bill before the House: there is a choice of doctor for medical card holders; there is the abolition of the special charge for out-patients; there will be assistance where drugs are needed by those of limited eligibility; there is an increase in maternity cash grants and children pre-school age will have the benefit of medical examination. As far as the Bill as a whole is concerned, that is an end of improvements. It falls short of the promises implied in the White Paper.  Not alone does it fall short of the hopes that were raised by that White Paper but in his Budget statement, the Minister for Finance said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="125" /> The cost of the health services is rising so rapidly that it is necessary to consider alternative methods of finance in order to reduce the amounts now charged on the taxpayer and the ratepayer.  A detailed examination is being undertaken of the feasibility of introducing an insurance or contributory scheme to finance at least part of the costs of the services available to the middle-income group.  It will extend to the question of eliminating the hospital charges for which middle-income patients are now liable.</P>
    <P>I feel that, in that statement, there was hope that in this Bill we would have a very frank discussion on how our health services should be financed.</P>
    <P>When the Minister introduced the Bill and reiterated the Government's determination to continue having the health services financed on the basis of 50 per cent from the State and 50 per cent from the local rates he drew what one might say were the old battle lines of the past ten years so far as our health services are concerned with the result that our minds are somewhat diverted from the merits or the demerits of the measure. Resolutions from local authorities all over the country will be found in the Department of Health asking the Minister to get away from what, in fact, he has once again indicated as the method by which our health services will be financed.  He certainly had an outstanding opportunity on this Bill to evolve a new and more satisfactory method of payment for our health services.  Had he done so, the Bill would have been discussed here in an open way instead of along lines on which this matter has been discussed for so long.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is possible to over-emphasise the strength of the opposition throughout the country to the present method of financing the health services.  In the White Paper of 1966, the Government said they were satisfied the local rates were not a form of taxation suitable for collecting additional money on this scale.  That point of view is very strongly held throughout the country.  One might say that Dublin Corporation were not living up <Col N="126" /> to their responsibilities when they refused to strike a rate in view of the Health Estimate but, to my mind, their action reflects the strong feeling that exists throughout the country on this whole matter.  I believe that the only thing that has prevented people from going further in that respect is a sense of helplessness.  I do not want to say that any one Party has all the answers to this problem.  I consider that each Party and possibly each one of us has a worthwhile contribution to make towards improving this scheme and this Bill.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage, I should be glad if the Minister would reconsider the manner in which he proposes to finance the health scheme.  Under this measure, he will have power to provide supplementary grants towards the operation of the new boards he proposes to set up.  It is not sufficient, at this stage, merely to make a blunt statement as to what he can provide in this context in view of the contents of the White Paper and the statement of Deputy Haughey, Minister for Finance, on 23rd April, 1968, when introducing the Budget for the financial year ahead.  Budget Day is the measure of truth for this House and for our country.  That statement by Deputy Haughey on that occasion gave hope that the Government were prepared to move away from the old system but, once again, we have it in this Bill and, while the Minister has certain powers under the Bill, it is not sufficient merely to say that he may or may not do this or do that.  The Minister should spell out exactly what he intends to do.  He should state clearly the contribution the Exchequer is prepared to make towards the cost of our health services.</P>
    <P>We have been told that the cost of our health services has increased by 50 per cent over the past four years. It must be agreed that most of that increase falls under the administrative side of the health services and that, in fact, there have been no great extensions to the health services proper. Though the Minister claims that the increases are being borne equally by the Exchequer and by the local rates, nevertheless, by virtue of various forms of taxation such as PAYE, a considerable proportion of the money provided <Col N="127" /> by the Minister for Finance to help to finance local authorities finds its way back into the Exchequer and, in reality, the net cost of the health services is borne to a far greater degree by local rates than by central taxation.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, 50 per cent of the members of the new health boards will be appointed by the Minister as will, also, be the chairman and the vice-chairman. When I first heard that health boards were to be set up I hoped the Minister would restore some of the powers originally held by the old Boards of Health before the County Management Act was introduced. It appears from this Bill that the same type of thinking that was responsible for the County Management Act, 1940, is now determining the functions of the new health boards. To ensure that health boards will be effective and efficient and, furthermore, to ensure that public representatives will have a reasonable &ldquo;say&rdquo; is not an easy matter having regard to the numerous services provided by the health authority.  Nevertheless, more power should have been given to the health boards and at least they should be allowed to elect their own chairman and vice-chairman.</P>
    <P>These boards will be composed of professional people, people engaged in the administrative side of the local and health authorities and public representatives. It was a retrograde step to include in the Bill necessity for the Minister's sanction for schemes put forward by the health boards.  In view of their composition, I believe them capable of very worthwhile improvements and recommendations and they should be allowed some of the powers contained in the City and County Management Act, 1955.  They should not have to seek the sanction of the Minister in respect of every little thing they feel should be done.</P>
    <P>The right of appeal against the decision of an executive officer is certainly a step forward but it will lose its effectiveness if the Minister decides that another officer of the board who, in the first instance, refused the application for a service will hear the appeals. The Minister should examine how other Departments of State operate and <Col N="128" /> should not allow a situation to arise where an executive officer of a health board will decide a case in one particular way and then an officer of the same board will be asked to hear an appeal.  Certainly, if the Minister allows that to happen, people will lose whatever confidence they may have in the right of appeal.</P>
    <P>Some people feel that members of a health authority cannot make representations in cases where applications are refused.  This is a retrograde step and public representatives should have a right to find out exactly why people are refused facilities to which they are entitled.  I am not saying that because I think people should ask public representatives to make representations but because public representatives have a duty on two fronts. They have a duty to the people who elected them and a duty to find out why people who made applications for various services were refused.  They also have a duty to let the people know why they were refused.  Most of us have always found the officials to whom we have made representations to be courteous when dealing with our representations and as a result public representatives have a duty to explain to people who feel aggrieved, that things might not be as bad as they felt or that in many cases they were genuinely&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>In certain respects too much power is being given to the executive officers and the Minister and too little consideration to the work done by public representatives over the years.  The more we move in this direction the sooner we will arrive at the undesirable stage of democracy by dictatorship.  A change which I should like to see made is in regard to the 10/-a day charge made on the middle income group for hospital services.  I do not know what the exact cost of removing this charge would be but from my experience I think it would not be greater than £500,000.  When one considers the time and money spent on investigations and re-investigations, sending out reminders and bills, then the collection of this sum is hardly warranted.  Another point is that the salaries of home assistance officers should rank for a 50 per cent recoupment from the Exchequer and not be a 100 per cent charge on the rates in view of the fact that most of the time of these officers is spent investigating matters relating to health services and, therefore, it hardly seems fair that this particular part of the administration of the health services should not rank for such recoupment.</P>
      <P>The Minister's decision to take into account only the income of the husband and wife in applications for medical cards and to ignore the incomes of other people in the house is a most desirable step.  His decision in regard to the payment of disability pension allowances is another move forward. The Minister will be aware that in many cases where people apply for this allowance they have no income and when they go to hospital for treatment they receive the allowance for eight weeks but people can be in hospital for four or six months and, perhaps, the Minister could extend the period of full payment or at least allow 50 per cent of the original amount for another four months.  This is not something which would break the State or cost a great deal but it would make a very great difference to many of the people involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his Estimate the Minister dealt with the extra provisions he hopes to make in the next couple of years for <Col N="130" /> mentally-handicapped children in institutions. It is generally felt that the parents of such children have to bear a very heavy burden and the Minister should provide treatment for these children free of charge irrespective of the parents' incomes.  I know that the county managers generally have been very lenient in this respect and that they use the flexibility clause in the Health Act in a very generous way, but as the State is bearing the greater proportion of the cost of institutional treatment for these children it would not impose an undue burden on the Exchequer if the Minister went a little bit further and provided treatment free of charge for all children irrespective of their parents' income.</P>
    <P>The question of appointing dispensary doctors is one that in many counties has been put on the long finger. I do not know what the position is throughout the country but in my own county there are four permanent posts vacant.  The sooner the Minister decides in which particular areas or districts he can provide a choice of doctor the better.  I am sure he will agree that it is unreasonable to have these four posts vacant in my county particularly as two of them are in adjoining areas. I am sure he will understand the difficulties people have in getting doctors when they want them.  Most of these posts are filled on a temporary basis and the situation has been dragging on for a very long time.  In Wicklow it has been dragging on for five or six years and the Minister should make up his mind where he is going to have the groups of doctors proposed in the Bill and when he will have these posts filled.  In some counties he has allowed permanent dispensary doctor posts to be filled as far as I am aware.  Some four or five months ago I remember reading in a Sunday newspaper advertisements for particular counties and certainly they were not for remote areas or on the western seaboard.  In Wicklow we have been told that the Minister is not prepared to sanction the permanent filling of these posts but he should have the matter decided finally.</P>
    <P>One other matter to which I should like to refer relates to married nurses working in various institutions throughout the country.  It is certainly true <Col N="131" /> to say that many district hospitals would not be able to keep going if the services of these nurses were not available.  The Minister should do something similar to what his colleague the Minister for Education has done in regard to married teachers.  If he is not prepared to do that he should at least ensure that these people are paid salaries commensurate with their ability and experience.  Surely he will agree that it was hardly reasonable to expect people who have been nursing for 15 or 20 years to come back and work in these institutions at the bottom of the scale.  In view of the problem that exists in regard to these areas, particularly small district hospitals in rural areas, the Minister should look at the position and see if he can sanction the appointment of these people on a permanent basis and pay them salaries in keeping with their experience.</P>
    <P>Finally, I exhort the Minister, even at this late stage, to go back to the Government and tell them that throughout the country there is a very strong feeling against the present method of financing the health services. I say in all sincerity that even reasonable people are objecting strongly to the method that has been employed through the years to finance health services.  While on a number of occasions recently in the House the Minister said he was having discussions with the Minister for Finance in connection with this matter, I think even the Minister for Finance himself does not now consider the position to be as gloomy as it was when the Minister for Health was trying to get some money from him some months ago. Therefore, I exhort him to take health matters out of the old battle-lines of the past and see if he can recommend any rational manner in which health services can be financed in future and so get us away from the system which has caused so much dissension over the past 15 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly necessary for me to say that the Bill falls very far short of what we in these benches would wish it to be.  All of us who are public representatives, and <Col N="132" /> particularly those of us who are local public representatives, have a very keen interest in this measure.  Therefore, although some of us covered the field pretty comprehensively only a few weeks ago, we feel called upon again to comment on the Bill.  It is difficult to do so because the Bill contains so little detail.</P>
      <P>It is nothing more or less than a modification of the White Paper on health which we received, I think, over three years ago.  There is nothing more specific in the Bill than was in the White Paper.  In some instances some worthy objectives in the White Paper are either excluded or treated very lightly in this Bill.  I find it strange that, after three years notice of the Government's intention, we should have such a scanty Bill, one so devoid of detail or elaboration in any form.</P>
      <P>The Minister, his Department and the Government have had three years to consider this measure.  It is difficult to understand that at this stage, with the Second Reading of the Bill in progress, consultations with those who must operate the Bill, or Act when it becomes law&mdash;the medical profession and the dentists&mdash;are still only in the elementary stages and that consultations with the local authorities have not even begun nor have we got notice that they will begin in the near future.  Consultation with the local authorities who have been operating under existing Health Acts and who will be very largely affected should have been considered essential before the Bill was introduced.  It is hard to understand what the Government have been doing for the past three years.  I hope that the Minister will be able to give us more details on the next Stage but, assuming that it will be taken soon, I doubt if he will be in a position to do so.  In these circumstances it is difficult for us properly to address ourselves to this measure.  However, we must take it as we got it for the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is my first criticism of the measure and the second is in regard to the proposed reorganisation of the services envisaged in the Bill.  I completely agree with the suggestion that those who operate the Health Act&mdash; doctors, nurses and medical people <Col N="133" /> generally&mdash;should have a say in the management of health authorities or regional boards or whatever they may be.  It is part of our policy as a Party that those who operate the services, whatever they may be, should have a say in their operation.  Therefore, we do not oppose in any way participation by medical people in whatever capacity in the new health boards but we believe that in order to safeguard democracy local public representatives, the direct representatives of the people&mdash;and after all this and every other such Act exist or should exist for the people whose health is our concern&mdash;should form the majority of any board set up.  This is the only way we can safeguard the rights of the people. By abolishing this system and by substituting a board on which the Minister is responsible for a majority of the members we take away this right of the people.</P>
    <P>We should be very careful to ensure that any Health Act we pass has the confidence of the people.  I contend that the present health services do not have the confidence of the people, particularly those who do not qualify for full eligibility or part eligibility, as this Bill describes it.  Those of us who are public representatives and attend local meetings and meet our constituents are told by people generally who have not been allowed full eligibility under the Health Act of those who are far better off than themselves and who have medical cards. They blame the local assistance officer, or the system, but the fact is that they have no confidence in the system, no confidence in the Act or those operating it.  In health, as in every other department, we must ensure from now on that any legislation we enact will have the people's confidence, that it will be operable and that it can be seen by the people it is intended to help to be a just system.</P>
    <P>I do not think that this Bill in any way removes the built-in criticisms associated with the old Act.  I do not know why, in the case of the new regional boards, it is left to the Minister to appoint the chairman and vice-chairman. Surely this is regression in democracy?  Surely any board should <Col N="134" /> have the right to have its members appoint its chairman and vice-chairman and other officers.  I was interested when the Minister in reply to a question across the House stated, I think, that local public representatives would be able to ensure that justice was meted out in the issue of medical cards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">

    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred in his Second Reading speech to the functions of the chief executive officer that he proposes should operate under section 16 of the Bill.  He said that the chief executive officer under that section would perform his duties on behalf of the board and in accordance with their decisions and directions except in respect of certain things in which he is specifically given functions by the Bill.  These will be mainly decisions on individual applications for services and control of officers.  I think local public representatives, as members of an advisory committee&mdash;only very few of them will be members of the body proper&mdash;have a very important function to fulfil in that they have a forum in which to air grievances. This is a vital outlet.  I think the chief executive officer under this Bill can tell them that this or that is his reserved function, that they have no right under the Act to interfere or make representations.  I do not say all the chief executive officers do this but under the Bill they are empowered to deal arbitrarily with applications and are not required to have recourse to public representatives or anybody else, even those on the board, in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several limitations on the powers of the boards.  Section 30 envisages limitations in regard to supplementary estimates.  Normally, that might be a very good thing.  Perhaps most members of health authorities complain that supplementary estimates have to be resorted to during the year but I have known occasions when this was necessary for very urgent reasons and I should hate to think that a detailed and protracted correspondence would ensue between the Minister's Department and the <Col N="135" /> board before money could be provided to finance very essential services.  This has been our experience not only in respect of health but in respect of local government generally.  It is indicative of the situation that exists between the Department of Local Government and local authorities.</P>
    <P>Nobody will deny that the choice of doctor for all patients is a very good thing.  However, at the moment it is very vague.  Indeed, if one reads page five of the Minister's introductory statement, one would think that it was an Opposition Party policy on health and that the responsibility for implementing the policy might be something to worry about tomorrow and not today.  The Minister is very vague in some of the statements appearing on that page.  After three years of waiting for this Bill we should have something more definite.</P>
    <P>The problem of deciding who is eligible for benefit and who is not will still be with us.  The very degrading investigation of means which is at present in operation is to be extended to the middle income group. It is good that help is being given to people in the middle income group to pay for costly drugs, but the administrative costs involved in ascertaining whether the amount of the expenses incurred within a specified time exceed a specified figure and deciding whether the person is qualified for benefit would far outweigh the advantages.  When the Minister decided to assist the middle income group, he should have cut out the means test.  If this were done, the cost in the long run would be less.</P>
    <P>We are glad to hear that, in determining eligibility for benefits, the income of other members of the family will not be taken into consideration. We can deduce from this that there will be a very large increase in the number of people qualifying for benefits. We have no idea of what the income limit will be but we know that the health authorities are, at the moment, operating a rather stringent system and that a man and his wife, whose joint income exceeds £11 per week, do not qualify for a medical card.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="136" /> I wonder what the Minister will do with regard to the agricultural community. He certainly cannot determine their eligibility for benefit on the basis of their valuation because valuation bears no relation to economic circumstances at the moment.  These are some of the details on which we should like clarification from the Minister either in his reply to this debate or on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to group practices by doctors.  These would work very well in city areas but they would be rather difficult to operate in remote areas.  Unfortunately, there are some dispensary areas for which there is no doctor.  In some of these cases a permanent appointment has not been made pending the implementation of this Act and it has not been found possible to get a doctor who will take the post on a temporary basis.</P>
    <P>Speaking of temporary appointments, I would ask the Minister to do something in this regard.  There is a great deal of unrest among the people because of the service they get as a result of these temporary appointments. Very often a doctor appointed in this way may, through no fault of his own, live far away from the dispensary area and in some cases the people in the area will not know the doctor's telephone number or his address.  This is a dreadful situation and I ask the Minister to do what he can to ensure that appointments are made in such areas with the least possible delay.  The Minister says that this legislation will not be implemented before mid-1970, but this is far too long to wait for this situation in remote areas to be cleared up.</P>
    <P>I agree with those who stated that the minimal charges for hospitalisation should be discontinued because it is not worth the administrative cost of collecting it.  I hope the Minister will listen to what we are saying and abolish that charge.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this Bill, we note the omission of several things which are very dear to us.  The White Paper on health referred specifically to dental treatment but there is only a very scant reference to the problem in the Bill.  No arrangement has been made <Col N="137" /> for the extension of the dental service. Sufficient dentists cannot be got to operate the school dental service. The result is that children of ten years and upwards&mdash;the children who most need treatment&mdash;cannot have it.  We have got to cut our service down to that.  A dental service like that is a farce.  Perhaps this is caused by the scarcity of dentists.  Maybe they prefer to go to some other country where they may get more money.  It behoves the Minister to address himself to this situation and to see that we have proper dental services in this country.</P>
    <P>We have had very little reference to the care and treatment of aged people in hospitals and to home nursing and general nursing.  The care of our old people is vital.  Something should be done for those people who have given up employment to care for their aged relatives.  I know there is something given under the social welfare code if they have 156 contributions, but it is very small.  Some of those people who have given up jobs to care for their aged relatives should be given some compensation.  Some of them have not any stamps when they come from abroad and they cannot get anything here.  Those people are providing a service for the community which means a very large saving to local authorities. The old people would be in institutions and would be costing the community a great deal of money, but by virtue of the fact that those people are doing this work they are saving the community this money.  Some scheme should be enacted which would give them compensation for performing this duty.  Parents, as a right, look after some members of their family who may be incapacitated in some way but many adult persons who do this work should not be asked to exist in society with no money, no personal belongings and no assistance from the State.  We should certainly do something to help those people who devote themselves to looking after their aged relatives. Those people who make this sacrifice should be given some help by the State.</P>
    <P>There is very little reference here to the upgrading of our mental services <Col N="138" /> and the abolition of the discrimination which exists between mental illness and general physical illness.  Mental illness is an enormous problem in this country.  It is especially so in County Cork where we have large crowds in mental hospitals and we find it very difficult to do much for them because of shortage of money. Mental patients should not be treated in this way.  In Cork we have something like 2,000 patients in a building with up to 60 or 80 beds in a ward. I have said this before, and I repeat it again, that I think it is appalling that those people should be treated in this way.  We should not allow this to happen in mental hospitals in this year of 1969.  I know it costs a lot of money but there are things which must be done regardless of what shortage of money there is.  There is a crying need for improvement in mental services and something should be done, whatever it costs us.</P>
    <P>There is also very little reference to school medical examinations.  Something should certainly be done to improve this.  Those matters to which I have referred might be regarded as administrative complaints but I feel this is the right place to make them. I would ask the Minister to ensure that all those services I have mentioned are improved without delay. I would ask him particularly to improve health services for our children because, if we do not do so, we will have a worse problem when they become older.  As a nation we certainly fall down in regard to our health services for our children and much could be done in this regard.</P>
    <P>I want to add to what the last speaker said about our nursing service. Here we have a section of our people on whom everything depends.  We cannot operate our health services without our nurses.  Let me say that I consider that they are the worst paid in our community.  Some people may say that their wages are not too bad but for the skill which nurses possess I want to say, as a woman, I consider that they are very badly paid.  They are nearly all female labour but, if they were not, they would be paid far higher wages.  It does not matter whether they are female or male they <Col N="139" /> should be paid according to the skills which they have.</P>
    <P>We should concentrate on upgrading the whole profession of nursing.  We should have diplomas and degrees in nursing and we should enable nurses to go right to the top of the scale, administratively or otherwise.  I hope in regard to any board which the Minister may set up to operate this Bill when it becomes an Act that there will be some nurses on it.  They could certainly contribute much to the success of those boards.</P>
    <P>I suspect there are many other criticisms which I could offer and also many compliments which I could pay the Minister on this Bill, but I feel at this juncture I should not take up the time of the House with them but rather wait until the Committee Stage when we can deal specifically with our particular grievances.  However, I would say this is another example of piecemeal legislation.  It eliminates a few injustices and it rights a few wrongs, but the basic problem remains the same.  It does not solve the basic problem of the people of this country. I think we have got to get away from the whole concept of piecemeal legislation, be it health or otherwise, and tackle the whole thing by way of legislation.</P>

      <P>The only one objection I have to this Bill in its <Col N="140" /> entirety is that, once more, there appears to be discrimination against married women.  Whilst there is great improvement in relation to family incomes I think a married woman who is working for an income should be treated in exactly the same way as a husband who is working for an income. This discrimination extends right through our income tax code and many other codes within our land.  I think it is incorrect to write off this Bill as piecemeal legislation.  As some of the Deputy's colleagues might know, I think it was the great chairman Mao who said that a long journey starts with the first step and this is a first step.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt in the world that if we improve our social services we can only improve them step by step.  This is in no way piecemeal legislation.  We go step by step as we have the money.  We improve the services all the time as the Exchequer can afford to pay for them and as the gross national product increases. We cannot suddenly come along, as Deputy O.J. Flanagan suggested before he joined the Fine Gael Party, and print money to meet the cost of these services.  There is some significance in the way in which this debate is taking place.  The Minister said in his opening statement that this is largely a Committee Stage Bill. Leading speakers of both Opposition Parties have agreed with this.  I do not know whether it is the Punchestown Races or what, but the Opposition Parties appear quite determined to prolong this Second Stage of the Bill for as long as possible.  Maybe they want to block the implementation of these provisions.  I just do not know.  So far as I am concerned, I did not intend to speak on the Second Stage of the Bill and I am speaking from notes on the side of the Bill which I had prepared for the Committee Stage when the real work of this Bill shall be done.  We <Col N="141" /> can discuss this politically as Members of the Opposition have done, and I may as well follow suit.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan, a spokesman for health, thanked the Minister for &ldquo;this miserable measure&rdquo;, which he called a mean, small-minded, begrudging and niggardly Health Bill.  That comes very well from Deputy Richie Ryan.  I am sorry he has left the House.  Deputy Ryan was the leading spokesman for Fine Gael in the Dublin Corporation when they refused to pay for the present health services.  Now he calls this a mean, begrudging, small-minded, niggardly piece of legislation.  Let him stand up and be counted when it comes to the time when we have to raise the money, be it by taxes on the pint or on the cigarettes, on income tax, or by putting it on the rates, or making the contribution stamp under the insurance scheme amount to £1 per week for the ordinary worker.  Let him stand up and be counted when it comes to paying for these services which this mean, small-minded, begrudging and niggardly Health Bill shall provide.</P>

      <P>I will deal with your insurance scheme, the rates question and the provisions of the Bill as I go along.  I prepared my statement for the Committee Stage.  It is certain that we will not be able to improve the health services by delaying the Second Stage debate.  I have read all the debates up to now and they were quite interesting for the first day or two.  Then we started on the repetition. I will refer to some of the remarks in these debates at a later stage.  The main demands that have been made by the public expressing their views in statements at meetings, letters to the Press, editorial comments in the newspapers or by political correspondents have all been dealt with in this Bill. The Bill deals with the free choice of doctor and the end of the dispensary system so that an individual can get his medicines and drugs from individual chemists.  Deputy Ryan is afraid that this good piece of legislation will get on the Statute Book before the general election, whenever that may <Col N="142" /> be, and he is determined not only to prevent that happening but also to use his influence to bring down the Dublin Corporation and to prevent another Fine Gael candidate getting the seat. The electorate know him and never give him many votes.  He would serve his Party and the nation better if he would use his influence with his Party to enable this Bill to get through this Second Stage in the House quickly.</P>
      <P>There may be some sections which will require long and detailed consideration on the Committee Stage. The Second Stage should be let through the House and not held up.  I suppose it is unfair to say it is being held up because of the Punchestown Races.  It is probably being held up by deliberate policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill proposes many good things. When I was first elected to Dublin Corporation and became a member of the Health Authority I had the privilege of attending a conference in Belgium in 1955 or 1956.  This concept of a regional organisation had become the thing in Europe then.  So far as France is concerned, there has been a referendum recently where greater regional power has been turned down, but the concept was there in 1955-56 that to get efficient organisation and management of health planning or housing matters you had to work on the basis of a region, not on the basis of a city or a county but on the basis of a region in which a city was situated. All the delegates who attended that conference, representing countries not only in the EEC and EFTA but also some countries in Eastern Europe, voted unanimously for this scheme. It appears that these international conferences are not effective in getting Governments to take action because it has taken 12 or 13 years for the Government of this country to adopt a regional system for health authorities. Such a system will do away with a great deal of overlapping.  It will bring about more efficient working of the health services and help reduce their cost.  It will enable the Minister of the day, no matter who he may be, to bring in specialised, technical experts to help, advise and assist those people <Col N="143" /> who are elected.  This is something which is most important.  I am aware of great waste, especially in our voluntary hospitals.  I suggest this could be overcome by proper organisation, proper management and proper technical help and advice.</P>
    <P>I am aware also of this defect in regard to our voluntary hospitals.  A man may complain of tummy trouble and the doctor may not be quite sure what is wrong with him.  He is admitted to a voluntary hospital on a Friday.  On a Monday the blood test has been completed, on Tuesday the X-Ray examination is done and it is Wednesday before the cardiograph is available. All of this could be done in 36 hours. I am aware of this because it happened to me.  I was a paying patient in a voluntary hospital but from the amount I paid I was aware that I was subsidised. I was in a private section of the hospital.  How the money is distributed I do not know, because in my opinion I should have paid more.  I am emphasising the delays and I know that it happens in the case of people who are admitted to voluntary hospitals under the health services.  There is a terrible waste of time.  In a business &mdash;the same should apply to medicine &mdash;when you have a building and machinery you must use that building and work that machinery around the clock, 24 hours a day, the only respite being on Sunday and that is on religious rather than economic grounds.</P>
    <P>The Minister is discussing with the medical profession the question of how payments should be made to them.  By the time this Bill will have become an Act it is possible to foresee that a satisfactory arrangement will have been come to because the difference of opinion between the Ministers and the doctors is not great, the door being wide open without any appearance of breakdown.  In these discussions, the Minister should consider, whether it be through group practice or individual practice by doctors and physicians, how the bed-time in hospitals can be better utilised, because 70 per cent to 80 per cent of the total health bill is spent on voluntary hospitals.  This is the big end of the expenditure on health and if <Col N="144" /> expenditure on voluntary hospitals can be cut&mdash;I am convinced that it can be, having spent three or four years on a health authority&mdash;we can extend our health services greatly.</P>
    <P>In section 4 (4) the Bill states that the Minister shall consult the council of a county, the corporation of a county borough or the Corporation of Dún Laoghaire before making regulations under this section which relate to the functional area of the council or corporation concerned.  I suggest to the Minister that this subsection is not necessary.  Up to now, local authorities have nothing to be proud of and the sooner the local authority administration of our health services is changed and improved the sooner we shall advance in our health services.</P>
    <P>I hope that Dublin Corporation, the Corporation of Dún Laoghaire, Dublin County Council and the councils of some of the surrounding counties will be amalgamated into a region including Kildare, Meath, Louth and so on. It is the only way to do it: it is the only way we shall get efficiency.</P>
    <P>I was a member of Dublin Corporation and Dublin Health Authority and I saw reasonable proposals put forward by the Department of Health but because a Fianna Fáil Minister made the proposals, they were obstructed and blocked because the Fianna Fáil Party did not have a majority on these bodies, and never had as far as I am aware.</P>
    <P>The Minister is quite right in introducing these reasonable provisions. We must reorganise our health services completely and in their entirety. When one goes on to read subsection (5) of section 4, I do not think the Minister is taking too much power, as the last Fine Gael speaker alleged.  He said the Minister is looking for dictatorial power.  It is not so.  The subsection states:</P>
    <P>A draft of regulations which it is proposed to make under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is obvious that the Minister <Col N="145" /> will not get away with anything unless the Deputies over there are not doing their job and I am sure they will be on their toes to spot any bit of excessive authority the Minister might try to exercise, no matter which Minister he might be.  Then we come to section 5.  I am prompted to say to the Government that if other Ministers wrote into their various Acts protection for individuals similar to that which the Minister for Health has introduced here, I would be far happier because section 5 gives the greatest possible protection to the individual.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Labour Party say we have two conservative Parties here. They repeated that allegation during the debate on this Bill.  Let us come along to section 6 (2) and we find the enactments which are being amended. We have only to look at them to appreciate that Fianna Fáil Governments during the years have been progressive and liberal.  One could call Fianna Fáil, accordingly, a socialist Party, depending on the interpretation one puts on it because every piece of legislation in the socialist field has been enacted by a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>In reference to the local committees to be set up under this Bill, I think everybody knows how local politics work.  There is a situation in which the Minister must make regulations. Otherwise the thing would not work at all.  In this instance, the Minister is quite right in his proposal to set up committees of the health board.  I should like to give him a list to start with.  He might, first of all, set up a committee to examine the ambulance services throughout the country.  We need that straight away.  I understand something is being done about it and it is essential.  We need a committee to look after our sea and river rescue services.  We need a committee to examine the problem of drug addiction. This has been advocated by other Members and I will not dwell on it.</P>
    <P>We need a committee to deal with venereal disease.  We need a committee to examine chemical pesticides to decide whether they are poisoning our food and whether they may be the basic agent of cancer and responsible for the increase in cancer.  I think <Col N="146" /> they are a greater contributor to cancer than tobacco consumption.  We should have a committee to deal with the problem I mentioned earlier, the waste of bed time in voluntary hospitals.  We need a committee to point out whether doctors can be persuaded to work a shift system as in America.  We need a committee to help the Minister for Finance to define which expenses are properly deductible on income tax claims.  The Minister brought in a concession last year, or the year before.</P>
    <P>I understand some people are not too happy about what expenses exactly are admissible.  We have to investigate also where the higher income people get some assistance.  In this Deputy Mrs. Desmond may be wrong. As I understand it, the Bill does provide for permanent assistance to the higher income group where permanent disability or sickness is entailed.  As against that, leaving children out of it, I do feel that where people may have to spend many tens of thousands of pounds to keep themselves alive at least some contribution should be made towards this.  I have raised this matter and so has Deputy Byrne of Fine Gael. Whether we both had in mind the same persons I doubt very much but I certainly am aware of a person who is making a great contribution to the national economy and who was nearly prevented from doing so simply by the cost of keeping himself alive.</P>
    <P>The income tax allowance is a help in this situation but no matter how high an individual's income may be medical expenses may run beyond that. This is a situation where each individual's claim should be examined on its merits and if it can be shown that hardship not only to the individual but, perhaps, to those he employs will be caused by not granting him some assistance, then the Minister should seriously consider making a subvention or some type of grant.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of families who find themselves in great difficulty when the husband has had an accident in the time that elapses between the accident taking place and the court settlement.  I do not think there is proper assistance given in these cases at the moment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" /> The main thing, so far as the publicity that goes out of this House is concerned, is that if we were to transfer the cost of the existing health services to direct taxation I feel we should examine who will, in fact, be the losers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If this charge is transferred to direct taxation, then I am afraid the loser will be the ordinary worker in the street, the ordinary man who makes a purchase in a shop or who earns an income that is taxable. At the moment in my constituency in Kimmage, Crumlin and that area the valuation of corporation houses is around £12 per annum.  The health charge that has been turned down by the corporation, the extra cost to those individuals, will be roughly twopence per week.  That is what the corporation tenant would be asked to pay.  The man with a valuation of about £24, which is the valuation in respect of the small dwelling acquisition type house built up to quite recent times, will be asked to pay about fourpence a week.  The man who can afford a house of £48 valuation will be asked to pay eightpence a week.  The man who is going to pay most money is the man who owns his shop, his industry, his business.  All the big industrialists and big shopkeepers, in fact, subsidise the smaller person.  If we take this away from property tax which it is now&mdash; something less than half the cost is paid out of tax on property&mdash;and put it on to direct taxation it means that the big property owner will get relief and the small direct taxpayer will be compelled to pay more.</P>
      <P>If we take the Fine Gael suggestion of insurance we are talking about £50 million.  What is the stamp going to cost?  A pound a week?  Another pound a week from the worker?</P>

      <P>I am glad Deputy Ryan is here because we have here the question of removal from the board in section 11.  No doubt Deputy Seán Dunne has considered the constitutional situation of the provisions of section 11 but I am twice as sure that Deputy Ryan has considered this point of view. After all, he has done quite well out of raising questions and going to court about constitutional points of view.  In fact, if Deputy Ryan's clients were to pay the Exchequer what they owe for the fluoridation action they could have the 10 per cent reduction in Deputy's salaries and the Exchequer would have even more money, the Exchequer would be better off.  I am sure the Minister is perfectly safe here, that even Deputy Ryan will not take him to court on the constitutional aspects of section 11 whereby he may remove members from the board when he is satisfied ... I heard Deputy Costello talking about being satisfied on the Criminal Justice Bill too.  It is quite clear that the purpose of the Opposition has been to delay and I am watching the clock so that I will not delay the House too long.</P>

      <P>It is provided, however, that the Minister may before establishing a health board, request the Local Appointments Commission to select a person for appointment as chief executive officer.  I have yet to hear anybody from any Party in this House express suspicion about the impartiality of the Local Appointments Commission.  The establishment of these commissioners has done a great service to this country and has raised many appointments way above the suspicion of political patronage.  It is most unfortunate that attempts to prove political patronage when it does not exist, are bandied around this House time and time again, but I am <Col N="149" /> glad that the commissioners at least are above this type of criticism.</P>
      <P>Section 16 relates to salaries, conditions, remuneration, privileges, superannuation of officers and servants of the board.  The only thing I am concerned about here is that in the event of a dispute, as I read the Bill, a decision on this dispute shall be determined by the Minister.  I believe that these officers and employees of the board should have access to the Labour Court as is the intention of the Bill we discussed here last week. Officers whether in State or semi-State employment should be treated in the same way.</P>
      <P>As I say, I welcome this Bill in its entirety.  All the major issues of contention have been properly dealt with. I am sorry to see it being held up in the House.  I have spoken after three or four Opposition speakers in succession. I heard Deputy L'Estrange making sure that he had four or five speakers to keep the debate going.  The point is that the Minister has made provision whereby with the consent of the Minister for Finance he can pay money over and above the contribution which the Government might normally make to the relief of the rates.  I am quite sure that as the service expands and as our national product expands, it will be within the competence of the Government to make a greater amount of money available for our health services.</P>
      <P>When these regional authorities are set up, there should be no wholesale redundancy among the existing officers. When the regional authorities take over the number of people employed should be reduced by normal wastage where possible, or by making pensions available to them, perhaps, a little earlier than their normal time for retirement. Care must be taken to avoid Parkinson's Law under which work will expand to meet the number of people available to do it.  This can happen and great care should be taken to see that it does not happen and, at the same time, that there is no wholesale redundancy.  Normal wastage should be the order of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister is taking compulsory purchase powers <Col N="150" /> in regard to purchasing land for extensions. This is absolutely essential. In fact, so far as I am aware, some hospital extensions in Dublin have not been completed because this power was not exercised at the time.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the only objection I have to the Bill is to section 43.  I believe that the wife and the husband should be treated as separate entities so far as their income earning abilities are concerned.  I believe the wife should not be a second-class citizen. I believe this was not the intention when the Constitution was drafted in 1937.  As time goes on, more and more the State will require the services of women to work to increase our productivity.  With the industrial policies which this Government have pursued successfully in the past there is no doubt that the question of a manpower shortage will become a problem in the next ten or 12 years.  Giving the children a chance, is a step forward. A boy getting married, or a girl for that matter, and earning an income, will put very little in the family purse when they are saving to buy a house or to buy furniture if they qualify for a corporation tenancy.</P>
    <P>This has been a source of great distress especially in Dublin where a mother has been making provision for the family and where she has to pay the grocery bills.  She expects so much money from each child.  The son gets engaged and he says to her: &ldquo;I reckon my food is worth 30/- and I will not be giving you the £4 or £5 in future.&rdquo; The mother then finds herself in difficulties with the rent or something else, and she is cut off from the health services. The Minister has certainly satisfied the majority of the people I talked to in Dublin in this respect.  This will be a most welcome provision.  Maybe we cannot do it this year, but I ask the Minister to consider seriously treating the income of the husband and the income of the wife as separate in the future.</P>
    <P>Section 52 is a major step away from class distinction, and I appreciate it. In order to make the health services work we must plan from a base.  We have to reorganise on regional bases. There are certain people like the Port <Col N="151" /> and Docks Board, the ESB and CIE, getting privileges in regard to the amount of rates they pay.  It has been suggested time and again that, once the ESB go into retail competition with the ordinary trader, they should not be given rating privileges.  They are well able to pay without doing away with their competitiveness, and then we could probably do a great deal more for the health services without the imposition of an extra halfpenny upon the ratepayers or the taxpayers.  This matter has been raised since the late Deputy Alfie Byrne was first elected to public office.  It has been a matter of contention since the establishment of the ESB.  This company have a rates remission of £311,268.  That gives them a great advantage over the ordinary trader.  The Port and Docks Board get the relief of £86,000.  This is a matter which should be examined very seriously.</P>
    <P>On the Supplementary Estimate the Minister gave us some vital statistics which are very promising.  Births may not be going up as fast as one would like but marriages are increasing and deaths are decreasing per 1,000 of the population.  We are making great progress in our health services.</P>
    <P>This Bill is to be commended to the House and the public in general.  It cannot be described as mean, small-minded, begrudging or niggardly.  I hope the House will approve the Second Reading and let us get down to the important work on Committee Stage when, if there is any change or improvement to be made, we can make it.  This cannot be done on Second Stage and obviously there is political filibustering going on at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage of the debate I suppose it is difficult to add something to what has already been said in the House.  I listened to Deputy Lemass and I was rather amazed that he accused the Opposition of delaying tactics.  I intend to deal in my own way with what is in the Bill, with what I am pleased with and what is not in the Bill and about which I feel disappointed, and I have no apology to offer to Deputy Lemass or anybody <Col N="152" /> else.  It is the duty of public representatives in this House to discuss matters in this House on the basis of their own experience of working in constituencies and to point out to the Minister what their views are.  I am sure the Minister would welcome this, and it is a pity that debate on a Bill such as this could not be discussed above Party politics. I propose to do that as far as I can. However, Deputy Lemass spoke about the delaying tactics of the Opposition Deputies and then proceeded to give us the longest speech we have listened to tonight.  Deputy Lemass should look at his own Party and say why there was a delay, since the White Paper was issued, of three years in producing this Bill.  This Bill is too little and too late.  It is too little because there are things that should be in the Bill that are not in it.  It is too late because it is three years since the White Paper was introduced and people expected much more than was in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stated in his opening remarks that he intends to provide unconditionally medical and dental services for all those people who cannot afford to pay for them.  This is fair enough, but I do not accept that this Bill provides for those people who cannot afford to pay.  In the application of the policy of the Minister about 90 per cent of the population have become ineligible for hospital services and 30 per cent for general practitioner services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is quite a lot of uniformity in the problems with which public representatives are confronted.  I am glad the Minister is here because one problem I should like to bring to his attention is that of hospitalisation.  Public representatives find from time to time that a patient of the lower or middle income group who is sent into hospital is not aware of the services that are provided for him and finds himself in a private or semi-private ward, thus placing himself outside benefit.  I would say that 50 per cent of the people do not understand what they are entitled to.  The doctors who attend patients should tell them what they are entitled to and that, if they go into a private or semi-private ward, this places them outside benefit and that they will have to pay for the <Col N="153" /> hospital services that are provided for them.</P>
    <P>I have known medical card holders, people in the lower income group, to write a letter from a private ward saying they were worried about the bill. While there is a hardship clause in the Bill whereby representations can be made and the Minister's sanction given to the alleviation of hardship, this is a very cumbersome procedure and very few cases get through.  If the people are looking for a private or semi-private ward for purposes of grandeur or any other such reason, then I have no objection to making them pay for it. However, due to the scarcity of hospital beds, people who may be involved in a road accident and who sometimes are removed unconscious to hospital, can find themselves in a private or semi-private ward, and when the bill is produced they have no hope of paying it. The Minister should tell doctors to instruct their patients as to what they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke stated the other night that in his constituency he played a major part in getting patients into hospitals.  I believe that is so, but it is very wrong and an indictment of the system that public representatives should interfere with the admission of patients into hospital.  This arises from overcrowding in all our hospitals.  If a doctor says a patient is entitled to hospital treatment and so certifies him, hospital accommodation should be provided for him and neither public representatives nor anybody else should interfere with that procedure.  I know admission officers in hospitals, house surgeons and hospital authorities are being tormented with this type of thing. I hate to see a situation where public representatives can get political kudos from this.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Cork Health Authority I visit many of the hospitals in the city and county of Cork.  We have a serious problem there in regard to the aged.  Unless we make some accommodation available for them, this is a problem which will always be with us.  Gone is the time, unfortunately, when the younger people took pride in looking after their old people.  For economic, social or other reasons old people are taken into or <Col N="154" /> sent into institutions.  Throughout the country the old district hospital in the town has changed from what it was originally intended for.  They are becoming more or less old people's homes.  In my own town of Macroom there are two hospitals, one of which was the old district hospital and the other was a TB hospital.  The district hospital is now being used for accommodating old people and I believe this is right.  In order to minimise the agony of old people who are taken from their own homes, they should be accommodated in the environment in which they grew up and cared for by the people they know locally.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we have gross overcrowding in Cork Mental Hospital. Longstay patients in mental hospitals become institutionalised.  As a result of representations to the Minister's predecessor, Macroom Hospital was made available to relieve overcrowding in Our Lady's Hospital in Cork and 30 patients were transferred to Macroom. I have seen the difference in these patients as a result of that transfer. It is a classic example of what can be done for the aged by way of rehabilitation. Some of the patients in Macroom are now going out to work for local farmers, earning £1 or 25/- a day.  I believe the same thing could be done in other mental hospitals and hospitals for the aged, thereby relieving overcrowding in these hospitals.</P>
    <P>The Minister or health authorities should provide some allowance for those who care for the aged in their own homes.  Very often, as I said earlier, the aged are removed because of economic reasons.  I came across two cases in the past week in which two old people would have been kept at home had there been some allowance given to enable those looking after them to employ outside help.  One was an old lady of 90 years.  Had there been an allowance she could have been kept at home and outside help employed to look after her.  She was removed to an institution.  This is happening all over the country.  In many cases people have given up their employment to care for aged parents or relatives.  I agree with everything Deputy Andrews said in regard to this matter.  It is bad economics to put an <Col N="155" /> old person into a hospital in which it costs the ratepayers or the taxpayers approximately £9 per week to maintain that old person when, if some allowance were provided which would keep even a tenth of these old people out of institutions, a big saving could be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <P>There is a scheme of assistance in some cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>There is home assistance. I asked the Minister recently if some allowance could be provided and he said he had no power to do so. Someone should provide an allowance.</P>
      <P>One of the things that worry me is the cost of the health services. In 1965-66 the cost was approximately £33 million.  Today it is £51 million. Though the cost has gone up the services have not been extended and very serious problems remain unsolved.  I do not approve of medical cards.  They are a badge of poverty.  They mark those who hold them second-class citizens. Some substitute should be devised. When someone applies for a medical card the home assistance officer investigates the means of the applicant. When an applicant is refused those who made representations on his behalf are not permitted to inspect the documentary evidence submitted. Now it is very difficult for anybody&mdash; home assistance officer or anyone else &mdash;to be conversant with what happens inside a family.  I have known small farmers to be declared ineligible for medical cards because, as a result of their industry, they had got a return from the creamery of £800 or £900 and that was taken into account.  But the cost of producing milk was not taken into account.  These reports should be open to public representatives for inspection, if those public representatives have authority from the applicant to do so.  I feel very strongly about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the abolition of the dispensary system.  In the proposed alternative system how will choice of doctor operate in remote rural areas?  How will a patient living 20 miles from a town have a choice of doctor?  The experience with the medical card-holder <Col N="156" /> in the past was that he or she was not, in fact, availing of the services of the dispensary doctor.  We all know it is necessary to have faith in the family doctor.  If you have not faith in him, you do not have him or want to have him.  I know of quite a number of cases where medical card-holders did not avail of the services they were entitled to from dispensary doctors.</P>
    <P>With regard to drugs and medicines, I understand the Bill to read that, if a medical card-holder goes to a doctor and is in need of drugs and medicines, the prescription will be given to the patient and the patient will go to the local chemist's shop and have this prescription dispensed.  How are the drugs to be provided?  Will the local authority or the chemist provide them? Doctors are always anxious to prescribe the most modern drugs.  Very often the new drugs are no different, except for a more fashionable wrapper or a different name, from drugs already in use.  It is very difficult for the chemist to keep abreast of supplies of all the new drugs coming on the market.  What check is on those drugs? From time to time, one sees the introduction of new drugs to replace old ones.  It is very hard for the small chemist's shop in the outlying villages to keep a wide supply of modern drugs for this service.  Deputy Lemass already referred to the impact of the health charges on the rates.  This is a serious burden because health costs are going up year by year.</P>
    <P>I can remember when a former Minister came down in 1960 to the first meeting of Cork Health Authority.  He was questioned there as to what the impact of health charges would be on the rates.  It is on the records of that meeting that he said it would mean from 2/- to 2/6d in the £; it is now over 30/-.  I believe there is a case to be made for transferring a greater proportion of the charge from the local rates to the Central Fund because a lot of the services provided are regional in character and the Exchequer should bear a greater charge than what they are already doing.  This is the reason Fine Gael are opposed to this Bill: I believe there is good foundation for it. We are all only too well aware of the <Col N="157" /> difficulties amongst ratepayers today in facing the payment of rates.</P>
    <P>There is a completely new approach to mental illness.  I should like a lot more done in that respect.  The most essential thing, in my opinion, is to try to relieve overcrowding.  That could be done by the extension of the local district hospitals.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Desmond mentioned nurses.  I am not too satisfied with the system of recruiting nurses in the Cork Health Authority, particularly in Saint Finbarr's Hospital.  Twice a year, we have approximately 140 applications for 16 vacancies for student nurses. There is a scarcity of nurses.  Whether it is that there is a lack of training facilities for nurses I do not know but there is something wrong with a system where an interview board can select 16 from 140 applicants by a mere interview. Some of the girls who are rejected go over to Britain and return, after three years, fully qualified nurses and can take up a post in the very hospital where they were rejected three years previously.  The Minister should look into that system as there appears to be something wrong with it.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied about the position of people in receipt of disabled persons' maintenance allowances.  I understand that the wording of the Act is that, if a person is not in a position to be maintained by himself or by his immediate relatives, he qualifies for an allowance. Everyone must realise that the day of providing by the immediate relatives is gone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a step in the right direction and I am glad of it.  I believe that people have been rejected because of this who, in fact, would be entitled to an allowance.  I am glad this clause will not now prevent people from benefiting.  When cases were investigated and it was found that maybe a sister or some relative was living with the applicant then the applicant might be deprived of an allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great scarcity of dentists and it is very difficult to provide an adequate dental service.  Our young children should be instructed, even by <Col N="158" /> way of advertisements on television, on how to care for their teeth and on the necessity for such care.  It is terrible to see young people of 14 and 15 years of age with a mouthful of bad teeth. It would be a wise step to have this matter brought to the attention of the children in the schools and, of course, through television and advertisements. It is necessary that there should be a consciousness in their homes of the necessity to provide for the care and protection of their teeth.</P>
    <P>There is nothing further for me to say now because anything else I might say has already been said.  I shall conclude by saying that people expected more from this Bill because, in 1960, when the White Paper was introduced, people expected that certain positive steps would be taken, steps which are now long overdue.  Many of these steps have not yet been taken. I refer especially to the necessity for a change in the dispensary system.  The health authority in Cork have not been able to get dispensary doctors for our dispensaries.  We have even had a situation recently where a doctor was catering for three dispensary districts. One cannot blame doctors for being unwilling to take up temporary appointments.  I am glad there has been some step forward in this respect because it is long overdue.  I trust it will not be long until the dispensary service will completely be changed and our people will enjoy a service of the kind which Fine Gael believe should have been provided for them long ago.</P>

      <P>I lost all the notes but I have made enough of them in the meantime.  I commend this Bill to the House, despite all the literary and historical eloquence of Deputy Ryan.  This Bill consolidates six Acts and it does this for a beginning.  I should like to deal with a few things in the Bill, things that are right, things that are wrong.  It is terribly important that health should be taken out of the realm of politics.  The Minister has said that he is going to have at least 50 per cent of the people on regional boards taken from nominated bodies. I hope when he makes his regulations that he will give sufficient teeth to <Col N="159" /> those boards to make sure they will act.  As I say, like education or anything else, take this out of politics. That is the representative character of this Bill.  We have at the moment a lot of things happening, we have the Fitzgerald Report, the Grey Book and the Brown Book.  We have people cashing in in various ways.  In Mullingar we have Deputy Corish's people cashing in and trying to keep the hospital in Mullingar.  I am not interested in where the hospital is; all I want to see is a man coming home in a car and not in a coffin.  Otherwise, I do not care two hoots what happens.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear the Minister spell out what the community centres will entail.  The phrase &ldquo;community centre&rdquo; is very important.  In this community you will have a complete nexus of people from doctors to patients and so on.  Most important of all, we will have an outpatients service.  These are all spelled out in the report yet we are so terribly narrow-minded that we do not accept this.  We want to have a status symbol in Athlone, Mullingar or wherever it is, but for goodness' sake let us send people home in cars and not in coffins. This is a most important thing to remember and it is the whole implication of the Fitzgerald Report.  I know that what I am saying will be thrown at me in the Westmeath County Council but these things may happen in ten, 20 or 30 years time, for this is a blue-print for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that when the Minister is replying he will emphasise the fact that there will be no downgrading in hospitals.  One other point about regulations. The L &amp; H Deputy over there mentioned doing things by regulation. The Department of Health is an organic, growing thing but no more than a growing child how can you expect to regulate its development if you put it in a straitjacket?  The Minister's regulations will be put on the Table of the House.  As I say, you cannot put a growing organic thing in a straitjacket.  We know how an amendment had to be brought in before because of the straitjacket idea. You must have a broad Act in order <Col N="160" /> to carry out what is visualised in the White Paper and this will carry it out. The Minister will make his regulations and they will be laid on the Table of the House.  I do not see any other way of doing something like this.  It should be remembered that we will still have control over the Minister and if we desire we can challenge the regulations when they are placed on the Table of the House.  You could not hope to carry out a task like this except on the basis on which the Minister is doing it.  As I said before, I would like to see health removed from the realm of politics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to talk it out.  There are plenty to follow me.  I would commend the House to this idea of the community hospital and I would like the Minister to spell out what it means.  We should indulge in no nonsense but we should look after the health of our people. There has been a lot of talk about looking after the aged but, for goodness' sake, can people not look after their fathers and mothers, or what kind of people are they?  The Minister has brought some sanity into this question of eligibility for the health card. This is very important.  Health cards can be got in Westmeath but not in Galway, Roscommon or other places. I also agree with the idea of an appeal but there should not be delays about this.  We know that several months can elapse waiting for a decision.  We know the way in which the Civil Service carries on.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of rates, surely something similar to what they have done in England could be done here?  There should be a re-assessment of the position.  It is most unfair that Leitrim or Mayo should have to pay more than some other counties.  I hope the Minister will indicate how he is going to handle what I will call the health grants.  In Westmeath 54 per cent of the total is involved for the health charges while some counties have a lesser amount and some others a higher amount.  Perhaps the Minister would at least indicate his intentions. Are we to take it that autistic children and other children with mental health problems will be looked after?</P>

      <P>The Minister has listened very carefully to the arguments put up by speakers on both sides of the House and I know that, in common with most of them, he must be rather disappointed with this Bill.  He must realise that due to promises made by his predecessors people were led to expect a different Bill.  But we must be thankful for small mercies and, so far as the Bill aims at doing something in the future for those who need medical services, we must welcome it.</P>
      <P>I, and all who have experience of local authority work, want to see an expansion of the existing services immediately.  We want to see preventive medicine&mdash;which was mentioned by many speakers&mdash;developed because prevention is better than cure and we want every effort made to prevent things happening when they can be prevented.</P>
      <P>In my county, as the Minister probably knows, the dental service is far below strength.  Our schools have only a partial dental service.  The dental service for adults is practically nonexistent. I want to see the school dental service made effective from the day the child reaches school until he leaves school and have it carried from primary through secondary school.  I want pre-school age children examined and given the facilities that exist for school-going children.  Unless we do that&mdash;the Minister must be prepared to do it&mdash;we are leaving a gap in the service at the very beginning.  When the child cannot be examined before going to school he goes to school with flaws and cavities and other defects that take more time to eradicate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Mayo we have a reasonably good ambulance service considering the territory it has to cover but, as the Minister knows, Mayo is not a county; it is a region.  For geographical and other reasons ambulances have long journeys to make.  We hope they can be sited in other areas so that full cover can be effected.  The Minister and the Department are examining the possibility of having a new type of ambulance service to deal with emergencies such as casualties from road crashes and so on. I hope this idea will be pushed forward and that the Minister will try to get <Col N="163" /> agreement between the different people concerned so that we shall have hospitals in strategic positions capable of dealing with this type of casualty and that we shall have an ambulance service fully equipped with radio, oxygen and recuscitation facilities to take people from the crash scene to hospitals designed to deal with them.</P>
    <P>There is a great need for education as regards prevention of diseases.  By that I mean television and radio can be used to bring home to people the facts relating to cancer and diseases of the heart.  The Minister has spoken many times about the dangers of smoking but we have on television today the glamour girls, the sporty youths and the boys who flash along in hot rods and racing cars smoking this or that brand of cigarettes.  The Minister, I know, would like to have this glamourised advertising eliminated but possibly his colleague, the Minister for Finance, might say: &ldquo;Go easy, or I shall have to find £20 million or £30 million from some other source.&rdquo; If the Minister means what he says and if we are to make any impact on the smoking habit&mdash;I think it has been proved beyond doubt that smoking does contribute to an alarming extent to lung cancer&mdash;we must take positive action.  If we are not sincere in this our young people will continue to go on committing suicide.  This is something we should push forward.  We have the means in radio and television and no effort should be spared to ensure that the message reaches all concerned.</P>
    <P>The same type of education can be given in regard to heart disease, the dangers of overweight, of doing this or that that might contribute to developing heart disease or conditions leading to it.  We can also use our newspapers to publicise the facts. Adult education in these facts is, I consider, one of the most important things needed.  There is much woolly thinking about these matters and many do not realise that by being careful, by taking exercise, eating the right kind of food, keeping down weight and so on they could be happier and healthier and there would not be so much money needed from the Exchequer <Col N="164" /> to pay for hospital services they might incur later.</P>
    <P>Seminars for adults should be held throughout the country with doctors and nurses and other experts attending to explain to the public all the dangers involved.  In the case of drugs I think it is also necessary to make a big effort. I know that a great deal cannot be done on television because of the danger that telling youth about all the factors involved might possibly make the position worse.  But seminars should be held to explain to adults and parents the dangers of drugs and what they lead to.  The sooner this is done the better.  It should bring good results.</P>
    <P>The Hospital Sweepstakes have contributed substantially to our hospital and health services being generally up to the present standard.  Not only the general public here but people in many lands have contributed to this.  Money has been flowing in from all the countries of the world to enable us to provide hospitals and services for our people.  I should like to see something being done by us in return.  Coming from the western seaboard I know that one of the greatest causes of anxiety and pain and the cause of the greatest loss in man hours is rheumatism in all its allied forms.  The time has come when this country can make a contribution to world health by establishing a research unit to study the disease. By doing this, we would be only repaying the people of the world for all the money they have sent to us, whether it was sent legally or illegally makes no difference.  A research unit could be set up in the west of Ireland, in, say, Castlebar or Galway.</P>
    <P>I know that there are people in this country engaged in research into this disease and those, together with people from outside the country, could examine the situation.  It is known that rheumatism in its many forms can be prevented if the knowledge is available and the right type of education given to the people.  The Minister will agree that, since we have many suffers of this disease living on the western seaboard, the west of Ireland would be a suitable place to establish a research unit.  It is not possible for us to do much as regards cancer <Col N="165" /> research.  There are other people who have greater finances and better facilities at their disposal for doing this, but we could do something very effective with regard to research into rheumatic diseases.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to appoint regional boards to take over the work formerly carried out by local authorities and we are told that boards will have certain powers.  If the Minister attempts to push this idea down the throats of local authorities, without first explaining very carefully what this will mean, the consequences may not be so good. The Minister must decide that representation from the local authorities will be composed of members of all Parties in proportion to their strength in the local authorities.  Otherwise there will be trouble which the Minister does not readily recognise and this will not help in getting public opinion to accept the new changes because there will have to be a big break through before the proposals are accepted.</P>
    <P>In concluding, I wish the Minister well with the Bill and I hope he will take into consideration the points that have been mentioned to him.</P>

      <P>We have had a few milestones to health legislation since this Dáil was established but I suppose that the 1953 Act could be regarded as being the most important milestone in health legislation up to now.  In that particular piece of legislation we got away from the poor law system.  One of the big things in that legislation was the abolition of the red ticket. There was an attempt to get away from the pauper idea of a health service.  We have been consistent in this House from our Party's point of view in progressive legislation, particularly in the fields of social welfare and health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a great controversy in 1953 about the then Health Act.  Looking back now it was a very mild piece of legislation, but all sorts of people saw great difficulties and even dangers in it.  Some considered it to be an infringement of the rights of the individual and of the community <Col N="166" /> in general.  We supported that legislation. We supported the Fianna Fáil Government who introduced it.  But, I regret to say, that there has been little if any progress since the enactment of the 1953 Bill.  There has, of course, been progress in the treatment of disease. But this has resulted, not from anything the Department of Health have done, but from the efforts made in the field of research and in the improvements in medicines, drugs and treatment.  Deputy Noel Lemass said that progress can only be made step by step, but the steps we have made during the past 16 years have been very small.  At the same time, I readily admit that the 1953 Act was a substantial improvement.  However, there has been dissatisfaction from the time of the enactment of that Act; one of the things which brought about some of this dissatisfaction was the eligibility of people to qualify for medical cards.</P>
      <P>In this legislation, the Minister is proposing to do something about that. This will be welcomed by all Deputies and by all public representatives because one of the questions we cannot answer, when we are asked, is: who is entitled to medical care?  We can tell people immediately if they are entitled to non-contributory old age pensions or certain other benefits, but people are very surprised when those who help in making the laws of the country cannot state specifically who is entitled to a medical card.  When we are asked that question we have to say that we do not know the manager's decision.  This is very annoying to people who believe that by reason of their contribution to taxation or, particularly, their contribution in insurance stamps they should benefit.  Of course, this is a wrong notion.  They believe that because they are stamping a card they are entitled to all benefits; but the sooner they get this out of their heads the better for themselves and for those of us who have to explain it to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil and the various Ministers for Health have been dragging their feet in respect of health legislation. In 1961, health was one of the most important issues in the election <Col N="167" /> campaign.  It was regarded as such by every Party.  In 1961, in order to satisfy some of the Independent Members and, I suppose, to seek their support, the then Minister for Health, Deputy MacEntee, decided that there would be a select committee appointed to inquire into the workings of the Health Act. This suggested improvements but, unfortunately, that select committee broke up, having met infrequently during a period of five or six years.  It was so bad that the Labour Party representatives withdrew because it appeared to them that Deputy MacEntee was reluctant to make any changes whatsoever.</P>
    <P>We placed a lot of faith in the late Deputy Donogh O'Malley when he produced <Col N="168" /> the White Paper in 1966 and, even at this stage, we would place faith in the present Minister for Health, hoping that he would be prepared to accept worthwhile amendments.  This brings me to a point made by Deputy Paddy Lenihan, when he said that we should take health out of politics. Everything we do in this House is political and we should not regard the word in the same way as people outside do.  We should, on all sides of the House, try to make this Bill a better one.  However, we will disagree on fundamentals.</P>
