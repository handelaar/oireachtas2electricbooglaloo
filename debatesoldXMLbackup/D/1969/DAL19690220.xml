      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The first and most important purpose of the Bill is to make provision for further grants to Córas Tráchtála to enable that body to continue the work of promoting, assisting and developing Irish exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Export Promotion Act, 1959, under which Córas Tráchtála were established, fixed at £1 million the total amount of grants which might be made to the board out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  This sum was raised to £2.5 million by the Export Promotion (Amendment) Act, 1963 and to £4.5 million by the Export Promotion (Amendment) Act, 1967. Payments to Córas Tráchtála to date out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas total £4,171,885 leaving a balance <Col N="1378" /> of only £328,115 unissued from the existing statutory limit of £4.5 million.</P>
    <P>With the increasing pace of expenditure on export promotion, it is necessary to ask the Oireachtas to provide for a further £4.5 million to meet the board's requirements for the next few years.  The Bill proposes to raise to £9 million the aggregate amount of grants that may be made to the board.</P>
    <P>Since they were established as a limited liability company in 1951 and as a statutory board in 1959, Córas Tráchtála have played an important part in the development of exports particularly exports of industrial goods through the provision of a wide range of aids and services for exporters.  The demand for these services has been increasing year by year, and the increase in the demands by exporters on Córas Tráchtála has been extremely steep over the past few years.  This has been reflected in the increase in exports, particularly of industrial goods.  Since 1963, for example, total exports have risen from £199 million to £365 million an increase of more than 80 per cent. Industrial exports in the same period more than doubled, rising from £67 million to an estimated £167 million.</P>
    <P>The aids and services made available by Córas Tráchtála are kept under review to ensure that the services most urgently needed by exporters are provided in the manner and in the measure that will be most useful. Recently a whole range of additional aids and services was introduced to encourage greater market diversification and, as far as possible, to reduce dependence on the British market.</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála must continue to play a vital role in the development of the national economy.  To do so they must have adequate funds at their disposal.  It is for this purpose that I recommend provision for an additional £4.5 million.  The actual provision to be made in each financial year out of this amount will be included in the Vote for my Department which will come before the Dáil in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>The principal function of Córas Tráchtála as provided by the Export Promotion Act, 1959 is &ldquo;to promote, assist and develop exports&rdquo;.  As this <Col N="1379" /> statutory function refers only to export of goods, the various aids and services which Córas Tráchtála provide for exporters are not available to exporters of services.  It is considered desirable that the aids and services provided by the board should be available for design and planning services, the work on the rendering of which is carried out in the State in connection with engineering and constructional works executed outside the State.  The second purpose of the Bill, therefore, is to provide enabling power for the board to assist architects and engineers practising in the State in relation to the rendering of these services for overseas clients.  It will, of course, be a matter for the board to consider how best they can use this additional power. No doubt they will have in mind that an Irish consultant, architect or engineer working on an overseas project could influence the purchase of Irish goods and materials for that project by making positive recommendations to the client that Irish goods of the required quality and price could be obtained or by specifying goods to Irish standard.  At the very least, a consultant could bring Irish materials to the attention of a client, contractor etc.  There would, of course, be a direct flow of income into the country in the form of fees in respect of overseas design and planning services and these fees could become a not insignificant item in our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>It is with confidence that I recommend to the Dáil the making of provision for additional funds for Córas Tráchtála for some years ahead and the provision for assistance by the board of design and planning services for overseas projects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House welcome this Bill.  As far as we are concerned we have, since the foundation of the State, welcomed any Bill that can help to promote, assist, or develop exports, give employment to our people at home and raise the standard of living.  We are glad to see that the amount of money for Córas Tráchtála has been raised steadily until now the Minister is seeking a further £4.5 millions.  We know that in this country we live by our exports. <Col N="1380" /> Unfortunately, if we cannot provide employment for our boys and girls they have to emigrate but if we can encourage greater exports this will not happen.  We are also glad to note the increase in exports which has taken place since 1963.  Some of us, indeed, are very glad to note the huge increase that has taken place even since 1947. I remember that our total exports in 1932, despite all that was then said, were £36 million and after 16 years, despite the fact that the prices of out exports to Britain and other countries doubled because of the war, total exports in 1947 were still only £38 million or £39 million.  Indeed, were it not for the fact that prices had increased we might only have been exporting £30 million or £35 million worth of goods.  We know the huge increase in our exports which took place immediately after that.  As far as we are concerned we want to give full credit to the present Minister for Industry and Commerce for what he has done over the past few years and for what he is doing.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that:</P>
      <P>The aids and services made available by Córas Tráchtála are kept under review to ensure that the services most urgently needed by exporters are provided in the manner and in the measure that will be most useful.  Recently a whole range of additional aids and services was introduced to encourage greater market diversification and, as far as possible, to reduce dependence on the British market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome that because if we look at our trade returns with many European and East-European countries we find that in some cases we are buying twice, three times and sometimes four or five times, as much from them as they are buying from us.  We believe that a greater effort should be made through our embassies or whatever contacts we have abroad to sell more of our produce to those countries.  Many of us believe that in our embassies we should have more trained, aggressive young salesmen to promote the sale of our exports.  I am one of those who are inclined to condemn what is happening in our embassies today.  We are <Col N="1381" /> too inclined to imitate the great Powers who have diplomats attending various functions and it would be much better if we had these trained, promotional salesmen who would use every opportunity to promote the sale of our produce. I am also glad to see that in this Bill provision is made for assisting architects and engineers practising in the State in relation to the rendering of services for overseas clients.  Any money spent in that way will be money well spent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Córas Tráchtála has performed a pretty good function for this country but I have some slight criticism to make in that from my own experience I found that, in the past anyway, they were more concerned with huge export projects rather than with smaller industries which were likely to develop, which were based on Irish raw materials and which would build up not very big quantities of exports but a multiplication of exports.  I felt for a long time&mdash;and I think I am pushing an open door here with the present Minister&mdash;that it is the smaller type of industry with wider diversification which is going to be more beneficial to our economy than some of the gigantic attempts made in the past by the Minister's predecessor, the exTaoiseach, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, to turn this country into a sort of industrial United States of America, which, of course, would be quite impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the change of policy on the part of the Minister.  I also welcome his statement regarding the diversification of our exports so that we would not be left entirely dependent on the British market.  That, of course, is long overdue but, unfortunately, we waited until we were kicked twice in the teeth by the British before this definite action or policy was brought into effect.  At one time the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement was thought to be the be all and the end all of our export problems and I am sure the activities of Córas Tráchtála were directed along those lines.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has now recognised that we must seek other export outlets and seek them as soon as possible so that we will not be entirely dependent on one <Col N="1382" /> market.  I think that if personal opinions were expressed in the House one would find agreement on this from all sides.</P>
    <P>It might be helpful to Deputies as a whole if the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when replying, gave us some details about the diversification of exports.  I know that there is a considerable drive to export to the United States which is a market of enormous potential and which as far as we are concerned is practically untapped.  I know too, that there are attempts being made, although there are difficulties in the way, to export to the European Economic Community.  If I were to direct my remarks to the European would be here most of the day because we have been led to believe that all sorts of wonderful things will be forthcoming arising from our entrance to this great purchasing body and which, of course, has not come to fruition.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us the type of export he has in mind. In my constituency of Wexford we have a small industry manufacturing Aran sweaters.  It was started by an American.  Unfortunately, he returned to the United States because there was not enough money in it for him.  It was taken over by an Irishman and the exports are now going to the United States free of tariff.  I cite this case as an example of the type of export that can be beneficial and the kind of export which removes us from dependence on the British market.  Perhaps the Minister, when he comes to reply, would give us a brief résumé as to what his intentions are.  I know he is very interested in the small industries project. He told us at the Wexford Chamber of Commerce the other day that this project is being extended to our area.  As Wexford generally gets everything last, I take it that means that the project will be extended to the whole country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will have far-reaching effects within the next few years on our drive to increase exports and also on our drive to attract industries to this country.  In the 1959 Act, under which Córas Tráchtála was <Col N="1383" /> established, a sum of £1 million was made available for grants.  In the 1953 Act it was raised to £2½ million and in the 1967 Act it was raised to £4½ million. It is gratifying to note that it is now proposed to provide a further £4½ million to meet the board's requirements over the next few years.  This is surely an indication of the intention of the Minister and the Government and, indeed, all concerned, to make an all-out drive during the next few years to promote sales abroad and attract more industries to this country.</P>
      <P>From my own small dealings with Córas Tráchtála I know they are doing a tremendous job.  At the moment they are carrying out surveys abroad to assist a few people in South Kerry who are interested in starting industries on their own.  It is a great advantage to these to have an organisation like Córas Tráchtála to carry out detailed surveys so that such people will know, before they commence operations, what the markets are likely to be.  Then, when they get the green light, they can start their industries with confidence.</P>
      <P>We have heard in recent times a certain amount of criticism of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement. As far as we are concerned in Kerry, we have known nothing but good to come out of this Agreement. In my own town of Killarney we had a major industry started there within the last 18 months.  This industry came to Killarney directly as a result of the Free Trade Area Agreement.  There are at the moment a number of industrialists interested in establishing industries in South Kerry because of the facilities available to them following on this agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on the initiative he has taken with regard to small industrial projects. In outlying areas these are the only industries which will keep the people at home, develop and re-animate the areas.  Recently we had inquiries from industrialists but we were, unfortunately, not able to make available to these industrialists all the female labour they required.  That is a problem in many areas.  It is difficult to get sufficient girls for factory work, even <Col N="1384" /> in areas where the ratio of male to female labour would be fifty-fifty.  We have no difficulty in supplying all the male labour required.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to compliment the Minister, the Industrial Development Authority, Foras Tionscal and Córas Tráchtála for the particular interest they are showing in Kerry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right that we should express our appreciation of the tremendous work Córas Tráchtála are doing in furthering the progress of our exports.  The success of that body, particularly in recent times, is indeed very striking.  It is a tribute to the enthusiasm, efficiency and dedication of the officers of the board. There is no doubt whatever that, despite what might be said about economic development and economic expansion, and despite the fact that approaches to economic development and economic expansion may differ from Party to Party, there is one aspect on which there is absolute agreement, not merely here but throughout the country, and that is the absolute need for an expansion of exports if this country is to survive as an economic entity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála, like other State bodies, comes in for a good deal of criticism, much of it unfounded, but the fact that our exports have now reached a figure of £365 million, or £1 million a day, is a very significant development.  Perhaps the Minister, as Minister responsible for Industry and Commerce and particularly for the promotion of exports, would be able to assist Córas Tráchtála in trying to break into new markets by making more frequent trips abroad.  I am not in any way advocating that he should go traipsing over Europe &mdash;I do not know his personal view on this&mdash;but seriously, I have seen the approach made by the Northern Ireland Government in Britain on the matter of exports where they make an all-out effort in a particular centre.  For instance in April this year there will be an Ulster week in Birmingham and later on in Sheffield.  In order to assist Córas Tráchtála to break into new <Col N="1385" /> markets with our exports I think the Minister should be present for the initial effort.</P>
    <P>There is much talk about diversification of production.  On yesterday's paper I read where Mr. Ivor Kenny of the Irish Management Institute expressed concern about the lack of diversification and technology in Irish industry and said this called for serious concern.  Just as there is need for diversification of production at home there is need for diversification of markets but while it may be important to seek markets other than Britain so that we would not have all our eggs in one basket, we must not forget that the British market is our most important market and that there is still considerable potential there for industrial exports.</P>
    <P>Personally, I have had some contact with the officials of Córas Tráchtála in seeking advice for industrialists in my constituency and I can say that the service provided by Córas Tráchtála is absolutely spot-on.  Some months ago an industrialist who was going to Sweden to explore a market asked me to contact Córas Tráchtála for certain information.  In five minutes, by telephone, technical information regarding customs duties and various other aspects of the trade in the country to which my friend was going, was supplied so that he was able to leave fully armed with all the facts.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure of visiting the Córas Tráchtála Office in Manchester and also in London and I cannot speak too highly of the tremendous sense of dedication of the officials attached to Córas Tráchtála there.  From what I can gather from discussions I have had with Irish exporters the picture is the same in all the other export markets. I think anything this House can do to assist Córas Tráchtála should be done and I welcome the Bill which provides additional finance for them to enable them particularly to explore and develop new export markets.  I wish the board every success in its future efforts and I am sincerely grateful to the various officials with whom I have had contact for their courtesy and the assistance they extended to me.</P>
    <Col N="1386" />
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> I also welcome this Bill because any financial assistance we can give to Córas Tráchtála is money well spent.  As other speakers have already said, the board's record has been phenomenal.  We have now reached am export level of £1 million a day which is in no small measure due to the efforts of Córas Tráchtála.  This is something of which we can be really proud.</P>
      <P>As other Deputies said, we must try to diversify our exports.  Over the past few years we have been running into certain difficulties as a result of the decisions of the British Government and we should try to secure markets outside Britain.  I think Córas Tráchtála should, therefore, direct their attention to other countries and see how we can utilise our embassies more as trade legations.  Perhaps we could send trained personnel to these embassies which already exist.  They could be very easily utilised for the purpose of exploring markets and in this way Córas Tráchtála could see what potential existed for our industries in other countries.</P>
      <P>It is very easy for big industries to start up and carry out independent research abroad but this is a different problem for small industries.  Where you have industries of the £40,000, £50,000 or £60,000 magnitude, it is not so easy for them to have research done as regards the potential for them in foreign markets.  I think Córas Tráchtála should pay particular attention to the needs of small industries specialising in certain products and encourage them by seeing how they can be helped to sell their goods abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By and large, nobody can deny that this would be great encouragement. We all realise that it is through the expansion of industry that we hope to maintain our employment.  We know there will be a gradual reduction in agricultural employment and that we must depend entirely on industry to absorb the surplus and provide employment for them.  Therefore, we must seriously consider how we can expand industry, encourage new industries and new capital to the country.  Córas <Col N="1387" /> Tráchtála is one State body that has certainly not failed in its duty to encourage new industries.  I have heard them praised by any manufacturers to whom I have spoken.  In the past six months I know of one company starting here and they had every praise for Córas Tráchtála and the help they gave.  This concern was amazed to find that all this help was available for them.  They have now started their industry and are opening very shortly. They are very pleased with the consideration they have been given.</P>
    <P>The Minister is doing everything possible and taking a very keen interest in the small industries programme. We should carry out more research into the possibilities of diversifying our exports so as not to have all our eggs in one basket&mdash;which is too risky&mdash;and so achieve a sense of security.  I know that it is difficult and expensive to initiate research abroad but, irrespective of the cost, I think the sense of security that would develop as a result would be worth while.  We should try to advance along these lines. If we do fail it will not be for the want of any effort on the part of Córas Tráchtála.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should start by expressing my thanks to the various Deputies who have spoken and who have practically unanimously, I think, stated their view of the activities of Córas Tráchtála in a favourable manner. I must say I concur in that view. I have said in this House before that I think they are doing an excellent job. Of course, like anyone else, one could find flaws with some of their activities and say they could be improved.  It would be strange if that were not so. But, by and large, they are doing an excellent job and many other countries envy us because we have available to our exporters the type of expertise and dedication which we get from most of our employees in the field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering this whole matter of our exports and the spectacular achievements which are to the credit of Córas Tráchtála, one should not lose sight of the fact that the basic cause of this increase is the activities of the exporters <Col N="1388" /> themselves.  They would probably be the first to tell us that their activities have been very considerably aided and enhanced by the assistance they have received from Córas Tráchtála.</P>
    <P>In moving the Second Reading I mentioned&mdash;and a number of Deputies have referred to it&mdash;the necessity for diversification of our markets.  I do not think it is necessary for me to dwell on that necessity.  It is clear to everyone concerned that for the foreseeable future the British market will be our major market.  That is a fact which everyone must accept.  It is also clear that to the extent that we can diversify our exports into markets other than Britain we are insuring ourselves against the risk of damage in that major market.</P>
    <P>I should not like it to be thought that this was a recent development or a recent realisation, or that it was only recently that we first wakened up, so to speak, to the necessity for the diversification. That is not so.  Efforts have been made for many years to diversify our markets.  Deputies will appreciate that, having regard to the nature of our economy, where agricultural exports form a considerable portion of our exports and where markets other than the traditional markets for our agricultural produce are very difficult to come by, to a great extent the diversification open to us is in the field of industrial exports.  In that regard I might, perhaps, give some figures taken from the annual report of Córas Tráchtála, to give some idea of what has been going on in the past in regard to diversification. I am quoting now from page 10 of the annual report for 1967:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the slight increase in the percentage of total exports going to Britain and Northern Ireland, the long-term trend has been towards higher exports to third markets of goods other than live animals. Between 1957 and 1967, all such exports (including those from Shannon) increased from £76.9 million to £264.2 million.  Exports to Britain and Northern Ireland advanced from £53 million to £163 million, or by 207.5 per cent; those going to other markets were up from £23.9 million to 323.4 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1389" /> I mention this merely to show that this trend has been going on.  We have been endeavouring to encourage it for a long time.  The recent imposition by the British of the deposit scheme underlines even further the necessity for diversification and, in that connection, Córas Tráchtála have announced special measures to further the diversification process.  These measures include the appointment of a special representative of Córas Tráchtála in Eastern Europe, and the appointment of additional representatives in other countries, representatives who would specialise in certain sectors of industry, particularly in engineering where we think there is a good field for development of our exports to places other than Britain especially, perhaps, Germany and the United States.  A special trade mission to Australia organised by Córas Tráchtála is about to set out, if it has not already gone.  I think it is about now it is going.  I am confident that the result will be well worth-while. Special measures are being taken to improve and strengthen our participation in trade fairs abroad, and improved grants are made available now to encourage travel by exporters to develop markets in places other than Britain and Northern Ireland.  These are just some of the things that are being done to help the diversification process.  I would remind the House that we are trammelled to the extent that most of the diversification we can do is confined to industrial exports.</P>
    <P>Another point made was the necessity for assistance for small exporters or small industrialists who might be able to export.  That is something with which I agree entirely.  Obviously the owner of a small firm who has not been in the export market is presented with quite a lot of difficulty if he decides to go into the export market.  He has not the resources available to enable him to carry out a market survey. Sometimes he does not even know how to go about the job.  Despite that, a number of small firms have succeeded in exporting successfully.  Deputies will be aware that CT have embarked on a special campaign to get at industrialists, large and small, who have not been exporting in the past but who <Col N="1390" /> seem to be capable of exporting, to do so.  It was roughly estimated that there were about 1,100 firms potentially capable of exporting who were not exporting. In that connection, Córas Tráchtála have been organising meetings with these people in different parts of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister is there any intention to establish a section in Córas Tráchtála parallel with the small industries section in the IDA to have specific care for small industries which might have an export potential?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, Córas Tráchtála is tied in with that scheme in the sense that there is an advisory committee with a small industries programme on which Córas Tráchtála are represented and, where it appears in connection with any project under that programme that it has a potential for export, Córas Tráchtála take over that aspect and the advice available to Córas Tráchtála is given to the applicant.  It has been so designed as to bring in Córas Tráchtála where they can operate.</P>
      <P>I was saying that Córas Tráchtála have been holding quite a number of meetings round the country with different firms.  I understand, in fact, they have had 400 firms represented at these area meetings; 160 firms have been interviewed and there has been follow-up again on that.  It is hoped to secure most of them as new exporters this year&mdash;people who will be exporting for the first time.  A number of these are, of course, small firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that Córas Tráchtála has a special care for new exporters and for small exporters. Within its field of operations within this country, it certainly gives a special care to new and small exporters.  The idea that they do not cater especially for the small exporter could arise from their activities abroad.  Where they have to expend money abroad on, say, trade fairs and promotions of that kind, very often there are some suitable ways in which they could do this which they do not do solely for the reason that another approach by them would yield greater results, in their view, and, of course, the amount <Col N="1391" /> of money available to them is limited. The more money they get, the more they can spend.  They have a budget&mdash; not an ungenerous one, I think.  Within that, they must choose the kind of promotions that will in their view yield the greatest results.  That means that they have on occasions to exclude promotions which would yield some results, and are good in themselves, but are not as good as the ones they pick.  This sometimes leads to a mistaken impression that they are not interested in that kind of promotion. If that happens to include a number of small exporters, the idea might get abroad that they were not interested in small exporters but, in fact, nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    <P>Some reference has been made to the role of our embassies in connection with exports and trade orientation.  Of course, the position will differ from embassy to embassy.  I must say that my own experience is that, in practically all of these cases, there is a very considerable emphasis on trade.  A very considerable effort is made to assist the development of our exports.  I think that the picture of any of our embassies being concerned solely with matters of high politics and cocktail parties is an unfair picture and just is not true.  Of necessity, they have to indulge in a certain amount of that: it is part of the reason they are there.  My impression is that all of them may be more effective than others in their activities.  This may be for purely personal reasons with people who operate in the respective embassies.  I should also like to make clear that, for a number of years, all the recruits to the Department of External Affairs get special training in connection with trade and, indeed, spend some time in factories around the country before they are sent abroad.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde said one thing to which I should like to reply, just to keep the record straight. He referred to my personal interest in small industries, which is true.  I have a great personal interest in this project because I have great belief in its efficacy for the future and for our particular problems.  He went on from <Col N="1392" /> there to read into this a change of policy from previous years and thought that the emphasis now is on small industry and is being taken away from large industry.  I want to refute that. It is not so.  What has happened is that we are putting an emphasis on small industry which was not there but we are not by any means reducing our interest in large industry: we cannot afford to do that.  Our efforts to develop larger scale industry are, in fact, being stepped up, as well as, what may be regarded as somewhat new, a greater stress on small industry but there is no question of changing our policy with regard to larger scale industry.</P>
    <P>I do not know that there is any other point to which the House will expect me to give a reply.  I thank the Deputies who have spoken for their remarks in regard to Córas Tráchtála.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1394" /> The Insurance Act, 1953, provided power for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to give guarantees with respect to the insurance of risks in connection with exports.  The Act provides that arrangements for the giving of export guarantees may include agreements with assurance companies for the re-insurance of guarantees given by them.  In exercise of these powers an agreement was entered into with a group of Irish insurance companies for the re-insurance of political risks insurance policies issued by them.  These policies provide exporters with cover against the risk of loss due to such causes as action by foreign governments preventing the transfer of payment for goods to Ireland.  Only in an exceptional case have these powers been used to insure commercial risks which are normally left to commercial insurance companies.</P>
    <P>The guarantees which I am empowered to give under the 1953 Act must be for the purpose of encouraging exports.  I have had representations concerning the need for similar guarantees in connection with design and planning services carried out by Irish firms for principals outside the State. I am advised, however, that my powers under the Insurance Act, 1953, do not extend to giving guarantees in connection with the rendering of services unconnected with external trade in goods or merchandise.  I consider that it is desirable that I should have power to give guarantees with respect to the insurance of risks in connection with the carrying out of desing and planning services for principals outside the State similar to the powers which I have to give guarantees with respect to the insurance of risks in connection with the export of goods.  The first purpose of this amending Bill is to extend the powers conferred on the Minister for Industry and Commerce by the Insurance Act, 1953, to cover design and planning services, the work on the rendering of which is carried out in the State in connection with engineering or constructional works executed outside the State.</P>
    <P>In the Insurance Act, 1953, the aggregate amount of the liability at <Col N="1395" /> any time of the Minister for principal moneys in respect of arrangements under the Act was fixed at £2 million. In 1961 the Oireachtas increased the limit to £5 million.  This is just barely sufficient to meet the present level of demand for export guarantees under the arrangements in force.  I consider it necessary that the statutory limit of £5 million should be raised in order to provide for the growing demand for insurance cover for exports of goods arising from the increased volume of exports and also to provide for any liabilities that might be assumed on the guarantees in relation to the design and planning services.  I think that £10 million is a suitable figure.  The aggregate potential liability would, of course, become an actual liability only if all the risks covered by the insurance policies materialise.  As Deputies will appreciate, that is an extremely remote contingency.</P>
    <P>The present Bill will facilitate the expansion of our exports by making possible the continuance on an increasing scale of insurance cover for exporters of goods and the provision of insurance cover in relation to design and planning services for overseas clients.  The risks to be covered which are inseparable from export trade are mainly risks of the type that cannot normally be covered by insurance or otherwise guarded against by commercial means.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House welcome this Bill.  It is an extension of the 1953 Act as the Minister has pointed out.  In the past Córas Tráchtála provided insurance for all commodities, for goods and for services exported abroad.  It is the intention of this Bill to apply this also to architects and to engineers</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe that this is money well spent.  As the Minister stated, it will help to bring money into this country in the form of fees in respect of overseas design and planning services and these fees could be of great significance in helping to right our balance of payments and I suppose the money could also be used to help give employment to our own people in our own country.  We on this side of the <Col N="1396" /> House are 100 per cent in favour of that.  I remember Deputy Sweetman and the late Deputy William Norton in 1956 bringing in a Bill to give inducements to foreign industrialists and to others to invest money here and to give employment to our people. At that time one of the first to come in was the Whitegate Oil Refinery which brought £12 million and gave employment to 500 or 600 Irish people. We all know that Irish boys and girls have brains and ability.  Our missionaries blazed the trail in years gone by and we have no doubt that our architects and engineers can also blaze trails abroad and, as the Minister pointed out, can help abroad by seeing that Irish materials and Irish goods are purchased.  Indeed, they can be very valuable ambassadors.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that at the present time almost two-thirds of our graduates, having been educated here, must emigrate.  It is a pity that this unfortupower is lost to Ireland.  It is unfortunate that we have this brain drain. Anything that this Minister or this Government or any Government of this country can do to give direct or even indirect employment to those people will be welcomed by this side of the House.  We welcome this Bill. We wish the Minister and Córas Tráchtála every success in the future with it.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I would like to support this Bill too.  We in the Labour Party are anxious that all guarantees should be given to encourage exports.  Exports. of course, are the life of the country.</P>
      <P>I have two questions to put to the Minister.  First, what kind of demand was made in the past on this fund by commercial firms?  Secondly, what amount has the Minister in mind to cover design and planning?  It seems to me that there is a very slight risk on that particular side.  I should like to know if he has a figure in mind.  How much does he think in his own mind should cover design and planning?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> I, too, have one or two questions.  How much of the £5 million did it cost the State at that time?  Was <Col N="1397" /> any of it availed of?  I can quite appreciate the necessity for insurance.  Does this also cover political insurance, especially companies that are exporting to countries where there is political unrest?  Does the Bill cover this type of export?  I think this is desirable. Some of our companies may be exporting to countries where there is political unrest.  I am sure the Bill has this in mind.  I welcome the Bill and I think it is desirable that our exporters should be covered especially where there is any type of risk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for the reception of this Bill.  It will, of course, be clear that it is tied in with the previous Bill we dealt with in connection with exports.</P>
      <P>The Bill has two objectives&mdash;one increasing the amount which I may guarantee and the other the extension of the arrangements to the design and planning by people operating within the State on construction abroad.  With regard to the first one, the question of the amount, I am not in a position to answer the question put by Deputy Kyne exactly but I may be able to give some indication of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At 31st March, 1968, the maximum potential liability of the Minister under the arrangements made under the 1953 Act was £4.6 million which left a balance of only £400,000 uncommitted from the statutory limit.  The amount of the maximum potential liability of the Minister varies at any time up and down according to the number of political risks insurance policies in force at a particular time.  At the 30th June, 1968, the maximum potential liability of the Minister stood at £3.9 million. Guarantees which have been issued since then are likely to bring the aggregate potential liability very close to the statutory limit of £5 million.  I cannot say what figure we could put in in respect of the liability under design and planning, but I agree with the Deputy that the figure is likely to be fairly small.  It does seem clear from the growth of exports, from the figures that are quoted, and from the fact that we are having some success in trying to diversify some of our exports with a consequent greater demand for political <Col N="1398" /> risks insurance, that the liability is likely to go up, mainly in respect of the export of goods rather than services. The figure of an additional £5 million was arrived at having regard to the necessity for keeping the matter under the control of the Oireachtas by bringing it in again from time to time.  As I say, I cannot give the exact figures which were requested.</P>
    <P>On the question of what has been done in the Bill about the extension of the guarantees to planning and design services, there is just one point I ought to make clear, that is, that there is no intention of expecting Irish architects or engineers to specify inferior goods for contracts which they would undertake abroad.  They cannot do this if they are to observe their professional standards.  I want to make it quite clear that we are not expecting them to do that.  What we are expecting and hoping they will do, when they undertake contracts, is to ensure that the Irish manufacturer will get the opportunity of supplying his goods when they are at least as effective as foreign ones.  In a number of cases Irish-produced goods are superior to many that are specified.  We are not expecting any concession for Irish manufacturers in this regard other than the opportunity to have their goods used if they are equal or superior to what might otherwise be specified.</P>

      <P>Last night I had been referring to the general temptation to bring a legal interpretation to bear on the subject to industrial relations, and suggested that there were dangers in it.  I was saying that what we should be doing in the course of this Bill is looking at the whole course of our industrial society, and I was referring to the workers' democracy policy of the Labour Party in this connection.  I had been criticising some ill-founded attacks which had been made in this House on that policy by both the Fine Gael Party and the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>I said last night we had no resentment of criticism which was founded on what, in fact, we said and what our policy was.  What we resented was attacks founded on what people imagined we said, for their own political purposes.  I remarked that in relation to the fundamental conflict in Irish industry, this economic conflict at the basis of so much disorder in our industrial society, our workers' democracy policy pamphlet was a contribution towards the creation of a new situation.  We think that the state of civil war which exists in industry at present calls for changes as fundamental as those we advocate in our policy document.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that that document has been greeted in the way it has been by the leading politicians of the other two Parties in this House.  The Taoiseach has seen a total deprivation of freedom involved in this document, whereas, as we have been saying, the whole point in the document is to give as much freedom as possible to workers in industry.  If our document can be attacked on any basis it can surely be attacked on the lines of giving too much freedom to the majority of those involved in industry.  The very last thing the document can be criticised for is any suggestion of the limitation of freedom.  The whole document is inspired by the idea of giving dignity and meaning back to work in industry. Nothing less than a programme designed to bring about such a situation in industry will get the industrial peace that all of us desire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in thinking that the conflict can be resolved by tinkering <Col N="1400" /> around and pretending the problem does not exist, because the problem undoubtedly does exist.  A great deal of research would be needed but the experience of other countries suggests that the worker in modern industry feels himself more and more a creature of impersonal powers, more and more part of the machine he is tending.  He is deprived of any human significance whatever.  He is asked to produce more and yet at his place of work he is not given the status a human being should be given.</P>
    <P>I was saying our document has been attacked as being Utopian.  Before universal suffrage was brought in, that was Utopia.  There were in the Parliament of those days gentlemen who said that society would be wrecked if the vote were given to every adult in the country.  They foresaw red revolution if universal suffrage came in.  It is understandable that the conservatives in our day should attack proposals to give the greatest possible amount of freedom to workers in industry.  This attack has come from all parts of this House.</P>
    <P>As I remarked last night, all of us here are supposed to subscribe to the idea of political democracy in a parliament in which we resolve our differences by dialogue.  In fact, our differences are resolved in the ballot boxes and the different interests agree to sit down together in Parliament to legislate for the country.  There is no point in a political democracy if we do not subscribe to these points, as our Party do.</P>
    <P>There has been an attempt in this matter of industrial relations to suggest that our significant contribution in our worker policy document is somehow an attempt to sabotage our industrial system, is somehow subversive.  I wish to repeat that this document has been put forward as an honest contribution to resolving difficulties in Irish industry. We invited all political Parties to give us their ideas about how the conflict in Irish industry may be resolved. To attack the document as Utopian and impossible is not meeting the suggestions in our document, which is aimed at improving human conditions. Similar attacks have greeted previous <Col N="1401" /> attempts at improvement in human conditions.  How many years ago is it that the suggestion of putting bathrooms in council houses was greeted with the comment that the tenants would put turf or coal in the baths, that in any case they would not use them?  It is an illustration of the totally arrogant claim by people that they know what is possible and what is not.</P>
    <P>In the country at the moment the newspapers and the seminars being run by political Parties are filled with a type of certainty.  Mark you, Deputy Cosgrave the other night pronounced this general rule for the Irish people. Deputy Lynch, the Taoiseach, and Deputy Cosgrave made similar speeches at different venues on the same evening. That is nothing remarkable considering the amount they have in common.  The brunt of their remarks was against the Labour Party.  Deputy Cosgrave referred to a revolution and Deputy Lynch spoke about State control.  The point has now been reached at which people are attempting not to discuss our policy document but, in emotive terms, to frighten the electorate into the belief that we are putting forward policies which we have not in fact put forward.</P>
    <P>Obviously, if in political democracy in Parliament an attempt is made to get rid of a socialist presence in this Parliament, then we can all go home because what is there left to discuss? What is left to discuss between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael without a Labour Party?  This is precisely the point in our industrial democracy document.  We have suggested in it a new order in Irish industry and I would have thought that we deserve, and that political Parties had reached the point where they could give such a document mature comment.</P>
    <P>I understand Fianna Fáil may be correcting their previous imbalance of criticism on this document.  Up to now they have indulged in a smear campaign, refusing to judge the document on its merits.  I understand that Fianna Fáil had a special meeting last night to consider the contents of the document and after that meeting we may presumably get more informed comment from them.  If Fine Gael can arrange <Col N="1402" /> for the same type of discussion, it may be possible that the worker policy document of the Labour Party will be given more serious comment.</P>
    <P>That is what we are inviting.  We invited anybody to disagree with the points in the document and to lay their disagreements on the table and not to indulge in smear criticism, in a smear campaign&mdash;not to continue to participate in that old shameful pastime in Irish politics in which your opponents are subversive or, as we used to call them, Communists.  In Irish politics in our time, so many people who patently were not Communists were described as Communists, so many conservative politicians have cried &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; so often, have addressed people who patently were not Communists as Communists that if ever the day comes when, perhaps, because of misgovernment there will be a strong Communist Party in this country, it will then be too late because nobody will believe that the Communists are Communists because so often in the past so many people have been smeared as Communists who were not subscribers to any totalitarian philosophy.</P>
    <P>I have remarked that the two Bills we have here do not go to the root causes of the discontent in Irish industry. Far deeper probes of the sources of dissension in Irish industrial life are needed before we can say we have made a proper examination of the underlying conflicts.  I have suggested that those conflicts are such that they require remedies and policies as fundamental as those we, the Labour Party, have advocated for Irish industry.  Any honest examination of the differences between employer and employee in Irish industry requires policies as farreaching and fundamental as we have proposed in our document.</P>
    <P>I suggest that an honest examination could come up with no different answer, and certainly only with an answer along the road that we have suggested.  All our speeches are directed to the point of calling for more cooperation in the place of work&mdash;more consultation.  The cases are there.  Not ten year ago, certainly not farther back, quite recently, it has been suggested that there is complete break-down <Col N="1403" /> of communication and consultation between employer and employee in Irish industry&mdash;that there are still in 1968 and 1969 too many workers being given their cards with too little consultation&mdash;and that the unqualified power as at present existing of hiring and firing by employers has to be hedged around with social clauses that would spell out more clearly the employers' obligation to the community.</P>
    <P>One question is whether the worker, who is tied in his job to one particular firm, has as much a stake in that firm as the shareholder who may keep his shares in that company for a year or two until they increase in value before his investment proceeds elsewhere to a more remunerative quarter.  Yet, at present, legally it is the shareholder who is the owner.  It is the shareholder who is given all the rights in the legal concept of the firm as we know it at present, the person who can flit with his investment from company to company. If we look up the shareholdings in this country we will see that there are very few shareholders who stick with one company as long as the average employee must stick with the one company.  The average employee in the larger company sinks or swims with that company and his family sink or swim with him.</P>
    <P>The people who decided to close down Rawson's in Dundalk did not have to sink or swim with Rawson's. The capital they withdrew is probably flourishing now in some other quarter in industry.  I do not know whether the workers who were employed in Rawson's are flourishing in another job at present.  You can see that, on grounds of equity, not on any particular political philosophy, we must give the ordinary employees in industry a status in the firm in which they work. We cannot regard the employee simply as part of the furnishings; he must be given a higher status than the actual equipment or machinery in the place in which he works.  To be perfectly honest, more attention is paid to the machinery, to the inanimate production unit, than is paid to the employee. Specialists of one sort or another are brought in to consider whether there is wear and tear on the machinery, to <Col N="1404" /> consider depreciation costs, to assess the lifetime of the machinery, how its lifetime may be extended, what are the best working conditions for it and how its performance may be improved. One need not ask if the same attention is given to the employee.  How many specialists are called in to see that the employees are satisfied with their lot?  How much attention is given to this aspect in management circles?</P>
    <P>Therefore, unless we seek to change the balance of forces in the place of work, to give employees a share in decisions which affect them, I cannot see how we are going to get real co-operation in the place of work. Today people know too much for anybody to think that the majority of citizens working in industry will be content to remain where they have been.  The whole spirit of our age calls for an appreciation of human dignity. God knows, sufficient speeches have been made on the theme of human dignity.  I suppose the greatest criticisms that can be made of us is that, while those speeches have been made, we have done very little to realise that human dignity in the place of work, or to give our citizens a decent standard of living.</P>
    <P>If the question of incomes is one of the embittering factors in industry it is equally important, having solved that problem, to proceed to this matter of restoring dignity to the majority in industry.  I repeat that the primary function of a Government is so to improve the economy that wage rates can keep the majority of people above the poverty line.  As I have said, there are too many workers earning less than £11 per week and on the poverty line. It is just as well to remember that, because too many statements are made suggesting that the problem of incomes is no longer the basic problem.  The figure I gave last night was that 38 per cent of our industrial workers are earning less than £11 per week and, as long as that situation remains, there will be no peace in industry.</P>
    <P>As a democratic people we could not have respect for ourselves if there was peace in industry when 38 per cent of industrial employees were earning less than £11 per week.  In asking our <Col N="1405" /> fellow citizens to maintain peace in industry when they are earning below £11 per week, we would be asking them to starve their children.  We would be asking them to live on less than £11 per week, asking them to neglect their children.  A new form of obedience to State would be dictating &mdash;this is something to which I would not subscribe&mdash;&ldquo;Please do not rock the boat on your £11 a week.  We know that it is not enough on which to keep your wife and children; we know that your whole family life will be breaking down under the impossible strain of trying to rear a family on £11 a week, but the economy cannot afford any more for you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would say that in a democracy the only reaction of a free man to such an order is to reject it.  The only selfrespecting thing for a man who has the concern of his family at heart to do is to reject this advice and look for more wages, to demand of the Government of the day that the economy be so ordered that more wages can be provided.  If we cannot provide more wages for the man with three or four children and who is earning £11 per week, then it is time we packed up the whole enterprise of the Republic of Ireland because we have failed.  There is no point in continuing the pretence any longer if we are not able to change the situation in which 38 per cent of the workers are doomed to earn less than £11 per week.  It is time we went back to Westminister to see if they can do any better.</P>
    <P>Even having solved that economic conflict we would still have to solve the problem of restoring dignity in the place of work.  It is a problem with which all modern industrial societies have been faced and are tackling at present to some extent.  There is no point in putting off the day of industrial democracy by saying that it is not necessary in this country.  We all know that within the place of work there exists the attitude of &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo;, or what has been described as an apartheid in industry.  It is important that that problem be solved.  There would be no conflict between restoring humanity in the place of work and seeing that a good day's work is done. <Col N="1406" /> We have not done any investigation of it but there are studies to suggest that more efficiency can be realised when greater participation is initiated in the place of work.  I would not suggest that this should be the basic reasoning behind our proposals in this area because the basic reasoning should have as its point of departure the ethical superiority of giving dignity back to work.  That should be the major point of departure and the efficiency factor should follow.  But there are studies to suggest that greater efficiency results from giving greater participation back to the majority of people working in industry.  It is true in human experience that the more satisfied one is, the more contented, the more productive one is at one's job; and the more dissatisfied and discontented and the more worried one is, the less one can give to the job.  I have no doubt that, if we can give more interest to the workers, give more control to the majority in Irish industry, greater productivity and efficiency may well result, in addition to having a more humane situation prevailing in the place of work.</P>
    <P>Nobody has suggested, nor have we suggested in our document, that we want the whole of our policy inaugurated now.  The policies we suggest in Irish industry were put out as democratic policies and we invited criticism from all those involved in Irish industry and from all interested in the country in regard to our first statement of aims.  We would then see, as we got more reaction from Irish industry, how, perhaps, one suggestion could be made more practical or how another could be changed.  What we have done in our document is to give a political commitment as to what eventually we would like to see in Irish industry.  We are not so naïve as to suggest that this is what we want all in one &ldquo;go&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Remember, in everthing we desire in Irish industry we fully subscribe to the necessity for democratic consent. Ours is a democratic Party and nothing in our policy document will be implemented without the expressed permission and consent of the Irish people. We are quite willing to wait and accept results on that basis.  Nothing subversive is suggested.  Everything in our <Col N="1407" /> policy documents is printed in the open light of day and is there to be examined by every Irish citizen so that he can make up his mind for himself whether or not to support us.</P>
    <P>I see no conflict between efficient management in Irish industry and the policy points we suggest in our workers' democracy.  Rather do I see the enthusiastic consent of Irish management to our proposals because I visualise Irish management realising that, unless we can get a really viable community, a community from which conflict is eliminated in the place of work, we shall not see progress made in the industrial sector.  Certainly, we shall be incapable of making the strides in exports we should make.  Our unions and work people will be too embittered to accept the changes that are necessary in Irish industry unless we can eliminate the conflict which at present exists there and unless we can, in fact, recreate a real community in the place of work.</P>
    <P>I suppose the first job we must tackle, the one that would occur here and now, is to deepen the idea of consulation. Over the years the unions have done their utmost to get the concept of consultation accepted in industry and they have met bitter opposition.  They have come up against the idea that the whole future of the firm, its marketing and export plans and everything intimately connected with its future, and information regarding such matters, should be jealously guarded from the majority in the place of work&mdash;that decisions must be controlled by very few.  There is a very old fashioned philosophy in Irish industry that what &ldquo;they&rdquo; do not know will not hurt &ldquo;them&rdquo;, but unfortunately, it hurts at some stage, as we have too often seen in the past few years.  It hurts very deeply when a man hears that the job he has had for 20 years will not be there on Monday morning.  One can only imagine that it must do incalculable damage to the whole idea that we can have co-operation in industry when workers in one part of the country read about a layoff, perhaps in a similar industry, in another part of the country without consultation.  It deepens the first impression <Col N="1408" /> that there is an everlasting conflict between &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo;: we must never allow &ldquo;them&rdquo; to get away with anything.  The lack of consultation and the philosophy that what &ldquo;they&rdquo; do not know will not hurt &ldquo;them&rdquo; certainly continues and adds to the sense of frustration, the sense of not being recognised, not being accepted as a human being, which is felt by so many people in industry. We must deepen the idea of consultation and of letting people in the firm know where they stand.</P>
    <P>For instance, in the past few years we have had quite an amount of redundancy in Irish industry.  Organised workers have done their utmost to negotiate suitable redundancy terms. We have the minimum terms in the redundancy Act, which itself was brought about as a result of the agitation and prodding of the trade unions who realised the necessity for such a measure.  We have in Irish industry too much unplanned redundancy, redundancy that need not occur if proper planning had been applied in the first place.  It is not sufficient defence in this situation to say that technological change makes this inevitable. I am always suspicious when people begin to invoke technological change as the reason for this or that in economic matters.  It is not sufficient to come along to the man who has worked at a job for 20 or 30 years and say: &ldquo;Technological change deprives you of your job&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Can we avoid a great deal of redundancy, especially when there is not so much new industrial activity in the same locality to give alternative employment? Can we, by adopting this principle of consultation, avoid redundancy? If there is redundancy in one section in a particular firm, can we by better planning absorb those declared redundant into another section of that firm?  This, again, would call for a deepening of the whole concept of consultation.  There is today an unsatisfactory conception of worker participation and how exactly employers regard employees.  If a firm knows that a particular market may be opening up in the near future, or another market closing down, why can management not attempt the experiment <Col N="1409" /> of informing the employees of the position and of seeking to enlist their support?  Why can they not open up the company books for inspection by their employees?  How many accusations do we hear from some people in industry that the workers are not interested in the economy of the firm, are not interested in whether the firm sinks or swims?</P>
    <P>My experience suggests that workers are very involved indeed and very concerned to know whether or not the jobs they have will still be there next year or the year after.  Nothing would be lost by discussing impartially with worker representatives just what the financial position of the firm is.  I means now the total financial position, not doctored figures; I mean an honest assessment of where the particular firm is going, whether or not it can expand, how many jobs there will be, and so on.  All this is necessary in the whole idea of consultation.</P>
    <P>We have had too few examples of worker councils and the councils we have are too concerned with irrelevant matters.  They do not really discussion the important issues.  An impression has grown up that they are just decoys to detract interest from the more important issues.  Trivial matters are discussed. There are too few examples of the worker council idea and the whole psychology and attitude in Irish industry would seem to be very much opposed to employers taking workers into their confidence.</P>
    <P>It may be said that the unions themselves must seek to deepen the whole idea of consultation.  But their experience in the past suggests to them that consultation is a management gimmick; managements do not really intend to have any really serious consultation. Some of the unions, as a result of their experience, may have come to reject the whole idea of consultation.  It would be regrettable if a good idea were rejected because of experience in the past.  In present circumstances we simply must make progress with this whole idea of consultation and the unions themselves and managements must play a very big part in advancing this idea of consultation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said&mdash;this is something <Col N="1410" /> I have said myself&mdash;that, whilst there may be an economic core to the majority of strikes, research in other countries would suggest that, if there is a climate of discontent existing over many years, the material is at hand for a pretty lengthy dispute.  How can one expect mutual respect between the two sides in industry when there is no attempt to bring in any consultative machinery, when management never meets the worker representatives, save in the heat of a row, and when the only time any confrontation takes place is either on the eve of a dispute or in the middle of it?  This would not seem to be the best time in which constructively to create a system of trust between both sides.  It certainly would not seem to be the time when both sides would seek to get to know one another better.  It certainly would not suggest that any lasting change could be made when one only has meetings in the middle of a dispute, in the heat of battle, as it were.  That is not the time to discuss any improvement in the overall working situation.</P>
    <P>In a county in which there is largescale unemployment, as there is here, very few people have any element of choice of job.  In other economies there is an element of choice and a man can pick the job most suitable to his aptitudes. If he can do that, there is then an element of rationality but, since we suffer from a dearth of jobs, that situation does not obtain here.  In fact, if one is lucky enough to get employment, the idea here is to hold on to that employment as long as possible.  There is very little element of choice and it is, therefore, all the more important that there should be some humanity and some dignity in the place of work.</P>
    <P>Very few Irish firms employ over 500.  Any scheme of greater participation between is management and employees is most essential, in the first place, in the larger firms.  Could one say it is most essential, too, in the semi-State sector?  There was a time not long ago when some people thought that, if the community was running a particular enterprise, then there would not be any conflict in that enterprise. Some people accuse the Labour Party of wishing to put everything under the <Col N="1411" /> control of the State.  We have, of course, no such desire and we never said that was our policy.  We attempted to give more power back to the community, to have more emphasis on community planning.</P>
    <P>Let no one say that in their policies for Irish industry the Labour Party would suggest that a proliferation of the present State and semi-State bodies is their ideal of a new industrial order. In the area of human relations the State and semi-State sector have failed and failed dismally.  We have only got to look at the record of the State transport company, CIE, to realise that theirs has not exactly been a success story in the matter of relations with their employees.  The individual busman does not feel he is in an enterprise in which his human dignity is accepted.</P>
    <P>Indeed, one might say that the State companies have carried over an even more old-fashioned concept of managerial preorgative than exists at present in the private enterprise sector.  Very little check is kept on their activities.  In the State and semi-State sector there is very little evidence of any creative endeavour to bring in schemes of consultation to involve the majority of the employees in those companies in decision-making in the particular enterprises. There has been a too easy acceptance of the idea that these companies must operate on good old-fashioned principles of management without any regard to the feelings of the majority of the people in the State and semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>Here, obviously, is a whole area calling out for new forms of participation. I noticed that the recent report on the ESB called for certain developments which would lead to greater participation by employees in the ESB. The impression one gets &mdash; and too many have referred to it for it to be dismissed as purely an individual complaint&mdash;is that there is a feeling of importence, a feeling that they are insignificant, a feeling that they do not count any more, a feeling that they are more or less cyphers in their jobs, a feeling that the chain of command has gone totally outside their scope of <Col N="1412" /> comprehension, a feeling that there is group of faceless burracucrats at the top, moving them around without knowing their names or their interests and without knowing how the employees think.  This complaint is too general to be dismissed as an individual complaint.  It is heard too often to be so dismissed.</P>
    <P>There should be no reason in the running of a large firm for a feeling of depersonalisation on the part of many employees.  Even though our State enterprises may be very large in comparison with other firms in Irish industry, the fact of the matter is that far larger firms in other countries have brought in schemes which certainly banished any ideas that they were insignificant from the minds of their employees.  In other countries imaginative schemes have been brought in that allowed participation by the employees. Our own State companies have been singularly lax in attempting to do anything similar.  In fact, I do not think it has ever crossed their minds that it is one of their obligations.  Even though they were set up by an Act of the Oireachtas and obviously owe their origin to community philosophy, they do not seem to feel that they have more obligations to the community than a firm which owes its origin possibly to the enterprise of one individual or a few individuals.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the State companies have given little evidence of feeling that they have any particular obligations in this area.  Of course, the corollary has followed that the unions negotiating with the State companies have given little evidence either that they are negotiating with community enterprises.  In fact, the bargaining approach of the unions to State or semi-State bodies is similar in every respect to their approach to private firms.  I recall a speech made by Mr. Dempsey of Aer Lingus some years ago in which he remarked on the failure of the trade unions to have any different strategy, any different approach, more an emphasis on social obligations, in their negotiations with State and semi-State companies on the basis that they were community enterprises. I suppose their defence would be: &ldquo;Well, we have seen little evidence <Col N="1413" /> on the part of the State and semi-State companies to suggest that they see any particular distinction or any difference between their role in the economy and that of those on the private industry side.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In fact their approach&mdash;and I am talking about their managerial decisions and dealings with the trade unions&mdash;may have less of the community interest involved than the private management may have in negotiations they may have with the unions, because there is always a very healthy safeguard to keep private management near to reality at least and that is the possibility of a down turn in trade and the possibility of sinking in a general dispute.  Such observations do not apply with equal force to managers in the State and semi-State sector.  Some of them seem to go around in a Walter Mitty like dream of their own importance in their dealings with the trade unions.  They seem to be having fantasies in many cases.  That has been my impression of their dealings with trade unions over the years.  They seem to feel: &ldquo;We will show these people where they get off&rdquo;, without realising that the public good may be involved in a successful culmination of the discussions going on.</P>
    <P>Unless we get a wholesale change of attitudes right across Irish industry, there is very little chance that this small country, with our small-scale industries, will be able to survive in the years ahead.  In leading up to that change in attitudes we must make a rigorous examination of things as they are at present, so that we do not get a wrong impression, and do not have an imaginary situation in mind when we talk about Irish industry.  We must stick to the facts rigorously.  We want a change of attitudes so that we would have mutual respect.  So many speeches have been made in the past directed to the desirability of changing our attitudes that one would expect some little change, but it is my impression that too few of our attitudes have changed.  Certainly, we have not changed our attitudes as radically as we would sometimes like to think we have.  To bear that out, I would refer to the whole approach to our worker <Col N="1414" /> democracy document which has been greeted on all sides with shouts of &ldquo;dictatorship&rdquo; and the suggestion that we are out to hold up the community to ransom.</P>
    <P>Peculiarly enough, the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Cosgrave, have made the same speeches about the document.  Both of them attack it for the same reason. Both of them say it is organised anarchy.  Both of them say is it unacceptable to the Irish people.  Both Leaders, apparently, are in possession of arcane information about the Irish people because both of them seem to know instinctively just what the Irish people will or will not accept.  We humbly admit that we have not all that knowledge in our possession.  We are not on the hot line to the Creator for His opinions as to what the Irish people will or will not accept nor have we any divine revelation to suggest to us what is best, and otherwise, for Irish industry.  We can only go on the facts before us, aided by our own intelligence, as to what may or may not be necessary.  We certainly cannot take refuge in such statements as &ldquo;this will not be accepted&rdquo;.  We believe the sickness in Irish industry is extensive enough to need the kinds of proposals in our document.  We do not believe that sickness is any less serious than would require the serious remedies suggested in our document.  Irish industry is not suffering from a cold or from influenza but from a deep and continuing state of pneumonia.  Our document reviews that situation and suggests remedies.  There is a conflict throughout Irish industry which must be corrected.</P>
    <P>To those who say that the employer and the employee have identical interests I would point out that this opinion is not shared by people with experience in Irish industry.  Everything in their working life confirms their impression that their interests are not identical.  We must suggest new institutional forms of consultation in Irish industry to ensure that real community exists there and conflict is eliminated. Lacking many natural resources, as this country does, we must so alter our industry as to ensure that <Col N="1415" /> human relations are really lived up to in this area and must seek to be superior to other countries&mdash;not merely to be in the same league but to be in a superior position in our organisational arrangements.  As things are, in disputes and strife, we are in as bad a position as any other country.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the expectations of many people, nothing in the Trade Union Bill and the Industrial Relations Bill would suggest that there would be one strike less next year than there were last year, because the causes of strikes and disputes lie elsewhere.  The Minister himself might admit that he never made such a claim for his documents but many commentators, many newspapers and so-called experts, looking to these Bills and to the changes in the law, suggest that we may have a totally new dispensation once these are brought through the House.</P>
    <P>Whether sufficient research has gone into these Bills or not is an open question. There has been in the Department of Labour, since its inception, a fondness for legal sanction.  There has been a feeling that problems may be made to disappear if they are put into a legal straitjacket.  This has been responsible for a great deal of the difficulties of the Department of Labour in its dealings with the organised working people.  The Department of Labour has been seen too often in several previous submissions of its legislation to coincide absolutely with what the organised employer opinion of this country would have us enact.</P>

      <P>Proposals were made&mdash;we will not say by whom&mdash;but let us say that there has been a fondness displayed for legal sanctions.  Indeed, one of the Bills before us suggests certain legal interventions in the area of industrial relations.  It is important that we should understand that in the matter of legal sanctions in this area one should proceed very cautiously before invoking them in this particular area.</P>
      <P>I mentioned last night how the Royal Commission in Britain rejected the idea in their proposals for change in this area of compulsory strike ballots. They said that there is a sort of an impression that if a strike ballot is necessary or has to be gone through before a strike takes place the strike is less likely to take place.  The Donovan Commission point out that experience in other countries does not suggest that this is, in fact, the case. Experience in the United States and Canada suggests that taking strike ballots before the issuing of strike notice does not, in fact, necessarily imply that.  Experience, in fact suggests that a strike is even more likely to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allied to that idea there has been the rather common assumption in this country that much of our industrial unrest is caused by unofficial strikes. In fact, we now hear in the Minister's proposals that we should withdraw the protection of the 1906 Act from the pickets of unofficial strikes.  Nobody in this House wishes to defend the rights of small groups who do not have the backing of their own unions but the figures do not suggest that unofficial strikes in this country have a very large part to play in the number of industrial disputes.  In 1967 my figures show that 66 per cent of days lost were as a result of official strikes. It seems to me that we would need to be very careful that we do not fall for an easy solution in this area and think that our main trouble is unofficial <Col N="1419" /> strikes.  We do not have a very high record of unofficial strikes.  They do not contribute significantly to our bad strike record.  Most of our strikes are what we call official strikes.  When one brings in legal clauses in a particular Bill it may happen that one may worsen a situation.  This is something we have referred to before.</P>
    <P>Our attitude on the matter cannot simply be described as one in which we are just against all progress from Government sources towards the improvement of industrial relations but what we do call for at every stage is to realise that just banging through legislation may not appreciably improve the situation and could, perhaps, arguably worsen the situation.</P>
    <P>The ESB (Special Provisions) Act was brought into this House.  Although, perhaps, nobody now is desirous of claiming authorship of that Bill, it most certainly was brought in by the Government.  It was invoked by the Government and it was supported by the majority of Deputies both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in its passage through this House.  Throughout that debate we had gentlemen getting up who delivered themselves of their own particular prejudices in this matter and who hastened the Bill on its way, declaring &ldquo;the rule of law must prevail&rdquo; as if they were talking about the Suez Canal or a legislative matter in the civil courts.  Obviously, the problem to their minds was a simple one, purely a matter of applying in the area of relations between employer and employees the same rules as one would devise in a civil case in the civil courts forgetting, of course, that in the matter of incomes, which court in the land can say what wage this man should have and what profit this employer should have.  What court can legislate in this area?  What laws can we devise in this area to ensure that equity is carried out?  However, that was their approach and they called for this Bill to go through the House as rapidly as possible.  They saw it as an essential step and as an improvement and only a few months ago an impartial committee examining the ESB <Col N="1420" /> situation suggested that this Bill should be scrapped as quickly as possible because it is a contributory factor to bad relations in the ESB.  The Minister himself in his opening speech suggests that if there is a guarantee of good behaviour by trade unions this Bill will, in fact, be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>That is why we should be extremely careful about invoking legal sanctions in this area.  That is why the Donovan Commission in Britain rejected the idea of compulsory strike ballots.  That Commission exhaustively examined every facet of British industrial life and their whole report is filled with the realisation that one must, indeed, be very careful about bringing in legislation to this area thinking that it will improve the situation.  Barbara Castle's White Paper on industrial strife suggests that the State must do its best to improve the organisational structure for consultation between employer and employee but must not attempt to wade in at the deep end at any rate, in the conflict between them.</P>
    <P>Unofficial strikes in this country are not a major element in the industrial disputes picture.  They contribute to some extent but they are not a major element.  Therefore, when we legislate to remove the protection of the 1906 Act from the unofficial picket we are not radically altering the situation for the better.  At most we are dealing with a very small ingredient in the present situation.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the drafting of this Bill, and since any changes will become legally binding when the Bill goes through this House, we must query very closely each clause to see that in the future it cannot worsen the situation, that it cannot penalise genuine efforts at negotiating in our industrial structure.  Of course, once such a Bill is law whatever the Minister, Deputies or anyone else does about it it becomes a gospel to be interpreted by legal people who, in many cases, do not understand the unique nature of industrial relations or that the mainspring of the industrial relations system is something totally different from the <Col N="1421" /> civil law side.  Take for example section 10:</P>
    <P>Sections 2 to 4 of the Act of 1906 shall apply only in relation to an authorised trade union which is the holder of a negotiation licence under the Act of 1941 and to a member or official of such a union and to an act done or committed with the authority of the union concerned.</P>
    <P>I am not a lawyer but quite a variety of interpretations are possible of the phrase &ldquo;with the authority of the union concerned&rdquo;.  That is a very loose way of expressing the position which exists within our unions at present.  Another example is section 9 of Part III:</P>
    <P>It shall be lawful for one or more persons ... acting on their own behalf or on behalf of a trade union...</P>
    <P>In legal terms there are a variety of interpretations possible of the phrase &ldquo;acting on behalf of a trade union&rdquo; and this could be troublesome in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the phrasing from the 1906 Act; it has been there for 63 years.  If it is the drafting the Deputy is worried about, neither of us is competent to judge the drafting, but the phrasing is there since 1906.</P>

      <P>In this Bill there are certain sections which have not been incorporated in previous legislation, and we must be extremely careful to see that the drafting is not susceptible to a variety of interpretations.  If a variety of interpretations is possible, then the legislation could do more harm than good.  The one that I particularly feel could create a great deal of harm in the future is in section 14 in relation to balloting, where, if this is made compulsory, the initiative of a union can be curtailed in the settlement of a dispute. I should like to know whether a great deal of research went into this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the section dealing with picketing of an employer's house.  All of us would certainly agree that picketing of a private residence should be outlawed. A conflict between an employer and an employee should not lead to the disruption of the employer's family life as a <Col N="1422" /> result of the picketing of his private residence.  However, there is the problem that very often the employer makes his residence into his place of work.  I am not aware of any union abusing the right of picketing to the extent of disrupting an employer's family life by coming along to his private residence to hold the family up to ransom.  I am not aware of such a case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The residence of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was picketed, just to give one example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there may be rare exceptions, but it certainly is not a common feature of our industrial relations that a private residence is picketed.  While one can agree suchand-such is correct, in theory, what we have to consider is whether, having tied it up in legal form, the position is improved or not.  Take the group idea. We intend to legalise the basis of groups.  One thing we must ask ourselves is, has the group idea been a success?  Admittedly, under the provisions here, the Minister is leaving the initiative to the unions as to the constitution and make-up of the group, but a great deal more investigation would be needed to decide whether the group is the best structure or whether a federal system would not be better.</P>
      <P>Some years ago the British TUC scrapped all their so-called industrial committees, but the new system did not work.  Our experience in this country at group working does not inspire us with confidence that the group idea is the best one.  The unions themselves, under Congress, have certain groups operating at present, but the whole problem about group operation is that each union still retains its own authority and its own right to accept or reject the ruling of the particular group. Though the section, in reference to the composition of the group, lays down certain guidelines, the question is whether by enshrining in legislation the idea of the group we may not be building on a false foundation&mdash;and this may not be what its proponents suggested for it: the group idea may not be the most suitable for the establishment of greater co-ordination between the unions in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1423" /> It seems to me that organisation on a more federal structure is something that needs to be more closely examined. At least we could see if there is not more in that idea.  There is the provision in the ballot clauses that a ballot is necessary for a resumption of work and discretion is given to the executive of the union to decide not to serve strike notice.  Subsection (1) (b) states:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding anything in its rules or in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the executive committee or other controlling authority of a trade union may, at its discretion, decide not to serve a strike notice so approved by secret ballot and that decision shall be binding on the union and its members.</P>
    <P>It may be all very well to state that in legislation, but it certainly is putting the executive of a union in an awkward spot if by law they must hold a ballot of their members, whether they want to or not, yet to state also that they may ignore it by law.  That may be fair enough, but I imagine that any executive caught in such a predicament would not be long in a controlling position in the union concerned.</P>
    <P>The Donovan Commission Report stated that that responsibility is seen to rest with the union executive concerned by insisting on the necessity for a ballot.  Paragraph (c) of the same subsection states:</P>
    <P>(i) whenever the service of a strike notice has been approved in accordance with paragraph (a) of this subsection and the strike notice has been served, a statement to that effect shall be deposited by the trade union concerned with the Labour Court on the date of such service;</P>
    <P>(ii) the statement required to be deposited under this paragraph shall be signed by not less than two officials of the trade union and shall certify that a secret ballot was duly taken in accordance with this section.</P>
    <P>I presume the Minister has discussed this matter with the trade union interests concerned.  It, again, introduces <Col N="1424" /> another compulsory clause. Throughout section 14 there is the problem that a rather elementary mistake by any union official, by a particular union, may be a serious mistake for the union concerned if anybody wishes to question thereafter the legality of what took place.</P>
    <P>In the Industrial Relations Bill, though in general one welcomes the proposals in it for the improvement of the court, one does not see any portion of the Bill which will help to bring about the situation whereby we can retain good industrial relations officers now in the service of the court. In the past there has been a very high turnover in the number of conciliation officers in the court service.  There has been a tendency for a man, having had experience in that position, to be removed elsewhere on promotion in the court service.  We should bring about a situation as rapidly as possible whereby a man could spend his whole career in that section of the court&mdash; that in order to secure promotion a man need not go elsewhere; that this position would be considered a definite grade within the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>One would be inclined to ask in this connection would it be possible to open up the grade of conciliation officer or industrial relations officer in the Labour Court to outside competition. I would not say that necessarily there is any difference in the matter of suitability between the man who chooses to become a civil servant and an industrial relations officer as provided for in this Bill.  There may be quite an amount of talent outside the Civil Service which would be quite suitable for this job if we made it attractive enough and if we gave it the status it should rightly have.  We should go for direct enrolment into the section from outside the charmed circle of the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>In the long discussions that were held with various Ministers during the years in the matter of doing something about industrial relations, I understood that in 1963 something was to be done about the Fitzpatrick versus the Educational Company of Ireland case.  That dispute involved an attempt to ensure there would be full trade <Col N="1425" /> union organisation in a job.  A decision was made against the trade union who found themselves, in pursuance of a dispute about full organisation in a job, subject to the full force of the law.  I understood an undertaking was given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce at that time that future legislation would provide against the possibility of such a decision.  I do not see that in the present case.  There is no suggestion that this will be done.  In 1963, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce wrote a letter to the President of the Congress of Trade Unions in which he referred to the Fitzpatrick case.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, was then Minister for Industry and Commerce and in his letter of April of that year, which was quoted in the Fifth Report of the Executive Council of Congress for 1962-63, he said:</P>
    <P>When representatives of Congress met the Taoiseach and myself on the 16th April, 1962, to discuss trade union legislation, two separate proposals emerged.  The first was that the Taoiseach would discuss with the Attorney General the setting up of a working party to consider how, without conflicting with the Supreme Court judgment in the <i>Educational Company versus Fitzpatrick</i> case a trade union right to take action, including picketing to enforce union membership could be made effective again and if any legislation was necessary for this purpose.  As you will be aware this working party was subsequently set up and its report is at present under consideration in my Department.</P>
    <P>The letter goes on:</P>
    <P>The second proposal related to the desirability of setting up a committee to consider the general modification and revision of all trade union law.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>I suggested to W.J. Fitzpatrick in April last when he was President of Congress, that he might take up with the Executive Committee of Congress consideration of this letter and latter proposal and let me have their views in due course.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1426" /> The Congress communicated their views on the general subject of trade union law and certainly I was under the impression that in any legislation introduced in this area we would hear something about the Supreme Court judgment in the <i>Educational Company versus Fitzpatrick</i> case on the right of a trade union to take action even to the point of picketing to ensure trade union membership in a particular job. Possibly the Minister could let us have his views on that point.  Certainly it was the understanding of the trade unions that something would be done about this matter of the <i>Educational Company of Ireland versus Fitzpatrick.</i></P>
    <P>In regard to the provisions relating to the Labour Court we can see that they are certainly improving the capacity of the court to deal with disputes. In regard to the other Bill a certain amount of caution is required in regard to various proposals in it.  There is the feeling that perhaps it may be based on inadequate research, a feeling that the group concept idea has still to be proved the best idea.  Also, it still has to be proved that making strike ballots compulsory will help appreciably and is the best idea.  I would say that there are too many ballots in the trade union world.  There are ballots on every issue. The position in Britain is different where the union rules do not make due allowance for balloting.  We have to consider, when we produce legal clauses about balloting whether, because of their construction, the tables cannot be turned on a union, where recalcitrant members or somebody with a grievance against a union feel the Act was not carried out to the letter.  These are matters which still have to be conclusively proved.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say quite justifiably that they have been waiting for a long time for action from the unions to put their own house in order.  He may say that he has been involved for three years in consultations with them and that this is his final word on the matter.  However, it must be accepted that unions, despite everything that has been said about them, are pretty democratic organisations, some might say that they are too democratic and that the surest way to bring about a position <Col N="1427" /> where there is lack of progress, or to create opposition, is to attempt to steamroll matters through the trade union movement.  The Minister himself has admitted that charges of coercion were made against some of his proposals. He has said that he himself was not involved initially in certain coercive measures but let us be fair: he has also spoken in defence of the ESB (Special Provisions) Act, and by implication was in support of its coercive provisions.  He has admitted that the charges of coercion against himself have done damage&mdash;and I recall speaking here two years ago about this &mdash;to the kind of neutral position a Department of Labour must attempt to maintain in the area of industrial relations because its value will be decreased if its expressions of opinion are seen to coincide too closely with those of one or the other side involved in industrial relations.</P>
    <P>The unions may be charged with having dragged their feet and with not having brought in rapidly enough the changes which they should have brought in and therefore the Minister may say, &ldquo;I have been forced to introduce this Bill&rdquo;.  However slow they may have been, unless the Minister has already consulted them on all the clauses in the Bill, then the Bill will certainly do more harm than good for, as he himself has said, it requires the cooperation of both sides in industry before one can see any piece of legislation working in a free democracy.  It is not sufficient and will not be helpful in the long run to seek to justify the legislation being introduced here merely by charging that the unions themselves have been slow and that, therefore, we have been forced to bring in this Bill.  That would be a very faulty foundation on which to set out to bring in legislative improvements&mdash; and that is what we hope would be involved&mdash;in this area.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that several points involved in this Bill have been conclusively proved.  It may be said that one cannot conclusively prove anything. Even present circumstances would seem to suggest that there are grave deficiencies in the group idea as it now operates.  Whether these deficiencies <Col N="1428" /> are ones that lie in the area which this Bill seeks to correct is an open question.  I do not think that has been proved either.  Do we believe that putting unofficial picketing outside the bounds of the 1906 Act may appreciably help the situation?  A surer guide there would be the unions themselves and their own action to outlaw the unofficial picket.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, in recent years we have seen an abuse of the picket in Irish industry, and the unions themselves would be the first to admit this.  Much serious thought has been given by trade unionists to the problem of the picket which goes on without consultation and disrupts industry, putting innocent people out of work.  But it is not as widespread in its incidence as some commentators suggest nor as suggested by some people who urge as a solution to the problem of industrial relations more legal sanctions. Whether, in fact, it might bring the halo of martyrdom to irresponsible elements is another consideration. Everything we do by legislation should strengthen the position and initiative of the lawful trade union movement, the organised bodies affiliated to Congress, and nothing we do here should be seen to detract in any way from that lawful authority or affect it in the slightest.</P>
    <P>About the following matters, therefore, we have our reservations: the withdrawal of the 1906 Act from a certain section; the laying down of a set procedure before a strike can actually be declared, saying for all time that this is the way it must be done, when it has not been proved that there is a lack of balloting in Irish industry, when it has not been proved that balloting itself reduces the incidence of strikes.  There is the idea that in balloting young people, who are imagined by many people to be at the root of strikes, are outnumbered.  This has not really been proved.  In most cases in the Irish trade union movement ballots do take place and very thorough discussion takes place beforehand.</P>
    <P>Last night, I mentioned in passing the idea of helping on the amalgamation of unions by giving a financial grant.  That is something that has been suggested by the trade unions themselves <Col N="1429" /> and could be very helpful.  We suggested previously that it might be possible financially to help unions interested in going ahead with amalgamation by the provision of earlier grants on declaration of intent. Nobody, least of all the trade unionists themselves, will say that the present system&mdash;even without inviting any farreaching changes in our present industrial relations&mdash;the system of collective bargaining as we know it in this country is the best of all systems.</P>
    <P>I believe it is a highly wasteful system, that it is very tough on those who must go out into open dispute with their employers.  It is very difficult for them if that is the only way they can remedy the imbalance in their incomes.  I consider it a wasteful and tragic manner in which to settle our disputes, but I can think of no better way under our present dispensation. The State itself has failed to come up with any kind of superior method of deciding the allocation of incomes in the community.  Therefore, in that situation, we must continue to live with a certain amount of disruption and dispute between employers and employees.</P>
    <P>Our disputes have one peculiar aspect compared with dispute records in other countries.  When they do take place our disputes appear to last far longer than similar disputes elsewhere. It appears to me that no matter how important the industry or service, the average duration of a dispute here is almost a fortnight.  A great deal of investigation could be made into this matter to ascertain exactly the elements that predispose the parties in our situation to dig in for a long confrontation as compared with other countries where they may have a greater incidence of such disputes but they are of far shorter duration than is the case here.</P>
    <P>Failing the introduction of any superior system or any fairer or less wasteful method of decision regarding allocation of incomes we must continue to live with our present system as it has been hammered out in the experience of its working in industry since the State was founded.  That system has been based on the idea that we do <Col N="1430" /> not have recourse overmuch to legal sanctions.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that the State can afford to play a completely passive role in this matter.  Indeed, I have suggested a very energetic role for the State in the overall conduct of the economy.  It has, as it were, in its overall economic policy generalship over the expansion of the economy.  It cannot, we admit, stand idly by and see disputes rend the country apart.  But its chief and predominant duty is to ensure that incomes do not fall below a certain level. That is its most important function.  Its second most important function is improving industrial relations by ensuring that existing institutions are improved to the point at which they can be most effective.  It is, I think, a good idea to make the court more effective.  With that court we will now have the rights commissioners.  While one may say that the core of many disputes is economic, too many disputes arise out of matters of interpretation in particular agreements. Too many disputes arise because of the overall bad climate in relations in particular firms and, in such cases, disputes blaze up on matters in relation to which quarrelling could, in fact, have been avoided.  The rights commissioners should certainly help in ensuring the elimination of that contributory element to disputes.</P>
    <P>It will be our endeavour in the course of this Bill to tailor some of the clauses more accurately in line with actual circumstances to ensure, in so far as we can, that this Bill will not subsequently prove a stumbling block.  We hope to introduce amendments at the appropriate stage.  There is a certain vagueness of construction.  We do not query certain things merely out of cussedness or from the point of view of Opposition politics.  We query them because this measure could have serious consequences and it might not contribute towards improving the existing situation.  I think all of us would like to see any legislation improving the position rather than worsening it and that will be our main approach to this Bill.</P>
    <P>We heartily subscribe to improvements in the Labour Court.  This falls within the area of improving the organisational structure in industrial <Col N="1431" /> relations.  Some of the clauses in the Trade Union Bill could be harmful. They are susceptible to a variety of interpretations.  There has been a tendency here to discuss industrial relations in the light of some existing storm.  Luckily, the present dispute looks like coming to an end.  It would be unfortunate if Deputies allowed recent events to colour their approach to this Bill, a Bill which will have effects and consequences on industrial relations in the years ahead.  It would be wrong also to cite the mistakes of the past few weeks as evidence of either the incapacity or the unwillingness of trade unions to come to grips with their own internal problems.</P>
    <P>Over the years the trade unions have given good service.  They have given evidence of a deep desire to improve the organisational position of industrial relations.  I am sure the Minister would be the first to admit his indebtedness to the trade union movement for their constructive comments and contributions towards improving industrial relations. It would be a mistake in this debate if, as has so often happened in the past, this House disgraced itself when discussing industrial relations.  It would be a mistake if members of any Party came in here merely for the purpose of manufacturing political cannon fodder for their own supporters back home, wherever that may be.</P>
    <P>This is a serious matter of grave import and significance in the whole sphere of industrial relations.  While the Bill does not go to the root of the existing conflict in Irish industry, it does suggest certain changes in the trade union structure, the group structure, and incorporates those in legal form.  It also suggests certain procedure before a strike can be called.  It deals with unofficial strikes.  Many people might think, at a superficial glance, that this Bill resolves once and for all the conflict in Irish industry.  Our opinion is that it does not go to the root cause and it was for that reason that I referred at some length to our own proposals in the area of industrial democracy and suggested that other people in this House might also consider whether they had anything to offer in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> Above all, it was my intention to appeal for constructive criticism of any proposal put forward in this area.  I wanted to suggest that it is not helpful when dealing with industrial relations to smear opponents or misrepresent views put forward honestly.  It is not helpful when discussing industrial disputes to consider the disputes superficially and say: &ldquo;This is caused by this or that subversive element.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>No one can get away from the economic core of the industrial unrest, which is that so many of our people must live on less than £11 per week. There is cause for dissension and conflagration, and until we tackle that underlying problem, there will be no peace&mdash;certainly no peace in our time &mdash;in Irish industry.  I appeal to all Deputies to consider this matter in the serious light in which we see it, and not to be afraid to state their honest opinion of what is wrong at present in Irish industry.  They should not fall for the suggestion which I expect to see put forward during this debate if it follows the usual course of these debates.  I refer to the fondness of many Members of the House for coercive legal action against members of trade unions in the ordering of their working lives.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I saw an interview on television in which Deputy Lindsay from the Fine Gael Party said: &ldquo;How can we legislate to ensure that a man will get out of bed in the morning and go to work?&rdquo; There is no way in which we can legislate to ensure that a man will go to work.  Yet that is precisely what this House enshrined in law in the ESB (Special Provisions) Bill and Fianna Fáil Deputies and Fine Gael Deputies trooped into the Lobby together to vote for that concept. One can see the grasp of the reality of industrial relations the majority of Deputies have when they accept such an idea.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the pitfalls experienced when discussing industrial relation.  No fiddling, no legal stratagems, will solve the problem, especially if one is utterly convinced, as I am, that the majority of strikes take place for a variety of deep economic motives.  Most of the disputes which take place are due to incomes.  If that <Col N="1433" /> is the reality, let it not be thought that industrial disputes can be eliminated by fiddling with the organisational arrangements.  It cannot be done without going to the economic heart of the problem.  We do not realise the depth of the problem unless we address ourselves to the question of incomes, which is at the centre of this conflict in our society.  No other measures will lay the foundation of peace or peaceful co-existence in Irish industry.  We must tackle the incomes problem and see to it that a certain minimum standard of living is available to every man and woman in Irish industry.  Having done that we must then deal with the problem of the organisational structure. We must also improve job opportunities.</P>
    <P>Some people may say that the unions do not adduce much evidence of their desire for change in the organisational structure.  We do not live in an economy which would give anyone much encouragement to participate in change.  Our economy has not given the unions the same scope as other economies have provided for enthusiastically supporting change. The unions have been fighting unemployment for so long that their psychological background has to some extent been poisoned, and they see their prime job as the defence of the interests of their members.  Their background explains that attitude.  The Government have a tremendously important job to do here.  That is all I have to say at this Stage.</P>

      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on bringing before the House Bills dealing with <Col N="1434" /> trade unions and industrial relations. We have been hearing about the repressive legislation the Minister intended to inflict upon the workers.  We now have this Bill before the House which some people regard as being mild.  It does not contain any section or clause that could be termed repressive.  To my mind the Minister, in his term as Minister for Labour, has always sought to assist the workers and trade unionists in every possible way.  That is evident in the various measures which he put through the House dealing with redundancy payments, industrial training and other matters of benefit to the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to Deputy O'Leary one would think that our Party produced only repressive legislation. There are times when, in order to protect the community and the workers, limited legislative action must be taken.  Deputy O'Leary referred to the ESB Bill.  I would appeal to the Minister to repeal it here and now.  I feel that that Act has lost its usefulness and that the Minister should here and now remove it from the Statute Book. I would bring to the notice of Deputy Michael O'Leary and his colleagues that quite a number of measures were put through this House from time to time for the benefit of the worker&mdash;going back over the period of years since the Fianna Fáil Government came into office.  These were all to the benefit of the worker.  Not alone did the Fianna Fáil Government produce the necessary jobs but they protected the workers.  The first measure was the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, which eliminated sweated labour.  It was followed by similar legislation in 1938: the Shops Act, the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, which set up the Labour Court; The Mines and Quarries Act; the Holidays with Pay Act; the Apprenticeship Act; the Redundancy Act; the West Time Acts.  Were these repressive measures?  These were all measures designed to assist and protect Irish workers.  That has been the sole desire of the Fianna Fáil Government and it has been the sole desire of the Minister further to add to this very extensive list of measures which have <Col N="1435" /> been produced in order that workers will be protected in times of stress and strain and in order to eliminate the many stresses in the ever-changing times in which we live.</P>
    <P>There is little we can point to in relation to legislation for the protection of the worker during the period when the Labour Party were partners in Government.  There is indeed little that one can point to.  There was no urgent legislation at that stage.  Redundancy legislation was needed for one or two sections of the community who found themselves on the labour exchange.  I listened with great interest to Deputy Michael O'Leary.</P>
    <P>Now let me come to the two Bills which are before the House.  The application of sincerity, sanity, practical experience and commonsense are all important when examining this question of industrial relations.  Deputy Michael O'Leary suggested on many occasions that the emphasis was on State interference and, when the State did interfere, he condemned it.  I would say to him that we must not place all our faith in systems alone.  If we have not sincerity and the right spirit then the systems that are produced, however good they may appear, cannot be successful. The worker, the employer, the Government and the other interested parties must examine this question and must come to grips with it.  There are many people who cry loudly for their rights, and even more loudly against their responsibilities in this age and in relation to this problem.  The attacks that have been made here today on the Minister and on the Department of Labour are unjustified and I should like now completely to refute them. Any political Party that endeavours to attract followers merely by fomenting hate does not deserve and will not get the support of our citizens.</P>

      <P>This malicious attitude towards the Minister and the Government by the Members who have spoken does not cut very much ice with responsible people.  People are judged by what they do rather than by the group to which they belong.  The Minister for Labour in his time has developed a sympathetic understanding with employers and workers irrespective of their Party affiliations.  The workers with whom I have spoken and the workers with whom I mix of my own trade union are conscious of the positive work done by the Department of Labour.  Any attempt to develop a suspicion of or a hatred for a Department or the person in political <Col N="1437" /> control of it is to be deplored.  That is as much as I want to say on that issue in relation to the Department of Labour.</P>
      <P>I am confident the Minister will do a good job, as he has done so far.  He is the one man who, on all occasions, has the problems of the workers at heart in relation to the present and the future.  I am quite sure that no Deputy on the Labour benches can indicate any type of repressive measure which the Minister for Labour has suggested.</P>
      <P>In our set-up here, there are many factors that need examination in relation to industrial relations.  To deal with these in order, I should like to say, first, that there is the necessity for the employers' organisation to put their house in order.  I believe that some of the problems have arisen as a result of confusion of thought among the employers themselves and in their own organisation.  The desire on some occasions to meet force with what appears to be force is something that is to be deplored.  One would think that organisation, with their resources and their officers, would be able to face up to developing situations and to see them in a realistic light.  Some of the acts of employers&mdash;lockouts, protective notices and so on&mdash;tend to create hardship for workers and are, in many cases, unjustifiable.  They are the basis of future dissension rather than dissension at this period.  The problem at the moment is over and forgotten but employees who are pushed out of work by employers have an undying memory of the injustice done to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say that this group of organisations would do a good job from their point of view and from the point of view of the nation if they put their own house in order, if they looked at the problems in a more realistic manner and took a more human view of the problems in relation to the question of strikes.  I deplore some of the action taken, and it is to be deplored by all proper thinking people, in the present dispute, in the lockout and the demands for lockout of certain sections of the community.  They have no regard at all for the workers.  This was displayed by this particular action.  Unfortunate <Col N="1438" /> men were sent away without pay packets, in some cases without welfare assistance or strike pay.  They were thrown to the four winds.  This type of action must be deplored and it is something that will have to be examined in the light of the present situation when the matter has resolved itself.</P>
    <P>In regard to industrial relations, I feel that skilled and efficient management can make a much greater contribution in the future than it has in the past.  Efficient and skilled management is the keynote to success, so that more will be available for the worker as a result of his initiative, energy and foresight. In many cases we have ineffective, inefficient management.  We have people pushed into positions, who are rejects from the universities or from other sections of society, because they are friends or relatives of the boss. They are put in important positions in personnel departments, positions of which they have no knowledge whatsoever. These people have to be carried by the workers.  They blunder their way from start to finish and the problems they cause fall back on the heads of the workers.  The official or the manager or whatever his title may be is immune from all blame but many of the factors that go wrong in industry are a result of inefficient management or misfits that have been placed there because they are friends of some member of the board.</P>
    <P>The lack of personnel management in my opinion is something that should get much greater consideration by firms.  The personnel management is a most important aspect in job placement and in selection.  I believe that if an industry is unable to employ a fulltime personnel manager there is no reason why group systems could not be organised for smaller industries where a personnel manager could be employed by two or three small groups. They are an essential part of managerial organisation.  They are most essential in the selection of the proper type of personnel, in the placement of personnel, in the desirable movement of personnel and how the personnel can be further trained or placed in effective posts.  We ought to stress this particular aspect.  It is something that <Col N="1439" /> is required in order to have the best possible industrial relations.  A group system for the smaller groups is something that is desirable both from their own point of view and from the point of view of industrial relations as a whole.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement is not immune from criticism at the moment.  I appeal to the trade union movement and to trade unionists to sit tight and examine the situation and not allow the organisation to fall asunder or deteriorate. There has been an amount of disruption, an amount of friction within the movement.  This could have very serious consequences for the members in the future.  I appeal to members of the trade union organisation as a trade unionist to sit tight at the moment, examine the situation in relation to past problems, endeavour to rectify them so that we will have a trade union organisation that is necessary and desirable so that the workers' case will be put forward with accuracy and honesty.  We have the capacity to do that.  There are people within the movement who are not concerned too much about the workers, about the employers, about the country as a whole, but we have a large number of dedicated men, men who are conscious of the workers' problems and who are effective and efficient.  However, we have people who are inefficient and ineffective and who have created a bad image for the trade union organisation. Trade unionists must look to the future and must look for complete efficiency within their organisation and ensure that the best possible personnel are obtained to put forward their wishes at the conference table.  Blundering along will not solve the problems of the workers.  We need highly skilled and efficient personnel.  The employers have at their disposal the finances to have the best type of brain available from their point of view to counteract the workers' claim or to put the claim for the employer forward while we have some who are still prepared to blunder along and create confusion in the minds of our own members and all concerned with the problems.</P>
    <P>I hope that the divisions that are <Col N="1440" /> evident at the moment will soon be healed and that we will have solid, sound, effective organisations to move forward into the future.  Modern economic complexity requires a more involved role for the trade union and an even more involved role for the trade unionist, a through understanding by the individual union and by the individual union member of the situation in which he moves, in which his union moves and in which the country must move.  The question of communication within the trade union is one that needs to be improved with a better understanding of all these problems, a better understanding by each and every member of the trade union movement of the manner in which we all must move. There are many defects no doubt in the system whereby a few people make decisions.  Trade union organisations will have to equip themselves properly in every respect, and provide all the modern facilities necessary to entice people to come along to union meetings.</P>
    <P>Many members of the trade union organisation and people who are not in a position to be members of the trade union organisation have expressed their concern at the position of the lower paid worker and their satisfaction with the views expressed by the Minister on the subject.  These views have been endorsed by Deputies on the Fine Gael and Labour benches.  The Minister expressed the view some time ago that something must be done to close the gap between the lower-paid workers and other workers.  The question of retaining existing differentials is a matter that must be tackled in an honourable and realistic manner.  It is an immense problem but with goodwill and with a proper explanation of the problem to the workers as a whole, I am quite sure we can improve the lot of the lower-paid worker.  The many trade unionists to whom I have spoken in recent times have indicated their satisfaction that a Minister of State should adopt this attitude.  This indicates the type of man he is and the desire he has to help the weaker section of the community.  I would ask the trade union officials, whatever the difficulties may be in relation to the variety of workers they represent, to give <Col N="1441" /> sympathetic consideration to this problem. I would ask the Minister again to do what he can to further this matter with Congress.  I was glad to see responsible members of Congress indicate that they would tackle this problem. We can hope that in due course the lower-paid worker will get some satisfaction now that all the political Parties have expressed their concern and their support for the Minister's views.</P>
    <P>As a worker, I know how workers are treated.  Much can be done on the workshop floor by the employer in order to bring about better industrial relations.  I do agree with some of the statements made that workers are regarded as ciphers and treated in a very impersonal way by employers.  On the last occasion I was in a workshop I had a number just like a convict.  When a man went along for his paypacket he gave his number; one would think he was never baptised judging by the manner in which the employer treated him. The dignity of the trade unionist is something that will have to be brought home to the employer.  This can be done by providing jobs with more meaning, where a person can exercise his initative and his energy, instead of the soul-destroying jobs that at present occupy the attention of many workers. The employers and the trade union organisations can do much to create a better understanding between management and workers.</P>
    <P>On the question of the various crafts and trades, in other sections of the community, people holding diplomas or certificates of one type or another receive special payments.  Many craftsmen, in addition to serving their apprenticeship, embark on long periods of intensive study in order to perfect their craft, and it is suggested that the craftsmen should get allowances to encourage them to develop their skills and to increase their knowledge, thus benefiting the nation as a whole.  The development of skilled labour is a factor that is not fully appreciated.  The Industrial Training Authority has foreseen the necessity for additional crafts and skills in order to meet our current and future needs.  I would suggest that, where possible, allowances would be <Col N="1442" /> given to tradesmen to encourage them to equip themselves adequately for the future.</P>
    <P>We all want our share, and rightly so, of the prosperity that flows from the development of our skills and crafts.  We must agree on how this can be attained.  It is open to the people at the conference table to discover how the splitting of the cake can best be done to the benefit of those who by their labours produced the development and prosperity.  There are a variety of factors and a variety of problems which must be tackled at the conference table if we are to have prolonged industrial stability.  Many ways have been suggested. Comprehensive agreements is one of the suggestions made in relation to long-term industrial prosperity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The rates of grant for farm buildings which apply outside the pilot areas are reasonable and I do not propose to alter them at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have frequently explained the special rates of grants payable in pilot areas for farm buildings and other works are primarily an inducement to <Col N="1443" /> farmers to co-operate with their advisers in the development work which is going on in these areas and which is to a large extent of a trial or exploratory nature.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there are several important schemes in operation which are designed specially for the needs of farmers in western counties. In particular special steps have been taken to strengthen the agricultural advisory service.  Progressive farmers in western areas who avail of this service to carry out planned development of their holdings, including the provision or improvement of farm buildings, will derive the maximum benefit from the existing scale of grants.</P>
    <P>In addition, those smaller farmers who come into the &ldquo;potentially viable&rdquo; category can avail of the Small Farm (Incentive Bonus) Scheme and in this way not only develop their holdings on a planned basis but also qualify for the bonus grants available under the Scheme.</P>

      <P>This is a matter for Dublin Corporation who have informed me that emergency procedures are available to keep snow, or ice-bound city streets open to traffic, and that these were put into operation on the morning of Friday, 14th February.

Would the Minister know why the procedures were not repeated when it was found that the water which had been formed at the big hills had re-frozen and that this caused the trouble?</P>

      <P>The Government announced recently their decision to set up a review body to advise them on remuneration in the upper ranges in the public sector.  The Government have decided that, pending the receipt and consideration of the review body's recommendations, decisions on findings resulting from the processing of claims, including awards already made but not implemented, will be deferred.

      <P>I am informed that work ceased on 28th January, 1969, in the firm in question as a result of a shortage of fuel oil.  The processing and decision of the resulting claims to unemployment benefit is a matter for and is being carried out by the Department of Labour.  Benefit due is being issued this week.  Having regard to the industrial situation prevailing for several weeks past, there would not appear to have been undue delay in dealing with the cases in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was compelled to put down this question because it was not an individual, or even a few individuals, who were involved in this case. In fact, some hundreds of workers were involved and very considerable hardship, of necessity, accrued to themselves and their families during the past number of weeks awaiting a decision from the Minister in respect of their entitlement to benefit.  Surely something should be done about matters of this kind?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that work ceased on the 28th January, so that it is not unduly long, particularly in view of the fact that the local exchange branch officer is not usually geared with staff to meet peak situations dealing with, perhaps, some three hundred people at a time.</P>

    <P>More recently, when I met the members of the Consultative Council on the General Hospital Services on the occasion of their first meeting, I made this position quite clear to them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I have.  I want to comment on some of the remarks Deputy O'Leary made.  He dealt with the balloting procedure as embodied in the Bill.  One would think that the trade union organisations were not in favour of the type of balloting arrangement indicated in the Bill.  I would say that this is a democratic type of process where one can ballot in secret, not in the manner Deputy O'Leary has indicated.  The secret ballot is the most effective ballot and should produce the desired results.  The people would not be intimidated by agitators or other personnel who have a particular motive.  It is a desirable inclusion in the Bill and one welcomed by all responsible trade unionists.  The only trade union official I have heard so far speak against it was Deputy O'Leary.  I meet many trade unionists and they have all favoured this particular inclusion in the Bill.  It is one that will meet with the general approval of all responsible people.  It adds to the democratic set-up of the trade union organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary dealt with the workers' democracy policy in some little detail.  I should just like to make a few comments in so far as he associated the remarks made by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Cosgrave, and the Leader of the <Col N="1463" /> Fianna Fáil Party.  He spoke about the sick system we had in this country. The Deputy spoke of the sick system of industrial relations that would be cured by the implementation of the workers' democracy policy.  The Deputy indicated that the system had what he called pneumonia.  The introduction of the workers' democracy policy might mean we would be suffering from Hong Kong flu or Cuban cancer in our industrial relations system.  I do not think that would be a cure for the ills that are at the moment contaminating the system of industrial relations.  The Deputy spoke about the wonderful participation in industries.  Some time ago he confused or disturbed the workers' minds by indicating that Aer Lingus would be one of the industries where this would be tried on, together with the Sugar Company. Many members of Aer Lingus have come to me and said that if I could in any way impede the Labour Party from once again interfering with or strangling Aer Lingus, perhaps I would do so.  It is not the first time.  I wonder why Deputy O'Leary picked out Aer Lingus as one of the two concerns where they could try out this policy. The Deputy spoke about it here today. No wonder a worker in Aer Lingus, Guinness', the Sugar Company or Pierce's would be concerned about future employment under a Labour Government.  There is every reason for workers to be concerned.  We know the mess that was made of a particular concern before and this concern would be a guinea pig again for the implementation of the workers' democracy.  I do not know about Guinness'.  I do not know how Guinness' or Pierce's or the Sugar Company get around this, but it certainly has disturbed the minds of the workers as to their future.  Men cannot plan and are concerned about their ability to do so if this policy is forced upon them.</P>
    <P>I want to do my part and to say to the trade unionists in Pierce's, the Sugar Company, Aer Lingus and Guinness' and the other companies threatened by the implementation of the policy of the workers' democracy <Col N="1464" /> that it has failed in so many places over such a long period.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to say much more. Once again I want to indicate my approval of the contents of both of these Bills and to say how glad I am that we have here a fairminded Minister who has done so much in such a short time for the benefit of the workers and who will continue to bring in legislation to benefit Irish workers.  It is easy to see why the criticism has come from Deputy O'Leary, as criticism always comes from Deputy O'Leary of responsible persons who are making an honest effort and are showing up some of his colleagues in a very poor light indeed.  As I pointed out earlier, every single measure that aided the workers was enacted by Fianna Fáil.  We will enact more such legislation despite Deputy O'Leary and his colleagues.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to abolish the Act dealing with the ESB and to abolish the political levy which has inflicted on so many people so much hardship by way of intimidation.  I am sorry the Minister did not embody in this legislation a provision to abolish the political levy.  It had some meaning in the past but now that certain unions have aligned themselves with political Parties, the whole thing has become undesirable.  I do not see why a Fianna Fáil, or for that matter a Fine Gael, trade unionist should have to make a contribution to a union which opts to pay the political levy.  My contacts with trade unionists are many and varied and I can tell the Minister that both Bills have the blessing of responsible members of trade unions.  They know that under the Minister's guidance no harm will come to them through any legislation enacted during his term of office.  They know such legislation will be progressive and in their interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be agreed universally by all shades of opinion that some sort of legislation is necessary to take us out of the, shall we say, industrial chaos in which we find ourselves at the moment.  In a competitive age such as this, no country can afford an industrial row, and certainly <Col N="1465" /> no country can afford an industrial row such as that which has existed &mdash;we hope it will end soon&mdash;in this country during the past few weeks.</P>
      <P>It is well to bear in mind that when you have industrial chaos and the wide disturbances which we have had recently, the greater hardship mainly falls on those who are least able to bear it.  In the competitive age in which we live, it is necessary for every country to produce as cheaply as possible if they wish to stay in world markets and to be able to maintain and sustain their exports.  No matter to which section of the community one belongs, one must be disturbed seriously by the conditions that exist in industrial relations here today.</P>
      <P>I personally welcome this legislation. At the outset I must say I do not think it is strong enough to cure the situation we are faced with at the moment. There are two major features in the two Bills.  One is an endeavour to prevent wildcat strikes and the second is to try to set up some form of compulsory arbitration.  The latter is subject to a lot of factors.  First of all, I should like to deal with the issue in regard to the stopping of wildcat strikes and of minority strikes.  All will agree that minority strikes are a distaster not only for the community at large but for the trade unions themselves.</P>
      <P>Legislation tends to produce groups and the registration of groups and, to a certain extent, to make trade unions official.  Because we are living in changing circumstances&mdash;we are in the twentieth century and things have changed during the years&mdash;we appreciate that it is necessary to have some official recognition of trade unions for the protection of the unions themselves but also for the protection of the public as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation, as I read it, suggests that it will not be possible for a strike to take place without the consent of the majority of the union&mdash;the members will have to vote and there must be a majority decision whether to take strike action or not.  The legislation further provides that the leaders of trade unions can themselves decide to reject the majority opinion of the unions concerned if they consider it to <Col N="1466" /> be undesirable to accept it.  I do not object to that because if you have responsible people in control of trade unions they should have the responsibility, and not only the responsibility but the right, to accept the opinion as to whether a strike should take place.</P>
    <P>I think it is there that this legislation falls down.  The Minister seems to be creating a situation whereby only a majority can vote for a strike and whereby the majority decision can be controverted by the trade union leaders, but the Minister does not give the trade union leaders a constituted authority: the legislation provides only that the leaders may take certain action.  This leaves the problem of trade union leaders themselves being put in a very ambiguous position.  Supposing they decide, knowing the ill effects of so much industrial unrest&mdash; and they may have inside information that the majority of union members themselves may not have&mdash;to controvert the majority decision of the union, these leaders will be in the position where, short of being bound by law, they can be deposed, kicked out, the following day.</P>
    <P>I should like respectfully to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that this is one of the disasters of the trade union movement in this country at the moment.  I have been conscious of it in a small way.  I have been brought in as arbitrator in small industrial disputes&mdash;small men are asked to deal with small matters and I am not claiming to have dealt with national matters such as the Minister has done.  When a settlement is made somebody else decides that the settlement is not just and equitable and the workers decide to go on strike again.  Because they go on strike, the trade union is placed in the position of either not recognising the strike or of having inter-union trouble, and at the least excuse it is turned into an official strike.  This has happened not only in the instances I am referring to: in some cases I went back again and the disputes were settled.  But that is happening nationally and as such it is a serious matter.</P>
    <P>To have successful legislation here we must recognise the fact that the trade unions play a very important <Col N="1467" /> part in the life of the country.  They are associated with and built into our economy, just as they are in other countries.  If we are going to recognise that fact, as we must in a sound democracy, they will have to be made secure and their officials will have to be given that authority by legislation. The Minister may say that there are 125 unions and it would not be very easy to do it.  I am sure the Minister will correct me if I am wrong in my surmise that this authority does not exist in the Bill, this binding authority to make a trade union leader a legal official so that he cannot be discharged just because he takes a decision which he believes is for the good of the union.  The ordinary safeguards would naturally exist, of course, so that if a person is no longer considered suitable to hold that office he would be removable under the different conditions that obtain in every Bill that is passed.</P>
    <P>That is the only way that you can get secure and binding agreement, by giving the elected officials of trade unions the right to take decisions which will be upheld.  This raises a matter in regard to legislation which deals with labour problems.  It is a delicate matter, because there is always a great deal of ambiguity in the phraseology used in Bills like this, and somebody comes along and says that the workers' rights are being attacked, but at the same time, even assuming that trade union officials are given that authority to which I feel they are entitled, there would have to be some form of penalty to make it binding. If I might refer for a moment to recent legislation enacted in the British House of Commons by the Minister's counterpart, the Rt. Hon. Barbara Castle, who is responsible for trade union relations there, certain penalties were included in that legislation.  There is no point in living in an atmosphere of wishful thinking and hoping that simply by passing laws, laws that are, mark you, not very clear, these will be in any way binding from the point of view of stopping a trade dispute.  Therefore, if the Minister wishes to take a strong hand and he will have to do so&mdash;he <Col N="1468" /> has been in the Department of Labour now for four years without doing anything, although I appreciate that he has been trying to negotiate without any real success and is now back in square one and that is why he has brought in this legislation&mdash;and if he does bring in legislation it should be effective legislation.  In my view this legislation, relative to the majority rule, does not go far enough.</P>
    <P>Another matter within the Bill is the question of trying to resolve disputes. It is fair to say that there are many people involved in the present dispute who are out of work and who do not want to be out of work but they have to be because of the existing set-up in the trade union movement.  They do not like to pass the pickets.  I am not an expert on union regulations but I think it is against regulations for them to do so.  The Minister is introducing what he calls the rights commissioners and I take it that the rights commissioner will have the function which the Labour Court originally had.  In other words, he will be a conciliation officer.  As far as I know, the Labour Court has no function except to try to bring the parties together and to try to get them to agree.  This has been going on for three weeks and I think that ultimately they will be successful but whether that will be the end of industrial unrest or not is another matter.  The idea is to have a rights commissioner who if asked by both parties may intervene but if one party objects the functions of the commissioner as far as settling the strike is concerned cease to exist.  It seems to me that this is rather meaningless.  It is not bringing us a step forward towards having peace and harmony restored to the unhappy situation in which we find ourselves at present.  The Bill also says that if the dispute is not resolved by the rights commissioner then subject to both parties agreeing, the matter goes to the Labour Court. Apparently the Labour Court then is going to have the function of settling the strike or imposing a settlement. That seems a very roundabout way of meeting the situation.</P>
    <P>I have contacts with many working class people who are in trade unions <Col N="1469" /> and they are seriously disturbed about the present situation.  They hope above all that there will be some form of compulsory negotiation introduced which will settle industrial unrest.  Unless this is done we are going to finish up economically in a very much worse situation than that in which we find ourselves at present.  Only a few weeks ago the Minister for Finance indicated that the economic situation was not too healthy but now we have passed through three weeks of industrial unrest and a great many firms have ground to a halt; as a result the workers have received no wages and there has been no production.  That is a national loss and we cannot afford to that sort of thing.  We cannot afford to go on on those lines and if the Minister is bringing in legislation he should bring in legislation which has some real meaning.</P>
    <P>One serious lack in the Bill is something to provide for a system similar to the American system of a cooling off period before a strike takes place.  I suggest that we should introduce a cooling off period when it has been decided to have a strike.  As we are hoping to do away with unofficial strikes, which are no benefit to anybody, we should have legislation providing for this cooling off period.  In the United States this cooling off period is 90 days.  Very often when there is a strike pending in the United States, where they have national strikes which grind not only the whole economy but the whole administration of the country to a halt, it has often happened that the threatened strike did not take place because the people involved got together during that period and discussed the matter properly.  The Minister could easily introduce legislation to that effect and I do not think that there would be very much opposition to it from the trade union movement.  There could be a cooling off period beginning from the time the conciliation officer was approached.  Unless the Minister makes it mandatory on both sides to the argument to take the matter to the conciliation court, which is the rights commissioner, before striking, then the whole exercise will be absolutely valueless.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1470" /> At the moment the position is that one side says &ldquo;No&rdquo; and the other side says &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;; you are as you were before and the factory door is closed and the strike goes on.  All this results in hardship not only to the workers themselves but to the people of the country as a whole&mdash;particularly the poorer sections&mdash;and also affects national production which is so essential to all of us.</P>
    <P>For that reason I suggest three things to the Minister, first, that he should make it binding on both sides before striking to go to the rights commissioner; that he should make it not mandatory but possible for the freezing or cooling-off period to be at least six weeks to prevent a recurrence of what we have just been through.  I further suggest that he give the trade union leaders the right to be made official, in other words put them in the position that they could take a decision that they believe to be right and in the interests of the workers they represent without being deposed.  That is one of the major troubles today.</P>
    <P>It would be of great help if the Minister were to tell the House the exact constitution of the Labour Court at present.  I do not blame the Labour Court for any of the difficulties they have had to face because they are, as they were described recently, a filleted institution.  They are not given any power.  They were created&mdash;I think in 1946&mdash;for the purpose of settling strikes but with absolutely no fundamental power to do so.  I believe the constitution of the Labour Court at the moment is that it is something that comes into effect only when it is needed and only comes into being when industrial relations break down.  I believe the chairman of the Labour Court is a civil servant&mdash;of that I am not sure&mdash; but if I am right in that surmise I should like to put to the Minister that a civil servant is not necessarily the best person to know what is going on around him.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the other members of the Labour Court are or whether they are all civil servants or if the members come from the Minister's Department or from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I note that in <Col N="1471" /> the Minister's opening speech he indicated that the Labour Court would be set up on wider lines.  I think many would agree with me that, if we are to have a Labour Court, and the new Labour Court under this new legislation&mdash;provided the dispute gets as far as the Labour Court&mdash;is going to be a binding court, it should be widely representative of every section of the community. The personnel should be wholetime and should be people chosen entirely outside the political arena.</P>
    <P>I do not like mentioning names but it seems to me that you would naturally require a representative of the trade unions to begin with.  It is quite obvious to everybody who that representative should be.  In the recent dispute, to my mind, that gentleman has stood out with tremendous courage.  It seems to me that if he would accept a full-time appointment on this board he would be highly desirable as he would have the experience, the understanding and goodwill necessary to establish good industrial relations.  We should certainly have somebody from the employers' side with wide experience in industrial work.  I am not terribly keen on lawyers myself.  I found they were rather costly people to have anything to do with but we would require somebody with legal training because so many quibbles and doubts and legal problems will arise.</P>
    <P>The court should be, perhaps, considerably larger than that.  I am not very keen on a High Court judge presiding over it.  High Court judges may be all right in deciding law or evaluating facts from witnesses and in trying to decide which witness is telling the truth and which is not when controversy arises, but I would be in favour of a much bigger Labour Court, one of at least seven or eight men of outstanding ability, people fully conversant with facts.  You would require somebody either concerned with finance or economy.  I should prefer a financier to an economist.  I always think that if you get in an economist to do anything you are getting into dangerous waters right away.  I think they should be fulltime officials.  They should be asked to serve the country in that court.  They <Col N="1472" /> should be well paid and fully pensionable no matter what it costs.  They will represent an outside point of view which is always helpful.  They will be people who in the past have been associated with trade disputes on both sides, people who will be concerned in the stability of the State.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  Perhaps, I have been pretty outspoken but it is time that somebody was outspoken.  I do not think the Bill goes far enough.  I think we are at the stage when we are introducing legislation which actually has been forced upon us by the unhappy state of affairs here.  The Minister should introduce a Bill which is really binding to protect all sections of the community because each of us is in this fight for economic survival.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to say much about this Bill except to comment on the timing of it.  I think the Minister chose this time particularly in which to introduce the Bill.  Perhaps, we should look at the situation which exists today.  We have seen these strikes but I do not think any effort is being made to diagnose the problem that exists.  It is merely a struggle by the worker to survive in the face of a rapidly rising cost of living that makes life almost intolerable for the worker and his family.  We cannot overlook the fact that wages today are inadequate to cope with the incessant demands made on the family.  This is the basic problem. Almost 40 per cent of our workers are earning less than £10 a week.  I do not know whether the Minister has ever endeavoured to ascertain how far £10 a week will go with a family.  It is virtually impossible to make it stretch to meet subsistence level.  I have seen these problems where people cannot cope and I have often wondered why they did not seek an easy way out.  But they go on hoping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the problem: that a man must fight for his rights, must fight to seek a normal week's wages.  That is what workers are not receiving at present.  I do not think we can legislate on matters like this.  We need a whole new approach to the matter.  I do not think the legislation in the case of the ESB solved any problem.  I do not think the <Col N="1473" /> Minister could honestly say it did, any more than this will solve it.  The Minister knows what the Donovan Commission reported in Britain.  They dismissed the idea of compulsory secret ballots.  Most unions have secret ballots and I do not see the need for compulsory ones.  I do not think this Trade Union Bill will achieve anything.  The Minister and his Department would be better employed in promoting a greater respect by employers for human dignity, for the dignity of the worker.</P>
    <P>Management has a great deal to learn.  Methods are outmoded.  There is lack of dialogue between workers and management.  That is the basic problem today.  What is worse is the indifference and apathy of the employer towards the worker and the refusal to examine into a fault on the part of management.  What is national production in aid of?  It is in aid of the citizen so that he may enjoy a better standard of living.  We must respect the rights of workers and the dignity of workers.  The solution to the problem lies in worker participation.  That was emphasised by the late Pope John in his encyclicals.  The worker must be respected.  In this Christian country there is no respect for the worker. There can only be respect for the worker when the worker is given more and more participation.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court has done a great deal of work and I pay tribute to the Chief Conciliation Officer, whom I meet so often and whose only ambition is to bring about an end to strikes. He is a tremendous person.  Nothing matters except bringing strikes to an end.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the previous speaker who said that this Trade Union Bill does not go far enough.  I do not think the Bill will bring about greater industrial harmony.  We want harmony in industry, but this Bill will not bring harmony.  The Minister should emphasise that employers must not seek excessive profits and that they must be prepared to share profits with their workers.  Not until that happy situation envolves will we have that industrial harmony so essential to progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pleased when <Col N="1474" /> the Minister said yesterday that he would be happy to see the Minister for Labour coming to this House frequently with Bills, taking one step at a time on the road to progress and reform.  It is very important that we should bear that in mind.  One cannot have radical, sudden and revolutionary changes in systems and traditions built up over the years.  Not all trade unions are afraid of change, but all are very, very proud of whatever traditions they have established.  I belong to a trade union which will be celebrating its golden jubilee this year. We would be very loath to smother our identity in that of a larger union. Some commercial travellers who joined bigger unions have regretted doing so because they find they do not get the individual and specialist attention their trade requires.</P>
      <P>The provisions in the industrial Relations Bill are excellent.  In the Trade Union Bill there are some provisions which cause me some concern.  Section 9 provides that an individual may put a picket on his place of employment. There are cases in which there is only one craftsman or one commercial traveller employed in a factory.  There could be several entrances to that factory and it would be necessary, therefore, for his union to employ people to do picket duty.  People using any of the entrances to the factory should be aware that there is a dispute in progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that Part IV of the Bill would not interfere with existing unions.  I have not had an opportunity of studying the 1941 Act, but there is nothing in this Bill which would protect unions with less than 500 members.  I am sure an assurance will be forthcoming.  It would be a good idea to have an explanation on the record.  My chief concern with regard to the group negotiating licence is that it seems to me that, if a majority of the workers in a particular industry decide they want to form a group and have a group negotiating licence, this group will be the body authorised to speak on behalf of all the employees, including craftsmen and others with specialist abilities.  I believe that an individual who goes to a vocational <Col N="1475" /> school, studies a trade and serves his time is entitled to more wages than a man who has not learned any special skill.  As I see it, the position under this group negotiating licence will be that, when the group is formed, the majority of the workers will decide whether or not what is offered to the craftsman is adequate.  In this way the small unions catering for specialist people will lose some of their power. They will be unable to negotiate in the way they have been negotiating up to this.</P>
    <P>A strike by the Irish Commercial Travellers' Federation is very rare but, when a strike is necessary, we want the right to pursue the strike, as we did in the past, and we would expect the support of the other unions, the same support as we got in the past. Two or three years ago the Irish Congress of Trade Unions at their annual delegate conference decided, as a matter of policy, that if you are going to enter into a dispute you must serve on Congress and on your local trades council one week's notice of your intention to serve one week's strike notice.  Where this Bill provides that notice may be sent to the Labour Court when a majority decision is taken to have a strike it should, I think, also be provided that this strike cannot be pursued for a period of two weeks&mdash;not 90 days, as Deputy Esmonde suggested.  At least let us give Congress power to implement their own decision on the matter.  This is what Congress wants and, if this is done and if it is incorporated into their own rules, then there can be no objection to our writing it into this Bill. The Minister might consider putting down an amendment to section 14 in that regard.</P>
    <P>With reference to Deputy Belton's remarks last night, I should like to say that most of the trade unions which have their head offices and executive in England have tried to encourage their branches in this State to set up their own executive and become autonomous in their own right. I believe the reason many of them will not do this is that they know <Col N="1476" /> there are vast resources of money in the main unions, and they want to have them available to themselves in the case of long disputes.  I do not know whether it would be constitutional to insist on these unions basing themselves here.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Belton that it would be a good idea if that were done because I remember, in a strike which took place in the centre of the city here in the furnishing industry some years ago, the workers had agreed to accept the employers' offer, but it took something like ten to 14 days to get executive sanction from England so that they could go back to work.  The ballot papers had to come here from England, and they had to go back to England to be counted.  To my mind, that is an inefficient way for a trade union to run its business, and it is not very helpful to the general trade union situation here.</P>
    <P>Some reference was made to the lower paid workers.  I believe there is only one way of solving the problem of the lower paid workers and bringing about a situation where they would have a steadily increasing take home wage packet for a 40 or 42 hour week. The only way is to set out a minimum wage, to lay down a minimum wage by law.  I do not care how low it is to start with.  It would have a part to play in the political scene.  The Government in office would see that the minimum wage was adjusted in a fair and equitable way to improve the lot of the workers.  It could become a political instrument like the social welfare services. People talk about their social welfare record when they are looking for support at elections.  The minimum wage would assume the same aspect.</P>
    <P>I do not care how low the figure is to start with.  Let us start somewhere. That is the only way we can get more money for these people without setting off spirals of claims to protect the differential which is the cause of the present engineering dispute.  I admit that many of the officials in the craft unions guard the differential most jealously.  If a craftsman in the ESB gets a rise in wages the craft unions will make sure that the same rate of <Col N="1477" /> wages will apply in private industry.  I understand that the maintenance of the differential with the ESB scale has a lot to do with the present difficulty in which the country finds itself.</P>
    <P>I believe the conciliation officers should be appointed on a fairly permanent and pensionable basis.  There is little doubt that there can be a better understanding of problems when they are dealt with by the same man or group of men over a long period.  I have been told this by people engaged in negotiations although, occasionally, someone says: &ldquo;There is one fellow and I hope I never get him.&rdquo;  Over a period of time these people get to understand the various problems and they should not be, as Deputy O'Leary said, merely carriers of messages from one room to another.  They learn and understand the problems, and they can use their initiative to help the two sides.</P>
    <P>Another matter I am concerned with is that, while I agree that the workers have a right to organise themselves for their own protection, the employers have also organised themselves.  There are several employers organisations, and there is the Federated Union of Employers.  In the craft strike at present in progress, I know of two or three manufacturers who would gladly have settled this dispute privately with their own employees and their unions but they felt that they belonged to the FUE and, if they had paid their subscription and had people carrying out negotiations for them, they must more or less take instructions.  To my mind the FUE have decided in this case that they would probably get the best terms by making the strike as extensive as possible, and the unions followed the same course.  It is the general workers who are now going back to work who have been rational.  In one instance I know of something like 200 workers out of work because one maintenance man is involved.  The employer would gladly pay that one maintenance man even more than the union demand in order to keep his factory open because he is losing export orders as well as home orders.</P>
    <P>It has yet to be demonstrated to me that the FUE insistence on all settlements <Col N="1478" /> being dealt with as a group is a good thing.  I think it is a bad thing. Before the war when a company had a good balance sheet and was making a profit the workers said they wanted a share.  It was not done on a national basis, or group employers basis, or on a collective negotiation licence.  It sometimes seems that the bigger the units in the negotiations the harder the line that is taken.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to note that the Minister is fully aware of the tremendous legal expenses which can be involved in the amalgamation of two unions.  The classic example was the IEIETU and the ETU, now the NEETU.  I understand from some people who worked on those negotiations that the expenses involved were such that, had the unions known before the negotiations started how much they would be, the negotiations would never have got off the ground.  The Minister has made provisions for this in this Bill.  I am quite sure that adequate assistance will be made available to the unions concerned.</P>
    <P>When Deputy O'Leary was talking last night about the Labour Party policy document he admitted to me that every resolution at the Labour Party Conference was passed.  Every resolution at last year's annual delegate conference of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions was passed, with one exception, and that was referred to the executive committee.  Furthermore, delegates to functions of this nature are somewhat intimidated because there is an enormous crowd of people present.  It is seldom that one hears criticism of any of the proposals.  This is a bad thing.  Perhaps the trade unions themselves would have a look at this and see if they can get more dialogue and controversy on the various matters.</P>

      <P>That is all I want to say.  However, I should like this assurance and I should like to be able to get, before the Second Stage is over, some type of assurance that the craft unions and the small specialist unions, regardless of what any worker in any group of industries or manufacturing <Col N="1479" /> concerns may say, will be entitled to retain the rights they now have.  If they are not allowed to do this a very serious strain will be placed on Congress when the craft unions and craftsmen find themselves outvoted all the time by the general workers.  They could bring about a situation which we never want to see in this country again, namely, that there will be two congresses.  I hope there is nothing in this Bill that might tend to bring about that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to echo what Deputy Patrick Belton said in opening this debate and in the most moderate language I can command.  I do really think the time has come when the Irish Congress of Trade Unions should say to the Trade Union Congress in London: &ldquo;None of your unions function in France.  They do not function in Germany, in Belgium or in Sweden. Do wake up to the fact that, although Ireland is a neighbour with a history of long friendly relations with Great Britain since Great Britain left this country as an occupying power, it is not appropriate for British trade unions to be functioning in Ireland as relics of a system that has survived from pre-Treaty times.  It gives rise to incongruities and to problems which must be as troublesome to the Trade Union Congress in Great Britain as they are to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and to the community as a whole in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the problem.  It is that many of these small relics of past history are, in fact, what Deputy Lemass described as the wealthy craft unions and that the members here are, not unnaturally, reluctant to cut themselves off from the almost unlimited funds of the unions in Great Britain.  However, all Parties ought to bear in mind the fact that busy trade union officials dealing with these craft unions in England which have large memberships scattered over a wide variety of industries, have very little time and, indeed, very little equipment to understand the industrial problems which are arising in Ireland.  Very naturally, <Col N="1480" /> they are inclined to delegate all matters of decision to the local officials here and the strike pay involved is peanuts to the immense resources of the union.  Therefore, there is no particular urge on the senior officials of the union in Great Britain to interest themselves at all intimately in the industrial disputes in which their members are participating except to pay the strike pay whenever it becomes due, being virtually indifferent to the issues involved in the pay dispute proceeding here.</P>
    <P>As we have learned so painfully in our recent past, such disputes could bring on this country something tantamount to catastrophe.  It would be a mistake to imagine that this is a peculiarity of the Republic here.  Of course, we all have present in our minds the fantastic situation obtaining in Vickers Shipyards in the north-east of England where plumbers were out on strike for four or five months because the fitters objected to their brazing pipes. They naturally reached a <i>modus vivendi</i>.  They all went back on Monday whereupon the fitters all came out on Tuesday and Vickers Shipyards are now at a standstill for over six months because the plumbers and the fitters cannot agree on who should braze the pipes.</P>
    <P>It would be a very great mistake for Members of this House not to have some measure of understanding for what superficially appears to be a grotesque situation.  These demarcation strikes often assume externally a very absurd pattern.  It is a source of astonishment to us that, in England, the Trade Union Congress and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions cannot devise effective arbitration procedure which would avoid disputes of this kind.  I think both Congresses are probably moving in that direction and I believe that it is in that direction the solution of that problem will be found.  Unless some consultation between the two Congresses can bring it about, I do not think any satisfactory solution of the present position, of unions functioning in this country whose headquarters are located in Great Britain, can be found.  The Minister should consult with the Irish Congress <Col N="1481" /> of Trade Unions and, indeed, with the Minister for Employment and Productivity in England, Mrs. Barbara Castle, and, through her, with the Congress of Trade Unions in Great Britain as to whether in a friendly and cooperative spirit that particular problem can be solved.  I do not wish to dwell on the qualities of foreign Ministers but Mrs. Castle seems to be a very able woman and is doing her best. However, it may take some negotiation. It is not an easy problem.  I fully realise how intricate it is.  I believe, ultimately, it will appear to both Congresses that the desirable thing is that the Congress functioning in Ireland should have its headquarters here and its effective authority sited within our own country.</P>
    <P>I want to say something that I think has been overlooked to some extent. I think the Minister for Labour would make a very considerable contribution to the acceptability of the proposed legislation if he placed some more emphasis upon it.  I did not come down in yesterday's shower and I have been employing men directly or indirectly for the last 45 years and I feel that the blame for a great deal of bad labour relations in this country rests squarely on the shoulders of employers.</P>
    <P>I want to try to diagnose the reason for that.  In family companies, family firms, which are becoming scarcer and scarcer, the number of trade disputes that reach the point of strike are minimal. One very rarely finds a strike occurring in a business where the proprietor and the workers are familiar friends.  There may be rows and ructions and threats of strikes, organisers arriving and people &ldquo;lepping&rdquo; around but one rarely finds pickets out and the whole paraphernalia of a trade dispute in progress.  So, we are really dealing in this context with the large employer, the firm controlled by a board of directors.  I have discussed this with a number of men who are busy as directors of companies responsible for the employment of large numbers of men and women.  It is surprising the frequency with which I have got the answer: &ldquo;The boards of <Col N="1482" /> directors are too busy to deal with personnel matters.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Minister for Labour that one of the most constructive things he could do would be to ask his colleague Deputy Colley, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to meet the FUE and to say to them: &ldquo;Listen, gentlemen, I ask you to start a movement among directors in this country which would provide that there would be, where there are more than a certain number of employees, not only a personnel manager but a personnel director and you should not stop there.  On your weekly and monthly agenda a variety of topics are set forth for discussion and decision by the board, the last of which is, almost invariably, personnel. In practice what you do is resolve the specific problems presented to the board by the various divisions of your enterprise.  It comes to lunch time or it comes to tea time and there are one or two items left on the agenda, one of which is personnel, and you say: `Oh, let Jack Power or Tom Burke'&mdash;whoever is the personnel manager&mdash;`deal with that and, if there is any trouble, he can come back to us'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is fatal because the aim ought to be to prevent trouble developing. When the trouble has developed it is usually too late for the board of directors to take any effective action.  I would seriously suggest that one of the most valuable reforms that could be constituted would be to persuade the FUE to carry conviction to the minds of boards of directors of large concerns employing considerable bodies of men that the first item on the agenda should be personnel and that there should be one director directly responsible to the board for personnel matters; that before they could proceed to the consideration of any other business a responsible board of directors would require themselves to be satisfied that, not only was there no trouble in existence, but that there was no trouble looming on the horizon in the personnel division and, if trouble was looming, that they would regard it as their indispensable duty to tackle that trouble forthwith and, if necessary, to have in the personnel manager.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1483" /> Here is a point to which I would draw special attention.  I believe a responsible board of directors with a competent personnel director and a competent personnel manager should be satisfied that that personnel manager is on terms of sufficiently intimate acquaintance and friendly co-operation with the officers of the trade union with whom he has to negotiate to be in a position to say: &ldquo;Mr. Farrell&rdquo;&mdash;or whatever his name is&mdash;&ldquo;is the trade union organiser responsible for our factory. Can I bring him in here so that we can discuss together the possibility of trouble that threatens to develop?&rdquo; It is a source of continuing astonishment to me that subconsciously, or sometimes consciously, the personnel establishment of a firm regards itself as the perennial enemy of the corresponding trade union official, whereas in fact a competent personnel officer or manager ought to be on terms of the most intimate correspondence with the organiser who is organising his factory.  The board of directors ought to be in contact with the general secretary of the union if they feel the situation between their personnel manager and the union organiser in their factory is getting to the point of being at loggerheads.</P>
    <P>I believe that, if you could prevail on boards of directors to impose that discipline upon themselves of placing first on their regular agenda the problem of personnel and of having a personnel director who is a member of the board fulfilling the obligation of being able to say to his fellow directors, before he agreed to participate in the general work: &ldquo;There is no personnel problem pending at the present time,&rdquo; a very substantial number of trade disputes would never even reach the stage of acrimonious argument, never mind strike and picket.</P>
    <P>I find myself in some disagreement with Deputy Esmonde when he speaks of the desirability of conferring legal tenure on officers of trade unions.  I hope I do not offend against propriety if I recall to memory someone whom I can only describe in any respect as a great man in his own sphere, which was trade union organisation, the late <Col N="1484" /> James Larkin, at whose obsequies we were present yesterday.  I do not think it is irrelevant to our present problems to tell a story in his regard.  I remember when I was Minister for Agriculture I was persecuted with what was called a house union in the Botanic Gardens. It was there from time immemorial, but I found that if I made an agreement with the house union on Monday two or three fellows would arrive on Wednesday and we would go back through the long delay of further negotiations in the knowledge that any agreement we reached was subject to disruption by the most irresponsible individual in the union.  It was up in that lobby, I think, I met Deputy Larkin and I said: &ldquo;Look, Deputy, would you mind going up and organising the workers in the Botanic Gardens?&rdquo; He looked at me with some surprise and said: &ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;Perfectly serious.  If you go up now right after this Division you will be as welcome as the flowers in May, because I am weary trying to make an agreement with the set-up they have there now and I would like to have an experienced trade union negotiator make a satisfactory agreement with them.&rdquo;  And he did so on behalf of the Workers Union of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I found him an extremely tough negotiator, and here is where I want to differ with Deputy Esmonde: after he would negotiate the outline of the agreement he would say to you perfectly frankly: &ldquo;Now, remember, I am the paid servant of the members of my union and I have got to bring that agreement back to the members of my union.  Unless and until they endorse the terms of that agreement, I cannot sign any agreement with you, because anything I sign I will stand over.&rdquo;  He would go off then and submit the agreement to the members of his union and if the members of his union authorised him to sign the agreement, he would come back and sign it and you could hang your hat on it.</P>
    <P>I remember the first time we signed an agreement together, there was an odd fellow, and within a week of the agreement being signed he announced he was going on strike.  The Workers Union of Ireland said they would not <Col N="1485" /> support him, that he was in breach of his agreement, that the agreement was a valid agreement which the union had made; whereupon he bought a tent and set up the tent outside the Botanic Gardens and announced he was going to fast until death.  When the union heard this they said: &ldquo;Let him fast and when he gets tired of fasting he will fold up his tent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I made some inquiries then and found out the poor fellow had been knocked about by the Black and Tans and knocked about in the Civil War. He had a long history of what we could rightly call delicacy.  In fact, in the Botanic Gardens the devil a much he did except mosey around and potter. Here is the point I want to make: the fatal mistake I could have made in that delicate situation was to go behind Deputy Larkin's back and settle directly with the member who had let him down after he had fully consulted the union members on whose authority he had signed the agreement. That is a mistake that is too often made.</P>
    <P>I told Deputy Larkin the case history of this man and said to him: &ldquo;In the light of that case history, between the two of us we ought to be able to accommodate him.&rdquo;  He was perfectly sympathetic to the man's case.  He said: &ldquo;As far as I am concerned as secretary of the Workers Union of Ireland, I am prepared to stand over the agreement we made.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;Will you ask that fellow to come in and see me?&rdquo; I well remember the poor fellow coming in to me and addressing me at length.  Eventually I said to him: &ldquo;We will find you a job in here as a paper carrier.&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;No.  That would involve me in walking up and down stairs.  I only work on the flat.&rdquo;  I remember saying to him: &ldquo;We will find you a job on one floor carrying papers and you will have to go up only one flight of stairs when you come in or, if you like, you can take the lift.&rdquo;  With perfect reluctance he spent the remainder of his days tripping everybody up on the first floor of the Department of Agriculture, and peace was restored.  The important thing was that it was done with the knowledge of the union; it was done through the union, on the understanding <Col N="1486" /> with the union that it was an act of grace and that so far as they were concerned they stood by their bargain. But, there was a corresponding obligation on me to stand by my bargain; if I had asked the union to organise the workers or if I had accepted the fact that the union had organised the workers, I should not deal with them individually.  My obligation was to deal with them through the organisation that they themselves had chosen to deal with me.</P>
    <P>These are aspects of industrial relations that the employers are only too frequently inclined to overlook.  If you have an effective trade union, if the people who work for you want to be represented in their discussions with you through that trade union, and you find that trade union acting in a responsible and honourable way, then there is a corresponding and very heavy obligation on the employer to deal with that union and not to go behind the union's back.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Noel Lemass is totally wrong when he says the Federated Union of Employers habitually involve the whole country in a strike that ought only to affect one individual. That is nonsense.  I have known several cases in my own experience where officers of the Federated Union of Employers have come down to advise an employer who was negotiating with the trade unions perhaps for the first time and who was quite unfamiliar with the usual give and take of trade union negotiations, in order to avoid the peppery and inexperienced employer getting into handgrips with the trade union organiser because the trade union organiser was using the language of trade union negotiation, to which the peppery employer was wholly unaccustomed. However, he had by him an experienced member of the negotiating side of the Federated Union of Employers who was able to say: &ldquo;Do not get fussed.  This fellow is only blowing off steam to show the delegation he has with him what a tough customer he is.  Let him blow and puff away for a while and he will come down to earth, as they always do.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When negotiations are opened&mdash;I do not think Deputy Kyne will disagree <Col N="1487" /> with me&mdash;and when a trade union organiser comes with a deputation of the workers, he is usually inclined to use tough, rough language and all the boys are edified at the boss being told off. Then it is suggested that they should all have a cup of tea or &ldquo;rud eile&rdquo;, and by the time that has been consumed, everybody gets down to talking in a realistic way.  That brings me back to my original remark.  The firm without competent personnel management and a representative of that personnel management on the board of directors is buying labour trouble for itself.  Those two precautions are not enough unless the secretary of a company insists that the first item on the agenda shall be &ldquo;personnel&rdquo; and that not until that has been satisfactorily disposed of will the board of directors proceed to other business.</P>
    <P>There is no use talking about the urgent necessity of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions taking whatever steps are necessary to remedy the fantastic situation of the multiplicity of unions functioning in this country.  Nobody knows better than the Congress itself the utter confusion that weighs down the British industrial economy at the present time.  In Great Britain you have to go very far back to understand how that whole complex of trade unions grew up.  We have no such long tradition here at all.  What has happened to us is that we have taken over from the British unions and inherited the difficulties of a trade union system the result of an industrial history in which we had no part at all.</P>
    <P>I do not underestimate the problem confronting the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in trying to resolve their difficulties.  These difficulties relate to the principles of small unions in seeking to maintain differentials.  If anybody else gets something, then the differentials must be reviewed and new contracts negotiated.  Let us not underestimate the differences here.  The Minister has offered financial help. One of his many problems here, I should imagine, would be this.  You have a small union with its office and permanent officials.  They have got into the habit of being trade union officials and it is not always easy for them, <Col N="1488" /> after ten, 15 or 20 years as trade union officials to go back to the bench and resume their previous craft.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister should hesitate to say that, where there is an amalgamation of trade union associations, the country at large should allow him pay the officials of the unions who will be affected.  He could then say to the unions concerned: &ldquo;If you cannot fit them into jobs in the larger union, I will pay them and I will do so for the rest of their lives.&rdquo;  This is a diminishing charge and a perfectly legitimate capital cost to be borne by the community in order to carry such an organisation through its amalgamation procedure.</P>
    <P>I remember, when the late Deputy Bill Norton&mdash;the Lord have mercy on him&mdash;was Tánaiste and Minister for Social Welfare, we had two bus drivers who belonged to some obscure British union and who were the cause of a strike here.  The late Deputy Norton, a man of immense ability and great courage but of extraordinary common sense, did something about this.  I remember him saying to the Government at that time: &ldquo;No matter how utterly irresponsible it is, the situation is such that unless you can get those two fellows fixed up we are in for a long, tedious, industrial wrangle out of all proportion to the actual problem. Nobody wants those people; it is one of those sticky things.  It is the only way out of this.  You have to pay those two fellows to stay at home.&rdquo;  I remember him being abused and denounced as being a combination of Stalin and earthworm.  The truth was that the late Bill Norton was faced with this great dispute which had held up the whole country and complicated the economy.  The fact is, where reason is suspended and those two fellows had got to get their pay, if we did not give it to them we would have been in for blue murder.  I think Deputy Kyne remembers that.</P>

      <P>The country was facing immense trouble at that time.  I do not think the problem has occurred since. As far as I know, those two men joined an Irish union and went back to corresponding <Col N="1489" /> employment.  It seemed an awful thing to do but it was typical of the practical wisdom of that most remarkable man, the late Deputy Bill Norton.  I venture to say it is typical of what I imagine could be the approach of that great trade unionist, the late James Larkin.  He had very great commonsense, wisdom and integrity. The death of both those men has left not only the trade union movement, but Ireland, the poorer by their passing.</P>
      <P>I am astonished that in the drafting of this Trade Union Bill the Minister could possibly have left so glaring an ambiguity as that in section 14.  Who are the members of the union who are qualified here?  Supposing there was a dispute in a place which employed four carters who were members of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union and the question was if there was a strike on would it be the whole Irish Transport and General Workers Union who would be canvassed?  Would everyone be involved even though only those four men went out on strike?  Subsection (1), paragraph (a) says:</P>
      <P>the rules of a trade union shall be deemed to require that, before the service of a strike notice, a majority of the members of the trade union entitled to vote and voting in a secret ballot conducted by the trade union shall approve of such service;.</P>

      <P>That did not make them work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think he did make them work because, having hanged some and shot some, the next step was <Col N="1491" /> to send people to a labour camp for re-education.  We live in a free society and I wish to make it quite clear that I regard the free trade union movement as being an integral part of the kind of freedom under which I wish to live and I want to protect the right of a trade union to picket the premises where its members work and where there is a legitimate trade dispute.</P>
      <P>It is an illusion for people to be flirting with the idea that a picket is an archaic, Victorian anomaly in our day.  A peaceful picket is a perfectly legitimate instrument of industrial dispute and anybody who imagines that that instrument can be struck from the hand of trade unions by legislation of this House is chasing rainbows.</P>
      <P>What we ought to concern ourselves with is to work out with the Congress of Trade Unions how we are to prevent the promiscuous picketing of industrial premises without reference to the trade union in wildcat strikes.  I have great sympathy with the feeling of the ordinary worker in this country who says &ldquo;I will not pass a picket,&rdquo; full stop.  I was reared in the Land League tradition and the Land League tradition was &ldquo;I will not speak to a man who has grabbed land,&rdquo; full stop.  That could be on occasion carried to extremity. I knew of the case of a man who was boycotted and I remember my father often telling me of how it was the wrong man who was boycotted. But there were certain irresponsible elements in the Land League at that time who said &ldquo;Whether it is the right or the wrong man, it will have to go on&rdquo; and my father had to go down himself and break them up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sooner or later we will have to face the unpopular measures needed to distinguish clearly between the wildcat strike with the unauthorised picket and the official strike with a controlled picket.  Some people say to me that if we try to do that we will make every unofficial strike an official one.  I am not so sure that that would not be a good thing.  I do not think the trade unions would like it; they would say that we were passing over to them responsibility for every lunatic in the country.  However, I would feel like <Col N="1492" /> saying to the trade unions that it is their baby.  If an agreement is reached between the employer and the trade union and if, say, six lunatics continue to parade up and down outside the premises concerned, it is only right that the employer should say to the trade union &ldquo;I am asking not only that you get men to pass the picket but that you get six men to do their jobs&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If a union has negotiated tough and rough and strong for its members and if it has gone back to its members and said &ldquo;We recommend this agreement to you&rdquo;, and if they go back to the employer again and say it is not acceptable and the union officials go back to the members with a new proposal and the members say they will accept that and the officials then ask if they may go back and sign that in the names of the members and they say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and they go back and sign it in their names, not only have the trade unions got an obligation to honour their undertakings but if, say, six or more members, despite the agreement, continue to strike, the unions, as I have said, are bound not only to ask their men to pass the picket but to get six fellows to fill the jobs of those six who are walking up and down outside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kyne is correct but the number of people who do not know that is surprising.  I believe that trade unions should go to wildcat strikers and say to them that the fact that they walked out does not mean the union is behind them and that if they have a grievance they should bring it to the trade union and have it investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I say something that will put the trade unionists into orbit.  Deputy Tully always goes into orbit when I mention this.  One of the reasons for the industrial trouble in this country <Col N="1493" /> is that the trade unionists will not pay their own officials a decent wage.  I have had cases in my own constituency in which the man sent down to negotiate the settlement of a perfectly simple trade dispute was not fit for his job and if an experienced trade union man had been sent down he would have rounded up his members in the district and told them to go back to their jobs while he would see the employer and discuss the matter and there would have been no need at all for a strike.  I have seen fellows parading up and down for a fortnight or three weeks and on one occasion I rang up the union and was told that the responsible organiser had gone on his holidays and I was expected to sit down and wait for this fellow to come back from his holidays.  I can see Deputy Tully's colour rising at that, but, while it is by no means the general rule, it does happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all sure that it is not a good thing for a wildcat strike to be turned into an official <Col N="1494" /> strike.  The unions should discharge their responsibility in regard to it and not simply wash their hands of it by saying that they made an agreement and that there is nothing they can do about it.</P>
      <P>I heard American industrialists in the recent past talking about investing money in this country and going into orbit at the idea of secondary strikes. I asked what they meant by secondary strikes.  They said what they meant was, where one firm gets involved in a strike, the carrying on of picketing of another firm which is not involved in the strike at all.  To this moment I am not quite clear what they meant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>You can get that on a lock-out.  It is quite common where one newspaper goes on strike for the others to lock everybody out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of the secondary strike seemed to impinge on their minds to a most extravagant degree.  I remember listening with indignation when they told me we should emulate the example of the Danes and the Swiss.  I felt constrained to say to them: &ldquo;The first thing you have to learn is that you are living in a foreign country, although we speak the same language as you do.  We are not Danes nor Swiss and have no desire to be either.&rdquo;  I told them that if they recognised that they were living in a foreign country they would find the trade union movement of this country is a very rational body indeed.  I think a fellow born in either South Carolina or Alaska, although he speaks English, does not speak the kind of English we speak in this country.  They should come over here and ask either the Irish Congress of Trade Unions or the Minister for Labour to get a good personnel officer.  If they did that they would clarify 90 per cent of the nightmares that seem to haunt their minds; but if they bring an efficiency expert from Pennsylvania and plant him in Kilmacow to establish labour relations with the local branch secretary of the General Workers' Union, there will be seismic reactions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last thing I want to say tonight is this: we are passing legislation here to try to promote industrial peace.  I <Col N="1495" /> want to ask any rational Deputy in this House when a trade union negotiate a wages settlement with any firm in this country and when we are making up our minds in Dáil Éireann that four per cent of the wages agreed with the trade unions will be taken from the members every year by inflation, how in the name of Providence are we to get enduring industrial peace?</P>
    <P>There is an objective method of measuring this.  Two countries in the free world performed in the last 20 years virtual economic miracles.  One is the Federal Union of Germany and the other is the Union of the United States. If you examine the record of the two countries you will find astonishing facts.  During a period of phenomenal expansion in their gross national product or national income the stability of prices, up to three years ago, was practically absolute.  As the curve on the graph of the gross national product rises the cost of living remains virtually in a straight line up to 1965 or so.  As that gap between the rising curve of the gross national product and the flat line of the cost of living grew, so there grew the layer of cream on the top of the milk available for redistribution in social services among all sections of the community, and increased wages and a higher standard of living.  Then America got involved in the Vietnam war and tried to carry on the war with her left hand and, with her right hand, the increasingly heavy burden of the domestic social services requisite to resolve her peculiar urban problem.  The gap began to close.  The cost of living began to go up and immediately the USA found themselves in economic difficulties.  The dollar became shaky and now all sorts of restrictive measures are becoming necessary.</P>
    <P>About Germany now: the whole world is drawing exports from Germany into their economies and the whole world is finding it more and more difficult to compete on the domestic German market.  Because the German people had the constant absence of inflation, they had been able, with perfect regularity, to negotiate rational wage agreements and maintain and steadily improve their <Col N="1496" /> family standard of living, whereas people, notoriously in Great Britain, have been caught in this infernal spiral of inflation.</P>
    <P>I can pinpoint the day when it began here.  It began with the turnover tax, with Deputy Seán Lemass's fraudulent purchase of two by-elections in Kildare and Cork.  Having lost an election in Dublin, he deliberately, for political motives, launched the inflationary spiral for the purpose of purchasing election victories in Cork and Kildare.  From that date we have never looked back. We have gone from one escalation to another in the inflationary spiral which will ultimately strangle us if it is allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>In Great Britain it is not so easy to pinpoint where the spiral of inflation began but now, in retrospect, there can be little doubt that the point of no return for them was reached when the Labour Government failed to devalue after their election.  They postponed devaluation until three years later, when they were forced to do it, instead of taking that action as a foresight, to remedy the problems they inherited from the Tory Government.</P>
    <P>I wish to warn the House that all this legislation, all these good intentions, will get us nowhere at all so long as the stability of money is not restored.  How many people in this House realise that since 1948 the value of the pound in this country has declined by 10/-?  When we pay a farmer today 2/- or 2/4d for a gallon of milk we are, in fact, paying the equivalent of 1/- or 1/2d 20 years ago; when we pay a pensioner 65/- a week we are giving him the equivalent of 32/6d 20 years ago; when a workman is paid £20 a week he is getting the equivalent of £10 a week 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>But that is not the end of it.  Now we are faced with the declaration by the Government that they intend so to operate the economy that there will be an annual inflation of four per cent. Do they realise what that means?  It means simply that in another 20 years the pound of today will be worth about 10/- or less.  What is even more tragic &mdash;and it is a constant source of conscience-pricking to me&mdash;is that we launched national loans when we were <Col N="1497" /> in office at interest rates of 3½ per cent per annum and we always stood up here and recommended them as good securities for the people to put their savings in.  In fact, the people who subscribed to them have been living on their savings ever since because instead of giving them 3½ per cent per annum we have been taking 10/- per cent from them during the entire period of the loans.  That is common theft, and what maddens me is that nobody who knows how to manage money, no wealthy person, has suffered the loss of a penny, because anybody who possesses sufficient funds has placed his money in equities or in the ordinary shares of large companies which have increased in value with the depreciation in money values.</P>
    <P>The only man who is suffering is the wage earner, the person with an industrial insurance policy, the person who has put his money into national savings, into trustee savings banks or into the ordinary commercial banks. I know no well-to-do person who has engaged in any such operation.  He realises the formidable problem of inflation, because the truth is that while inflation is going on other things are happening.</P>
    <P>When you open the <i>Irish Independent</i> or the <i>Irish Times</i> and you read that holdings in the London Stock Exchange have gone up 1/- or 1/6d, it gives you a warm, comfortable feeling, whereas if you read that there has been a slide in the London Stock Exchange by half a crown, you are in a depressed state for the rest of the day.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that a trade union official who negotiates for an increase is regarded as better than the man who succeeds in holding the line in stable currency.  The average fellow is happy when he has plenty of airgead, money, to rattle in his pocket.  He is relatively indifferent to the fact that the half crown today would not buy 2/6d worth 20 years ago.  What he likes is the money.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the Government to save society from the kinds of problems which they have, and these Bills <Col N="1498" /> are in part directed at restoring the value of money.  However, until you do something better, the effect of this will merely be a palliative.  The more simple things are and the more universally agreed they are, in one sense the more dangerous they are because the Government will continue to slide on the thin ice of inflation until eventually they plunge us into the world of inflation, and, then, the greater the danger for a country like this becomes. England is unlikely to perish, the US and Russia will survive, but a small country struggling to stay free, and democratic, is threatened with no greater peril than uncontrolled inflation.</P>

      <P>One appreciates that the Minister had to introduce these Bills but at the same time one must appreciate that the trade union movement generally is in need of aid, as was expressed by the President of the Trade Union Congress.  The need for the Minister to introduce these Bills makes me a little sad because those of us who believe in democracy and in free enterprise agree that there should be as little as possible State interference in the lives of the people.  Taking notice of what is happening and trying to help out as best he can, the Minister has introduced this legislation.  Few of us here believe that legislation is an end in itself: it can only help people to do things; it can create conditions where people can work better for the common good.</P>

      <P>Approval has not been given to schemes of letting priorities submitted to me by the County Councils of Dublin, Galway and Wicklow, Galway Corporation and the Urban District Councils of Bray, Buncrana and Letterkenny.  In each of these cases correspondence regarding the schemes submitted has been taking place between my Department and the local housing authority.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if section 40 (1) (a) of the Housing Act, 1966 enables a housing authority to make a loan, and in particular an unsecured loan, to finance part of approved works to qualify for an essential repairs grant before approved works are carried out, where they are satisfied that if the proposed works are carried out the house will be fit for human habitation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">

      <P>Applications for sanction to loans for the carrying out of schemes which have subsequently been abandoned or rejected, are in abeyance or have not progressed beyond preliminary planning stage, could technically be regarded as &ldquo;awaiting sanction&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The compilation of a full list of all loan applications not sanctioned would, therefore, give a misleading picture apart from the fact that the compilation would involve investigation of the records of nearly 90 local authorities. It is proposed to compile and send to the Deputy a list of all such applications received since 1st January, 1968, which are awaiting sanction.</P>
