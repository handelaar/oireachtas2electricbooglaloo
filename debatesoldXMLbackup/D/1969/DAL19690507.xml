      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the countries behind the Iron Curtain with which Ireland has an unfavourable trade balance; the amount of such trade deficits; and what action the Government intends to take to right the imbalance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the calendar year 1968, Ireland had an import excess in trade with the following East European countries: Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Rumania and the USSR.  There was an export excess with Yugoslavia.  With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement setting out the balances concerned.</P>
      <P>In the case of countries with which we have an adverse trade balance, the general aim is to seek to improve the position by encouraging the expansion of exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government Departments concerned are keeping under continuous <Col N="596" /> review the question of what special action might be taken to secure an increase in exports to East European countries, particularly to those countries with whom our trade is in greatest imbalance.  We have recently furnished to the Soviet authorities a list of Irish export products for their consideration. It is hoped that, on the basis of this list, it will be possible to enter into negotiations for the development of trade between the two countries.  So far as trade with the other East European countries is concerned, certain further steps that might be taken, including the possibility of concluding trade agreements, are being examined at present.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the wide range of grants, incentives and services which the Government have made available to exporters, through Córas Tráchtála, has recently been expanded by the introduction of a programme of new incentives and services aimed at stimulating and assisting a more rapid development of exports to markets other than Britain.  I might add that, under this programme, Córas Tráchtála has appointed a marketing adviser with special responsibility for developing exports to Eastern Europe.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that our effort to increase exports to and reduce imports from those countries has been a dismal failure?  Would he not think the time has come to inform those countries we are prepared to deal with them only on a barter system?</P>

Does he not think it is time we did more about our Buy Irish Campaign?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made a similar allegation here last week in respect of France and, although I pointed out that the great bulk of the imports from France were of a kind that is not normally produced here, he repeats the allegation without specifying what he has in mind.  Normally speaking, the bulk of our imports from these countries consists of goods we do not produce ourselves or do not produce in sufficient quantity or quality for the purpose for which they are required here.  Our exporters and manufacturers are entitled to have access to the cheapest raw materials they can get in order to compete successfully with exporters from countries who have access to these raw materials. There are many considerations involved. I can assure the Deputy this matter is being kept under close review and steps are being taken to correct the imbalance.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the ESB that the townlands in question are in <Col N="600" /> the board's Dunderry rural area which has already been recanvassed under the rural electrification post development scheme.  However, as the canvass was carried out before the revised special service charges were introduced last year it is necessary to quote revised terms.</P>
      <P>The board hope to have this done shortly and to commence construction work in the Dunderry rural area, and the adjoining Liscarton rural area, in about two months time and supply will then be extended to all householders who accept the terms quoted and have their houses wired.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that it is their policy to deploy the resources available for connecting new rural consumers on the basis of an orderly programme, planned and executed on a rational basis.  Only in this way can the overall cost, and the cost of individual connections, be kept within reasonable limits, though it necessarily involves a wait for many applicants, including farmers, until their areas are reached under the programme.  It is clearly impossible for the board to connect immediately all who are seeking supply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 21 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927, requires the ESB to so fix their charges that they are able to meet their outgoings.  The board are prohibited under section 93 of the same Act from granting preferential treatment.  The board, therefore, <Col N="601" /> in fixing charges must have regard to the cost of making supply available. The fixing of charges is, under the Act, the sole responsibility of the board.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the board that in cases where capital costs of connection for an industry are high the board must have some guarantee that a correspondingly high rate of user will be assured over a period of years sufficient to enable them to break even on their investment.  In certain cases, therefore, they require a capital contribution, which is normally refundable after a period provided that the anticipated consumption is achieved.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Harte</b> asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (a) the date upon which the National Agricultural Council was set up, (b) its present members, (c) the number of meetings held, (d) when it is proposed to hold the next meeting and (e) the functions of the Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Agricultural Council was established for the purpose of providing a forum for discussions between representatives of the farming community and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries on agricultural policy matters, including the carrying out of an annual review of the position, progress and prospects of agriculture.  The council held its inaugural meeting on the 4th and 5th April, 1967.  Members were appointed for a period of two years and their term of office has accordingly expired. The council met on 21 occasions and its work has proved most valuable for the farming community.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, one farmers' organisation refused to join the council and the Government have indicated their willingness to explore with the principal farming bodies the kind of consultative machinery which would be acceptable to all.  I am informed that discussions on this question are taking place between a number of the organisations concerned and, pending the outcome of these initiatives, I have not taken any steps to reconstitute the council.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister instance one good thing that this organisation did?  A year and a half ago, the Minister told this House that this organisation would succeed, despite Fine Gael and the NFA.  Will the Minister not agree that he would not now co-operate with the farmers' major organisation in this country if we were not facing a general election? Would the Minister not have them sitting outside in Merrion Street for 21 days, as was the position before?  The Minister is co-operating now only because there is a general election in the offing.</P>

The fruits of their work are to be seen there physically during the years 1968 and 1967 which, successively, have been the two best years, put together, we have ever had in the history of agriculture in this country.</P>

It is possible that all weather playing pitches might qualify for assistance under the amenity grants scheme administered by my Department provided the pitches are part of a general scheme of amenity development and the general conditions of the scheme are complied with.  It must, however, be appreciated that the funds available to service the scheme are limited and that any application received would have to be considered on its merits having regard to the financial position at the particular time and the competing demands of other schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Figures as to the total number of fatal accidents involving the use of farm tractors are not available. A special check made by the Garda Síochána shows that nine persons were killed in the year ended 31st December, 1968, and two persons were killed in the first two months of 1969 as a result of agricultural tractors overturning.  As to the second part of the Deputy's question, I do not accept that there has been any undue delay in introducing the necessary regulations to make the fitting of safety frames compulsory. On the 25th January last public notice was given of my intention to make such regulations and an invitation was given to interested parties to submit comments on the proposals to my Department not later than 28th February.  These comments have now been considered and drafting of the regulations is in progress and, as I indicated when replying to a similar question by Deputy Tully on 22nd April last, these regulations should be made in about six weeks from that date.  Let Deputies take note that Deputy Tully's name was mentioned.</P>

      <P>As regards the provision of traffic light signals at the two crossroads, the background to this was given by me in reply to a question in the House on 5th December last.  A proposal to accept a tender for the supply and installation of the light signals was submitted to my Department by Galway County Council in February last.  It was necessary to clarify certain aspects of this proposal with the county council and I expect now that a decision will issue very shortly.  Subject to approval to the accepted tender, it would be a matter for the county council to proceed with the provision of the signals.</P>
      <P>Regarding accidents at the two intersections, I am informed that in the six years ended 31st December, 1968, the number of accidents reported to the Gardaí were 29 accidents at Moneenageisha Cross, one of which was fatal, and 41 accidents at New Cemetery Cross, none of which was fatal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the general terms in which the question is framed it would not be feasible to furnish the detailed information requested in a reasonably concise form.  The following is a broad outline of the position.</P>
      <P>Home manufactured drugs, medicines and medical requisites are not liable to excise duties apart from the excise duty which would be chargeable on any spirits they might contain.</P>
      <P>Imported drugs and medicines are classified at Chapters 28, 29 and 30 of the Customs and Excise Tariff.  The range of articles which would be covered by the general description medical requisites is so wide that it would be impracticable to indicate all the possible tariff classifications.  As regards customs duties, therefore, the only useful comment I can make is to say that most of the duties involved would be protective in character and that there would be provision for the issue of duty-free licences.</P>
      <P>Turnover tax at 2½ per cent is payable on retail sales of drugs, medicines and medical requisites for human application, whether imported or home manufactured, but these items are not liable to wholesae tax.</P>

There was no projection for the total number of new jobs.

If the Taoiseach wants to deny the speech he made in Drogheda in 1965, he can. He promised 80,000 new jobs.  The Second Programme has been a failure. There are now 70,000 fewer people at work instead of 80,000 new jobs.  The Taoiseach is silent on the question of the number of people at work.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is well aware that this committee was set up last week but the request submitted to the Office of Public Works and to other Government Departments was made quite some time ago.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary say why it is that State Departments, in common with other employers of low-paid labour, made no attempt to bring up the wages with effect from 1st April, or is it because, as Deputy Henry Kenny's question asks, they have not yet paid out arrears due for increases given in April, 1968?  Is that the reason why they have not given the increase?</P>

      <i>Review of</i> 1968</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the detailed analysis of the economic situation given by the Taoiseach last November and the number of documents currently available reviewing the economy, I do not propose to give more than a broad outline of economic trends in 1968.  Detailed information is contained in my Department's &ldquo;Review of 1968 and Outlook for 1969&rdquo;, the comments of the National Industrial Economic Council on that review and the annual survey of the Irish economy published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.</P>
      <P>1968 was the best year in our economic history.  The main objective of economic policy during the year was to keep the economy on the path of steady and substantial growth without imposing an undue strain on the balance of payments.  We achieved a growth rate of 5½ per cent.  The balance of payments outturn was not unsatisfactory. The actual deficit, £20 million, was not much above the £15 million projected at this time last year, though it represented a swing of £35 million from the surplus of £15 million in 1967.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industrial production increased at the remarkable rate of 11 per cent and reached a record level in 1968.  While an expansion of domestic demand <Col N="634" /> contributed to the rise, exports were the main source of growth.  The stability of unit wage costs resulting from a productivity rise which virtually offset a sharp increase in wages contributed to a 30 per cent expansion of industrial exports.  This gain in productivity was based largely on the taking-up of slack capacity in industry and may not be experienced in the same measure in 1969.</P>
    <P>In building and construction, there was a marked rise in the volume of output in 1968.  Agriculture too had a good year.  Thanks to substantial increases in crop output and to a rise in livestock numbers, a growth rate of up to 6 per cent seems likely on the basis of provisional figures.</P>
    <P>Employment outside agriculture increased and is likely to have more than offset the continuing decline in numbers engaged in agriculture.  In the last quarter of the year, employment in manufacturing industry was 6,400 higher than a year earlier.  At the end of the year, unemployment was below the level at the end of 1967, while emigration was approximately the same.</P>
    <P>Both industrial and agricultural exports showed satisfactory increases, although agricultural exports lagged behind the others mainly because supply difficulties limited the volume of cattle and beef exports.  In the balance of payments, net earnings from invisible transactions were boosted by high receipts from an excellent tourist season.</P>
    <P>As I envisaged last year, imports grew rapidly throughout 1968 from the abnormally low base in 1967.  This was associated with a quickening rate of growth of consumer expenditure which rose by five per cent over the year as compared with 1½ per cent in 1967. The main factor in stimulating this rise was the substantial increase in incomes, accompanied in many cases by the promise of more in 1969.</P>
    <P>Despite the generally favourable trend of production, employment and exports in 1968, the threat posed by the rapid rise in incomes, consumer expenditure and imports necessitated the corrective measures introduced in November.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="635" />
      <i>International monetary situation</i>
    </P>
    <P>During the past year, we pursued a policy of diversifying our currency reserves and acquired a creditor position in the International Monetary Fund. We agreed to release part of the Irish currency element of our subscription to the Fund for use in convertible form by countries in need of foreign currency. As a consequence, we have become creditors in the Fund to the extent of £13¾ million.</P>
    <P>Under the Basle arrangement for the support of sterling, we in common with other members of the sterling area, received from Britain a guarantee of the maintenance of the dollar value of the greater part of our sterling reserves. On our side, we have agreed to maintain a minimum of 65 per cent of our official reserves in sterling.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the international payments system has been showing increasing signs of inadequacy, and the past year witnessed further strains upon it and upon the principal international currencies.  It is a tribute to the system's resilience and to the ingenuity of the many <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements made to support it that it continues to function reasonably well.  However, one must note that surplus countries have been hesitant to aid international liquidity by substantially reducing their surpluses, while countries with balance of payments difficulties, such as the United States, Britain and France, have adopted increasingly defensive policies.</P>
    <P>Although few are satisfied with the present system, a consensus is lacking on what should be done to improve it. There is fairly general acceptance of the new special drawing rights scheme of the International Monetary Fund. For our part we have accepted it and passed the necessary legislation to enable us to participate in it.  I hope that our fellow-members of the Fund will agree to its early establishment and implementation.</P>
    <P>Even if there were general agreement on further improvements, it would take time to bring them into effect.  We must, therefore, base our short-term policy on the assumption that the external environment will be one of continuing uncertainty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="636" />
      <i>Foreign trade</i>
    </P>
    <P>The most important element of our foreign trade is our trade with Britain. The Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement is working well and has substantially justified the hopes we held when entering into it.  Between 1965 and 1968 the annual value of the total trade between the two countries has risen by 38 per cent.  During the same period our exports to Britain increased by 46 per cent&mdash;from £160 million to £234 million.  A striking feature of these trends is the remarkable growth in our exports of manufactured goods to Britain which rose by 78 per cent.</P>
    <P>During the second half of 1968 there were some developments which affected the smooth working of the Free Trade Area Agreement.  I refer, in particular, to the British import deposit scheme and to British proposals for restricting supplies of cheese to the United Kingdom market.  These matters were of sufficient importance to warrant a series of ministerial discussions which took place from November to March</P>
    <P>The Government, in co-operation with the Irish banks, devised a scheme which ensures that, so far as our exporters are concerned, there will be no difficulty about financing the deposits on Irish goods entering the UK.  While this scheme has gone a long way towards enabling Irish exporters to maintain the rising trend of our exports to the UK, we cannot insulate our exports against British measures for the curtailment of internal demand which affect British as well as imported goods.</P>
    <P>In making the arrangements for exports of cheese to the UK market for the two-year period ending March, 1970, we emphasised that we do not regard voluntary restriction arrangements as a normal feature of the Free Trade Area Agreement, and we reserved all our rights in regard to the future.  This position was accepted by British Ministers.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Agreement can bring considerable benefits to both economies and that there should be continuing close contacts at ministerial level to ensure that any difficulties arising are resolved promptly and that the agreement realises its full potential.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" /> While Britain is and will for a long time remain the principal outlet for our products, it is important that progress should be made towards greater diversification of export markets.  Our experience in the British market in recent months emphasises the need to hasten this process.</P>
    <P>In the long term the best prospect for diversification of markets lies in membership of the EEC.  Recent political events have led to speculation on the possibility of the opening of negotiations with the applicants for membership, including Ireland.  The Government are following developments closely but, while it may be permissible to hope for a more fluid situation favouring progress towards the enlargement of the Community, it is, as yet, too early to form an opinion about the likely course of events.  I would like to emphasise, however, that, despite present uncertainties, it will be in the long-term interests of our exporters to have secured a foothold in the EEC market when membership becomes a reality.  This applies particularly to industrial products since, until membership is achieved, the prospects for industrial exports to that area are much better than for agricultural exports.</P>
    <P>To find new markets is a top priority.  Córas Tráchtála is charged with the task and has been provided with substantial additional resources to enable it to do so.  Another field to which increasing attention will be given is the development of new products for export and finding ways of harnessing the talents of our young scientists and technologists to this end.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Outlook for 1969</i>
    </P>
    <P>The autumn budget was designed to moderate the rate of increase of domestic demand in 1969 and make it possible to maintain economic growth at a satisfactory rate without allowing the balance of payments to get out of hand.  This strategy was founded on a careful assessment, based on such information as was then available, of economic prospects in 1969 and, in particular, on the likely trend of demand pressures.</P>
    <P>During the early months of this year <Col N="638" /> certain adverse trends persisted.  Demand pressures remained high despite the appeal which the Government made in January for restraint in requests for pay increases.  The settlement of the maintenance craftsmen's dispute at a level far beyond any likely increase in production would have had the gravest consequences for the economy if, as seemed possible at one stage, it set a headline for general pay revisions.  The Government were, understandably, concerned since such a development would have made it impossible to sustain the rate of growth which the economic indicators showed to be within our capacity this year. Thanks to the responsible reaction of the trade unions and other groups, that danger seems to have receded and the economy's prospects for 1969 can now be viewed with less apprehension on that score.</P>
    <P>The indications are that the growth rate will be about 4½ per cent.  This means that 1969 will be our third successive year of satisfactory growth. There are, however, some warning signals. Export expansion is likely to be slower than last year because of less favourable conditions in our main export markets, and the recent interruption of industrial production has probably lost us a number of export opportunities.  At the same time, the pressures carried over from last year are likely to cause a large rise in imports of consumer goods and raw materials for further processing.  Capital imports will be swollen by exceptionally heavy purchases of aircraft.  Allowing for a rise in net invisible earnings, the likelihood is that the balance of payments deficit will be about £55 million. Even if aircraft imports are excluded on the basis that they will be financed in the first instance by foreign borrowing, the deficit is likely to be £40 to £45 million.  This is still large but must be viewed against our strong reserves position, the voluntary capital inflow and the prospects of substantial increases in output, savings and investment.</P>
    <P>Investment, both private and public, is likely to be vigorous in 1969.  The ratio of total fixed investment to gross national product should not be far short of 22 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="639" />
      <i>Incomes</i>
    </P>
    <P>The background to this year's Budget is dominated by the incomes situation.  Developments on this front in recent months have been responsible for the basic approach to the strategy of the Budget.  With a view to working out an acceptable, realistic policy for incomes this year in which budgetary measures would play a vital role, the Government initiated a programme of wide-ranging discussions with all the parties involved.</P>
    <P>The prospect of a growth rate of over four per cent in 1969 means that we can reasonably allow the general level of money incomes to rise by that amount in sharing the fruits of our advance.  Coming on the heels of the exceptional rise of 1968, this would represent a substantial average improvement over the two years.  However, the particular settlement I have already mentioned, representing more than four times the expected growth in national production, set a dangerous pattern early on.  The Government have been active in alerting public opinion to the dangers involved in sharply rising prices which affect particularly the lower-paid and weaker sections of the community and threaten employment.</P>
    <P>The rapid recognition of these dangers by employers and employees alike was encouraging and there is every reason to hope for a united effort to avoid them.  This would remove the most dangerous threat to our chances of a further year of substantial improvement in 1969 and would be of enormous benefit, not only in its material aspects, but also in the confidence it would create in our combined will and ability to overcome similar dangers in the future.</P>
    <P>There is widespread agreement that any general restraint should not extend to lower-paid workers and that a special effort should be made to improve their position and that of the poorer and weaker sections generally. Any attempt to do this would, of course, be impeded and, indeed, negatived if other groups were to insist on maintaining differentials and relativities.</P>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, <Col N="640" /> which held a special consultative conference to discuss the situation, has pointed out that the majority of wage agreements do not terminate before the end of 1969.  It has called for urgent action to improve the position of the low paid by substantial increases in family allowances and for effective action by the Government to restrain non-wage inflation by price control and other appropriate means.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to infer from this and other trade union statements of a similar nature that, if the Government take action along those lines, the trade union movement will not seek to alter existing agreements which run to the end of this year and will pursue a policy of moderation in negotiations where agreements have already expired or will expire during the year.  The Government welcome this response which accords fully with our social and economic policy regarding the rights of the less well-off sections to a growing share of increasing national prosperity. The Government are prepared to play their part in facilitating the development of incomes along these lines in 1969.  We have decided, therefore, to make substantial improvements in the main benefits payable under the Social Welfare code, which I will shortly announce.  I propose also to apply to public sector pay the general policy already outlined and to take related action to which I shall come at a later part of my statement.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Rise in Government expenditure</i>
    </P>
    <P>While the budgetary proposals I will announce are of more than usual importance this year in relation to incomes, the major part of budgetary policy is contained in the expenditure proposals published some weeks ago. Accordingly, before coming to to-day's budgetary measures, I intend to deal with the current expenditure set out in the book of estimates and to comment on the growth of that expenditure</P>
    <P>A year ago, I drew attention to the huge rise in social expenditure generally and in aid to agriculture.  I pointed out that current Government outlay on social welfare, education and health had more than doubled in the decade to 1968.  Outlay on the economic <Col N="641" /> services and on the improvement of the growth infrastructure has also been buoyant.  This rise in expenditure came in response to the need to strengthen the social and economic framework of the national economy.</P>
    <P>The Government's continuing desire to increase social expenditure and to help agriculture is again evident in this year's volume of estimates.  The total of non-capital outlay is £298½ million. This is £41½ million, or 16 per cent, up on the figures in last year's volume. Over £31 million, or more than 75 per cent, of this rise is devoted to the social services and to agriculture.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Agriculture</i>
    </P>
    <P>Total Government expenditure in relation to agriculture is estimated at about £81 million for 1969-70, compared with £78 million in 1968-69, and £38.5 million in 1963-64.  Two items account for well over half of the £81 million.  In 1969-70, support of creamery milk prices will account for £27 million, which is £6 million above the original estimate for 1968-69, and relief of rates on agricultural land will cost over £19 million&mdash;an increase of more that £2 million on the previous year.</P>
    <P>The cost of supporting creamery milk has risen from the comparatively modest sum of £6 million in 1963-64, to an estimated £27 million in the present year.  The dairy industry is, of course, a key one and is closely linked with the cattle industry, which gives us our largest single export.  At the same time, the Government are, naturally, concerned at the steeply rising cost of supporting creamery milk, especially at a time when the return from marginal markets represents no more than about 2d per gallon at the creamery exclusive of the value of skim.  The reasons for the high bill are the low prices on export markets, due to over-production all over the world, and the increase in production here. The more money is required for support of creamery milk, the more difficult it is to find the additional funds needed for other sectors of agriculture. For all these reasons, the Government decided that the last increase in creamery milk prices should be on a <Col N="642" /> selective basis and intended to benefit mainly the small and medium-sized producers.</P>
    <P>In view of the depression in export markets for milk products, it is, obviously, a sensible course to give increased incentives for beef cattle production, and this has been done under the recently-introduced Beef Cattle Incentive Scheme.  The response to this Scheme has been encouraging.  It will cost about £1 million this year, but expenditure is likely to increase considerably in later years.</P>
    <P>Because of increased State support for the relief of rates on agricultural land, net rates on such land are at approximately the same level as eight years ago.  With the complete exemption of small farms with a land valuation not exceeding £20, only one farmer in three now pays rates on land.</P>
    <P>The cost of supporting agriculture now represents a very significant proportion of the Budget and Government expenditure accounts for a large part of the increase in farm income in recent years.  It is the Government's policy to preserve a reasonable relationship between farm and other incomes.  The Government, therefore, will, throughout the year, watch carefully the development of farm incomes in relation to the movement of incomes in other sectors.</P>
    <P>As stated in the Third Programme, studies are in progress to establish whether the best results are being secured from the heavy State expenditure related to agriculture.  When these studies are completed, they will be published as a basis for public discussion. In reaching decisions on these studies, the Government's aim will be to ensure that the agricultural community gets maximum benefit and that national resources are allocated to the best national advantage.</P>
    <P>Agriculture again made very good progress in 1968.  The value and volume of output broke all previous records. As I stated earlier, provisional figures indicate a growth rate of 6 per cent. Agricultural exports totalled £155 million. It is provisionally estimated that farm income went up by about 16 per cent, as compared with 10 per cent in <Col N="643" /> 1967, and that those engaged in agriculture not only held their position relative to the rest of the community in 1968, but improved it somewhat.  This is, indeed, a welcome development.</P>
    <P>As regards 1969, it is, of course, too early to attempt an income forecast, but there seems no reason not to expect another good year, assuming favourable weather for the rest of the year and no disruption of prices on export markets.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Education</i>
    </P>
    <P>The non-capital estimates for education amount to £51¾ million.  The corresponding figure for 1959-60 was £15¾ million.  This vast increase is compelling evidence of the Government's commitment to improve the prospects of our young people.</P>
    <P>Within the past three years, there has been an increase of almost 25 per cent in the enrolments in second level schools and of 2,500 in the number of university students.  As a consequence, the school building programme has been stepped up and there has been a considerable expansion in the recruitment of teachers.  In the present financial year five of the Regional Technical Colleges will be opened, additional comprehensive schools will be built and new services, such as a nation-wide scheme of career-guidance masters in post-primary schools, will be introduced.</P>
    <P>The growth in numbers in whole-time education will continue.  The number of students is expected to increase from 695,000 in 1968 to 760,000 in 1972.  Most of this increase will be in the number of post-primary pupils. Thus, over the next few years, we will have to meet a continuing growth in expenditure on education.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Welfare</i>
    </P>
    <P>In the past five years expenditure on social welfare has risen from £52½ million to £81 million.  This year, it is estimated that £85 million will be spent on existing services before today's increases are taken into account.</P>
    <P>A special feature of the growth in social welfare expenditure has been the shift in emphasis from non-contributory <Col N="644" /> to insurance, or contributory, arrangements.  The increases of recent years have been far in excess of the rise in the consumer price index and have substantially raised the real value of the benefits.</P>
    <P>Legislation has been introduced to provide for three eminently desirable innovations.  These are: a limited scheme of retirement pensions for insured workers at age 65; invalidity pensions for insured workers whose illness or incapacity is either permanent or likely to be of long duration; and payment of a death grant in respect of a qualified insured worker, or of his close dependants.  A scheme of pay-related unemployment and disability benefit is under consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Health</i>
    </P>
    <P>Current government expenditure on health services has been rising steeply. The total amounted to £9½ million in 1961-62; it had risen to £14¼ million in 1964-65 and this year it will cost about £30½ million.</P>
    <P>The Government's general proposals are set out in the White Paper on the Health Services and their Further Development. Discussions on the implementation of new services are in progress with the relevant professional organisations, and legislation has been introduced in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes a new structure of administration for the health services. It provides for the replacement of the dispensary system by a service offering choice of doctor in the general medical service for the lower income group in so far as this is practicable.  It also proposes that drugs and medicines will, as far as practicable, be issued through retail pharmaceutical chemists to the eligible groups.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Financing of local authorities</i>
    </P>
    <P>Local authority finances and rates relief are current and controversial topics.  Undoubtedly, a problem exists but the debate of recent months has tended to ignore the fact that, over the years, more and more of the burden of local expenditure has been borne by the Exchequer and less and less by the rates.  This is clearly evident if a comparison is made with the pre-war <Col N="645" /> position.  Coming to more recent times, local authority current expenditure rose from £90½ million in 1965-66 to an estimated £123 million in 1968-69.  £18 million, or more than one half of this increase, was financed by way of Government grant while the rates have had to bear an additional burden of only £8 million or about one-fourth of the total increase.</P>
    <P>These figures effectively rebut allegations that the Government have been complacent in their approach to the rates problem.  Indeed, they illustrate how much has been done by the Central Government in this sphere without any apparent recognition.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer comes to the assistance of ratepayers in several ways. Apart from the rates relief for agriculture mentioned already, it meets the bulk of the cost of the health services. Last year, 56 per cent of the net expenditure of health authorities came from the Exchequer.  In addition, the Exchequer makes good part of the deficits of voluntary hospitals relating to Health Act patients.  The sum included for this item in 1969-70 is £2¾ million.  It must also be emphasised that the Government have decided that no part of the cost of new health services or further extensions of existing health services should fall on local rates.</P>
    <P>On the recommendation of an interdepartmental committee, the Government have introduced legislation providing for the payment of rates in instalments and a flexible form of rates relief for necessitous persons.  Other recommendations are being considered in conjunction with a review of the structure of local government at present being undertaken.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Service of Debt</i>
    </P>
    <P>The estimated cost of the service of debt shows an increase of £11½ million over last year because of the additional borrowing required for the capital programme and the very high level of interest rates now prevailing.  There is continued advocacy for the provision of more money for housing and sanitary services, for rural electricity and for telephone development, to mention but a few items of the programme.  Money <Col N="646" /> borrowed for capital investment must be paid for, and as long as we accept the duty of providing the capital we must also accept the responsibility for the servicing of the resulting debt.  At present, interest rates all over the world are at phenomenally high levels, and we cannot isolate ourselves from these trends.  We must be prepared, therefore, if we are to press on with capital development, to remunerate the borrowing involved at the going rates.  In general, these are 1 per cent or more over those prevailing this time last year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Budget outturn</i> 1968-69</P>
    <P>I will now review the budgetary out-turn for 1968-69 and survey the opening position of the account for the present year.</P>
    <P>The budget plan for 1968-69 provided for a balance between revenue and expenditure after making an allowance of £4 million for errors of estimation.  However, for a variety of reasons which are now well known, expenditure outpaced revenue and excessive demand pressures developed as the year progressed.  The supplementary budget, which was introduced in November to cope primarily with the demand situation, projected a deficit for the year of little over £7 million.</P>
    <P>In the event, the deficit was £8.4 million.  Expenditure, at £353.9 million, was £2.4 million higher than the November estimate.  Increased outlay on the health services accounted for the greater portion of the excess. Despite the depressing effects of industrial disputes on tax returns, revenue continued to be buoyant and at £345.5 million was £1.2 million above the November estimate.  Receipts from Customs and Excise duties and from the turnover and wholesale taxes were greater than expected.</P>
    <P>The 1968-69 capital Budget proposed an expenditure of £136.4 million on the public capital programme, but because of increases during the year in the allocations for industrial grants, electricity generation, transport, agriculture and agricultural credit and for housing and sanitary services, this rose to £141.6 million and was 28 per cent higher than in 1967-68.  The deficit on <Col N="647" /> current account, a shortfall in the investment resources of Departmental Funds and reduced public holdings of Exchequer Bills had the effect of raising Exchequer residual borrowing requirements from the estimated figure of £33 million to £52 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Budgetary outlook</i> 1969-70</P>
    <P>The primary economic aim of budgetary policy, both capital and current, for 1969 must be to encourage the continuance of the satisfactory growth performance of 1968 and the main contingency we have to guard against is the possibility of excess demand arising from money incomes growing faster than national production.</P>
    <P>In view of the attitude of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in regard to pay for the rest of this year, and the Government's intention to foster a realistic development of incomes on the lines I have already mentioned, there is much common ground between the economic and social objectives of budgetary policy on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The public capital programme is reasonably expansionist without running the risk of undue inflation. Although it shows a substantial rise over last year's expenditure, the original proposals for capital spending have been reduced by some £23 million in order to keep the State's credit requirements at a reasonable level.</P>
    <P>The estimates of current expenditure have undergone similar treatment. While they are £41½ million above the corresponding figure for last year, they would have been almost £25 million higher still but for the Government's determination to reduce them to a figure which could be met from the estimates of revenue at present rates of taxation.  This was a formidable task.  The original total was an intimidating figure and Ministers have been continuously engaged since the beginning of the year in getting it down to manageable proportions.  To succeed in doing so involved many difficult decisions including the postponement of many desirable new projects and extensions of existing ones.  The aim was to favour expenditures contributing to economic growth, to eliminate anything <Col N="648" /> that seemed wasteful or unnecessary and to use existing resources to the best possible advantage.  This work will be followed up vigorously throughout the year to ensure that appropriations are not exceeded.</P>
    <P>In all, £48 million has been lopped off public expenditure, current and capital.  In different circumstances much of this would have been approved.  A reduction of this size is an earnest of the Government's determination to ensure that inflationary pressures are contained and that economic progress is not imperilled by excessive external deficits.</P>
    <P>The major part of budgetary policy is normally contained in the pre-Budget expenditure proposals as set out in the capital programme and the book of estimates published some weeks before Budget day.  The policy measures I am announcing today, however, are more important than usual.  They represent the Government's contribution to a specific approach to incomes in 1969 which we hope will be adopted by all the parties involved for the common good.</P>
    <P>I propose to balance the current account for 1969 at a level which is likely to facilitate achievement of our economic and social aims.  The achievement of balance this year should have a marked disinflationary effect following on the deficit of £8½ million in 1968-69.  The supplementary budget of last November had as its principal objective the checking of excess demand in 1969.  It has not yet had time to work its way through the economy and I am counting on its delayed effects as a major factor working in favour of moderation this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Opening position</i>
    </P>
    <P>The White Paper published a few days ago discloses that estimated revenue for 1969-70 totals £387.6 million and expenditure comes to £386.7 million.  I have, therefore, an opening surplus of £0.9 million.  This situation was achieved, as I have explained, by a thorough review of every item of expenditure and the elimination of anything not considered necessary for social and economic development.  It was open to me to leave matters at that <Col N="649" /> by simply distributing some or all of this amount and going no further. Needless to say this course offered the attraction of avoiding an increase in taxation.</P>
    <P>However, it will be clear from what I have said that we decided that the Budget this year must play an important part in establishing a sensible policy for incomes by coming to the aid in a very positive way of the lower-paid and weaker sections.  I shall now outline how this is to be done.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Increases in children's allowances</i>
    </P>
    <P>Children's allowances are being substantially increased because it is by this means that assistance can be given directly to the families who need it most.</P>
    <P>The present allowance of 15/6 a month for the second qualified child will be increased to 30/- and the present allowance of 26/6 a month for all other qualified children will be increased to 40/-, with effect from 1st August, 1969.  The present allowance of 10/- for the first child remains unchanged.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that, in my budget statement a year ago, I indicated that the structure of the scheme of children's allowances would be reviewed with a view to ensuring that an element of selectivity would be introduced by reference to the means of the parents.  I have decided against the introduction of a means test but I propose to make a start towards selectivity by providing that part of the proposed increase in the allowances will be recovered from persons paying income tax.</P>
    <P>The allowance for children under the Income Tax Acts will be reduced by £15 for each child who qualifies for an increased benefit under the Social Welfare Acts.  For children over 16 years of age who are attending an educational establishment, the income tax allowance will remain unchanged because they are outside the scope of the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    <P>As the new social welfare allowances are payable from 1st August, 1969, the reduction in the income tax child allowance for 1969-70 will not be £15, but £10 for each qualified child.  In this <Col N="650" /> manner I propose to recover about £400,000 in a full year and about £300,000 in the current year from income tax payers thus reducing the net cost of the increases to £3.3 million this year and £5 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The combined effect of these changes is that, with the exceptions mentioned, everyone will receive a net increase which will be greater or less depending on the circumstances.  An income tax payer with one child will neither lose nor gain and persons in the top ranges of sur-tax, who have qualified children, will be called upon to make a small contribution towards the scheme.</P>
    <P>In addition to these increases, and as a contribution towards the heavy additional expenses incidental to multiple births, a sum of £100 will in future be paid on the birth of triplets and £150 on the birth of quadruplets.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Increases in other social welfare payments</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year, increases of 7s 6d a week were given to the recipients of old age, blind, widows' and orphans' contributory and non-contributory pensions, as well as to those eligible for disability payments, for unemployment assistance and benefit, for maternity allowance and for adult dependant allowances.</P>
    <P>This year, to compensate them for increases in the cost of living, and as part of our policy of positively improving the position of the less well-off, we are giving even greater help to persons in the categories I have mentioned. Increases of 10s a week will be paid from August, 1969, in the case of non-contributory pensions and allowances and from January, 1970, in the case of contributory pensions and benefits.  The disabled persons maintenance allowance and the infectious diseases maintenance allowance, which are administered by the Department of Health, will be increased by 10/- a week also from August next.</P>
    <P>These improvements in the social welfare code will cost £3.8 million in this financial year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Further social welfare improvements</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year, a scheme was introduced for the payment of an allowance to incapacitated old age pensioners living <Col N="651" /> alone.  The allowance was payable in respect of daughters who left insurable employment to undertake full-time home care of their parents.  Experience has shown that this scheme is a worthwhile addition to our social welfare services, but that its effectiveness is impaired by the condition that, to qualify, a daughter must have left insurable employment and by its limitation to our own old age pensioners.  It is proposed, therefore, to waive this condition in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill thus enabling payment to be made in respect of daughters who have never worked outside the home, and also to extend the scheme to cover all incapacitated old age pensioners over 70 who, except for their daughter's company, live alone.</P>
    <P>Widows in receipt of social welfare pensions, whether contributory or non-contrbutory, are faced with serious financial difficulties in educating their children.  Their problems are not eased by the fact that the allowances in respect of the children cease at 16 years of age.  To provide some assistance towards continuation of the children's education, I propose that payment of the allowance will continue for so long as the child is in full-time education up to the age of 21.</P>
    <P>A similar concession will be made in respect of orphans' allowances.</P>
    <P>There is a distinction between the free travel scheme and the free electricity and television and radio licence schemes, inasmuch as the latter schemes do not extend to persons in receipt of Northern Ireland or British old age pensions.  As many of these are Irish people who have returned here on retirement, I propose to remove this distinction and to extend those schemes to such pensioners who are over the age of 70.</P>
    <P>The final social welfare improvement I propose is to extend the duration of the cheap fuel scheme for necessitous persons by a month at each end, so that from this year onwards it will cover the period October to April, inclusive. These miscellaneous improvements will cost £310,000 this year.</P>
    <P>The Government are concerned at the hardship caused to mothers and <Col N="652" /> families who have been deserted by the father of the family.  The Minister for Social Welfare is examining how to provide some financial assistance for those cases in this year's Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Income Tax allowances</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have been considering for some time the general structure of our income tax and sur-tax codes, particularly with a view to making improvements in the personal reliefs and allowances.  The basic ones have remained unaltered for many years because, as Deputies will realise, the costs involved are enormous.  Because of this, significant changes in our direct taxation structure could only be undertaken in the context of a comprehensive recasting of the general pattern of taxation&mdash;both direct and indirect.  In addition, the machinery of our system of PAYE makes fundamental changes impossible during the course of the income tax year.  A comprehensive scheme is being examined and it is my intention to introduce it, if possible, for 1970-71.  This would mean making the necessary legislative and other arrangements before the end of the current financial year.</P>
    <P>However, I think it is absolutely necessary to give some relief this year, and accordingly I propose to increase the allowance for married persons by £30 and to increase the allowance for single and widowed persons by £15. I estimate that this will cost the Exchequer £3.52 million in the current year and that it will remove about 30,000 taxpayers from the income tax net when account is taken of the adjustment for the increase in social welfare children's allowances.  The magnitude of this cost clearly explains why greater reliefs cannot be given at present.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Dependent Relative</i>
    </P>
    <P>As I announced earlier, I propose to increase the amount of the non-contributory old age pension to £195 as from the 1st August next.  Consequent on this increase I intend to raise the income limit for the allowance for income tax purposes of dependent relative relief.  This will secure that a taxpayer, who maintains at his own <Col N="653" /> expense a dependent relative having no income other than a non-contributory old age pension, will not have the allowance reduced because of the increased pension.</P>
    <P>
      <i>New Allowances for Incapacitated Spouse</i>
    </P>
    <P>A taxpayer whose spouse is totally incapacitated and who employs a housekeeper to look after the incapacitated person does not qualify, under existing law, for any special relief.  In response to representations that this causes hardship I propose to provide that a new allowance of £100 will be granted where such a taxpayer requires the services of a housekeeper to care for the spouse.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Handicapped children</i>
    </P>
    <P>Deputies will recall in the course of the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill last year I was asked to do something for the parent of a child who was, by reason of mental or physical infirmity, incapable of receiving full-time instruction.  This year I propose to bring in a provision which will permit the parent to claim, in lieu of the dependent relative allowance, the child allowance which, of course, is substantially larger.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Medical Expenses</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Finance Act of 1967 introduced a valuable tax relief for people who were unfortunately obliged to incur heavy medical expenses.  The relief is for expenses in excess of £50 incurred by a taxpayer on himself or on any one who is dependent on him; the relief is related to the expenses for each individual and not to the expenses for the family as a group.</P>
    <P>This year I propose to extend the relief by providing that the taxpayer may elect to claim for expenses exceeding £100 incurred by him on his family as a whole if this would be more favourable to him than the existing arrangement.</P>
    <P>There is an upper limit of £300 for the amount of expenses which might be considered in relation to each person: this will be increased to £500.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="654" />
      <i>Exports Sales Relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>The exports sales relief, which came into operation in 1957-58, has been a powerful incentive in stimulating investment in Irish industry.  As it is due to expire in April, 1980, its incentive value will progressively diminish. If the pace of industrial development is to be maintained, our incentives to export-orientated manufacturing industry must be strengthened.  I therefore propose to extend the terminal date of the relief to April, 1990&mdash;a period, which, I feel, will be sufficient to maintain the momentum of investment in Irish industry and, in particular, to attract new technological industries requiring a lengthy &ldquo;running-in&rdquo; period.  The &ldquo;Shannon&rdquo; relief will be similarly extended.</P>
    <P>In addition, the maximum period for which a company may claim exports relief will be extended from fifteen to twenty years.  Full relief will be available for fifteen years, with tapering relief at the existing rates for the remaining years.  These extensions will, of course, apply also to existing concerns.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Deductions in respect of decimalised machinery or plant</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have decided to give a special measure of assistance to traders and manufacturers who purchase or convert machinery or plant for the purpose of the change-over to the decimal currency system.  In the case of new machinery or plant purchased before the 6th April, 1971, I propose to allow &ldquo;free depreciation&rdquo; to be claimed so that the purchaser may, if he so wishes, write off 100 per cent of his expenditure in the first year.  In addition where, because of the change to the decimal currency system, a trader or manufacturer incurs before the 6th April, 1971, capital expenditure on major adaptations or conversions of his existing machinery or plant, I propose to allow the amount to be deducted as a business expense.</P>
    <P>These allowances will not be felt as a cost to the Exchequer until 1970-71.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Industrial Buildings Allowance&mdash; holiday cottages</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Shannon Free Airport Develop- <Col N="655" /> ment Company is fostering, in conjunction with Bord Fáilte and local interests, the building of holiday cottages of a type suitable for letting to tourists.  I propose to encourage this development by extending to these cottages the initial and annual allowances which are at present available for hotels and holiday camps.  Subject to the provisions of the legislation, the relief will apply to similar projects throughout the country.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Recreational facilities</i>
    </P>
    <P>It is desirable that workers in manufacturing industry should have a wide range of recreational facilities and amenities provided at the factory and elsewhere for use during breaks and after hours.  To encourage management to provide these, the Finance Bill will contain provisions to extend the industrial building allowance to capital expenditure incurred by a manufacturer on the provision of facilities such as swimming pools, tennis courts and sports clubs for employees, where such allowances are not available under existing law.  The relief will have no effect on the revenue until 1970-71.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Stamp Duties</i>
    </P>
    <P>I propose to introduce a number of changes affecting the incidence of stamp duties.  To assist purchasers of &ldquo;grant-type&rdquo; houses, I intend to relieve entirely from duty conveyances or leases executed on the first purchase of such houses.  In addition, the present maximum rate of £3 per cent will be reduced to £2 per cent in the case of purchases of other property, whether lands or houses, where the value does not exceed £6,000.</P>
    <P>To compensate for the loss of revenue resulting from these reliefs, the rate of duty on sales involving upwards of £50,000 will be increased from £3 per cent to £5 per cent.  I also propose to impose duty on a new subject of charge, namely, contracts for office block development.  This will be chargeable at the rate of £10 per cent of the contract price and will apply only to contracts of over £50,000; it will not affect local authority contracts or contracts in connection with projects in the undeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="656" /> The overall effect of these proposals will be to increase the yield from stamp duty by £100,000 in the first year and £150,000 a year thereafter.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Premiums payable on the maturity of Government securities</i>
    </P>
    <P>The National Bonds, 1966-77, were issued with the condition that the premium payable on maturity would be exempt from tax (income tax, sur-tax and corporation profits tax) and the 6½ per cent Investment Bonds enjoy a like exemption in respect of the three per cent premium which is payable on the Bonds at the end of five years.  This year, I am including a provision in the Finance Bill to grant such an exemption generally in respect of premiums which may be payable on future issues of Government securities.  These exemptions do not of course apply where the premiums fall to be regarded as a part of trading profits.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax Relief for Assurance Companies</i>
    </P>
    <P>Representations have been made to me that Irish life assurance companies who decide to engage in pension annuity business in Great Britain would suffer a competitive disadvantage by comparison with British life assurance companies which enjoy certain tax exemptions in that field.  I propose to include in the Finance Bill provisions which will remove the disadvantage.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Abolition of Schedules A and B</i>
    </P>
    <P>As provided in last year's Finance Act, tax under Schedules A and B of the Income Tax Acts will not be payable for the current year.  Detailed provisions removing Schedules A and B from the statute book will be included in the forthcoming Finance Bill. The termination of Schedule A will be of particular benefit to owner-occupiers of private residences, while the abolition of Schedule B will give additional help to the farming community through the exemption of income from the occupation of land.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Death Duties</i>
    </P>
    <P>Recent Finance Acts contained provisions for abatement of the estate duty payable in respect of property <Col N="657" /> passing on death to a deceased's widow or dependent children.  The abatement in respect of a widow's benefit is £1,000 and that for a dependent child £500.  Experience has shown that in certain cases, on account of the way in which the property passed, the abatement to the widow was less than it might have been otherwise.  I propose to remedy this in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I propose to relieve further the burden of estate duty on agricultural land.  I shall speak of this in a few minutes.  These miscellaneous tax reliefs will cost £460,000 this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Disabled Persons</i>
    </P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that a provision was included in the 1968 Finance Act exempting from road tax vehicles which are specially constructed or adapted for use by disabled drivers.  It has been represented to me that the cost of petrol constitutes a particularly heavy burden on disabled motorists who must use such vehicles to get to work.  Indeed many disabled people are totally dependent on this form of transport to enable them to obtain employment. I am satisfied that the circumstances of these motorists are exceptional enough to justify relief from the petrol duty.</P>
    <P>I propose, therefore, to authorise the Revenue Commissioners to make repayments of duty at the rate of 4s a gallon in respect of petrol used by disabled motorists subject to an annual maximum of 350 gallons per person. The repayments will cover petrol used only in those specially adapted vehicles which are exempted from road tax.  The concession will apply to petrol used on or after 1st June next and will cost approximately £25,000 this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Assistance to farmers</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year, Government expenditure in relation to agriculture rose by £9 million.  A further increase of £3 million has been provided in the Estimates already published and further improvements continue to be made where considered necessary.  In addition to the new Beef Incentive Scheme, the rate of export subsidy for beef has been increased <Col N="658" /> by 10s per cwt. from 1st April and the rate of subsidy on mutton and lamb by 1½d a lb.  An Córas Beostoic agus Feola has been set up to promote exports of cattle, beef, mutton and lamb, and an increase of 3s per barrel for barley of the 1969 crop has been announced.</P>
    <P>In the discussions which have taken place between the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and farming organisations, a number of suggestions were put forward and were promised consideration by the Minister.  Arising out of the various suggestions the following improvements are being made.</P>
    <P>The rate of payment under the Beef Incentive Scheme was recently increased from £8 to £12 per animal.  As a further encouragement to sheep production, it is proposed to extend the sheep subsidy scheme.  Farmers in mountain areas already receive a lamb subsidy of £1 per head: in future they will also receive a subsidy of £1 per head for each hogget ewe.  This additional subsidy, for which £150,000 has been provided in the estimate, should lead to a considerable improvement in the quality of breeding stock in the mountain areas and promote an expansion in sheep production generally.</P>
    <P>The small farm (incentive bonus) scheme, which is designed to effect a substantial improvement in the income of small farmers, has not proved as attractive as expected.  As a further inducement to farmers, the Government now propose to offer a higher cash incentive.  At present the scheme provides for a grant of £50 per head for four years.  It is now proposed to increase the grant to £75 in the second and third years and to £100 in the fourth.  The total grant available per farm will thus be increased from £200 to £300.</P>
    <P>The Government also intend to improve the terms for certain grants under the farm buildings and water supply schemes.  The limit for the highest rate of silo grants is being increased from 100 to 150 cubic yards.  The maximum grant for housing dry stock is being raised from £75 to £200.  The maximum grant for the provision of farm water supplies is being increased from £100 to £125.  These reliefs will <Col N="659" /> cost £133,000 but, as this is capital expenditure, it does not affect the current budget.</P>
    <P>In general, the value of any property for the purposes of Estate Duty is the price which it would fetch in the open market at the relevant date.  There is, however, an exception to this in the case of agricultural land.  This may be valued on an artificial basis favourable to the taxpayer if, broadly speaking, by adopting such basis the value of the estate does not exceed £1,000.  In order to lighten further the incidence of Estate Duty on such land, I propose to raise this limit to £2,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Pension increases</i>
    </P>
    <P>In recent years the Government have increased public service pensions on six occasions.  Pensions related to 1959 pay levels have been raised by 35 per cent and those related to 1961 pay levels have gone up by 28 per cent. This includes compensation for rises in the Consumer Price Index from those years, up to June, 1966, and, in addition, a further increase of 5 per cent was granted last year.</P>
    <P>The pensioners longest retired are, of course, those whose needs are most immediate because of the lower pay rates to which their pensions are related.  I have met the representatives of these pensioners many times and they have always pressed for parity with the pensions of those retiring now.  This would be quite expensive. While I could not give full effect to it now, I have decided to adopt it in principle and to move towards it over a number of years.  As a start, the pensions of those who retired before the general pay revision of 1st February, 1964, will be brought up to the level of the pensions of their colleagues who retired with the benefit of that pay revision.</P>
    <P>The main groups affected are retired civil servants, Gardaí, teachers, members of the Defence Forces and Local Authority pensioners.  There will be a corresponding adjustment of Military Service pensions and other Army pensions, including special allowances.</P>
    <P>In making this provision the Government are continuing to discharge <Col N="660" /> their obligations towards their former employees and are making a substantial contribution to raise their living standards of one of the weaker sections of the community.</P>
    <P>The increase will apply as from 1st August next.  The cost is estimated at £500,000 in the current year and £800,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Old IRA</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have been asked to do something for those members of the Old IRA who may be in needy circumstances.  I shall always be happy to do whatever I can for these men to whom we are all so deeply indebted.  Special allowances are paid to veterans who are not well off.  Some of them have small military service pensions also.  I propose that any recipient of a special allowance who has a military service pension of less than £25 a year, will have his pension brought up to that amount.  The revised pension will then qualify for the general pensions increase which I have just announced and which, in this case, is about ten per cent.  The special allowance will also share in that increase.</P>
    <P>I am also providing a funeral grant of £25 for those members of the Old IRA who are in receipt of special allowances.  The representatives of the veterans have asked specially for this and I am glad to be able to meet their wishes.</P>
    <P>The cost of these concessions is estimated at approximately £30,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Widows of Public Servants</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have considerable sympathy with the widows of pensionable public servants who, because their husbands retired or died before 23rd July, 1968, are not eligible for benefits under the new Widows and Children pensions scheme.  The introduction of this scheme was in line with the practice of good employers and has been welcomed on all sides.  As it had to commence at some current date, a number of widows whose husbands never had an opportunity of participating in the scheme are excluded.  The question of the State accepting some responsibility <Col N="661" /> for these widows has been brought frequently to my attention.</P>
    <P>I have examined this question fully and have decided that the most equitable solution is to give these widows half the appropriate benefit under the scheme on an <i>ex-gratia</i> basis.  Serving staff are paying half the cost of the scheme, the other half being met by the Exchequer.  Thus under my proposal the widows of pensionable staff who retired or died before the introduction of the scheme will be paid the portion of benefit attributable to the State's contribution.  This is, I think, a reasonable and generous solution which, I hope, will be welcomed.</P>
    <P>It will take some time to set up the administrative machinery to implement this scheme but I propose to introduce it as soon as possible.  I am providing £200,000 for this purpose in the current year.  The concession will cost almost £500,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>A sum of £100,000 is being made available to promote the provision of recreational facilities for our young people.  I shall speak at greater length on this later on in my statement.</P>
    <P>That concludes my list of the budgetary reliefs and concessions.  They will cost the formidable total of £12.24 million in 1969-70 and more, of course, in a full year.</P>
    <P>As I had an opening surplus of £0.91 million there is a net £11.33 million to be found.</P>
    <P>By reference to the size of this year's budget &mdash; almost £400 million &mdash; an allowance of £4 million, or 1 per cent, for errors of estimation would not be unreasonable.  However I must have regard to two factors.  The first is that the estimates have already been subjected to a very severe pruning, and the second is the necessity to provide for contingencies&mdash;notably that which is likely to arise in applying to public sector pay the incomes policy which I have already outlined.</P>
    <P>I have had fruitful discussions on this subject with the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and these are continuing at official level.  In accordance with the general policy which I have already mentioned, I propose to earmark the <Col N="662" /> bulk of such limited resources as can be made available for public sector pay, to increasing the pay of the lower-paid employees.</P>
    <P>I propose therefore to provide for this and any other uncovered contingencies that may arise by making a deduction of only £2 million under the traditional heading of errors of estimation.  To raise the sum of £9.33 million required to balance my budget I propose to make the following increases in taxation:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax Proposals</i>
    </P>
    <P>I propose to find the bulk of the additional revenue required by increasing the duties on tobacco, petrol, beer, spirits and wine.  The specific proposals and the expected additional yields in 1969-70 are:</P>

    <P>In determining the precise additions to the duties on these commodities I have made allowance for the incidence of turnover tax.</P>
    <P>As the principal social aim of this Budget is to assist the lower-paid and weaker sections, it seems appropriate that some of the additional revenue required should be derived from spending on less essential items.  I propose, therefore, to increase the rate of wholesale tax on certain articles from 10 to 15 per cent, with effect from 1st June, 1969.  The articles concerned are motor cars, motor cycles, scooters and <Col N="663" /> mopeds; television and radio sets, radiograms, record players, gramophones and records; caravans; yachts and other pleasure craft.</P>
    <P>The increased rate is expected to bring in £1.6 million in the current year; in a full year the additional yield will be £2.2 million.</P>
    <P>In the field of sales taxation, the Finance Bill will also contain some minor provisions designed to remove anomalies which have come to notice. It is desirable that one of these provisions, dealing with the settlement of accounts by way of set-off, should have immediate statutory effect.  It is, therefore, the subject of a Financial Resolution which I shall be moving this evening.</P>
    <P>There will now be a three-tiered system of turnover taxation&mdash;the retail turnover tax of 2½ per cent on general consumer goods; the 10 per cent wholesale tax on less essential goods, which makes a total charge of 12½ per cent on these goods; and the additional 5 per cent charge on a very narrow range of items.  The total charge in that limited area will thus be 17½ per cent on tax-inclusive prices.</P>
    <P>A decision has not yet been taken on the question of introducing an added-value tax but, if at a later date it were decided to have such a tax, it would be quite feasible to retain the new three-tiered system.</P>
    <P>In deciding on the tax increases I have just described, I have sought to combine a number of objectives.  I wished to avoid raising the money required by increasing indirect taxation on essentials.  This would have run counter to the general objectives of the incomes policy which we are seeking to have accepted.  Such taxes affect prices and living costs and might, therefore, give an impetus to claims for compensatory pay increases which would be particularly unwelcome in this year's conditions.</P>
    <P>Direct taxes, on the other hand, tend to discourage effort and to have widespread disincentive effects.  Moreover the Government were conscious of the need to lighten the load of direct taxation on the lower-paid taxpayer.  There <Col N="664" /> are now upwards of 700,000 income taxpayers, many of whom can be classified as lower paid and will benefit from the increase in personal allowances. It would have been inconsistent with this objective to raise the rate of the income tax.</P>
    <P>I believe that the course I have taken represents the right mix of measures to achieve these varied purposes. It spreads the burden as fairly as possible on the commodities affected by the tax increases and is in line with the general feeling that ostentatious luxury-type spending should be discouraged and the cost of essentials kept down to the minimum.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the fact that I am turning once more to those well-established sources, drink, tobacco and petrol.  The simple fact is, however, that they continue to be as buoyant as ever&mdash;the consumption of beer for instance has for the first time ever touched the 40 million gallon mark last year.  As long as they continue to come up smiling they cannot expect to escape the attention of any Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I wish to make it clear that the Government will subject applications for price increases to the most rigorous scrutiny.  Apart from the economic necessity for minimising price increases, we are determined to ensure that the large sums now being set aside to improve the position of the less prosperous amongst us are not eaten up by unjustifiable price rises. The Department of Industry and Commerce will exercise a continuous surveillance on prices and I would urge an increasing vigilance on the part of the public itself in this field.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Budget and the Third Programme</i>
    </P>
    <P>This budget is the first to be prepared since the Third Programme was published.  It seeks, therefore, to outline a fiscal policy for 1969 with regard not alone to immediate problems and possibilities but also to the potential and the requirements of the economy over the next four years.  It is not always practicable in a particular budget to reconcile completely the conflicts between short-term and medium-term needs.  I would hope, however, that improved <Col N="665" /> procedures which are now being developed will make this more feasible.</P>
    <P>Periodic reviews of the programme will take place from next year onwards. Their purpose will be to assess the progress being made towards the programme's economic and social objectives, and to identify the factors responsible for any significant departures from the expected path of development.  The Government's contributions to progress must come in for particular examination.  With this in mind, we are attempting to relate Government current and capital expenditure more closely and more specifically to the needs of development. The annual budget will be used to correct any deviations from the programme's targets that may occur in the course of a year and to re-align the public sector if the targets should be altered.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made with the appraisal of the public capital programme.  There is a large number of items involved and many are complex in scope and effect.  It is hoped to complete the task early next year.  The possibility of developing a programme budgeting system for Government expenditure, both current and capital, is being examined.  This would place emphasis on defining the aims and objectives of expenditure, on analysing the costs and the benefits associated with them, and on aligning expenditure with resources.  This work will be assisted by the systematic study of Departmental objectives which will be made by the development units mentioned in the Third Programme.  Because of the theoretical and administrative questions to be resolved, it is unlikely that results will be apparent for a number of years.</P>
    <P>The most desirable allocation of expenditure is, of course, only one side of the budgetary problem.  The financing of these expenditures and its relationship to the general management of demand is another.  Here also, the medium-term objectives of the programme have been taken into account in framing the provisions of this Budget.</P>
    <P>The extra cost of today's benefits will <Col N="666" /> accelerate the pace of the progression contemplated in the Third Programme in social development and total Government current expenditure but I consider this justifiable in the circumstances I have explained.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Decimalisation of Currency</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year I announced the Government's decision to introduce on 15th February, 1971 the £, new penny decimal system of currency.  In June, 1968 I set up the Irish Decimal Currency Board to facilitate the changeover by familiarising the public with the new currency and by finding solutions for the problems that will arise.</P>
    <P>The board are placing most emphasis at this stage on publicity to persuade business to take preparatory action in good time to ensure that accounting and other machines are capable of decimal working.</P>
    <P>Many traders have already taken steps to prepare for the changeover.  A recent survey made by the board among the main machine supply companies showed that, in relation to about 30 per cent of cash registers in use in this country, action has already been taken.  This is a good start but the pace must be accelerated.  Those who have not yet made definite arrangements for conversion or replacement of their machines should do so now.  I hope that the free depreciation provision which I have already announced will encourage them to take early action.</P>
    <P>I have already announced the designs for the decimal coins.  The 10p and 5p coins, which correspond to the existing florin and shilling, will be in circulation in the autumn.  The new 50p coin, which corresponds to the existing 10s note, will be out early in 1970.</P>
    <P>Preparations in the public sector are proceeding.  The Department of Education has been planning to phase out the teaching of &ldquo;shilling-and-pence&rdquo; arithmetic and to have decimal currency calculations taught.  Preparations by the Post Office and the other Government Departments are also going forward.</P>
    <P>The education of the general public in the new system is timed for late <Col N="667" /> 1970, when it can be expected to have maximum effect.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Banking Developments</i>
    </P>
    <P>The text of the Central Bank Bill, 1968, which proposes important changes in the law relating to banking, will be calculated shortly.</P>
    <P>In my Budget Statement last year, I mentioned the trend towards merger and consolidation in Irish banking. These developments have continued and both major banking groups have now declared their intention to bring about complete mergers of their separate clearing banks into single entities.  The Associated Banks are our major banking institutions, the main recipients of the community's savings and the source of a great part of the funds for investment and development. It is important that our banks and financial institutions, in common with other businesses, should make every effort to keep down the cost of their services.  Any steps they take to rationalise their business, increase efficiency and widen the range of their services, are to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>While it cannot be said that the reorganisation in Irish banking has not been in the public interest, the Government are conscious of the fact that over-concentration of business can entail risks.  I am happy to say that the banks have always kept the Central Bank and my Department informed of their intentions in these matters, and have thereby enabled the impact on the community at large to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The money market committee have completed their work and presented a report to the Central Bank.  The report was published last week and is being studied by the Bank, by my Department and by the Associated Banks. The results of this examination and the decision in regard to the development of a money market here will be announced in due course.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Savings</i>
    </P>
    <P>The necessity for increased savings to finance the expanding development requirements of the economy has been frequently stressed.  Saving is largely <Col N="668" /> a matter of individual decision.  The Government can hope to influence that decision mainly by providing incentives to save and by endeavouring to contain increases in prices.</P>
    <P>Details of the savings media in the public sector have been conveniently summarised in a brochure by the Savings Committee.  I am having a copy of this sent to Deputies and I hope that they will do all they can to encourage savings whenever they get the chance.</P>
    <P>Since January last, interest on deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank and the Trustee Savings Banks has been increased to 4 per cent and Investment Bonds have been put on sale offering an interest rate of 6½ per cent and a tax-free capital gain of 3 per cent after 5 years.  The Trustee Savings Banks have also introduced a new type of investment account carrying a rate of interest of 6½ per cent.  The response to these measures has been most satisfactory. In the first quarter of this year savings through the Government media have shown an increase of almost £5 million over the corresponding period of the previous year.  I hope that this commendable performance on the part of the public will be continued.</P>
    <P>The Operations Research survey of the Post Office Savings Bank and other media is continuing.  Much useful analytical work has already been completed, and market research methods will now be applied to ascertain the views of typical savers.  The results of this work may enable further improvements to be made in existing savings media and may indeed suggest some new form of investment for savings.</P>
    <P>I have said that saving is a matter of individual decision.  It is also a matter of habit.  The development of this habit would be greatly facilitated in places of employment if employees were to join in group savings schemes such as those organised under the National Savings Committee.  While many employers have agreed to the operation of these schemes there are still some who, for one reason or another, find themselves unable to participate. I would appeal once again to all employers to facilitate the introduction of savings schemes based on deductions from pay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="669" /> Before leaving the question of savings, I must again pay tribute to the work of the National Savings Committee whose members, through their unpaid efforts, are doing good work in this field.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Special Regional Development Fund</i>
    </P>
    <P>In 1967 I set up the Special Regional Development Fund to provide a flexible source of finance for economic projects in the West which, though worthwhile, do not fall within the scope of existing schemes of assistance.  The Fund has proved itself an effective instrument of development.  The projects assisted have given rise to a significant amount of employment and income.  The establishment of the Fund has given a new dimension to the work of the County Development Teams and I think it is fair to say that it has an effect far out of proportion to its size.</P>
    <P>In each of the first two years, a sum of £250,000 was provided.  Experience of the operation of the Fund and the pace at which commitments mature for payment, indicate that a sum of £100,000 added to the balance in the Fund in March last will enable it to meet all the demands which will have to be met during this financial year.  I should like to emphasise that this does not place any limit on the activities to be financed but is simply an estimate of what will be required.  No worthwhile economic project in the West will be allowed to fail because of lack of funds and whatever amount is needed for the Fund during the year will be provided.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Service</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Public Services Organisation Review Group has almost completed its investigation of the organisation of the public services at the higher levels and I expect its report during the course of the summer.</P>
    <P>Every effort is being made to keep to a minimum the growth of the Civil Service as Government activities expand and to increase its productivity and efficiency.  Recruitment procedures are being adapted to changing circumstances, the use of computers is being extended, appropriate modern management <Col N="670" /> techniques are applied and the assistance of outside consultants enlisted where necessary.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service has been in the forefront in the application of organisation and methods and continues to extend the use of these techniques. New methods of clerical work evaluation are being introduced.  A recent development has been the setting-up of a special unit in my Department to undertake a continuing survey of work in Government Departments to control numbers and to establish correct gradings. Civil Service training and staff development activities continue to expand.</P>
    <P>As already announced, the Government have decided to set up a Review Body on remuneration in the upper ranges of the public sector.  This will be a standing body which will advise the Government from time to time on the general level of remuneration of civil servants and local authority officers outside the scope of conciliation and arbitration schemes, and of chief executives of State-sponsored companies.  The Government consider that it is both in the public interest and the interest of the staff concerned to have remuneration in this area reviewed from time to time by an independent outside body.</P>
    <P>The body will consist of five members, of whom two will be drawn from the Labour Court, in line with the Government's efforts to secure co-ordination in regard to remuneration generally in the public sector.  The names of the members were announced on Monday last.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Culture and Leisure</i>
    </P>
    <P>Our recent record of economic achievement has been impressive.  In the last decade we have increased national output by 45 per cent and, at our present rate of progress, it will have doubled by 1975.</P>
    <P>Material progress is vital to the nation's well-being, but by itself it is not enough.  Indeed it brings many problems in its wake which must be identified and solved if the quality of living is also to improve.  For more and more people, rising standards are providing time and resources which <Col N="671" /> can either be fruitfully employed or simply frittered away.</P>
    <P>Thus, the problem of the use of leisure is already with us.  There is an urgent need to provide a wide range of cultural, educational and social facilities not just for the few, but for all our people.  We must seek a situation where the arts are an integral part of the daily life of each individual. Only in this way can the individual achieve personal satisfaction and the quality of our society be improved.</P>
    <P>The fruitful use of leisure affects adults and young people on different levels.  A survey of adult education needs is being undertaken to enable the Government to initiate any necessary expansion on restructuring in this important field.</P>
    <P>I have already announced the reorganisation and strengthening of the resources of An Chomhairle Ealaíon. I can assure those who may be growing impatient about this that action will not now be long delayed.</P>
    <P>As further encouragement to the creative artists in our midst and to help create a sympathetic environment here in which the arts can flourish I will provide in the Finance Bill that painters, sculptors, writers and composers living and working in Ireland will be free of tax on all earnings derived from work of cultural merit.  This is covered in the cost of the miscellaneous tax reliefs.</P>
    <P>In the dramatically changing times in which we live there is an urgent need to do more for our young people in their use of leisure also.  The provision of suitable sporting and recreational facilities requires a new comprehensive approach.  In many areas, individuals and groups, through youth clubs and otherwise, are struggling to meet the need but their efforts need encouragement, expansion and guidance.</P>
    <P>Young people in Ireland have always shown a strong inclination for outdoor activities and sports.  Several movements and associations help to organise and guide these healthy instincts. How they can be helped and strengthened will be examined.  The recent commissioning of the <i>Asgard</i> for <Col N="672" /> the training of young people in seamanship is an example of what can be done.</P>
    <P>The Government intend, therefore, that a new and forceful impetus should be given to the provision of sporting and recreational facilities for our young people.  By and large, the organisations catering for spectator field games are able to fend for themselves and it is in other directions that help is needed.</P>
    <P>I know that very little positive progress can be made in this field without funds and, as already announced, I am providing a sum of £100,000 in this year's Budget to enable a start to be made.  We are considering whether a new organisation should be established to undertake the task of administering to the best advantage this allocation, and whatever other moneys may be made available, and to promote progress in this area generally.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Irish Language</i>
    </P>
    <P>As Minister for Finance, I have exercised a general co-ordinating and supervisory function regarding the specific decisions contained in the White Paper on the Restoration of the Irish Language.  A progress report giving particulars of measures taken during the two years ended 31st March, 1968, was issued early this year.  Arising from this and the last report of Comhairle Comhairleach na Gaeilge, the Government have decided to increase and intensify their efforts.  A new broadly-based Council&mdash;Comhairle na Gaeilge&mdash;are being set up to advise and assist the Government.</P>
    <P>The Linguistic Institute of Ireland is being re-organised and strengthened. It will undertake specialised, scientific research and evaluation programmes to identify the methods and policies most likely to succeed in developing the use of Irish.  Measures for the economic, social and cultural advancement of the Gaeltacht are being intensified and extended.  The Government intend to transform the widespread public goodwill in favour of the language into a sustained national effort to maintain and extend its use.  We regard this as the most important cultural activity of all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="673" />
      <i>Conclusion</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have already stated that the expected deficit on external payments, though exceptionally large, must be viewed against the background of such factors as our strong reserves, the likelihood of a continuing capital inflow, and the upsurge in investment. Strong, however, though our reserves are, we would not be justified in deferring action to correct an excessive deficit unless there were reasonable grounds for believing that the forces generating inflation would be contained otherwise.  Apart from the measures taken to secure that the Budget deficit of last year will be replaced by a balance on current account, I have proceeded on the basis that the proposals I have outlined in favour of the less well-off will avert excessive pay claims and income increases generally. If this expectation is realised, the necessity for corrective measures disruptive of output and employment can be avoided.</P>
    <P>This Budget, therefore, has been carefully planned to meet the needs of the present situation.  Its main purpose is to make sure that economic growth is maintained for the benefit of all the people.  At the present time the overriding need is to act in a clear and positive way to encourage the adoption of a sensible attitude to incomes.  This has been done by a series of specific, <Col N="674" /> detailed measures to improve the position of the poorer, weaker and lower paid sections.  I believe that what has been done should be accepted as reasonable and that claims for an increase in money incomes should be moderated accordingly.  There is a great victory to be won here.  If the Government, acting in co-operation with all concerned, can steer the community through this anxious period of threatening inflation, the lesson of that achievement will last for many years to come.</P>
    <P>As successive Budgets should do, step by step, this Budget takes what measures it can to eliminate poverty and injustice, and to bring everybody in the community a little further along the road to prosperity and the good life.</P>
    <P>Because of this, and because of the many provisions it makes for improving our national life, I am hopeful that those who will have to pay more will do so willingly in the knowledge that they are contributing to that improvement and making life better for young and old alike.</P>
    <P>I dare to hope that this Budget will be regarded as enlightened and that it will take its place in the financial calendar as one which made a real contribution to improving the present, and safeguarding the future, for the ordinary people of Ireland.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and recognise it as such the people will, because they will remember that in March of 1965 Dáil Éireann was suddenly dissolved and the Fianna Fáil Party's appeal for votes at that time was based on the continuance of a supposed prosperity which the country was experiencing.  Indeed, one can recollect their posters which carried the messages &ldquo;Back Prosperity&rdquo;, &ldquo;Stay With Success&rdquo;, &ldquo;Let Lemass Lead On&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil Government knew at that time, what the people did not, that a grave economic crisis was in the offing.  They also knew, what the people did not, that the apparent prosperity was spurious, that the country was living beyond its means, that a huge balance of payments deficit had been incurred and that the country was in the grip of inflation.  They knew also, what the people did not, that bills had been run up, that debts had been incurred that would have to be paid, not by the rich but by the ordinary people through their wages, through the taxes they would have to pay and through the jobs they would lose.</P>

    <P>The last election took place.  It was fought and it was won by Fianna Fáil. Then what happened?  I see the Taoiseach sitting there beside the Minister for Finance.  He had the unenviable task of coming to Dáil Éireann when the election was over asking the people to pay the bills.  The party was over, the cheque had to be taken up, not by the rich of this land but by the ordinary wage earners and workers <Col N="688" /> who were asked to pay the bills for the inflation which Fianna Fáil ran up in 1964.</P>

      <P>It is necessary to remind Deputies of such a recent event as that which took place in 1968?  That was another election year. We had the referendum election.  We had a Budget introduced on 23rd April by the Minister for Finance.  It was designed to please as many people as possible.  Social welfare benefits were increased.  Income tax reliefs were given.  There was a little bit of comfort for most sections of the voters. We now know, and it is so recent that it is worth recalling, that in his Budget, introduced on 23rd April of last year, the Minister paid no regard to certain significant commitments of the State. He paid no regard to the public salary increases which were already ordained and in train.  He paid no attention to certain agricultural payments which were required.  In April of last year he introduced a false Budget which, if it remained unaltered, would have meant that we would have come to the end of the financial year with a huge deficit of over £13 million.</P>

      <P>Why was it introduced.  It was introduced because of the referendum proposals.  It was designed to cod the people into voting for the Fianna Fáil proposals.  They did not do so.  Of course, the referendum was over then, and we had a second Budget introduced by the Taoiseach, in the absence of the Minister for Finance, on 5th November, 1968.  That was the crunch, because in that Budget £19 million of new taxation was imposed upon the people of this country, making last year a record year for the imposition of taxation&mdash; £19 million of which only £4 million was required in that financial year, but that £19 million was intended to provide slush money to enable this Budget to be introduced today to indulge in vote catching.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait.  Do not put me off.  What had he to say?  He appeared in an atmosphere of drama. There was a crisis upon our land and an emergency was rife throughout the country.  Look at the headlines he got: &ldquo;We face crisis, says Haughey&rdquo; in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  He ranked a leader in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 19th March.  I will refer to that leader in a moment. Other headlines were: &ldquo;Gloomy Budget forecast by Finance Minister&rdquo;, &ldquo;There is a deficit to be made up of well over £15 million&rdquo;.  Here is what the Minister said to the people of this country just four or five weeks ago:</P>
      <P>We came into this year with very real financial problems.  During last year money incomes went up by 10 per cent, while national production rose by only 5 per cent.</P>
      <P>We carried this inflation into 1969. When incomes and the price of things bought by those incomes each start to rise, the pressure of events chase both upward at an increasing rate.</P>
      <P>On top of this a very difficult budget position was developing.  As a community, we have been going quite fast in providing new and better services for our people.</P>
      <P>An enormous amount of money has to be provided this year to build all the houses, hospitals, schools, factories and other things we want.</P>
      <P>The bills we are facing in paying for the improved education, health and social welfare services and supporting farm prices exceed our capacity to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To frame a budget to meet this situation was clearly going to be a formidable task anyway.  There <Col N="691" /> would have to be increases in taxation with small, if any, increases in benefits for those who would normally be expecting them.</P>
    <P>That was the Minister for Finance on 19th March last.  I do not know how the grass roots of Fianna Fáil took that, but the <i>Irish Press</i> came out with an editorial headed, &ldquo;Paying our Way&rdquo; and they had this to say:</P>
    <P>It was no secret that Mr. Haughey, as Minister for Finance, was faced with a very difficult task in preparing his 1969 Budget.  He and his advisers have been working on these calculations, which are based on known figures and estimates of how the economy will perform in the coming 12 months.</P>
    <P>The editorial went on to underline the crisis that faced the people and the difficulties which were causing headaches to the Minister for Finance because of the formidable Budgetary situation he was facing.  As Deputy Murphy reminded me with his interjection, this crisis appearance by the Minister on television was followed the next day by an announcement from the Head of the Government that, as an example in belt-tightening, Ministerial salaries would be reduced by 15 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That solved the crisis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That was an end to the crisis.  I want to suggest that today we have a Budget in which the Minister tries to please as many people as possible and, knowing what has been done so frequently in the past in election years, how can anyone be expected to take seriously what is proposed today?  We know there are disturbing features in our economy, and the Minister knows it.  We know&mdash;and the people throughout the country know this full well&mdash;that prices are soaring and the cost of living is reaching a record peak.  Last year prices rose by five per cent.  The latest figures show an increase of 6½ per cent.  That is indicative of a very serious malaise in the economy.  Does the Minister pay any attention to it?  Not at all.  The harassed people will have to be satisfied with a bromide doled out by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="692" /> In his statement today the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The Government have been active in alerting public opinion to the dangers involved in sharply rising prices...</P>
    <P>There was no need to alert the public. The Minister does not know it, but the ordinary people of this country have been alive to it for a long, long time. Rising prices represent a problem and a challenge to the welfare of every average family throughout the country. That is one factor.  This Budget ignores that.  In addition, there is the fact that unemployment continues to be disturbingly high.  There are over 60,000 people unemployed at the moment. What is in this Budget to deal with that?  Nothing whatsoever.  Unemployment is ignored.  There was a time when Deputy Lemass put forward the view, with which I entirely agree, that the true test of any Government's policy in this country or any other country was the number of jobs they were able to provide for the people.  There are 60,000 of our people unemployed today and the Minister for Finance acts as if he was the veritable goose that laid the golden egg.</P>
    <P>It is realised by this complacent Government&mdash;if it is not it is well to remind them&mdash;that emigration is running at the rate of close on 24,000 a year, at a higher rate than in recent years.  Although we are told there is a restriction on employment opportunities in England, nevertheless in the year which has ended 23,700 young Irish people left this country.  These disturbing features exist and abound.</P>
    <P>Another aspect is referred to in the National Industrial Economic Council's report.  At page 7, paragraph 10, in a review of the year they say:</P>
    <P>Throughout 1968, the inflationary pressures grew in strength, and the rate of growth in consumption and investment expenditures accelerated. The Budgetary measures of 5 November, 1968 probably had a net expansionary effect during the remainder of the calendar year because the growth in expenditure to forestall the higher rate of wholesale tax which became effective from 1 January <Col N="693" /> 1969 was almost certainly of greater importance than the immediate restraining effects of the higher duties on beer, tobacco and spirits.  However, at this stage the relevance of 1968 lies in the legacies it bequeaths to 1969...</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The legacies it bequeaths to 1969.&rdquo; It goes on to deal with the prospects for 1969.  Time does not permit me to go into this report in detail but it is fair to say that this National Industrial Economic Council is objective, and it points to very serious sources of danger affecting the very welfare of our people and the employment of ordinary people throughout the country.  The warning contained in that report was also contained in the Economic Review issued by the Department of Finance in relation to the outlook for 1969.</P>
    <P>Where in this Budget is there any evidence of a plan to deal with persistent, chronic unemployment, with continuing emigration, with the dangers inherent in a rising deficit in our balance of payments?  There is nothing here.  This is merely an effort to please as many people as possible.</P>

If he smokes 20 cigarettes a day, if he takes one pint a day, if he smokes no cigarettes on Sunday and if he does not take a pint on Sunday, all that that means is that he will pay more in increased taxation than he will get by way of allowance from the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>For the first time since 1965 the backbenchers of the Fianna Fáil Party had an opportunity of applauding a Budget.  As far as I and my Party are concerned, we welcome the concessions given and we will be prepared to support the measures designed to finance these concessions.  I do not know that the Minister for Finance has a good claim to be considered any sort of financial wizard because, as far as the Budget is concerned, we are still following the same old pattern, particularly where taxation is concerned.  It does not need a great deal of imagination or a great deal of brainwork to do what the Minister has done today or what he and his predecessors did in Budgets over the last five or six years.  There is the usual twopence on the packet of cigarettes, the usual twopence on the pint, threepence on the gallon of petrol, and so on.  That brings in £10 million and then one gives concessions to certain sections of the community.  Those who are being assisted are, I agree, deserving of assistance but nobody is going to tell me that, as a result of this Budget, the old age pensioner will run riot on £3 15/- a week or that the single person qualifying for the proposed income tax relief will be any better off as a result of that so-called relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, we welcome any concessions and we will support the measures designed to finance them.  In recent years Fianna Fáil have not acted in the best interests of the country when framing their Budgets.  They put Party before country.  There is all the evidence in the world to support the argument that Fianna Fáil think this is a good political Budget.  One could see <Col N="697" /> the relief when the different concessions were mentioned.  The Fianna Fáil Government, the Fianna Fáil Party and Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance have used Budgets to protect or to safeguard their political fortunes and their only interest now is in the result of the next general election, whenever it may be.</P>
    <P>In April, 1968, we had what is now generally described as the &ldquo;Referendum Budget&rdquo;.  It was a mild Budget. It did not cause a ripple anywhere. The taxation proposals were lenient. There were reasonably generous concessions. All this was done because there was going to be a referendum. The Government deliberately ignored their responsibility.  The Minister ignored his responsibility to provide for the pay increases in the public sector, increases amounting to some millions of pounds.  It would have been an unpopular thing for him to have made, as he should have done, provisions for these pay increases at that time and the Minister was not prepared to risk unpopularity, for the sake of the Party and for the sake of the referendum that was held later in that year.  It was a politically tailored Budget.  One could describe this Budget also as politically tailored for the general election, whenever it will be.</P>
    <P>The referendum was held and, in face of the colossal rebuff the Government suffered, the Government decided they would have to face up to their responsibilities.  They did not postpone facing up to these responsibilities as a Government normally would until the next Budget was introduced in April or May of this year. They knew they would be in a difficulty because there would be a general election looming up and the Taoiseach, as acting Minister for Finance, introduced what was called a &ldquo;mini-Budget&rdquo; but what was, in effect, a &ldquo;maxi-Budget&rdquo; to raise the £12 million or £15 million needed for public service pay increases and to meet other liabilities amounting to some £3 million or £4 million.  Within a short six months an extra £20 million was called for&mdash;£20 million that should have been given consideration when the Minister for Finance introduced <Col N="698" /> his Budget in April 1968.  They postponed making provision for that £20 million until after the referendum and they brought in a Budget in November in an effort to repair the damage done before they entered an election year.</P>
    <P>One wonders whether or not we can now depend on the figures, any of them, quoted to us here this afternoon by the Minister for Finance.  Fianna Fáil Ministers have been wrong in the past, so wrong that they were compelled to bring in two Supplementary Budgets.  We have reached the stage now where we cannot trust a Minister for Finance.  It is a dreadful thing to have to say that, but the fact is that we cannot trust him.  I do not know who will be the Government after the next general election&mdash;Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, or Labour&mdash;but it is a possibility that, because of past practices of Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance, as soon as the election is over, we will be faced with a colossal problem as far as revenue and taxation are concerned.</P>
    <P>The taxpayers were scourged in 1968.  There was more taxation imposed in that year than was ever imposed in any year since the State was founded.  It amounted to something like £22 million.  The taxpayers were scourged in order to ensure that there would be something for the Minister for Finance to distribute as largesse in view of the impending general election. In two Budgets cigarettes went up by 5d.  As a result of this Budget they will go up by another 2d&mdash;an increase of 7d on the packet of cigarettes in a period of 12 months.  There is an increase of 5d on the gallon of petrol in the same period.  Those who drink will be asked to pay another 2d on the pint.  Similarly with spirits.  The wholesale tax went up by 51 per cent last year.  Now it is proposed, in respect of certain commodities, to increase it further.</P>
    <P>The Minister had not much regard in his speech for the way the consumer price index has behaved in the past 12 months.  There was an increase of 7.1 points.  It was the second largest increase in the consumer price index in this country in 15 years.  Of course, the notable one was the year 1963-64 when the turnover tax was introduced. <Col N="699" /> Between 1953 and 1960, seven years, the consumer price index went up by 18 points.  However, between 1961 and 1968, it went up by 40 points.  We had twice as large an increase in the consumer price index between 1961 and 1968 as we had between 1953 and 1960.</P>
    <P>We have a surplus of nearly £1 million but, again, at what cost to the taxpayers?  We have that surplus at a cost of something like £22 million or £23 million to the taxpayers which was imposed to produce one result only, as all Budgets here in the past three or four years have been designed and as this Budget is designed, namely, to garner votes for Fianna Fáil in the 1969 general election.  I suppose the people are now expected to be grateful for the concessions that have been given.  They should be grateful, I suggest, that a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance has ceased kicking them for the first time in five years.  They may not now feel the pain so much.</P>
    <P>One is bound to wonder if this Budget is the first instalment of the Budget for the financial year 1969-70.  There was some reference to this last year also.  In April, 1968, when the Minister said&mdash;casually&mdash;that he might have to come back to the Dáil in the autumn, his remark was not taken seriously. When the Minister for Finance introduced his Budget in 1968, nobody thought that the Taoiseach, on his behalf, would have to come back in the autumn for so much extra.</P>
    <P>The past year has been a year of economic confusion: I am not talking about strikes in this context.  The greater part of the confusion was caused by the Government themselves and, as Deputy O'Higgins has said, the Minister for Finance was the chief contributor to that confusion and panic, aided and abetted by the Taoiseach. Reference was made to the unprecedented television appearance of the Minister for Finance on 18th March, 1969.  This had never been availed of by any Minister since Radio Telefís Éireann was established.  Deputy Haughey told his television and radio audiences that we came into the financial year 1968-1969 with grave <Col N="700" /> financial problems and that to frame a budget for the financial year 1969-70 to meet that situation would be a formidable task.  He told his audiences that there would have to be an increase in taxation in order to provide small, if any, increases in benefit for certain categories of persons.  We are, indeed, glad that the Minister for Finance has introduced these benefits.  On 18th March, 1969, he mentioned the serious economic situation in which we found ourselves.  He talked about a cutback in spending, a credit squeeze and more restrictions.  He ended his speech in that rather serious vein.</P>
    <P>As Deputy M.P. Murphy has mentioned, if the Government thought the position at that time was so serious that they reduced their substantial salaries by £250 per annum, we may well ask for what purpose did they decide on that reduction.  Was it meant to be an example to the community?  If it was, it was a cynical gesture by people who, like ourselves, had voted themselves substantial increases last year but believed that, by reducing their salaries by a mere £250, low-paid workers would show restraint.  It was a cynical gesture by the Minister and, equally, it was a cynical gesture by the Fine Gael Party.  One month later, the Minister for Finance said there was no crisis.  If there was no crisis, why did he go on television one month before that and call for restraint?  Why did he talk about the adverse balance of payments?  I suggest that the answer is that a general election was in the offing and that everything he did was done with an eye to that occasion. Why did he suggest, within one month of its introduction, that this Budget would be a very tough Budget?  What was his purpose in doing all that?</P>

      <P>This is one of the best examples of the confusion and frustration <Col N="701" /> created in the mind of the Irish people as a result of the radio and television speech by the Minister for Finance on 18th March, 1969.  I cannot call a general election.  That is his prerogative and that of the Taoiseach, in consultation with his Cabinet members.</P>
      <P>This Budget is further evidence that everything the Fianna Fáil Party have done, particularly in the past three or four months, is designed to ensure that the fortunes of the Fianna Fáil Party will be safeguarded rather than the fortunes of the nation.  There are other crises the Government have ignored. The manufactured crisis of 18th March, 1969, dissolved within a month.  There are other crises which neither the Government nor the respective Ministers have attempted to dissolve.  Take those who cannot find employment.</P>
      <P>I am amused by some of the contributions in this House by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and other Ministers on the subject of employment and new industries, the prospects for further employment, and so on. Deputy Haughey spoke a lot about employment and unemployment in his Budget speech.  I would ask him to take note of the following figures.  In 1968, the last year for which figures are available, there were 6,000 fewer persons at work in this State than in 1964.  Is that not a crisis which the Government are refusing to tackle and is that not a crisis which has obtained since Fianna Fáil came back into office in 1957?</P>
      <P>Let us talk about 1957 for a moment &mdash;1957, the year which has been described as the worst year in our economic history.  In that year there were 19,000 more at work than there were in 1968.  So much for Fianna Fáil's industrial miracle.  Our people are not getting the jobs Fianna Fáil promised to provide for them or forecast under the various programmes for economic expansion.  On the contrary, ever since Fianna Fáil came back into power in 1957, the number of jobs in this country has gradually been diminishing to the point that we now have 19,000 fewer people at work in this country than were at work here in 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there not a crisis for the homeless? <Col N="702" /> It would have matched some Minister, principally the Minister for Local Government, to make a special television appearance on the subject of the housing crisis in this city, in every town and in the rural areas. That is the crisis that should be tackled rather than the gimmick of the Minister for Finance who made a speech on television and on radio on 18th March last&mdash;a speech which has not yet been explained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It was 153,000: the unemployment figure was about double the 1954-57 figure.  It would match the Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce to concern themselves about the crisis in prices. It was somewhat cynical of the Minister today to reiterate that there must be strict control of prices.  Did the Minister for Labour, Dr. Hillery, not introduce a Bill into this House entitled the Prices Bill?  During the debate he promised there would be strict control of prices in order to try to ensure that there would be stability in wages and salaries.  It is a bit late now, three or four years afterwards, to tacitly admit that we have not had price control since that Bill.  As I say, every housewife knows that there is a crisis in prices.  The cost of living for her went up by 5 per cent last year which means that she is only getting 19/- worth now for the £ that she spent the year before.  There is a crisis as far as the small wage earner is concerned. Wage earners particularly have been dragged into the taxation net by the hair.  I should like the Minister to be under no illusions about what his £2 million is going to do for the lowly paid workers in the public service.  It will give them a certain small amount but it will not satisfy them in the manner he expects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate as much as anybody else how costly it is to make sweeping <Col N="703" /> changes in our income tax system. Again, let me say that the concession of £15 to the single person is not going to have a tremendous effect on his spending power.  It will not increase it to any great extent.  Again, as has been said, this Budget will do nothing for anybody who smokes or drinks or has a car.  In any case, there is a grave disproportion in the amount paid by those who now have their tax collected under PAYE and other sections.  Over the last five years, sur-tax went up by 20 per cent, tax on company profits went up by 50 per cent but taxes on wages and salaries in the same period went up by 100 per cent.  The Minister can check those figures if he wishes, certainly I will check them anyway.  Year after year those who are earning wages and salaries are paying proportionately more.</P>

      <P>I am talking about percentages. I am saying that they are contributing a greater percentage.  The wage and salary earners have borne the brunt of tax increases in recent times.  The Government should also concern themselves with the crisis in agriculture.  There have been concessions given but I am afraid these are not going to satisfy to any great extent those people from the farming organisations who made representations, perhaps, to the Minister for Finance, but certainly to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  There is a crisis as far as the agricultural population is concerned in that, while year after year large numbers have left the land, in 1968 9,000 more left the land.  We have not applied ourselves to the task of endeavouring to improve the incomes of those engaged in agriculture.  At present their income is only three-quarters of the incomes in the cities and urban areas.  These concessions whilst they are welcome will certainly not go anywhere near to equating the incomes of the agricultural community with those in the cities and towns.</P>

      <P>That is right, in accordance with their income.  Any farmer who should not pay income tax will not pay it and that will mean the majority of farmers, due to the policy carried out by the Fianna Fáil Party over the last 12 years.  The Minister has been hammering at the workers for being solely responsible for our economic difficulties.  He can deny this if he likes but that was one of his purposes on television, to tell workers that they dare not look for any more money or the economy would be upset. How the unfortunate worker is to relate that to the balance of payments problem I do not know.  Too often and for too long has the worker been made a scapegoat of Government attacks when they find themselves in balance of payments difficulties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should concede this: some people believe that wage costs have gone up beyond all control.  It is true that in 1968 wages went up by 8½ per cent but it is also true that the workers increased production by 8½ per cent so that anything they got in 1968 was their due.  As a result of this, apropos of what has been <Col N="705" /> said about increasing wages and exports, unit wage costs did not go up last year but there is no mention of profits going up.  I did not hear any emphasis being laid by the Minister on increases in profits.  If I remember rightly, there was no mention in his television speech of profits going up by 12 per cent last year.  We are not supposed to touch these people and we talk about incentives for these people to make profits in order that they will produce more.  There are no such incentives for workers who last year justified every single penny they got as far as wages and salaries were concerned.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is looking for an economic crisis he should look at the trading conditions of this country with Great Britain.  If he likes he can read the speeches made by members of this Party on the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.  Last year we had an adverse swing in our trading with Great Britain of £25 million which was solely attributable to Government policy.  However, the real threat to security is jobs and we do not believe that as a result of Government policy, particularly as far as the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement is concerned, that we can look forward to an increase in jobs or that we can look forward to security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing in this Budget to solve our economic problems.  It will be regarded as a popular Budget and it is tailor-made for a general election. That is the right of the Fianna Fáil Party, but in the last four or five years they have scourged the taxpayer and thrown out paltry amounts to social welfare recipients.  They will boast about what they are doing for social welfare and talk about what I as Minister for Social Welfare did or did not do but as far as tax revenue is concerned, or as far as Budgetary expenditure was concerned, the late Deputy Bill Norton and myself did more than the Fianna Fáil Party are now doing.  In 1962-63 there was 16.6 per cent of total Budgetary expenditure on social welfare; in 1968-68 it was only 13.6 per cent, or £45 million out of a total of £332 million.  We have had various Ministers, including Deputy <Col N="706" /> MacEntee and the present Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Brennan, and all the Fianna Fáil Ministers for Social Welfare, telling us that we cannot give the pensioners any more unless we get more in.  That has not been the pattern; crusts have been thrown to them.  The old age pensioner on £3 15s. a week is not going to go wild, nor are those who are going to get increases in unemployment benefit or sickness benefit going to go wild.  We thought the Minister was going to make a determined effort to improve the lot of social welfare recipients and of the lowly paid workers, particularly in his own Department.  He has not done that.  Therefore, I do not think that the people are going to get too excited by this Budget.  They will recognise it for what it is.  There seems to be a childish attitude on the part of the Government in regard to the date of the election.  If the Minister wants to know our point of view on that I can tell him: we are ready.  It is not a question of catching any Party, or at least the Labour Party, on the wrong foot.  It is a childish idea to be withholding what the Taoiseach may regard as a secret, keeping everybody in suspense. A general election is an important thing.  It is not an instrument for the Fianna Fáil Party only.  It is an exercise in which Deputies will be returned to Dáil Éireann and the country wants to know when it will take place.  The Minister, as Minister for Finance, should recognise that because there is this uncertainty there may also be uncertainty in industry and business.  Like the Deputy who spoke before me I would urge the Minister to ask the Taoiseach to dissolve this Dáil as soon as possible because no matter what one thinks about this Budget, and conceding the good things that are in it, we are prepared to fight every Party in the expectation of greatly increasing our present strength.</P>

      <P>I should like to know the total amount of duty on one gallon of petrol including the tax levied directly as well as turnover tax and other incidental taxes?  It can no longer be said that only the wealthy use cars and so consume petrol.  Most people in modern conditions require cars and workers and farmers now have cars.  As mentioned earlier by Deputy Tully, there is no rebate for a worker using his car to go to or return from work.  That concession should be made. Let me mention a specific case to illustrate my point.  We had the case of a factory which closed down and workers had to purchase a car or mini-bus and travel 26 miles to secure alternative employment.  That meant travelling 52 miles daily.  I asked the Minister at the time to give some rebate to such workers but nothing was done.  Workers who have to use their cars to get to and from work should get a rebate.  I am sure the Minister will agree that is reasonable.  Could the Minister say what is the actual total tax on a gallon of petrol?</P>

      <P>I could, perhaps, give a word of explanation which might help.  The approach is that both are covered&mdash;petrol and diesel.  I am using these terms very roughly to cover the two main headings.  Petrol and diesel are both covered and then the diesel is exempted for a number of uses and the only use really left in for tax purposes for diesel oil is use for a motor vehicle on the roads.  Practically all other uses are excluded.</P>

      <P>Apart from the case made by Deputy Murphy, the effect of this, then, comes to this, that there is in this a tax on distribution and the costs of distribution must obviously be raised.  That clearly has some effect &mdash;I do not know what effect&mdash;on prices at a time when prices have shown an alarming tendency upwards.  I note that the estimated yield from this tax is £2 million and it is to be noted that in the Budget the Minister makes an allowance for errors of estimation of £2 million.  It is not necessary to go into a major discussion at this stage but, in this year, with a threatening of inflation&mdash;whether it has occurred or not you can leave aside&mdash;the view is strongly held and has been expressed here in relation to other circumstances on this issue that there should be this year no allowance for errors in estimation. I do not believe there should be.</P>

      <P>Deputy P.J. Lenihan referred to the fact that we had no case to make about the people who are travelling to work because, he said, this 3d. per gallon on petrol would not affect them.  What Deputy Lenihan was, in fact, talking about was company buses.  We are not talking about company buses.  We are talking about the unfortunate people scattered throughout the country who have to travel from early morning, sometimes from as early as 7 o'clock, with three, four, five or six people to a car into Dublin and home again after a hard day's work.  These people are to get no remission on their income tax while <Col N="717" /> they will have to pay the extra 3d. per gallon on petrol.</P>
      <P>I pay this tribute to the Minister for Finance that when he was Minister for Justice he stopped a racket that had started whereby the gardaí had got instructions from somebody to stop cars and prosecute people for travelling in this way.  That racket has not since been started.  However, we had expected that the Minister for Finance would do something to make an allowance for these people so that they could claim travelling expenses just as their boss could and just as Deputy Lenihan could if he were travelling from his home to his office in the course of his work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>A man who uses a motor vehicle in the course of his employment, regardless of whether he is a labourer or the manager of the job, gets a tax-free allowance; but the man who uses his car to travel to his place of employment gets no tax-free allowance.  This is where the catch comes in and, as I have said, we had expected that the Minister would make some provision for these people, but he has not done so.  It is not only the rich who now use cars because the people to whom I am referring would have to stay out of employment if they did not have a car to get to their work. Therefore, this extra imposition being put on them is unfair and it is only right that the Minister should be told that.</P>

      <P>If there are five people travelling in a car and assuming that the car does 30 miles to the gallon and the cost of petrol being 6/-after the passing of this Resolution, the increase would amount to only 2½ per day which, in effect, would mean that each person would have to pay only one halfpenny per day extra.  What, then, is all the weeping and wailing about?</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee is not only confusing himself but he is confusing us as well.  There are people travelling 40 miles to work and 40 miles back, 80 miles in all and that <Col N="718" /> figure would be multiplied by six for a week.  Most of these people have very old cars from which they would only get about 20 miles to the gallon.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>(1)  That, subject to paragraphs (2) and (3) of this Resolution, the duty of customs on tobacco imposed by section 20 of the Finance Act, 1932 (No. 20 of 1932), shall, as on and from the 8th day of May, 1969, be charged, levied and paid at the several rates specified in Part I of the Schedule to this Resolution in lieu of the several rates specified in Parts I and II of the Second Schedule to the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1968 (No. 37 of 1968).</P>
      <P>(2)  That the provisions of section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall apply to the duty mentioned in paragraph (1) of this Resolution&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  with the substitution of &ldquo;the area of application of the Acts of the Oireachtas&rdquo; for &ldquo;Great Britain and Ireland&rdquo;, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  as though the descriptions of manufactured tobacco mentioned in Part I of the Schedule to this Resolution were included in the first column of the Second Schedule to that Act after the expression &ldquo;manufactured tobacco&rdquo; and the appropriate preferential rates mentioned in that Part were mentioned in the second column of the said Second Schedule opposite the mention <Col N="719" /> of those goods in the first column thereof in lieu of the rate mentioned in the said second column opposite the mention of manufactured tobacco in the said first column.</P>
    <P>(3)  That&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  this paragraph applies to manufactured tobacco which was manufactured in, and consigned from, the United Kingdom and was manufactured therein from materials other than materials falling within Tariff Heading number 24.02 in the Schedule to the Imposition of Duties (No. 159) (Customs Duties and Form of Customs Tariff) Order, 1966 (S.I. No. 132 of 1966),</P>
    <P>(b)  the customs duty on tobacco mentioned in paragraph (1) of this Resolution shall, as on and from the 8th day of May, 1969, and before the 1st day of July, 1969, be charged, levied and paid on manufactured tobacco to which this paragraph applies at the several rates specified in Part II of the Schedule to this Resolution in lieu of the several rates specified in Part I thereof and shall, as on and from the 1st day of July, 1969, be charged, levied and paid on manufactured tobacco to which this paragraph applies at the several rates specified in Part III of the Schedule to this Resolution in lieu of the several rates specified in Parts I and II thereof,</P>
    <P>(c)  the provisions of section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall apply to the duties imposed by this paragraph&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  with the substitution of &ldquo;the area of application of the Acts of the Oireachtas&rdquo; for &ldquo;Great Britain and Ireland&rdquo; and as though the expression &ldquo;manufactured tobacco&rdquo; in the first column of the Second Schedule to that Act did not include manufactured tobacco to which this paragraph applies,</P>
    <P>(ii)  as though manufactured tobacco to which this paragraph <Col N="720" /> applies, together with the descriptions of such manufactured tobacco in Part II or III (as may be appropriate) of the Schedule to this Resolution, were mentioned separately in the said first column and the appropriate preferential rates specified in that Part were mentioned in the second column of the said Second Schedule opposite the mention of those goods in the first column thereof, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  subject to the last paragraph (beginning with &ldquo;Goods shall not be deemed&rdquo;) of subsection (1) of the said section 8 being disregarded.</P>
    <P>(d)  in this paragraph the expression &ldquo;the United Kingdom&rdquo; means Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands,</P>
    <P>(e)  the expression &ldquo;hard pressed tobacco&rdquo; mentioned in Parts II and III of the Schedule to this Resolution and the next subparagraph of this paragraph has the same meaning as it has in section 17 of the Finance Act, 1940 (No. 14 of 1940),</P>
    <P>(f)  the expression &ldquo;other pipe tobacco&rdquo; mentioned in Parts II and III of the Schedule to this Resolution means manufactured tobacco of kinds normally intended to be used in pipes, not being hard pressed tobacco.</P>
    <P>(4)  That the duty of excise on tobacco imposed by section 19 of the Finance Act, 1934 (No. 31 of 1934), shall, as on and from the 8th day of May, 1969, be charged, levied and paid at the several rates specified in Part IV of the Schedule to this Resolution in lieu of the several rates specified in Part III of the Second Schedule to the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1968.</P>
    <P>(5)  That, subject to the provisions of paragraph (6) of this Resolution, there shall be charged, levied and paid on all stocks of tobacco of every description which at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 7th <Col N="721" /> day of May, 1969, are in the ownership or possession of a licensed manufacturer of tobacco and in any place in the State other than a bonded warehouse, a duty of excise, payable by the manufacturer, at the following rate, that is to say:</P>
    <P>(a)  so far as the stocks consist of unmanufactured tobacco, three shillings and seven pence for every pound weight of the stocks, and</P>
    <P>(b)  so far as the stocks consist of tobacco (including snuff) other than unmanufactured tobacco, three shillings and seven pence for every pound weight of unmanufactured tobacco from which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, the stocks were derived.</P>
    <P>(6)  That the duty provided for by paragraph (5) of this Resolution shall not be chargeable on any manufactured tobacco (including cigarettes, cigars and snuff other than offal snuff) as to which it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that it was at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 7th day of May, 1969, fully prepared for sale by retail and that either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  it was not the product of any operation carried out by any manufacturer in whose ownership or possession it was at that time; or</P>
    <P>(ii)  it was at that time held as retail stock in premises used for selling tobacco by retail; or</P>
    <P>(iii)  it was at that time in transit from seller to buyer under a contract of sale:</P>
    <P>Provided that no tobacco shall be deemed for the purposes of this paragraph to have been fully prepared for sale by retail if, according to the ordinary course of business of the person in whose ownership or possession it was or to whom it was in transit, it had still to be subjected to some further process (other than packing) before being sold by him.</P>
    <P>(7)  That every licensed manufacturer of tobacco shall not later <Col N="722" /> than the 14th day of May, 1969, make a return to the Revenue Commissioners in a form approved by them giving such information as they may thereby require and, in particular, showing the quantities by weight of tobacco of every description in his ownership or possession at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 7th day of May, 1969, in any place in the State other than a bonded warehouse.</P>
    <P>(8)  That every licensed manufacturer of tobacco shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  produce, if so required, to any officer of Customs and Excise the trade books and all accounts and documents belonging to or in the possession of such manufacturer which are necessary for verifying the return made in pursuance of paragraph (7) of this Resolution, and</P>
    <P>(b)  render all reasonable assistance to such officer in the taking of an account of the tobacco which was in the ownership or possession of such manufacturer at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 7th day of May, 1969.</P>
    <P>(9)  That every licensed manufacturer of tobacco shall, immediately upon making the return required by paragraph (7) of this Resolution or on the 14th day of May, 1969, whichever is the earlier, pay to the Revenue Commissioners the full amount of the duty mentioned in paragraph (5) of this Resolution on any tobacco which was in his ownership or possession at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 7th day of May, 1969, and was chargeable with the said duty, and the Revenue Commissioners may, if they think fit, defer the payment of the duty to a date not later than the 1st day of November, 1969, upon the manufacturer giving security by bond or otherwise to their satisfaction that such duty will be paid.</P>
    <P>(10)  That every manufacturer required by paragraph (7) of this Resolution to make such return as is mentioned in that paragraph who <Col N="723" /> either fails to make such return or makes a return which is incomplete, false or misleading in any material respect or fails or refuses to do anything which he is required by paragraph (8) of this Resolution to do shall be guilty of an offence under the statutes relating to duties of excise and shall for every such offence incur an excise penalty of fifty pounds, and all tobacco in relation to which such offence was committed shall be forfeited.</P>
    <P>(11)  That where drawback is payable in respect of tobacco on which the excise duty provided for by paragraph (5) of this Resolution has been paid, such drawback shall, to the extent of the duty paid in pursuance of the said paragraph (5) as determined by the Revenue Commissioners, be a drawback of excise.</P>
    <P>(12)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>

      <P>Here again we have an increase.  I should like to know what now is the price per ounce of hard-pressed tobacco, loose tobacco and the price of the standard size packet of cigarettes.  How much per packet is the State to get from the total amount?  I mentioned in this House some time ago that the State was dependent to a large extent for its financial existence on people who smoke and drink.  Am I correct in saying that the taxation on a packet of 20 cigarettes is in the region of 3s. 8d. or 3s. 9d.?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;so that a man buying a packet of 20 cigarettes <Col N="727" /> each day on which taxation is 4s. will be paying the State £75 per year. Therefore, we here today are asking those of us who smoke 20 cigarettes per day to contribute about £75 each year to the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have thought that Deputy Briscoe would have been good at calculating but apparently he is not.  There would have been a lot of unrest if people were asked to pay an extra £75 in additional revenue on, say, rates.  What would happen if, as a result of this additional impact, a sizeable percentage of our cigarette and tobacco smokers decided to take the advice that is freely available to them to stop smoking and prolong their lives? What would the reaction be if, instead of paying the 4/- tax at the time of purchase, the shopkeeper would take only the price of the cigarettes and keep an account of the tax to be paid later to the State?  This would mean, in effect, that the person would get a demand for £37 10s each half year and that is a rather formidable figure. In most cases at least 25 per cent of what the old age pensioner is getting is taken back through additional tax on tobacco and cigarettes.  We know that many people have very little other means of enjoying themselves after their day's work except to sit around talking and smoking.  It is a good job for Deputy Haughey as Minister for Finance that that is the position.  I just wonder are we being fair to these people.  The Minister states in relation to another Resolution that our consumption is not going down and whilst it is not going up it attracts his attention. Is that a good approach?  I leave this to the judgement of the House.</P>

We were all concerned a while ago, and rightly so, about many of our old age pensioners, our lower paid workers and others.

I find nothing wrong with a person taking a few drinks.  It is only when drink is taken to excess, as, unfortunately, happens in a small percentage of cases, that it is harmful.  It is an old Irish tradition whether at a christening, a wedding or a wake that you have a supply of drink.  If the Minister is here next year and I am doubtful of that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the downgrade I would say.  We must get away from this idea of taxing drink.  I think the Minister supports this.  I know I can see some of you smiling over there.  He is getting an extra 2d. on every pint which is consumed at the publicans counter whether it is in Dublin or any part of rural Ireland. If by any chance you are Minister for Finance next year, although I am sure you will not as this Dáil could not last that long.  I suppose you will try to put something on it again.  Forget about that.  We must change our tax structure.  Those who drink and smoke are paying through their consumption of drink and cigarettes all these millions, which, the Minister says, help others.  Some of these people who take a few pints are not very wealthy people.  They often have to work hard for this money.  As a result of this Budget a man will find that he will only have a pint a day for his £1. That is too much of an impact on him.</P>

    <P>This amendment has been discussed for some time and the Minister, so far, has not shown any inclination to accept it.  I want to urge him to reconsider his attitude with regard to it.  Subsection (8) of section 12 is the subsection which imports into later sections in the Bill the power to arrest without warrant.  I am suggesting in my amendment that this subsection should be deleted, that it is unwise and unnecessary to carry the power of arrest without warrant into the subsequent sections of the Bill comprised in Part VI of the Bill as the Minister <Col N="750" /> would have us do if this subsection remains in.</P>
    <P>As I said in the course of the Committee discussion, I regard this as one of the most important amendments being proposed to this Bill.  I referred in earlier contributions to the effect which this will have in relation to some of the sections contained in Part VI of the Bill if it is allowed to remain unaltered.  I indicated that I proposed to say some words with regard to its effect on sections 28 and 29 of the Bill.  It is correct to say that the Minister in amendments which he will move later on proposes to modify the proposals contained in sections 30 and 31 of the Bill as the Bill now stands, but there are no proposals from the Minister, other than what might be regarded as drafting amendments, in relation to sections 28 and 29 with the exception, of course, that the House has already agreed to an amendment in the definition section which has an effect, so far as these sections, in particular section 28, are concerned.  That is the amendment which would enable the meetings contemplated in section 28 to take place in a building.  Apart from that, there is no substantial amendment proposed by the Minister in relation to either section 28 or section 29.</P>
    <P>Under the subsection which we are discussing at the moment&mdash;subsection (8) of section 12&mdash;it is proposed that in relation to offences under section 28 or under section 29 or under the other sections in Part V of the Bill, the Garda authorities will have power of arrest without warrant.  I want to view that, and I want the House to view it, first of all, in the context of section 28 of the Bill.  The House will know that section 28 deals with two things.  It deals with meetings, processions or demonstrations held within half a mile of a building in which the Houses of the Oireachtas are sitting.  It deals also with a public meeting, procession or demonstration relative to civil or criminal proceedings.  So far as the first part is concerned, that is its relation to meetings, processions or demonstrations within half a mile of any building in which a House of the Oireachtas is sitting, it is necessary <Col N="751" /> that in order to become unlawful and in order to be an offence under this part of the Bill, the meeting, procession or demonstration should be calculated to influence or affect the deliberations of either House of the Oireachtas.  There is a very important distinction between the phrase used in relation to a meeting, procession or demonstration which takes place within half a mile of Leinster House and the subsequent provisions in subsection (3) of section 28 in relation to a public meeting, procession or demonstration relative to civil or criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P>The first distinction is that, so far as the Houses of the Oireachtas are concerned, the demonstration or meeting, as the case may be, must be calculated to influence or to affect the deliberations of the House but in relation to court proceedings, whether they be civil or criminal, it is not necessary that the meeting or demonstration should be calculated to affect the deliberations of the court.  All that is necessary in order to render the meeting, demonstration or procession unlawful is that it should be relative to civil or criminal proceedings pending or at hearing in any court.  I feel that that puts the matter very far indeed. So far as I can see it means and states that if any meeting of any description, if any demonstration of any description, if any procession of any description is held which has any reference to civil or criminal proceedings, either pending or at hearing, an offence will be committed, and any person who takes part in any such procession, demonstration or meeting is liable, under the subsection, which I seek to have deleted from this Bill, to arrest without warrant and that notwithstanding that there is no limitation as to distance in regard to any such meeting, demonstration or procession.  Under the provisions of section 28 linked with the provisions of section 12 (8) it would be possible and open to the gardaí to arrest without warrant a person who attends a meeting in Cork or Mayo or Meath which has any reference to or connection with a court case listed for hearing in any of the courts sitting in Dublin, whether or not the case is actually at hearing, <Col N="752" /> because the phrase used in subsection (3) of section 28, is &ldquo;any public meeting, or procession in or through a public place, or demonstration in a public place by one person or by two or more persons, being relative to any civil or criminal proceedings which are pending or at hearing, shall be unlawful.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If a situation should arise in which people wanted to hold a public meeting or demonstration, even if the demonstration was by one person, even if that person was honestly and conscientiously convinced in his own mind that an injustice was being perpetrated in the courts, that proceedings were being brought of either a civil or criminal nature, in a manner in which a person or people were being victimised either because of religious or political beliefs or anything else, if that person uttered a single protest by way of demonstration, even though he might be 100 miles away from where the court was sitting, he would be liable to arrest without warrant under the provisions of subsection (8) of section 12.</P>
    <P>As I say, there is no limitation as regards distance such as there is in the earlier part of section 28 in relation to the proceedings of this House or of Seanad Éireann.  Not only is there no limitation as regards distance, but the demonstration, or criticism, or whatever it may be, need not be calculated to influence the mind of the judge, or to have any effect or bearing on the decision of the court.  Any reference good, bad or indifferent, to court proceedings, whether of a civil or a criminal nature, renders a person under subsection (3) of section 28 coupled with subsection (8) of section 12, liable to instant arrest without warrant.</P>
    <P>That is an enormous power for the Minister to ask us to give to the police force of this country.  I do not think it is necessary or desirable, and I do not think it is a power that we in this House should sanction.  If there were any reason for it, if an emergency situation had arisen which would justify the Minister in coming to the House and looking for special powers in order to deal with it, that would be a different position.  We would be considering it in emergency conditions and in an emergency situation, we could look at it through the eyes of <Col N="753" /> people living through an emergency, but that is not what is suggested here. What the Minister is asking us to do is to write into our permanent legislation this immense power of arrest without warrant in the circumstances which I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Since we last discussed this matter in this House I gather from a report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Monday, 5th May, that the Council of the Association of Irish Jurists have sent a memorandum to the Minister on this topic.  It is well that we should know what a body such as the Council of the Association of Irish Jurists think of the kind of provisions which the Minister asks the House to adopt. According to that report:</P>
    <P>The Council of the Association of Irish Jurists is of the opinion that, while some of the provisions of the proposed new Criminal Justice Bill will effect praiseworthy reforms, much of the new law would be to the detriment of the citizen.</P>
    <P>The Association considers the Bill to be an extension of the powers of the State, the police, prosecutors and administration.</P>
    <P>Then there is reference to the fact that the council forwarded a memorandum to the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>Declaring that it considered the powers granted to the Gardaí were too extensive in relation to arrests without warrant for breaches of the peace the Council comments:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The law has always recognised the dangers of permitting the arrest without warrant of a person for an alleged breach of the peace which the arresting officer did not witness.  This attitude of the courts is due to their recognition of the fact that &lsquo;breach of the peace&rsquo; is an ill-defined concept.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to get on to the part of the report which is relevant to what I am talking about now.  I can deal later with the views of the council regarding the provisions dealing with breaches of the peace which we have discussed to some extent already.  Later on in the <Col N="754" /> course of the report we find the following:</P>
    <P>Regarding the prohibition on demonstrations relating to civil or criminal proceedings, the Council feels that the right of freedom of demonstration and assembly would not infringe the right of every citizen to a fair and unprejudiced trial, if the prohibition should relate solely to demonstrations outside a half-mile radius of the court.</P>
    <P>In fact, as I pointed out, there is no limitation good, bad or indifferent as regards distance in the provision before us at the moment in section 28 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to make an offer to the Minister.  As reported at column 95, volume 240 of the Official Report of 29th April, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I know quite well that Deputy O'Higgins is well aware of the fact but it suits his purpose to shout: &ldquo;Wolf, wolf&rdquo; and particularly it suits his announced purpose, and that of his Party, of holding up the progress of this Bill.  Little cares he about the man with the flick-knife, little cares he for the man with the bicycle chain.  His only interest is a narrow political one&mdash;the hope that he can raise doubts in the minds of certain people outside this House and use them as political footballs.</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion by the Minister that I have no regard for the victims of flick-knives or bicycle chains.  The Leader of my Party, Deputy Liam Cosgrave, for years has advocated from these benches that legislation should be introduced in this House to control the use of flick-knives.</P>

      <P>I think it is due to the determined effort made by Deputy Liam Cosgrave in campaigning for such legislation that the provisions of sections 22 and 23 have been introduced in this Bill.  I want to make this offer to the Minister.  If he will bring in a new Bill or another Bill, a short Bill, containing sections 22 and 23 of this Bill&mdash;and I am fully authorised by my Party to state this&mdash;my Party are prepared to give him all Stages of such <Col N="755" /> a Bill in one day.  If he is not prepared to bring in such a Bill, we will do it for him, and we will see whether or not the Minister will oppose it.</P>
      <P>We are not prepared to accept this kind of curate's egg legislation, this package deal, with good and bad mixed up together, and to be told that if we do not accept the bad we will not get the good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not prepared, for the price of including in this Bill the provisions of subsection (8) of section 12, to be offered the Minister's package deal.  There are some provisions in this Bill that we want to see implemented.  If the Minister will introduce such a Bill we are prepared to give him all Stages without delay, but we are not prepared to agree to the provisions of subsection (8) of section 12 extending the power of arrest without warrant in the cases which are mentioned in Part IV of the Bill in relation to offences which will be created, if this Bill passes, under section 28 or section 29 or, as the Bill stands at the moment, under section 31; nor am I prepared to agree that the power of arrest without warrant, which the Minister proposes should apply to section 33 dealing with public meetings, should be given to the Garda authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister himself in dealing with section 33&mdash;I am not sure of this; it is some time since I looked at it but I think it is referred to in the <Col N="756" /> Explanatory Memorandum&mdash;pointed out that the provisions of section 33 in relation to public meetings are already contained in the Public Meetings Act of 1909.  The Minister is quite right; they are, and they are brought virtually word for word from that Act into section 33 of this Bill, with this fundamental difference, that under the law as it stands, under the Public Meetings Act, there is no power of arrest without warrant in cases where the Garda themselves do not witness a breach of the peace such as would be caused by disorderly conduct at a meeting.</P>
    <P>It is proposed via subsection (8) of section 12 to incorporate into section 33 authority to a garda to arrest without warrant on somebody else's information if there is disorder at a public meeting.  It is not necessary for the garda himself to witness the disruption, disorder, call it what you will. It is not necessary for the superintendent in the area to send men out to control, if control be necessary, a public meeting.  He will be authorised hereafter to act on the information of anyone who goes to him and tells him that so-and-so created a disorder at a meeting and he will be entitled to arrest without warrant.  He will not even have the trouble of going to get a warrant for arrest.  If this is carried I shall have some more to say later about the importance of its effect in relation to section 14 of the Bill, where the power of search without warrant will also be given via this section we are on at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that he would allow for change where he considered cases were brought against sections of the Bill which a wide cross-section of people feel should not be included in this legislation. Since there is widespread opposition in this House among Members of the Opposition to subsection (8) of section 12, would the Minister give an undertaking either to withdraw it or to give further consideration to some of the opinions expressed on it?  A case has not been adequately made by the Minister for this provision or for other provisions in the Bill, and in the absence of a case being made we are <Col N="757" /> forced to oppose this section.  No one should lightly suggest that the power of arrest without warrant be given over to the members of the Garda, and this is what is proposed.  It is also proposed in Part VI dealing with the requirements of a public meeting to give a very wide scope in relation to power of arrest without warrant.</P>
      <P>The case has been made here, and possibly will be made again in the course of the passage of this Bill, that to give very wide powers to a police force of any democracy must lead that force into disrepute and do the very opposite to what would be intended. Nobody can give exactly the background thinking which went into the composition of this Bill, but this is too fundamental a change to be brought in on the basis of a few scare stories about demonstrations in Dublin in the past year or two.  It is ironic that we should be discussing sections of a Bill designed to give unnecessary powers to gardaí and restricting the rights of public assembly when we know in another part of this country people have been opposing these restrictions tooth and nail over the past year.  Only last week in Dublin one of the MPs who was engaged in the campaign for civil rights in the northern area had reason to criticise the Minister's measure.  In view of all these circumstances would the Minister agree that if we are concerned for the standing of this Parliament this is the wrong time&mdash;it is wrong at any time but particularly wrong at this time&mdash; to bring in a Bill with such provisions when our own fellow countrymen have their backs to the wall fighting the Unionist administration in Belfast?</P>

      <P>Yes.  We are dealing with powers of arrest without warrant, and in Dublin last week Mr. Ivan Cooper addressed a meeting representative of all shades of political opinion and criticised this Administration for bringing in this Bill.  He said he regarded it as a stab in the back to the civil rights movement in the north of Ireland that this Government should bring in a Bill with these wild provisions at this period.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether he would consider withdrawing this provision.  He has made speeches over recent months in which he said the Bill we have before us is not in its final form, that he is ready to withdraw sections which, having listened to arguments in this House, he would himself feel should be withdrawn. I should be interested to know what the Minister has to say on this amendment and whether or not he is prepared to give way because we feel very strongly about it, strongly enough to keep talking about it for quite some time to come.</P>

      <P>The attitude from this side of the House is an attitude reasonably designed to get through this House a Criminal Justice Act which will command the support of the people.  No Criminal Justice Act that does not command the support of the people is enforceable by a constitutional Government such as we have here in the Republic.  Any Criminal Justice Act that this Oireachtas passes can be enforced, if the people understand it, because the Government of the Republic has a moral responsibility to enforce it.  I followed the arguments advanced by Deputy O'Leary, but I am bound to concede that some of the people speaking at these meetings were saying a great deal more than their prayers.  Nevertheless, I have considerable sympathy with them.  Deputy Michael O'Higgins and I are experienced practitioners in this House.  I would draw attention to the fact that we are now dealing with a Bill which has been two years in print.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are now two sheets of amendments to this Bill.  Mark you, one wants to be pretty skilled in the practice of this House to weave these two pages of amendments into the original text of the Bill and get a clear view of what the Bill will ultimately look like if some of these amendments are incorporated in it.  None of us knows with any degree of precision which of the amendments on these two sheets will be incorporated in the Bill. The Minister makes the case that this amendment is put down on the presumption that Part VI of the Bill will be the same at the end of the discussion on this Committee Stage as it now is, whereas the Minister says he has indicated on the amendment sheet that it will not be the same.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that, if our purpose is to carry a free people with us in such amendments to the criminal law as may be requisite to the situation obtaining in this Republic, the sensible course is to withdraw the Bill and incorporate into a new Bill the amendments the Minister intends to make, which are already printed on the amendment sheets, and any other alterations he may feel it requisite to make in the light of the discussion that has gone on so far.  Then we would all know what we were talking about and what is much more important, the people would know what we were discussing in this House.  The present situation is that nobody has any very clear idea of what it is we are discussing because, despite what the Minister said, we are entitled to proceed until we reach the Minister's amendment on the assumption that Deputy Michael O'Higgins's amendment is moved to the Bill as it at present stands.  One of the Minister's principal defences is that the Bill is not going to stand in that way when he finishes amending it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that within a very short period&mdash;early in June&mdash;we will have a general election and the prospect of this Bill passing all Stages, with the other business that will have to be transacted between now and the general election, is very remote.  Under our procedure, if it does not pass all Stages before then it will have to be dropped and it will have to be reintroduced <Col N="760" /> into the next Dáil.  I shall not be here to discuss it then, but I am suggesting to the Minister now that it cannot possibly make any difference to him to drop it now.</P>
    <P>Let us drop this blooming Bill.  It has got too riddled with amendments. It is incomprehensible.  Let the Minister agree with Deputy Michael O'Higgins in regard to flick knives and offensive weapons such as bicycle chains and so on, which the court might reasonably hold to be offensive weapons, having regard to the surroundings and circumstances in which they were produced or used, and let him bring in a short Bill to deal with these.  We will give it to him.  He will get it through the Oireachtas, I imagine, in one week and have it enacted into law before the general election.  There will be no quarrel on the more abtruse issues that we are at present engaged in discussing. But it is unreasonable to say to us here that we ought not to protest against very considerably expanded powers of arrest without warrant for the purpose of Part VI of the Bill we have before us, because on the Minister's argument, Part VI of the Bill is not what will be there by the time this Bill leaves the House.  I do not know whether or not that is, in fact, the case, but the Minister himself must recognise that it is for the purpose of the records.  We have got to challenge subsection (8) which Deputy Michael O'Higgins has moved to delete because, in our judgment, subsection (8) as incorporated in the original Bill is quite unthinkable.</P>
    <P>I know, and every experienced Deputy knows, what is happening. This Bill was drafted about two years ago.  I think Deputy Brian Lenihan was Minister for Justice at the time. Now everybody knows that if there is one mouth in the whole parish into which Deputy Lenihan, now Minister for Education, could put his foot, that mouth will be found by Deputy Lenihan and he will put his foot in it.  The last time he did that was on the occasion of the Succession Bill and, having got his foot inextricably caught in his own back teeth, he went down to Deputy John A.  Costello and asked him: &ldquo;Would you, for God's sake, extricate my foot because I cannot <Col N="761" /> do it&rdquo; and Deputy Jack Costello, to my mild indignation, took him by the hand, rewrote the Bill and said: &ldquo;The best thing you can do, Brian, is to drop the Bill you have and introduce a new Bill&rdquo; and, as far as I know, that new Bill was substantially drafted by Deputy Costello and Deputy Brian Lenihan came in here with the new Bill, which was passed into law after some discussion.</P>
    <P>In regard to the present Minister for Justice, Deputy Moran's facility for putting his foot in his mouth is not quite so notorious, but he has a habit of becoming like a bulldog; he has got his teeth into this blooming Bill and he is going to bully and batter his way through this House.  If you have a clear majority in Dáil Éireann it is, of course, physically possible to do that, but it is very bad Parliamentary procedure.  Over and above that, it is very bad public relations.  I think there are a great many perfectly decent people who are honestly bewildered, who do not understand that they are not still, in good faith, discussing the Bill as it was originally presented.</P>
    <P>The whole atmosphere of this discussion would be radically changed if the Minister now dropped this Bill and brought in a new Bill.  If the Minister dropped this and brought in a new Bill, I think he would probably get passage of the new Bill with reasonable celerity.  I feel embarrassed trying to argue the merits of this amendment because I think this amendment ought to be pressed by Deputy Michael O'Higgins, whether the original section or the Minister's proposed amended section is considered in relation to it.  However, there are other amendments here standing in the name of the Opposition which I think probably would be redundant if a new Bill were brought in, including the good provisions, about which we are all agreed, and an amended version of some of the other provisions about which there can be legitimate difference. I cannot see why the Minister will not do it.  I could understand it if he was in the embarrassing position of having brought this Bill in its original form to the Government and recommended it to his colleagues in <Col N="762" /> Government and was now constrained to go back to the Taoiseach and to say: &ldquo;This Bill was not well drafted. I should not have recommended it to the Government and I am now asking leave to drop it.&rdquo;  That is not the position.</P>
    <P>The position is that the Minister found himself inducted into the Department of Justice and carrying a Bill in which he himself declares he does not believe and which he himself said he would not bring to the House without undertakings given to the House to gut the Bill substantially in regard to Part VI.  We in the House understand the significance of such undertakings on the part of the Minister, particularly when they are sustained by a printed amendment, but 90 per cent of the people outside do not understand it. Mind you, it would have a most favourable reaction on the public mind if the Minister said: &ldquo;It is better to drop this Bill and to get this thing straightened out.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary referred to Mr. Hume and I thought he was going to refer to Miss Bernadette Devlin prancing about here in the Republic.  My advice to them is to demonstrate their prowess in the Six Counties and, if they are as effective in the Parliament of the Six Counties as is the Opposition in the Oireachtas of the Republic, we shall find solutions for our mutual problems much more expeditiously.  I do not believe we are confronted with the same problem as they are confronted with.  Miss Devlin is dealing with a Government which has no moral authority.  She is dealing with a situation in which the Government is an ascendancy Government.  We are not dealing with such a situation.  We are dealing with a legitimate Government. Our solicitude in this House ought to be to see that our people recognise that legitimacy and recognise that the natural tendency of an Executive to ask for excessive powers is prudently restrained by a representative Parliament in the Republic and that rational argument will carry conviction to the mind of a rational Minister.  Why the Minister for Justice does not accept that point of view, I cannot imagine. If he feels himself gravely embarrassed <Col N="763" /> by the lack of power to deal with offensive weapons, we shall give him that power in 48 hours.</P>

      <P>I urge him to re-draft this Bill and to bring it back to the House.  We need not have any long Second Stage debate on such a redrafted Bill.  We can amend it in Committee and differ, if we must differ, genuinely about certain matters and argue them exhaustively and take the judgement of the House upon them.  I urge most strenuously upon the Minister for Justice not to present the appearance of saying: &ldquo;Anyone who criticises this Bill is in bad faith&rdquo; because it simply is not true and he is only creating an atmosphere which is inimical to himself and to his own Party.  What does concern me is that the Minister can create an atmosphere which, in my judgement, can speciously be described by Mr. Hume or Miss Devlin as approximating to the attitude of the ascendancy Government of Northern Ireland.  So long as we continue on the basis of the present Bill, there is a kind of specious justification for that allegation.  I do not want that kind of publicity to be spread abroad about this country.  Especially, I do not want that fraudulent alibi to be used by the ascendancy Government in Belfast who, if they accept the version of Mr. Hume and Miss Devlin, come to be in a position of saying: &ldquo;Mr. Hume and Miss Devlin certify that the Minister for Justice in the Republic is asking for exactly the same powers as we are asking for here, no more and no less&rdquo;.  &ldquo;We do not claim to know,&rdquo; they will say; &ldquo;We are accepting the certificate of Mr. Hume and Miss Devlin who visited the Republic and discussed this matter with public men in the Republic and who tell us that the Minister for Justice there is looking for the very powers that we are asking for here&rdquo;.  I do not want that to happen.  I do not think it should happen.  I do not think it need happen. I think this is the amendment on which that issue ought finally to be determined.  I suppose the Minister feels it would be too revolutionary a gesture <Col N="764" /> to say here: &ldquo;Let us drop this blooming thing.  I shall bring in two Bills. One of the Bills I shall ask you to pass promptly because I need the powers at once to deal with offensive weapons.  The second Bill will be a re-draft of the general Bill at present before you.&rdquo;  The effect of that, I think, would be wholly beneficial not only upon our own people but upon our international reputation as a Parliamentary democracy.  I think that is a very precious position which Ireland at present occupies in the world.  It is in the power of the Minister to enhance it.</P>
      <P>I take no joy in having to be constrained to admit in public that Deputy Michael Moran, the Minister for Justice, had made a statesman-like gesture: I do not conceal the fact that I should be astonished if he did&mdash;but hope is the riches of the destitute.  Even if I am destitute in the presence of a Fianna Fáil majority in this House, I hang on to the riches of hope that, some day, some Fianna Fáil Minister may act in a manner approximating to sanity and, in that hope, I urge on the Minister to drop this Bill and drop the course of action suggested by Part VI.</P>

      <P>It would appear from what Deputy O'Leary said that he is not aware of the offer I made on the last day we discussed this Bill, which was to discuss each section in Part VI individually when the House comes to it and on a later stage to recommit amendment No. 8 for discussion again in the light of what may be decided on Part VI of the Bill.  That offer was not acceptable to the House and since that form of procedure is not acceptable I have no option but to press here and now for the subsection as it stands.  Obviously, whatever may be said about certain sections in Part VI, there are undoubtedly some sections in that Part in relation to which a power of arrest is vital.  Let us start with another of Deputy O'Higgins's misconceptions.  He was speaking about section 33 which deals with public meetings and he said, in effect, that this was conferring a power of arrest without warrant where the garda did not witness what had occurred.  Of <Col N="765" /> course, that is not so.  Section 33 states:</P>
      <P>(1)  Any person who at a lawful public meeting acts in a disorderly manner for the purpose of preventing the transaction of the business of the meeting shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>(2)  In a prosecution for an offence under this section, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is shown, that the meeting was lawful.</P>
      <P>That section is a re-enactment of the Public Meeting Act of 1908.  The Deputy's suggestion about a garda accepting somebody's word is totally and utterly misconceived in this connection. The garda who makes an arrest has got to be in a position to charge the arrested person and, therefore, has to have his evidence ready and give that evidence.  It is, incidentally, rather peculiar that while I am accused of hindering public meetings, I am also accused of acting wrongly in giving the police power to interfere and stop people from breaking up meetings, which is what it would appear I am accused of here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 12 (8) &ldquo;A member of the Garda Síochána may arrest without warrant a person who, after warning, refuses to desist from or continues conduct which the member has reasonable grounds for believing to be an offence under Part VI of this Act&rdquo;. Last week, before the debate on this Bill was adjourned, Deputy O'Higgins had referred to the power of arrest without warrant as it would apply under section 32, which is the section dealing with watching and besetting. Again, that is a re-enactment of existing law.  The Deputy suggested that, if the Bill had been enacted at the time the offices of the Department of Agriculture were being picketed by farmers, those concerned could have and would have been arrested without warrant under the section so as to prevent what Deputy O'Higgins referred to as the orderly protest carried out at that time. Now, for the record, I want to point out that Deputy O'Higgins is utterly wrong in this contention also.  If it had been desired to put a stop to the picketing engaged in at that time by <Col N="766" /> members of the farmers' organisation, that could readily have been done under section 28 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, which empowers the Garda to prohibit by notice meetings or processions in the public street within half a mile of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Alternatively, the Garda could have prosecuted those concerned under section 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, the relevant provision of which is being replaced, almost word for word, in section 32 of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There would have been no difficulty in obtaining warrants for the arrest of those engaged in the picketing.  In fact, section 32 is designed to deal with an entirely different type of situation.  In the main, that section is aimed at the watching and besetting of private individuals.  This is something which has been unlawful since 1875 and, in all probability, even before that.  It is something about which I would have thought there would be no disagreement in this House.  If I understand Deputy O'Higgins correctly, he objects to the Garda having power to arrest without warrant a person committing an offence under section 32.  I would ask the Deputy and the House to consider what would be the practical alternative.  Let us suppose someone who does not like the Deputy decides to watch and beset his private house with a view to compelling him to abstain from participating in an important debate here in the House.  Naturally, the Deputy would be outraged and he would telephone the Garda to come and remove the source of this annoyance and threat so that he could go about his lawful business. The Garda tell him: &ldquo;We will have to proceed by summons.&rdquo;  This procedure is going to take several days, at the very least, by which time those committing the offence may well have achieved their purpose.  I ask the Deputy to say honestly whether he would be happy with such a situation. Whatever about Deputy O'Higgins, Deputies as a whole would not be happy with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="767" /> The section is intended to deal with the watching and besetting of people anywhere they may happen to be.  For instance, if certain people do not like the colour of a man's skin they could watch and beset him not alone at his house but at his place of employment. When Deputies relate these two sections, one providing this power to prevent the break-up of public meetings and the other providing the power to stop people watching and besetting individuals, the need for subsection (8) is quite apparent.  These are two important provisions of Part VI in relation to which the House as a whole, when Members come to consider them, would certainly insist on a power of arrest without warrant being provided.</P>
    <P>Let me say for the record, and I will deal again with this on the proper section, that there is no comparison whatever between the powers in this Bill and those which are already in existence and being sought in Northern Ireland.  I am not going to pursue that hare here and now, but when we come to the section dealing with public meetings I will make the position abundantly clear.</P>

      <P>I wonder would the Deputy stand over many of the statements made by the same people.  I am not concerned with what they say for their particular purposes.  I am concerned with facts, and the facts are as I say and as I shall satisfy the House when we come to the relevant section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon and I think Deputy O'Leary referred to the question of amendments.  I would point out that I have already accepted an amendment from Deputy O'Leary's Party for the purpose of clarifying the meaning of an earlier provision.  I have also introduced amendments to spell out and clarify the intentions in a number of other sections and, when we come to the particular sections if an ordered and reasoned case is made on any point in connection with them.  I shall be prepared to listen to it.  I have done <Col N="768" /> so since the Bill came to the House. I have, in fact, introduced amendments to meet some objections that were raised.  I have accepted an amendment which the Deputy's Party considered to be necessary.  I know we can be going back and forward between Part VI and this particular subsection for a long time.  The fact that the subsection is in this particular form does not mean that the House will be committed to every line in every section in Part VI when we come to discuss those provisions. I made an offer to recommit Deputy O'Higgins's amendment on the next stage but that was not accepted by the House.  Whatever may emerge from our discussion on Part VI, it is clear that there are some sections in that Part in which this particular power is, in my view, essential.  When we come to discuss these sections I believe this view will, in the main, be accepted by the House.  Therefore, as this amendment stands, I cannot accept it for the reasons I have given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say which are the sections in Part VI in which he considers subsection (8) to be essential without going into the matter too far?  I know the difficulties of doing this but I should be glad if he would indicate the sections he has in mind, where this specifically applies, if that is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view this power should be there in respect of the whole of Part VI with the exception of sections 30 and 31.  Under the new section 30 which I am proposing in a later amendment, no question of an offence will arise.  In the new section 31, on the other hand, provision is made for certain offences for which penalties are prescribed under a later section in Part VI but it would not be appropriate, nor do I seek, to have any power of arrest without warrant in connection with offences.  I have brought in an amendment to subsection (8) of section 12 to make that clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is entitled to make the best possible case in defence of this provision.  He disputes the argument I made in <Col N="769" /> regard to public meetings and he gave the correct date of the Public Meetings Act which is 1908; I think I said 1909.  I made a case and he seems to think I am wrong.  If so, I should like to know precisely where I am wrong.  I made the case that the position as obtaining at present under the 1908 Act is that any person who at a lawful public meeting acts in a disorderly manner for the purpose of preventing the transaction of the business of the meeting is guilty of an offence.  That is the position at present and that is the provision which appears in subsection (1) of section 33 of the Bill.  I say there is a vital distinction between the two in that at present there is no power of arrest without warrant in relation to the offence under the Public Meetings Act of 1908 except in the case where a member of the Garda sees the disorder and decides that it is a breach of the peace and, witnessing a breach of the peace, he is then entitled to arrest without warrant.</P>
      <P>I further make the case that under section 33 (1) of the Bill it is not necessary for a member of the Garda to see the disorder at a meeting; that he is entitled to act on information supplied to him by somebody else. I should like to know where I am wrong in making that argument and if I am wrong, well and good.  The Minister can satisfy the House that that is so.  He has not satisfied me so far.  He has referred&mdash;quite rightly &mdash;to the wording of section 12 (8) which is that &ldquo;a member of the Garda Síochána may arrest without warrant a person who, after warning, refuses to desist from, or continues conduct which the member has reasonable grounds for believing to be an offence under Part VI of the Act&rdquo;.  I am relating that for the moment to section 33 in Part VI of the Act.  The Minister seems to deduce from the wording of section 33 and the wording of subsection (8) of section 12 that a garda must witness the disorder at the meeting because he must be in a position to make a charge if he makes an arrest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that follows; it may be what the Minister intends.  I intended to raise specificially the wording of the <Col N="770" /> subsection on subsection (8) later; I might as well do it now.  It is: &ldquo;A member of the Garda Síochána may arrest without warrant a person who, after warning, refuses to desist from or continues conduct....&rdquo;  That warning need not be administered by a garda.  It could be a warning administered by anyone as the subsection stands at present.  As I see it&mdash;the Minister can show me if I am wrong where I am wrong&mdash;if I am presiding at a public meeting and somebody interrupts I can warn him.  If he persists in interrupting after being warned by me anybody may then inform the Garda and the Garda are entitled to come and arrest him without warrant. Is that not the position under the proposals contained in this Bill?  It may not be what the Minister intends should be the position but what will be interpreted by the courts is what is in the Bill when it becomes an Act and not what the Minister or any other Deputy intends.  So, in order to trigger off this power of arrest without warrant under subsection (8) all we are saying is that a person should continue in a particular course of conduct after warning.  It does not say who is to give the warning or that it must necessarily be given by a garda.</P>
    <P>The Minister then referred to the Offences Against the State Act and the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act of 1875 in order to demonstrate that in relation to the pickets placed on the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries some time ago by farmers that there was power there to deal with such picketing.  I agree the power is there under the Offences Against the State Act and under section 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act of 1875 and I am content that that power should remain as it is under the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875.  I would even be happy to some extent to see the provisions of the Offences Against the State Act&mdash;section 28, oddly enough, of that Act&mdash;also incorporated here instead of the provisions in section 28 of this Bill.  I think it is better that this should be dealt with by ordinary legislation rather than that picketing or meetings within half a mile radius <Col N="771" /> of Leinster House should be regarded as offences against the State.</P>
    <P>But, again, there is this vital distinction between the power the Minister now seeks and the powers that are there already in the Offences Against the State Act or the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, that while the powers are there, and powers quite adequate, to deal with such a situation as picketing of Government Departments, it is necessary for the Garda to get a warrant if they want to arrest the picketers and what the Minister is doing now is providing in this Bill that the gardaí can arrest in such circumstances without any warrant. That is the important distinction, as I see it, between the powers that are there already and the power which the Minister wants to incorporate in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister, again, in relation to section 32, which is the section dealing with watching and besetting, falls back on a line of defence that I am quite sure is perfectly <i>bona fide</i> but which to my mind just cannot stand up in court. The Minister says that what is aimed at in section 32 is watching and besetting a private individual.  I am quite sure that that is what is intended but that is not what it says.  Again, there is no reason to my mind why section 32, if passed by this House, should not apply exactly to the situation which arose here some time ago when the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries was being picketed by Irish farmers, who were doing it in an orderly way. I repeat that because the Minister seemed to challenge me on it arising out of what I said here last week. They picketed the Department in a perfectly orderly way, a perfectly orderly manner, in pursuance of their demands.</P>
    <P>I think that the remedy so far as this Bill goes is what has been urged here by Deputy James Dillon and I know that there is great truth in what he says because I have heard discussions of this Bill and even though I am violently opposed to some of the proposals in this Bill I felt called upon on occasion to defend the Minister.  I have heard <Col N="772" /> people discussing this Bill and saying that the Bill is going to do so-and-so and so-and-so and it might have been to my political advantage to let that idea run on but I had to pull it up and I said: &ldquo;Yes, that was the Bill as originally introduced but the Minister intends proposing amendments which will materially alter that.&rdquo;  There is chaos and confusion in the minds of the people with regard to the Bill as it stands.  There is a great deal of public uneasiness with regard to the Bill as it stands.</P>
    <P>Some of the proposals which the Minister is introducing in relation to Part VI and the amendment No. 9, which is being taken with amendment No. 8, will mitigate the severity of the measure as drafted but that has not got home to the people.  I attended the meeting in the Mansion House last Friday to which Deputy O'Leary referred. I was not speaking at it but I went along to hear the views of the speakers with regard to this measure. I want to say to the Minister quite frankly that there is a tremendous volume of public feeling against this Bill.  It was quite clear to anyone who attended that meeting that that volume of public opinion against the Bill exists.  The Minister would be wise to adopt the suggestions that have been made to drop the Bill completely and to come in with a new Bill dropping a number of the objectionable sections, dropping in particular the extension of the power of arrest without warrant.</P>
    <P>I was surprised when the Minister intervened that he did not comment to the House with regard to the submissions which have been made to him by the Council of the Association of Irish Jurists in relation to this measure and in relation in particular to what I was speaking about regarding section 28&mdash; the extension of the power of arrest without warrant into section 28 in relation to civil or criminal proceedings.  I think I am not wronging him when I say that the Minister was completely silent with regard to the case made in connection with section 28 and I do want to get the Minister's views on this and to try to draw from him what his intentions are with regard to section 28.</P>
    <P>We have already heard from the <Col N="773" /> Minister on section 32 as to what he is aiming at.  I do not think what he is aiming at is the only thing being captured under section 32.  That is the whole trouble about a Bill of this sort. I want to find out now from him, in fact, what he is aiming at in subsection (3) of section 28 because, remember, the power of arrest without warrant is being imported into section 28 by means of subsection (8) of section 12 and subsection (3) of section 28 is the portion of this Bill which is making it an offence for any public meeting, procession or demonstration to be held which is relative to any civil or criminal proceedings either pending or at hearing and the case I make on that is that that, as the Bill stands, will be applicable regardless of the distance involved, will be applicable regardless of the nature of the discussion or demonstration that takes place. If any reference is made to a civil or criminal proceeding which is listed for hearing even though not actually at hearing, if any reference is made even though it is not intended to influence, even though it is not calculated to influence the court or the consideration of the case or the proper conduct of the case, the person who makes that reference, provided, of course, he gets a warning from someone&mdash;it need not be from a garda&mdash;and continues, will be liable to arrest without warrant by virtue of subsection (8) of section 12.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister is that so or is it not so.  If it is so, and I believe it is so, then subsection (8) of section 12 imported into subsection (3) of section 28 of this Bill is setting a very dangerous precedent.  It is giving enormous and dangerous powers of arrest without warrant.  I do not think the Minister referred to that at all when he spoke some while ago.  I invited him to do so because I think that this is a section that is of paramount importance to our consideration of this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say that section 32 of this Bill would substantially repeal the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875.  The Minister should show some understanding of this.  I could <Col N="774" /> understand that if, when I looked at the Schedule, I found that the Minister had repealed the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act of 1875, as he proposes to repeal a long list of archaic statutes.  But when I look at the Schedule, as it appears on page 41 of the Bill, I find he is not repealing the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act of 1875.  He is repealing only paragraph 4 of section 7.  It seems reasonable for a Deputy, who is not in a position to read through a list of repeals which must run into three figures and must consist of more than 100 repeals, to ask the Minister why he repealed paragraph 4 of section 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act.  Section 32 of this Bill does nothing except to lengthen a paragraph in the Minister's own Schedule.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister find himself justifiably impatient with people outside the House who find it difficult to understand that problem?  I find it difficult to understand.  I could quite understand the Minister saying to us here: &ldquo;We wanted to get rid of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act of 1875 because 95 per cent of that Act is no longer applicable, but we wanted to preserve one provision in it which prevented the unlawful besetting of an individual for the purpose of preventing him from going about his lawful occasions&rdquo;.  However, that is not the position.  The Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act of 1875 remains fully enforced except in respect of paragraph 4 of section 7.  That paragraph of the 1875 Act cannot contain much more than what is contained in section 32 of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Regarding section 32 of the Bill and the rest of Part VI that we are arguing about, section 32 does no more than put back into our law what was already there.  The Minister ought to explain why it was necessary to put in section 32 at all when he could have achieved the same purpose by omitting paragraph 4 of section 7 in his Schedules of repealed Statutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins complains that I did not deal with the submissions made by the Association of Irish Jurists.  I did not deal with them <Col N="775" /> for the simple reason that, in my view, it would be irrelevant to deal with them on this particular amendment.  We are not now discussing section 28 and I will deal with the submissions when we come to that particular section.  I only heard from the Association two days ago after their submissions had gone into print.  On the Second Reading I dealt in detail with what we are aiming at in section 28 as to the stopping of the recent but pernicious practice of mounting demonstrations to intimidate the courts.  When we come to that particular section I will again deal with this matter fully.</P>
      <P>I thought it would be accepted in this House, as it is accepted in every other democracy, that the courts must be allowed to do their business with-out-being intimidated and without fear or favour.  In fact, this House has passed a law which prevents newspapers from publishing reports of cases that are pending.  I should imagine that it should be clear to everybody in this House that we cannot afford street trials in this democracy if it is to survive, that we cannot allow our courts to be intimidated about a case before it comes off and that it would be utterly wrong if the rights and wrongs of a particular case, be it criminal or civil, could be the subject of public controversy and discussion prior to its coming before the court and the judge.</P>
      <P>I am sure that when we come to that particular section all Deputies in the House will see how essential the section is.  I do not propose to deal further with it at the moment.  Deputy O'Higgins asked me what was the purpose of it.  I set it out fully in my Second Reading speech and I shall deal fully with it when we come to the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins also asked me to say where he was wrong in dealing with section 33.  When I said he was wrong I meant that he was wrong in saying that the police could act on any story by another person.  The police can do no such thing under that particular section.  They must have their evidence and a person must refuse to obey a request to leave the meeting. They could not arrest on the story of <Col N="776" /> anybody else as suggested by the Deputy unless they saw evidence there that a criminal offence had been committed&mdash;for instance, if they found a person whose skull was split open and they were informed that such a person did it.  They would have to have evidence to justify making an arrest and I keep on saying that part of the legal process is that a charge follows the arrest.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins seems to have some doubts about what is meant in the subsection as it stands.  The subsection states very clearly that:</P>
    <P>A member of the Garda Síochána may arrest without warrant a person who, after warning, refuses to desist from or continues conduct which the member has reasonable grounds for believing to be an offence under Part VI of this Act.</P>
    <P>It appears to me to be as plain as a pikestaff that the person who gives the warning must be the garda we are concerned with in this section.  If the Deputy has any doubt about what I think is quite clear already, I will have that aspect of it examined between this and the next Stage of the Bill.  I have made the intention clear in what I have said.  I cannot get the meaning Deputy O'Higgins seems to read into it but, as I say, if on examination I find there is any doubt about my interpretation of it or the Deputy's I will have it examined.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Dillon was concerned about paragraph 4 of section 7 of the 1875 Act.  The point is that paragraph 4 of section 7 of the 1875 Act is a provision dealing with a certain type of public demonstration.  Part VI of the Bill was intended to get all the demonstration provisions into the law together.  That also is the reason justifying the repeal and re-enactment of the Public Meetings Act, 1908.  This is a consolidation measure bringing us up to date with the criminal law.  The purpose of bringing those sections in was to have the relevant provisions of the law dealing with demonstrations and meetings all in the same Act and in the same Part.</P>
    <P>Finally, as Deputy O'Higgins has come back to this, let me repeat for <Col N="777" /> the record that the picketing by the farmers could have been stopped under either of the two provisions to which I referred.  Might I also point out it is not necessary to get a warrant under the 1939 Act in a situation of that kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I draw the Minister's attention to this.  In regard to the Public Meetings Act, 1908, he repeals the whole Act.  He presumably has brought back into section 6 whatever part of that Act he feels ought to be retained in the criminal law.  When we come to the Prevention of Crimes Act, 1906, he has thrown aside the whole Act.  He has in fact repealed only paragraph 4 of section 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act of 1875.  Therefore, the whole of that Act continues to be law with the exception of paragraph 4 of section 7. What I cannot understand is, if paragraph 4 of section 7 said no more and no less than section 32, what was the necessity of repealing paragraph 4 of section 7 and enacting section 32?  I can understand the other case because the Minister was getting rid of the whole Bill, wiping it off the criminal calendar, but retaining the necessary part.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The short answer, of course, is that the Act deals with many other matters besides this particular one.  The rest of the 1875 Act is not relevant to the provisions of a Criminal Justice Bill.  It is not relevant so far as this Bill is concerned.  On the other hand the whole of the 1908 Act, to which I have referred, is in section 32.  It dealt solely with public meetings and consequently it was all repealed and we have it here.</P>

Surely the first part of section 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875 would in many ways be far more relevant to a Criminal Justice Bill than Part IV, which is the part he is repealing and re-enacting in this Criminal Justice Bill?  Section 7 of the 1875 Act says:</P>

    <P>All of those remain unrepealed.  They are not coming into this Bill.  All that is being repealed and coming into this Bill is Part IV which then goes on:</P>

    <P>That paragraph 4 is being repealed.  It is coming into the Criminal Justice Bill we have before us.  Paragraphs 1,2 and 3, which I have read out, are not being touched.  They are not coming into this Bill.  Neither is paragraph 5 of section 7 of the 1875 Act coming into this Bill.  This reads:</P>
    <P>Follows such other person with two or more other persons in a disorderly manner in or through any street or road.</P>

      <P>It is quite simple really, as I already explained to the House. This particular section deals with what I would call demonstrators.  There may be two, three or four of them publicly watching or besetting a house.  That is why this provision is being re-enacted. As I have already explained to the House, these are &ldquo;demonstration&rdquo; sections&mdash;the law on meetings and demonstrations, generally speaking.  We are <Col N="779" /> not here re-enacting the whole of the criminal law.  We are not attempting to do that.  This particular provision is being re-enacted and so also is the 1908 Act, which deals with public meetings and demonstrations, because it was felt desirable to have all the different laws dealing with this matter in the one Act and in the one Part of that Act.</P>

      <P>I was delighted to hear my colleague, the Minister for Justice, giving an explanation regarding the powers of the Garda to arrest without warrant because this part of the Bill has been completely misrepresented outside.  It was implied at a meeting at which I was present recently that, if a garda did not like you, he could arrest you on the street.  I have listened very carefully to the various arguments since I came into the House this evening.  I heard people allege in Ballymun on Thursday night that a garda could arrest and charge you with something if he did not like the colour of your hair.  I said this was not so at all, and gave an explanation of the section.  We have a situation in Dublin where fellows have flick-knives and injure people.  The injured people are afraid, even in their own homes, to give evidence against the people using the flick-knives on them.</P>

      <P>We want our people free to walk through city and country without interference.  I am delighted the Minister has given this explanation.  I would be glad if the Minister would go even further and tell us the circumstances under which the Garda can arrest and so contradict the misrepresentation of this Bill made outside.  I know the Minister is an able legal man.  He is a democrat who would not give such powers of arrest to the Garda except in exceptional circumstances, perhaps in cases of rows or threats.  The house of a public man may be picketed because of the way he voted in this House or because of a statement he made about a particular organisation.  I believe such protection is necessary.  The people most <Col N="780" /> anxious to condemn this section of the Bill are people who have no respect for the law.  Statements were made in Ballymun that night which would be out of order in any democracy, or even in a dictatorship.</P>
      <P>If by this Bill we can help in any way to preserve the freedom of our citizens in city and country we will be contributing something worthwhile to society.  In parts of my area certain sections of the people have circularised others condemning us as undemocratic and dictatorial.  These people want a free-for-all.  Some of these people have very little respect for law or order themselves.  The idea of representing us as going even further than they have gone in Northern Ireland is completely wrong.  There is great freedom in this country.  People can insult Deputies and even Ministers and get away with it.  I am delighted to be here tonight to hear the Minister's explanation.</P>

      <P>One way or another, we are all delighted to be here tonight.  So far as the Bill is concerned, we all have a duty to see that this &ldquo;best of all possible worlds&rdquo; in which Deputy Burke is so happy to be living will continue to have some of its best and most bearable features.</P>
      <P>Section 8 will mean that some features of this &ldquo;best of all possible worlds&rdquo; which we enjoy could disappear. We cannot look on this Bill with a black and white polarity of views.  We cannot say that, on one side, we have parties with flick-knives who want to see anarchy installed in the country and city and, on the other, people like Deputy Burke who trust the Minister's good wishes and the good wishes of everybody all around and hope that everything will be for the best in this &ldquo;best of all possible worlds&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As members of this House we must look on the dark side of this Bill and see what might happen through court interpretation of the provisions of this Bill.  We are in a difficulty on this amendment because the Minister indicates he is willing, if we are willing, to let the thing go for the moment, and to relate it later to Part VI.  In Part <Col N="781" /> VI the Minister indicates that he would consider each section and listen to arguments as they are put.  Part VI is the centre of hysteria in this Bill. Whether we like it or not, there is a hysteria involved in the creation of this Bill.  The Minister has indicated that he is prepared to explain the basic motivation behind Part VI when we come to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister said we cannot have street trials.  This country, like every other country in Europe, has had its share of demonstrations and counter-demonstrations over the past year. Every democracy in Europe has had them.  There is no need for the House to become hysterical or to think that the fabric of democracy is breaking up because of group marches here or there.  The democracy which cannot survive with people marching does not have much confidence in its own future. I have confidence in the future of this democracy.  We are not safeguarding democracy here by making a hysterical response to such manifestations by young or old people.  There are many such demonstrations in European countries today; they have been a feature of these latter years of the 1960s.  Anyone who appreciates what democracy is about should welcome the fact that nowadays people feel more strongly about matters relating to politics and the conduct of State policy.  I welcome the widest possible interest in public affairs among people who previously had little interest in them.  Many times in this House we have discussed young people having no interest in the world around them.  We have spoken of young people having various vices.  We must welcome this interest in public affairs as a new development.  I hope that every young person in this country will continue to march for what he considers to be social justice of one kind or another.  This Parliament does not earn respect for itself as an assembly of people devoted to giving the country the best legislation if we react hysterically to the occurrences of the past year.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;bicycle chains, the lot.  There are good sections in the Bill which none of us has any quarrel with, but there are ominous sections which all of us are worried about and our concern does not arise because of recent circulars from this or that group.  It arises from our honest examination of the provisions of the Bill and our consideration of the way they can affect this democracy and the conduct of justice in general.  The Minister has said he is willing to consider subsection (8) later in relation to Part VI.  That is all very well but we do not know the Minister's mind on Part VI, which seems to me to contain totally unreasonable provisions.  The Minister says he will deal with the matter we are now discussing when he comes to Part VI.  He says he will tell us all but we are in the position of having to guess about what he means by telling us all.</P>
      <P>Why should the Minister not deal with subsection (8) now?  Why not withdraw it at this stage and, perhaps, re-introduce it when we come to Part VI when he comes to explain that part of the Bill?  This would be fairer to the people who are opposing the Bill in good faith.  When we come to Part VI, the Minister can give us the complete facts and convince us of the necessity for that Part.  It will take some convincing but the Minister seems to think we can be convinced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="783" /> The Minister has said that the parts of the Bill which we have been opposing cannot be compared with the Unionists' Public Order Act in Northern Ireland but spokesmen of the Unionist administration have used against civil rights spokesmen the fact that these provisions which we are opposing are being brought in in this Bill by the Dublin Government.  This has been a serious embarrassment to Six County civil rights fighters.  That should be remembered.  It shows extraordinary insensitivity to their problems in the North that we here should be pressing on regardless with this Bill at this time especially when we have said that we have no quarrel with the parts of the Bill relating to such things as offensive weapons and to which Deputies from all sides of the House have referred and on which they have suggested there should be legislation.</P>
    <P>The legislation we have got in this Bill would impose serious limitations on the liberties of our people and this means, in effect, that we are caught in the dilemma of having to oppose the Bill as it stands, even if some good sections must go with it.  The Minister has said he is willing to accept amendments which he considers to be near to the point which he wishes to arrive at. He must be aware of the volume of criticism coming from people throughout the country who do not have much interest in political parties.  He must be aware that wildfire opposition to this Bill is growing throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We do not wish to have an election fought on our differences on this Bill but this is what we will have if the Minister does not rapidly realise that we are concerned with getting good legislation.  I am far more concerned that we do not pass legislation which will be a threat to the liberty of individuals throughout the country.  There is a hysterical heart in this Bill and that hysteria is included in Part VI.  The sections which carry this hysteria include that dealing with arrest without warrant.  All this goes back to Part VI and it is on that part of the Bill that the Minister says he will give us the full facts which, he has said, made it necessary to bring in such a Bill.  I <Col N="784" /> repeat my request that the Minister withdraw this subsection and if necessary re-introduce it when we are discussing Part VI.  Otherwise we cannot continue the discussion on a constructive level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few points arising out of what the Minister and Deputy Burke have said. On Deputy Burke's intervention, we should all be clear that the opposition to this subsection has nothing to do with flick-knives or other offensive weapons.  It has nothing to do with keeping our city free for people to walk through it, or anything like that. Any discussion on offensive weapons will be on sections 22 and 23.  As I said earlier&mdash;Deputy O'Leary has confirmed this from the Labour point of view&mdash;we are willing to give the Minister all Stages in one day of a Bill to legislate on the matter of offensive weapons.</P>
      <P>That is not what we are discussing here.  We are now discussing the power of arrest without warrant and its extension into Part VI of the Bill.  One of the sections in Part VI is section 28 which deals with public meetings, processions or demonstrations within half a mile of the place where the Oireachtas is sitting and with such meetings or processions being relative to any civil or criminal proceedings which are pending or at hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke on the subject of civil and criminal proceedings and the Minister's reply was that none of us wanted intimidation of the courts&mdash;that we could not afford to have street trials. Nobody disagrees with the Minister on that point.  In our approach to this matter, we are not advocating that intimidation of the courts should be allowed, that street trials should be allowed, that mob rule should prevail, but we are questioning the wisdom of and the necessity for extending the power of arrest without warrant in the circumstances suggested in section 28 (3).  The wording of that subsection, when taken in the context of power of arrest without warrant, is far too wide. The Minister has met me to some extent in relation to my arguments in section 23 on the matter of public meetings: he said he is prepared to <Col N="785" /> have examined between now and the Fourth Stage the wording of section 12 (8).  I am grateful for the Minister's undertaking to do that but I am afraid it does not induce me in the slightest to withdraw the amendment to delete subsection (8) and it does not induce me at all to minimise in any way the opposition which I feel is rightfully being made against this subsection. Subsection (8) reads:</P>
    <P>A member of the Garda Síochána may arrest without warrant a person who, after warning, refuses to desist from or continues conduct which the member has reasonable grounds for believing to be an offence under Part VI of this Act.</P>
    <P>The point in question is that it is not spelled out that the warning must be given by a member of the Garda Síochána.  The Minister thinks that that is the intention.  From his point of view he seems convinced that that is quite clear.  I do not think it is.  It is not said in the subsection and to my mind if a warning is given by anyone, in particular circumstances, that is enough to trigger off the operation of that subsection.  I gave the example of a public meeting where an interruption is made and where the chairman warns the interrupter.  I think that once that is done it can be said that under the subsection as it stands the necessary warning has been given and that if a further interruption is made from the same source then anyone may inform the Garda and the Garda may arrest without warrant the person who has interrupted because he has continued after warning.  However, the Minister has agreed to have that examined.</P>
    <P>That does not get over the difficulty as I see it in relation to section 28 with regard to civil or criminal proceedings. Subsection (3) of section 28 as the Bill stands lays down that:</P>
    <P>Any&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  public meeting, or</P>
    <P>(b)  procession in or through a public place, or</P>
    <P>(c)  demonstration in a public place by one person or by two or more persons,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="786" /> being relative to any civil or criminal proceedings which are pending or at hearing, shall be unlawful.</P>

      <P>Subsection (8) of section 12 is the subsection which imports into section 28 of this Bill the power of arrest without warrant and I feel the House is entitled to consider, indeed, I believe the House is obliged to consider, the circumstances under section 28 where the power of arrest without warrant may be exercised. The point I am making is that if a meeting, procession or demonstration relative&mdash;and that is the important word here&mdash;to any civil or criminal proceedings is held then the power of arrest without warrant under subsection (8) of section 12 becomes operative. I do not think it should become operative and that is one of the reasons why I am moving that subsection (8) should be deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="787" /> The Minister has dealt with this on the basis of saying that we cannot allow intimidation of the courts&mdash;I agree with that; that we cannot allow street trials&mdash;I agree with that; that we cannot allow our courts to be intimidated&mdash;I agree with that, but this refers to any public meeting, procession or demonstration relative to any civil or criminal proceedings either pending or at hearing.  It refers to any of these, relative to any civil or criminal proceedings, no matter where the meeting, procession or demonstration takes place.  There is no limitation as to distance.</P>

      <P>The point I am trying to get to, if I am not interrupted by the Minister or if there are no further interventions, is that the phrase here is &ldquo;any civil or criminal proceedings which are pending or at hearing&rdquo;.  One would assume, and I imagine the Minister assumed when he presented this section to the House, that that necessarily refers to court proceedings which are either being heard in court or which are listed for hearing in court.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to find, Sir, the extent to which it is being suggested that this House should give the Garda Síochána power to arrest without warrant.  That is the purpose of my query to the Minister.  Is the power of arrest without warrant, for example, to <Col N="788" /> be given in the case of a protest raised by someone because a Land Commission notice has been served with regard to the acquisition of property, that proceedings in the Land Commission court are thereby to be put under way?  Is that not a civil proceeding?  If there is a protest against that by the owner or by anyone else is this House seriously going to give the Garda power of arrest without warrant because such a person makes a protest?  Can the Minister assure me that is not captured by reason of section 12 (8) in its relation to subsection (3) of section 28?</P>
      <P>Let us examine this a bit further. The Minister is a lawyer.  There has been a system in operation here for some years now of fines-on-the-spot.  If the Minister or any Deputy of this House or anyone outside the House finds on his car a sticker that he is to be fined on the spot and if that person protests against it, is he liable to arrest without warrant on the basis that there are civil or criminal, as the case may be, proceedings initiated by the service of the notice?  I am sure the Minister did not intend this but surely that is a case that must be answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is asking us under subsection (8) of section 12 to give the Garda the power of arrest without warrant in cases which come within Part VI of the Bill.  Part VI of the Bill includes section 28 and it includes civil and criminal proceedings in the manner provided for in subsection (3) of section 28.  Surely the House is entitled to know from the Minister whether, if the House decides that power of arrest without warrant should be imported into Part VI of the Bill, in section 28 (3) the phrase &ldquo;any civil or criminal proceedings&rdquo; is broad enough to capture cases such as I have mentioned, cases concerning Land Commission notices being served, or notices by local authorities or health authorities, notices under the Health Act, sanitary notices in regard to buildings, and notices under the Factory Acts.  Surely they come within the terms of civil proceedings at least if they are warning notices, notices warning that, unless a certain course of action is taken, prosecution will follow. There are also demolition notices.  I <Col N="789" /> want to know about this from the Minister&mdash;I am quite serious about this; it is very relevant to this subsection&mdash;whether he is now suggesting that in these cases, although unintentionally, power of arrest will, in fact, be given to the Garda.  I am quite sure the Minister does not intend it but I want to know is it possible.</P>

      <P>I hope we will have sufficient information from the Minister to deal with it fully and adequately by the time we do reach it.  So far as I am concerned, the position is that under subsection (8) of section 12 provision is made for the importation into Part VI of power of arrest without warrant.  Unless I am specifically ruled out of order by the Chair, I propose to examine, in relation to this amendment, the various sections which comprise Part VI of the Bill and to try to ascertain, for the clarification of the position, and for the benefit of Deputies of the House and people outside it, just how far the Minister suggests we should go in carrying through these powers of arrest without warrant.</P>
      <P>Subsection (8), as I said, provides that &ldquo;a member of the Garda Síochána may arrest without warrant a person who, after warning, refuses to desist from or continues conduct which the member has reasonable grounds for believing to be an offence under Part VI of the Act&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>It has already <Col N="791" /> been pointed out to the Minister by other speakers that there is a definite and very sustained and very serious volume of opinion against this Bill and that this is one of the provisions which has given rise to it.  The Minister dealt with a point raised by Deputy Dillon with regard to section 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875.  This relates to the provisions to which are extended the powers of arrest without warrant as regards, I think it is, section 32 in Part VI of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The case the Minister made was that the reason why only paragraph 4 of section 7 of the 1875 Act was being repealed and re-enacted in this Bill was, as I understood him in any event, that he was gathering together particular provisions which dealt with a particular type of demonstration and that paragraph 4 of section 7 of the 1875 Act dealt with demonstrations of the particular kind to which the Minister referred.  I want to ask the Minister if this is so, does not that also apply to Part V of section 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875?</P>

      <P>The ruling I asked for from the Chair was on dealing with the point made by the Minister. If I am ruled out on that I will leave it.  One of the objections which I have made to this matter is that I think the things the Minister is seeking to confer on the Garda, powers of arrest without warrant, are not matters which should properly be dealt with in a Bill of this sort.  That, let <Col N="793" /> me say to the Minister, is the reason I was not prepared to fall in with his suggestion to deal with this amendment as we dealt with a previous amendment.  It was not intended in any sense to be from discourtesy to the Minister that that refusal was made. It is because I take a particular view of the matters which have been introduced into this Bill that I am not prepared to oblige him in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put it on the record as clearly and as emphatically as I can that neither under the provisions of this Bill as introduced nor under my suggested amendments is there any proposal to restrict in any way the right of legitimate public meeting, public procession or public protest. Deputy O'Leary makes this assertion here to-night and gives us a lecture on the desirability of allowing young people to protest.  There is nothing about that in this Bill at all.  What I was referring to when I spoke of street trials was not any ordinary protest meetings but demonstrations or meetings designed to influence a case that was pending before the courts or at hearing before the courts.  It was in that connection I referred to street trials and mock trials.  Lest somebody might think, with all the misrepresentation that has gone on about this Bill and having listened to Deputy O'Leary's words, that we are dealing here with the type of protest he is talking about, let me say we are not and that it has nothing to do with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as Deputy O'Leary talks about telling all when I come to these particular sections in Part VI of this Bill, &ldquo;telling all&rdquo; are Deputy O'Leary's words, not mine.  As far as I am concerned I told all in my Second Reading speech and covered all these sections very thoroughly.  What I have said to the Deputy and to the House is that when we reach that stage of the Bill I shall listen to any reasoned argument about these sections, that if there is any doubt about their interpretation I shall clarify them; that if I see reasoned argument for amending these sections I shall deal with them in the same way as I have dealt with the Labour Party's amendment which I have already accepted and the <Col N="794" /> amendments we have dealt with so far for the purpose of clarifying various provisions.  I do not intend to follow Deputy O'Higgins into the realms of fantasy he has conjured up in this House for the purpose of obstructing this Bill.  I do not intend to chase the hares raised by the Deputy as to what is the meaning of these sections, particularly the sections dealing with intimidation of the courts.  He can raise those hares again when we come to the section but I shall not assist him in wasting the time of the House in that exercise.  On this amendment he has repeatedly gone over everything that is in the Bill and has used the amendment for the purpose of dragging out the discussion.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister let us know if, since the matter was first raised, he has had any further view on the question of who must give the warning under subsection (8) of section 12?  I know the Minister has made clear what his intention is but as the subsection stands it is not clear that the warning has to be administered by a member of the Garda Síochána, and, if we pass this subsection as it stands, taking the words of the subsection at their face value, the warning can be administered by anyone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In case the Minister may have overlooked it, we are still on section 12.  I am proposing amendment No. 10 in respect of section 12 (9).  As presented, subsection (9) reads:</P>
      <P>For the purpose of arresting a person under any power conferred by this section, a member of the Garda Síochána may enter (if need be, by force) and search any place where that person is or where the member, with reasonable cause, suspects him to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am suggesting in this amendment that we should add to that subsection the words &ldquo;provided that if it is reasonably practicable to do so he shall first apply for and obtain a search warrant&rdquo;.  I urge the Minister to accept this amendment. Its purpose clearly is to provide in respect of the garda who proposes to search and who, under the terms of the subsection, would have authority to use force for the purpose of effecting an entry to a place that may be a person's private house or any type of building that that power will not be used if it is possible first to obtain a search warrant.  All I am suggesting here is the addition of the words which would impose an obligation on the garda, if reasonably practicable, first to apply for a search warrant before entry by force to a particular place is effected by him for the purpose of <Col N="798" /> making the arrest contemplated by this subsection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>What is involved in this subsection is a power to search a house for the purpose of making an arrest.  It is not, and it does not include, a power to search the house for goods or to carry out an examination of the contents of the house.  This will be clear from the wording of the subsection, as the Deputy has already read out.  But the matter is put beyond any shadow of doubt by the provisions of section 18 which lays down the general rule that a search authorised by this part of the Act shall not be carried out to any greater extent than is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which the search is authorised.</P>
      <P>To put it another way, he can only enter after his man without a warrant for the purpose of effecting the arrest. What is involved, therefore, is a right to go in and have the kind of general look-around that would be needed to establish whether a person was hiding or was in the building.  In this very limited context, the question is whether it is reasonable or necessary to impose the restriction suggested by the Deputy. I suggest it is not necessary.  On the contrary, I feel that it would be most undesirable in its implications.  We are dealing only with cases where, by definition, so to speak, circumstances are such that prompt arrest is necessary. Of course, the power of arrest can readily be frustrated unless the gardaí have a power of entry for the purpose of effecting the arrest.  Once one concedes the power of entry one must logically concede it without the qualification which the amendment would make.  If the garda could go for a search warrant, as suggested by the amendment, he could equally well, and at the same time, ask for a warrant of arrest, because the issuing authority is the same in both cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment envisages an arrangement that would be altogether wrong, namely, that a garda would go along for a search warrant for the express purpose of enabling him to make an arrest without a warrant.  This could never be justified.  I would ask Deputies to remember that in this day and age we have highly organised crime <Col N="799" /> and travel facilities whereby criminals can get on a plane and disappear out of the jurisdiction in a matter of hours. Consider the position of a garda who sees one of these wanted men, perhaps, in the middle of the night, entering some building&mdash;a man whom he knows is wanted for a crime.  If the garda chases that man there and then, and the criminal rushes into some building or house, the garda is in a hopeless position if he has to look for a peace commissioner to swear an information for the purpose of effecting the arrest. We all know quite well that, by the time the garda returns, his bird will have flown and may have committed many further crimes before he is finally apprehended.  This is the reason for giving the gardaí the power proposed here.  I suggest to the Deputy that his amendment would hamstring that power and make it ineffective.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of this provision is to ensure that the garda will not be frustrated by a wanted man escaping from him into a house.  If he had to go to look for a warrant&mdash;particularly if he saw the wanted man entering certain premises at night&mdash;there would be little hope of his apprehending the wanted man.  For these reasons I suggest that the Deputy should not press this amendment.  As I say, in these circumstances, this power of instant arrest is very essential for the effective control of crime and criminals by the gardaí.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister has considered fully the wording of the amendment and what is suggested in it.  It would seem to me, and possibly this is borne out by words used in a previous section, that the various examples which the Minister gave of when it would be necessary in the interests of justice to enter without warrant were all cases where it would not be reasonably practicable for the gardaí to obtain a warrant.  For example, the Minister made the case that if a wanted person was seen entering a building at night it would not be possible to get a warrant. That is exactly the kind of situation that is accepted in my amendment. <Col N="800" /> What I am trying to do, and I would not mind if the Minister met me in another way, is to lay down guidelines so that the power of entering private houses, public buildings, church property or other buildings of that sort, will not be arbitrarily open to be used possibly by a raw member of the force.</P>
      <P>I do not for a moment suggest that it would be normal practice, or the desire, or that there would be any encouragement to members of the garda by their authorities to use the power in any arbitrary way, but when we are legislating here we should as far as we can lay down guidelines in relation to this kind of matter.  After all, it is a very wide and very broad power that the section seeks to give member of the force simply because, as may happen under the subsection as it stands, the member of the force has formed a suspicion that on that piece of property or in that particular building a wanted person may be found.  It is probably a necessary corollary to giving that power that the member of the force should also have the authority to use such force as might be necessary to make the entry, but when we are giving it we should try to lay down guidelines as to when it would be proper to enter without a warrant as provided for in the section and when it would be proper first to obtain a search warrant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will recall that in subsection (4) of this section which deals with the power of a garda to arrest without warrant in certain circumstances where the garda is satisfied a person has committed an offence involving a breach of the peace and so on, one of the limitations imposed on the power of arrest without warrant of the garda is that it has not been reasonably practicable for him to apply for a warrant.  I am suggesting that exactly the same provision should exist in relation to this power of searching without a warrant.  Most of the objections which the Minister raised would be cases where it was not reasonably practicable to obtain a warrant but if the Minister feels that the use of the phrase which is a repetition of the phrase used in subsection (4) would be too strong and that it would hamper a garda in times of emergency, I do not mind if it is altered or modified as long <Col N="801" /> as we try to lay down the guideline which should be followed.</P>
    <P>This is of some importance.  It is not as important as other matters in the Bill.  As the Minister pointed out, this is a power which properly, so to speak, concerns the question of crime and crime detection and it is concerned with the whole process of bringing a person who has committed a crime to justice, of arresting him and bringing him before the courts.  For that reason I do not regard this subsection as being a controversial one in the way I regarded subsection (8) as being such.  I am not trying to force acceptance of the amendment on the Minister just as it is drafted but I feel fairly strongly that there should be a guideline.  If the Minister is prepared to suggest any other form, or to undertake the drafting of some modification which would satisfy him will not hamper unnecessarily the gardaí at a time of emergency, I would be quite happy about it.</P>

      <P>There is just one point about which I should like to inquire of the Minister.  It is stated that for the purposes of arresting a person under any power conferred by this section a member of the Garda Síochána may enter and search.  It struck me that as the power conferred by this section would be a power to arrest without warrant what would be the position of a member of the Garda Síochána who did have a warrant, who, perhaps, saw a fugitive enter a certain premises, but whose warrant might not cover entering that premises for the purpose of searching for him and arresting him?  Would it not be better, because of the obvious necessity of giving this power, to extend it to a garda who had a warrant as well as one endeavouring to make an arrest without a warrant?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that we are getting confused in this subsection by regarding the subsection as involving an additional power of arrest.  This is purely a provision enabling a member of the Garda Síochána to enter, if need be by force, and search a place.  The only reference to an arrest is that he is doing this for <Col N="802" /> the purpose of arresting a person but his power of arrest as such is not contained in the subsection but in another subsection.  We could simplify matters if we confined ourselves, correctly to my mind, to the right of entry, if necessary by force.  That is the whole purpose of this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Deputy O'Higgins certainly raised it because he was saying that the powers of arrest under subsection (4) were qualified by the provision that it must not be reasonably practicable to apply for a warrant. To my mind the provisions of subsection (4) are already applicable to an arrest carried out after an entry and search carried out under this subsection (9).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt but I think the Deputy missed the point.  All I said was that in relation to subsection (4) which deals with arrest, there was this modification and I was suggesting a similar modification in relation to the power to search without a warrant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>But in a number of cases there is power to arrest without a warrant which is not so qualified.  I think subsection (9) is purely a subsection giving the right of entry and search and I cannot see any objection to it, while I can see everything in favour of it.  Obviously, where a garda already has power to arrest either by warrant or by statute under this Bill when it becomes an Act, he must not be prevented from apprehending a culprit through not having the right of entry, if necessary by force, to search a premises.  I think we are confusing the issue if we bring the question of arrest into this.  It is only a question of whether we should allow a member of the Garda to enter and search the premises, if necessary by force, where he has good reason for believing a man who should be arrested is hiding.</P>

      <P>The whole point in this amendment again is an attempt to limit the wide area of discretion which <Col N="803" /> every section of this Bill apparently gives members of the Garda.  Presumably, the intention of the amendment is to seek some kind of guideline which will limit unrestricted powers in this area.  Deputy Booth may say that there are sections of the Bill concerned with arrest without warrant.  To these we are opposed because of this arbitrary use of Garda authority.  Possibly, it is difficult to get the correct drafting that will allow the discretion, necessary discretion in some instances, to search premises, but at the same time it is important that an attempt be made to limit such a search and, if possible, have it accompanied by a search warrant. However difficult it may be to achieve, we must not be lulled by simplicity because the most disturbing sections of this Bill are simple and easy to understand, but they are pretty alarming in their results as regards the ordinary citizens and their liberties. Presumably, it is the intention of this particular amendment that the gardaí should, by reason of our legislation, be in such a situation that, in fact, they would be required, wherever practicable or possible, to obtain a search warrant before following up their just suspicion and entering premises.  All of us who treasure privacy and private property and individual rights of citizens will know that we must not lightly relinquish a position in which it is impossible for any forces of the State to enter a premises in any part of the country without going through all the due procedure wherever this is practicable and possible.  As Deputy Booth well knows, our Party are very concerned about protecting private liberty and private property.</P>

      <P>Possibly Deputy Booth misunderstood the argument I made on this subject.  It is quite clear that we are dealing now with the question of power to search without a warrant.  Earlier we dealt with the power to arrest without a warrant.  I do not think there will be any serious disagreement in the general proposition which Deputy Booth made that where a garda has the power of arrest&mdash;certainly where he has a warrant&mdash;that he should have whatever other power is <Col N="804" /> necessary to execute the commission to arrest.  Two things are involved here. As Deputy O'Malley pointed out, this section&mdash;I am talking of the section now and not the subsection&mdash;so far as arrest is concerned deals only with the case of power to arrest without warrant and accordingly subsection (9) deals with the power to search without warrant in cases of arrest without warrant.</P>

      <P>No.  I think Deputy O'Malley's point is right.  The case of power to search where there is power to arrest with a warrant may be covered by other section later.  I may be wrong and Deputy O'Malley may be wrong but, as I see it, the point made by Deputy O'Malley is a good one.  This section deals with power to arrest without warrant.  This deals with the power to search without warrant in cases of arrest without warrant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">

      <P>If the Deputy reads subsection (9) he will see that it says: &ldquo;... for the purpose of arresting a person under any power conferred by this section ...&rdquo; the power of arrest conferred by this section is the power of arrest without warrant.  I think that is Deputy O'Malley's point.  The only reason I referred to subsection (4) which deals only with one of the cases of power to arrest without a warrant&mdash; that is the case of a breach of the peace &mdash;was because there it was thought proper in drafting the Bill to provide that in relation to such cases the power to arrest without warrant would only apply where it was not reasonably practicable to obtain a warrant.  I am suggesting here that we should also lay down a guideline similar to that when it is a question of entering a person's property for the purpose of arresting a person without a warrant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would argue in the same way even if the Minister were to assure Deputy O'Malley and myself that this power also applies in the case where there <Col N="805" /> is a warrant.  I should also argue then that here you have a question of entering on property and that we should only, so far as we can, seriously contemplate that being done without a warrant in cases where, for one reason or another, it will not be reasonably possible or practicable to obtain a warrant or where a situation has arisen where, if the garda has to delay in order to get a warrant, the &ldquo;bird&rdquo; will have flown.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's argument on that point and, as far as I am concerned, if there is a guideline laid down I should feel reasonably happy about it.  I cannot imagine Deputy Booth feeling happy.  If there is a knock on his door some night and on opening it he finds a garda there who says: &ldquo;I think someone who has broken the peace has got in through a window of your house&rdquo; or &ldquo;You let him in through the front door and I want to search the house.&rdquo;  I think Deputy Booth's immediate reaction would be to say: &ldquo;You may search provided you show me a warrant to search&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

I do not think that situation is likely to arise between reasonable people and the guards having reasonable cause but I do think it would be a valuable safeguard if we could write into this section some kind of protection.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputies refer back to the Explanatory Memorandum they will find what was envisaged by this subsection.  It really is to clear up some doubts in the existing law.  In reply to Deputy O'Malley, let me say that the existing law allows entry in the case of a warrant but that we are dealing in this section only with arrest without warrant.  The existing law allowing entry by force in the case of arrest under warrant remains undisturbed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins's amendment gives me some difficulty from another point of view and that is the point of view of its interpretation.  In view of what I have said about this section, the power of instant arrest, or instant entry to effect an arrest, is very necessary because otherwise the bird would have flown.  Deputy O'Leary starts talking about someone being suspected.  What we are concerned with here is a wanted criminal who is seen to enter a place and the power is for the purpose of arresting that man.  In due process of law, when arrested, he must be charged.  This is what I would like to explain to the Deputy.  There are wide powers of arrest already vested in the Garda Síochána and it has not been suggested, for instance, that there have been any abuses.  Why assume that the garda will act <i>mala fide</i> and not <i>bona</i><i>fide</i>?  The law is there for long and <Col N="807" /> many a day that any garda, any police officer, can arrest anybody on the suspicion of stealing one penny.  He has a power of arrest without warrant there.  I am only saying this to remind Deputies of other powers that are there in this particular context.</P>
    <P>But what I want to get down to is the practical position that a garda may find himself in if he spots some criminal who has been on the wanted list possibly for quite a while and who possibly has been out of the country. He may see him some night entering a premises, may get a glimpse of him going in.  How can he make up his mind as to whether it is practicable to apply for a warrant in such a case? He has no way of knowing whether the man is going to remain in the building or move out five minutes later. It is always practicable, I suppose, to apply for a warrant if the garda takes the chance that the wanted man will stay there long enough for him to come back with the warrant and make an arrest.  It is never practicable in the present context for a garda to take a chance.  In my view, the chance he takes depends on what the other man may do and does not depend on anything the garda has knowledge of.  The position is that he sees the wanted man, he sees the criminal, entering a house or building.  He has not much time to consider whether it is practicable to get on his bicycle and chase a peace commissioner, when the wanted man may be on the plane within half an hour, nor has he time to speculate whether the wanted man is prepared to sit there and wait for him to come back with his warrant.</P>
    <P>Let me again emphasise that this is a power where instant action by the garda is necessary to apprehend wanted criminals.  Let me also say that there is a general instruction to the Garda always, if possible, to apply for a warrant.  The Garda authorities regard that procedure as the desirable one.  However, it is one thing to have such a general instruction issued to the Garda Síochána but quite another matter to try to write it into this subsection, to put this fetter on the garda's efforts to apprehend his man when he sees him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="808" /> Deputy O'Higgins has suggested to me that I might have another look at this to see if any amended version of the wording of his amendment could be acceptable.  I certainly will undertake to do that.  What I am emphasising to the Deputy here is the practical position of a guard or detective officer who suddenly sees a wanted man and the decision facing him as to whether it is practicable for him in these circumstances to take the chance of letting his man escape and to go off looking for a warrant.  If Deputies appreciate that the man must be a wanted man, that the power of entry here without warrant is tied up with the power of arrest which is part of the process of bringing a charge, then they will see the necessity for ensuring that the garda is not frustrated in his efforts to chase the criminal and take him in.</P>
    <P>However, as I have said to Deputy O'Higgins, I will have a look at his suggestion.  Certainly, I am satisfied of this: I could not accept his amendment in its present form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see that in view of the case the Minister makes. I will not press it in view of the Minister's undertaking but it does seem to me that if qualified in some such way as to allow the opinion of the garda to be paramount it would probably mean, if it was not reasonably practicable in the opinion of the garda, then he need not do it&mdash;or some such thing as that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As the subsection stands, a member of the Garda Síochána may enter and <Col N="809" /> search any place where the person is or where the garda, with reasonable cause, suspects him to be.  Take the case of a member of the Garda Síochána going to the door of a house and the suspected person answering the door and the member of the Garda Síochána arresting the person there and then proceeding to search the house. I know that section 18 to some extent covers this aspect of the matter. Nevertheless, that protection should be embodied in the subsection because, as it stands, it not only gives the Garda Síochána discretion to arrest without warrant and to enter the building without warrant but it also gives them discretion to search the building without warrant and as it is worded here the building may be searched even if the arrest has been affected beforehand.</P>

      <P>I regret that I find it necessary to raise the subject matter of Question No. 26 on today's Order Paper on the Adjournment.  I am charitably-minded enough to interpret the Minister's reply as arising from his not being in full possession of the facts.</P>
      <P>Question No. 26 asked the Minister why there is such a long delay in sanctioning the extension of the Gortmore-Banteer water supply scheme. We did not require any money from the Department for this scheme.  At the end of last year, our assistant county manager informed the committee of the county council dealing with water schemes that it was anticipated there would be savings on current schemes and that, in his opinion, that money should be used to complete some small schemes.  The amount of money left was not very great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the committee had discussed the matter they agreed unanimously with the suggestion of the assistant county manager and they requested their chief engineer to make some recommendation on the matter.  He eventually recommended that the money could usefully be expended on <Col N="810" /> this small scheme, the Gortmore-Banteer water scheme, and he also suggested that, perhaps, some of the money could be used for the headworks of the Castletownroche water scheme.  The Castletownroche scheme was subsequently sanctioned.</P>
    <P>The recommendation of the engineer that the rest of the money should go towards extending the Gortmore-Banteer scheme was forwarded to the Department of Local Government for sanction on the 21st June, 1966.  A letter was addressed to the Department on the 25th November, 1968, requesting sanction so that the anticipated savings of capital moneys from schemes sanctioned in 1968-69 could be used on the suggested scheme. At that time, Castletownroche was excluded, as it had already been sanctioned. The scheme in question would link up two other schemes, Gortmore and Banteer, and that is how it got its name.</P>
    <P>To our surprise, we have not heard since from the Department.  The Minister, in his reply today, said that the matter was not on the priority list.  We accept that but there are a great number of people there who would welcome piped water.  It was originally anticipated that the amount of money required for the scheme would be about £7,000, but I understand that it would only cost about £5,000.  It is extraordinary that the Minister cannot see his way to sanction this.  I appeal to him, even at this late stage, to give his sanction to the scheme while the money is still available.</P>

      <P>The Order Paper every day shows signs of the extraordinary conversion of the main Opposition Party to this whole idea of regional water schemes.  I find it very satisfying but, at the same time, rather amusing to see this new found enthusiasm of Fine Gael for these schemes which, when they were being pushed by my predecessor some years ago, were described in such contemptuous terms by the then Leader of Fine Gael.  I shall quote from a speech made by Deputy Dillon, when he was Leader of the Fine Gael Party, which shows what the mentality of Fine Gael was with regard <Col N="811" /> to the idea of piped water in rural areas at a time when we in Fianna Fáil were endeavouring to have the idea accepted by local authorities.  On the 22nd November, 1962, Deputy Dillon is reported at column 1641 of volume 197 of the Official Report for that day as having said:</P>
      <P>I am very much troubled about this whole question of piped water supply.  I heard a Deputy from Kerry announce today that for a restricted area in Kerry a piped water supply had been formulated, the capital cost of which was £2,500,000. He went on to say that the rates are already almost £3 in the £ and he foresaw some difficulty in accepting this proposal.  I am, I am quite convinced, as radical as any Deputy, but surely there is some sanity left amongst us.  Does anybody who knows rural Ireland, and the way the houses are situated there, seriously believe that an effective way of bringing water supplies to the houses of rural Ireland is by laying mains along the main roads?</P>
      <P>He went on to say:</P>
      <P>If we are to build water mains along every main road in Ireland, we will have a blister on the rates, a blister of very formidable dimensions ...</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon continued:</P>
      <P>Surely we can get a sane approach to this whole business.</P>
      <P>Further down in the same column we read:</P>
      <P>Outside of Bedlam, would anyone propose to lay down on all the roads in all these areas water mains which, according to the calculation of the Deputy from Kerry, are liable to involve a capital cost of £2,500,000 for one very relatively small area covering an area of 25 miles all around the shortage of supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the opposition of Fine Gael at that time, my predecessor's efforts were successful and local authorities took an interest in the matter and pushed ahead with the scheme to the extent that we now have schemes in planning to a total <Col N="812" /> cost of between £60 and £65 million. I frankly admit that it is not within the capacity of the people of this country, either from the financial aspect or from the point of view of physical capacity, to carry out all these schemes immediately.  In the ten-year period from 1959-60 to 1968-69, despite Deputy Dillon's prognostications, schemes to the value of £25 million have been completed and the total value of schemes at present in progress is £10 million and, as I have said, schemes are in planning to the value of between £60 and £65 million.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that under this Government I can get an increasing capital allocation every year from the Minister for Finance for this purpose. But I cannot get sufficient to do £60 or £65 million worth of work in the one year and, even if I could, the constructional capacity is not in the country to carry out such a programme.  Although I can get an increasing amount every year, the schemes in progress will obviously take some years to complete. Surely, then, the obvious thing to do is to arrange to have those schemes put into order of priority and to have selected in the different local authority areas those schemes which are most urgent from the point of view of the necessity to provide houses and industries and those schemes which will give the greatest immediate benefit? Who can put the schemes in order of priority better than the local authorities?</P>
    <P>In order to decide on which schemes should be allowed to start in any one year I asked every local authority in the country to draw up an order of priority.  Cork County Council did this and placed 33 schemes in order of priority.  The scheme about which Deputy Burton is complaining was not in that list of 33.  Surely, then, it would be foolish to take a scheme that the local authority did not consider in the first 33 and to do it before those they placed higher in the order of priority?</P>
    <P>Deputy Burton claims that this scheme could be done out of money saved from the allocations for the year 1968/69.  It is a fact that it was reported there would be savings amounting to £7,250 out of an allocation of £60,000. The suggestion put forward was that <Col N="813" /> with this £7,250 the Castletownroche water supply scheme, which is estimated to cost £31,000 and the Gortmore-Banteer water supply scheme, which is estimated to cost £12,500, should be done out of the estimated saving of £7,250, schemes totalling £43,500.  In fact, my Department authorised the starting of the Castletownroche water scheme but the final turnout of the financial year was not that there was a saving of £7,250 but that there was an extra expenditure of £23,000.  Therefore, instead of £52,250 being spent out of £60,000, there was in fact £83,000 spent in all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="814" /> As I said, the only logical way to deal with this matter is to arrange the schemes in an order of priority and this is more appropriately done by the local authority.  In this case Cork County Council did not allocate this particular scheme any place at all in the order of priority and I can certainly see no justification for taking it ahead of schemes that the local authority, who are competent to decide, believed were much more urgent than this particular scheme.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 8th May, 1969.</P>
