      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I spent some little time analysing what has been happening within the CIE organisation since its foundation and analysing the assessments made by the different Ministers for Transport and Power with regard to the organisation.</P>
      <P>We find that the record is a rather painful one.  It is a record of blunders in so far as ministerial sanction is concerned, the ministerial sanction of Mr. Lemass and of Deputy Childers.  We must examine every item of CIE policy before voting this £2,650,000 which we are told will tide the organisation over until 1974.  If this will tide them over their difficulties until 1974 it is reasonable to assume that we shall not have the same opportunity of examining the records of CIE and the records of the Minister for Transport and Power during the next five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To find out what has happened to CIE it is not necessary to go back too far.  In fact, it is only necessary to go back to 1958 when we got a definite assurance from assessments made by the then Minister for Transport and Power and the management of CIE <Col N="1018" /> that the organisation would break even by 1964 and that there would be no need for further subventions from the pockets of the tax-paying community.</P>
    <P>What has taken place since that statement was made in 1958 is that CIE have chopped off 747 miles of railway line and they have done this in the most dictatorial manner possible. They told us this is what they must do, that the railway lines were non-profitable and would have to go and that, when that took place, CIE would carry out their activities in a business-like way and would not be dependent on the public purse in the future.  The length of railway line that was taken away&mdash;747 miles&mdash;was a relatively large percentage of the line as it then existed: in fact, it was about 30 per cent.  One would expect to get as sound and business-like an assessment as that from Portlaoise or Grangegorman.  We could foresee that CIE would not pay their way but yet the Minister vehemently maintained that they would and that there would be no question of continuing subvention.  In one of his remarks in this regard, the Minister mentioned that subsidies encouraged exclusive staffing and featherbedding.  The Minister mentioned that officers in charge of State-sponsored bodies are featherbedded. They are featherbedded as against the man in charge of his own family business or against the managing director of a small company.  There is featherbedding and we must be careful that this is not abused.  They must account for their stewardship. It is all right to talk about nationalisation and to set up bodies such as Bord Fáilte, the ESB and CIE and hand them over to managements and make them autonomous bodies with little or no accountability to this House.</P>
    <P>That is why I am speaking on this Bill.  We must set up a committee of the House in view of the wrong assessment made so far as CIE are concerned, in view of the many blunders which were made and are made and in view of the many statements, which were completely out of plumb, from the former Minister for Transport and Power, Mr. Lemass and from the present Minister for Health, Deputy Childers, while he was in charge of <Col N="1019" /> the Department.  Their assessments could not be more off the mark.  They did not listen, as is usual with Fianna Fáil Ministers, to Opposition statements here in regard to CIE.  They refused to listen and Deputy Childers, when Minister for Transport and Power, in connivance with the chairman and management of that body, would not listen to anyone.  They were not going to meet county councils, corporations or anybody.  They were infallible; they knew everything; they knew how to make CIE pay for themselves and they knew how to relieve them of the necessity of going to the taxpayers for subventions to keep them going.</P>
    <P>We are being asked to continue paying £2,650,000 a year for the next five years to enable CIE to continue their activities.  I maintain we must have, and that this House must demand, an assurance from the Minister that we can pry into their activities much more closely and examine whether there is mismanagement in any sector of the company. We must be assured that each sector is operating carefully and efficiently. I cannot say, and neither could any of the Deputies here last night who were passing bouquets all over the place to CIE, say they are.  What knowledge have they that I have not as to the efficiency or otherwise of CIE? We are not getting any reports.  We are not entitled to information here as members of this House so how can we assess the position?</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that CIE enjoy a monopoly so far as transport is concerned, despite the fact that they cut out the lean pieces and retained the fat pieces, they cannot continue under their own steam without seeking the aid of public funds.  It does not matter whether a company is nationalised or not there is an obligation on it to work efficiently.  When substantial injections of public funds are made there is an obligation on us here to find out everything about that company.</P>
    <P>I mentioned here last night the headaches of many people running family businesses.  I am a firm believer in the idea that State bodies and <Col N="1020" /> even private concerns should suffer such headaches to ensure that they balance their books and keep afloat. Merchants and shopkeepers have to be watchful of their accounts.  They are not featherbedded like CIE.  For CIE it does not matter because the Government will pay.  The management of CIE do not go to bed with headaches; they do not go to bed with bankruptcy staring them in the face. This measure fully ensures that irrespective of whether you work efficiently or otherwise you are guaranteed that your pay cheque will arrive.</P>
    <P>On the 14th November, 1962, we had the statement from the Minister for Transport and Power about the featherbedding of CIE.  He referred to people in non-productive employment &mdash;I do not want to go over that again as I dealt with it last evening&mdash;and said that if every £ of public money injected into CIE was used in some other productive direction it would give more and better type of employment. That is in the Minister's statement of 1962.  If there is any doubt I will give his exact quotation.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Minister he has certain qualifications.  One of his qualifications&mdash;unfortunately, he possesses qualifications which do not entitle him to hold the posts he has held and which he continues to hold&mdash;is his honesty. Last night he told us that he made those statements in good faith.  I accept that he made those statements, particularly the 1962 one, in good faith but they did not portray a man who had much foresight.  Looking at those statements now there is no indication that Deputy Childers had the qualifications for the post he held in 1962.  In making such a statement I do not wish to reflect on Deputy Childers in any way personally.  I am quite satisfied that he is an honest man and a man of the highest integrity but I am satisfied he did not possess the qualifications for the ministerial office he held.  Unfortunately, he had this attribute of not listening to us.  I gave him ample advice at the time, as did others, on this side of the House but he would not listen to it.</P>
    <P>We have, however, to assess that part of his statement in which he indicates <Col N="1021" /> the inadvisability of having people in non-productive employment when productive employment could be provided in some alternative way.  I am inclined to agree with that but we have no knowledge&mdash;perhaps the Minister has &mdash;of the non-productive employment which obtains in CIE.  If there is employment of a non-productive type we should be made aware of it.  The 1962 statement seems to indicate that the Minister believed there was a good deal of non-productive employment within the organisation, that it would be much better to cut that out, cut out the subsidies, make them pay their way and then put the money thus saved into some productive source to give alternative employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There was non-productive employment in those useless, minor railway lines which had to be closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister closed 747 miles of line since 1958.  I want to remind the House of that fact again. Where is the subsidy?  What is happening now.  What about Mr. Lemass's statement of 1958 that when the railways were closed they would break even, that there would be no need of subventions here?  What about your statement in 1962 that CIE would pay their way&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is repeating himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and would become a viable, economic body, standing on their own feet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsidy would have been much greater if these lines had not been closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I said to the Minister in my opening statement that he was very fortunate that Mr. McGilligan is not a Member of this House at present because all of us, knowing Mr. McGilligan's technique, know he would have gone down to the Library and brought up 14 volumes and would have choked the Minister with his sayings about CIE.  I must add that his contribution would not have been less than five <Col N="1022" /> hours and this would have been justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>He would also have choked Deputy Morrissey and the late and esteemed Deputy Norton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The Minister has had his opportunity but he has not said anything to that effect in any recent statements.  I just took up the first book on transport and the statements were all similar.  I was waiting to hear if I and others were wrong and if the Minister, with all the facilities at his disposal&mdash;statistics, the Pacemaker Report and other reports&mdash; could possibly be right and these subsidies could be wiped out.  In debates in 1958 I endeavoured to advance the view that CIE, in addition to providing a transport service, should also provide a social service.  The Minister took issue with that; he did not agree that CIE, a body receiving subvention from taxpayers, should provide a social service.  He said it was a business service, that it was bound to act in an efficient and economic manner and where there were lean patches in any section they should be wiped out; hence the big surgical operation that did away with 747 miles of railway line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to know from the Minister when this money is passed, as undoubtedly it will be, what additional information will be placed at our disposal? Shall we get more information on the working of CIE?  Will we be told what is happening in each sector? Is the Minister satisfied that everything is running smoothly and efficiently in this body that has a monopoly of one of our principal services? Let us take the case of a private person with a lorry, with no merchandise plate, living in the country who is trying to make a living for his wife and family.  The Minister may say he is stealing business from CIE but as far as CIE is concerned it is a dead loss in south Cork.  From Cork city southwards we are completely cut off and have been put into the wilderness and if we require lorry or transport services we have to fall back on the small private man.  How do these people exist?  They cannot <Col N="1023" /> put their hands into the taxpayer's pocket, they cannot come to the Minister for Transport and Power and say: &ldquo;We have had a lean time, business is not good, our lorries and tyres cost more and petrol and diesel oil are expensive&rdquo;.  They do not do this but CIE have all these advantages.  I repeat for the fourth time in this debate that we must have more accountability; we must establish a sub-committee of this House to inquire into every aspect of CIE.  We know there are efficient men within the organisation but there may also be inefficient people there and this inefficiency must be wiped out.</P>
    <P>I have not mentioned the board of CIE but I shall not pass without saying a few words on this matter.  What is happening there is similar to what is occurring on other State-sponsored boards in this country.  A sizeable percentage of the posts on those boards is left over and reserved for political patronage.  It is not a person's qualifications as a businessman that entitle him to a place on the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not have the Deputy libel me on this.  I have appointed some of the finest businessmen in this country to State-sponsored boards and the Deputy knows this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not ask me to name some of the people appointed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I maintain they have no business ability whatever. They just got the job completely through political patronage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said I appointed some of the finest businessmen in this country to a great number of boards.  The Deputy can rant as much as he wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not ranting. Would the Minister agree that he has appointed some people because he was made do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the personnel on some of these boards are not qualified in the assessment of many people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Deputy's opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>They have been appointed through political patronage. Both Deputy Flanagan and the late Deputy O'Malley have said: &ldquo;We will give it to our own&rdquo;.  Why deny this? Why be untruthful about it?  I know very well that the Minister could find a far more efficient board for the transport organisation of this country as he could in relation to many other State boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not discussing any board other than the board of CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Minister's term of office he has appointed people to other boards and the political qualification was the prime factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that we are only discussing the board of CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister had to appoint Labour representatives from the trade unions because he had no alternative but wherever there is an opening the political man gets the job.  However, this is now seven years after 1962 and the Minister has learned that CIE cannot pay their way, that they provide a social service and surely nobody could expect a body providing such a service to pay its way.  The Minister agreed last night that he made blunders and that his assessments were wrong.  He took comfort from the fact, if this is really so, that a number of other Ministers for Transport and Power in Europe made similar blunders.  Am I correct in my statement that the Minister agreed that he made blunders, that his assessments were wrong and can it be assumed that his advice was not soundly based?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has misinterpreted me.  What I said was that Ministers all over Europe in making economic predictions did not take <Col N="1025" /> account, in many countries, of the appalling rate of inflation which in the case of high labour cost industries or services completely put aside all the economic estimates that were made at that time.  I said also that they did not predict correctly the tremendous effect of the motor car on the passenger service volume of European roads and that I was in good company with other Ministers for Transport.  That is all I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure it is on the record.  You said&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  The Minister said that he could not see any inflationary trend in 1962.  He was about the only one in Ireland who could not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I said the rate of inflationary trend, not inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>He could not see this trend in 1962.  He could not see, seven years ago, the different groups and organisations building up in this country, every section of our population joining together and making demands on the Government and making demands on everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said all this last night.  A Cheann Comhairle, can the Deputy repeat himself indefinitely and make exactly the same speech he made last night?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not repeat himself indefinitely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  The Minister does not like hearing this because even though Fianna Fáil are dictatorial in some aspects they are afraid of organisations.  They are afraid of combines when they make demands because they might lose votes if they stood up to them.  They will not use their dictatorial attitude with some of those boys when they come along and make demands.  The demands are usually yielded to eventually. That applies to almost every <Col N="1026" /> section.  This is a country now of agitation. Any group may join together, bind themselves into an organisation and put the gun to the State and say: &ldquo;We demand&mdash;otherwise....&rdquo; That is how business is transacted in this country at present and the Government are very mild on that aspect.  They are really afraid of themselves.  They are afraid that if they stood firm and made pronouncements which at times one would expect from a Government they would lose votes and find themselves here instead of there.  They are really afraid of themselves.  Everybody knows that.  This is not in any way disgressing from what is before us.  The main issue here is State subvention.  When one section makes a demand and gets what it asks or very near it, it is natural to assume that every section will do the same.  Any section that does not is foolish, it is out of the race, it will be left behind and forgotten.</P>
      <P>The Minister could not foresee in 1962 the inflationary trend.  He was blind.  He did not have his glasses on so far as inflation was concerned.  There was no change in our general position in that time.  We had no major upheavals, no disaster of any kind.  Everything ran smoothly between 1962 and 1967.  There was no upheaval of any kind except the inefficiency of the Government. They were allowed to continue in office because the people accepted that there was no alternative Government.  That is how they are here despite their inefficiency and that is how, despite their 140,000 votes of a minority in the last election, they are here as a majority Party.  We made mistakes, that is my opinion.  Others made mistakes.</P>

I am making the case that the inefficiency of Fianna Fáil and their Minister for Transport and Power is responsible for that.  The question could <Col N="1027" /> be asked: &ldquo;Why did the people not change this inefficient Government?&rdquo; Am I not correct in giving my opinion as to why the Government were not changed?</P>

      <P>What I am trying to say is that in 1958 and in 1962 and for a number of years when the Minister was closing 747 miles of railway lines, a group taken from an institution here in Dublin would make a better assessment of the position than the Minister did.  That is a factual appraisal of the position, which can be backed by ministerial statements made at the time and statements from the board of CIE.</P>
      <P>It could very well happen that the assessment we are getting in 1969 is wrong and that we will be told in 1972 or 1973 that £2,650,000 is not good enough for this transport company and that we must give them another million.</P>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House and the reason I have taken up so much time is that I consider this of vital importance.  What I want to know, as a TD elected by some of the Irish people, is how CIE use this subsidy, how they manage their business.  I want an account from each sector of CIE's activities as to its efficiency, whether there is want and wastage in some sectors and whether everything is working smoothly and efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1029" /> At the present time I am not able to say to my constituents in Cork south-west, who are paying this £2,650,000 whether it is justifiable or not.  If there is no doubt so far as the management is concerned about its efficient running I should like to know why a sub-committee of this House is not set up.  How can we be asked to pay this money to an autonomous body which has no responsibility to this House?  I hope the Minister is not annoyed with that suggestion. I should like to hear his reasons why that information is not forthcoming.  If this were a Bill providing money for the ESB I would be saying exactly the same thing because I want to know where the people's money is going and why there is the need for these big injections.</P>
    <P>The people in my constituency have been deprived of CIE's services.  CIE closed the railway line in Waterford and Clare as well as 600 miles in other places and as a result these people have no service, yet they have to pay CIE to keep going.  In the Berehaven Peninsula there is no CIE service, but a private bus service operates in that area.  I should like to ask the Minister to give recognition to this service in order that those who qualify for free travel on CIE might receive a reciprocal arrangement with this private bus service.  I think an arrangement should be made by the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Social Welfare for IRA veterans and old age pensioners in this peninsula to get the free travel to which they are entitled. In other parts the only CIE service provided is the school bus service. I believe that all areas where there is non-availability of the public service should be given special consideration.</P>
    <P>It was said last night that CIE are providing a very efficient train service, and I do not think that can be denied. With regard to CIE's bus service I think it is pricing itself out of the market.  I live in Schull and the fare from Schull to Cork is £1 6s 6d, £2 13s return except for one day in the week when there is a special excursion fare.  I find what is happening is that, say, three people, who, when <Col N="1030" /> waiting for a bus, find they all have the same destination, decide instead to hire a hackney car because it would cost them £7 19s to go by bus.  The same thing could be happening all over the country.  CIE are not competitive; they are running almost empty buses round the country and we are paying them a subsidy to keep on doing that.</P>
    <P>So far as CIE's small parcels delivery service is concerned the price is so exorbitant that people do not use the service.  One may ask how a company charging such excessive rates can continue in business.  The answer is that it is easy for CIE to continue in business because the State is behind them; if a private transport company acted in the same manner as CIE it would be in the bankrupcy court very quickly.  We are told time and time again that CIE must increase their charges otherwise the burden will be heavier on the public purse.  I am doubtful if that is correct.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, many people find it cheaper and more comfortable to hire a hackney car.  I know CIE provide a regular service which the hackney car may not do, but business is being lost because of the high prices. I do not know whether this is noticed by the board of management or whether the board even cares what is happening, but I maintain that the fare of £2 13s. from Schull to Cork is exorbitant.</P>
    <P>A bus from Schull to Cork or from Cork to Schull takes more time to make the journey than does a train from Cork to Dublin.  Not only do passengers pay through the nose but they are jolted about all over the country for three hours and ten minutes or three hours and 20 minutes and for that one pays £2 13s.  I do not give these illustrations for the purpose of depriving CIE of business.  I give them for the purpose of illustrating the necessity for a re-assessment of CIE's farecharging policy.  I believe such a re-assessment is necessary and due because, as a result of this policy, CIE are losing business from right under their noses.  Rural routes would be more profitable if fares were not so excessive. I trust the Minister will have <Col N="1031" /> something to say on this aspect when he comes to reply.</P>
    <P>Since 1958, 747 miles of railway line have been taken up.  What was done with the money received for the rails that were sold?  I understand some went to Italy and others as far away as South Africa.  I telephoned CIE and the Department of Transport and Power for information as to the amount CIE received for this 747 miles of railway line.  What happened to the money received for the rails and sleepers?  Was the price received for those that were sold equivalent to the cost of removing the rails and sleepers?  If a farmer goes to a junkyard to buy a girder for a shed he will pay a saucy price for it.  I am assuming the rails were valuable and fetched a high price.  My colleague, Deputy Dr. O'Donovan, tells me the money was used for current expenditure. Is that correct?  If it is then, in actual fact, along with the subventions we have paid to CIE since 1958 to date they have also had the value of the railway lines torn up all over the country. Is that so?  I trust the Minister will not take umbrage at my question because I am merely seeking information. I am sure these rails and sleepers were disposed of at competitive prices. What happened to the money?</P>

      <P>If an ordinary individual goes to buy a few rails, as <Col N="1032" /> farmers do for sheds, they are very costly items indeed.  I mentioned the desirability of making available to pensioners in rural areas the facilities enjoyed by those living in areas serviced by CIE.  I have no railway men to deal with now, thanks to the Minister, but I have been told that some CIE workers are not satisfied with their pay and conditions, particularly those who work as porters and in the lower grades of the CIE service.  Here in Dublin a porter gets £13 per week.  There is very little opportunity of getting overtime.  No family man in Dublin, or anywhere else, should be asked to live on a wage of £13 per week.  If that is the position, then it should be rectified.</P>
      <P>I emphasise again that there should be more accountability to this House in relation to CIE expenditure.  Some regulations should be made or, if necessary, legislation should be introduced to enable Deputies to know far more about the affairs of CIE and other State-sponsored bodies than they know at the moment.</P>

      <P>One thing in Deputy Murphy's speech that I agree with&mdash;it is about the only thing&mdash;is that we should have more say in the affairs of CIE and the other State-sponsored bodies.  There are many defects in the CIE system that must be rectified.  First, I shall deal with the appalling situation in regard to CIE pensioners.  Men <Col N="1035" /> who served CIE for 20, 30 or 40 years are now getting a miserable 25/- a week.  This shows no real thought for this section of former CIE workers. These people are entitled to greater consideration and must get it from an ever-expanding pension fund.  The fund has plenty of money which should be made available to those who so loyally served the transport system in their day and accepted short time and a reduction in wages in order to ensure that the transport system kept going. They should not be treated like this at the end of their days.  The Minister should do something about that.</P>
      <P>Last March I wrote to the general manager and got a reply which is the height of nonsense.  He indicated that all members of the board's wages grade pension scheme were insured under the Social Welfare Acts and tried to indicate that because they were getting social welfare benefits they had enough. It is not enough.  The men paid for the social welfare benefits they are getting. I do not know of any employer who would insult a man by giving him 25/-a week after 40 years loyal service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  It was 16/- at one time.  This is an appalling situation.  I would ask the Minister to stress this matter which does not seem to be understood by people who are making decisions and have fine, fat salaries in CIE.  Recently, Deputy Tunney, Deputy Moore and I made representations in regard to this, the most depressed section in CIE, men now approaching 80 years of age in many cases.  I suggest that out of this expanding pension fund these men should now get a direct payment of £200.  Some of the men will live a year, or two or three.  A direct payment would be one way of making up for the sins of the past committed by the CIE group who control this pension fund.  The letter I received is an insult.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I will read it.  It says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to your letter of the 14th <Col N="1036" /> inst.  About pensions paid to former members of the wages grade staff. All members of the Board's wages grade pension scheme are insured under the Social Welfare Acts and statutory benefits to which they are entitled are taken into account in the pension scheme.</P>
    <P>&mdash;these are benefits to which the men are entitled&mdash;</P>
    <P>The income to pensioners to whom you refer, including statutory benefits, amounts to £7 17s 6d a week for a married man.</P>
    <P>Many of these men are not married and many are widowers.  He takes into consideration the social welfare benefits for which these men paid:</P>
    <P>All these pensioners were given an increase of 5/- per week on the portion of their pension which was paid by the company with effect from January, 1968.  The statutory benefits payable to them have been, of course, increased in recent years and the last increase from January last amounted to 15/-.</P>
    <P>The fact that the State deemed it necessary to give these men an additional 15/- and the other increases down the years is beside the point.  They want some return for their service; they are not getting any except a weekly cheque of £1 5s in some cases, which is an insult.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputy O'Donnell has been supporting this depressed section for many years.  I agree with him and with other Members who have referred from time to time to the diabolical situation about CIE pensioners.  I hope the Minister will bring to the notice of those concerned what I and others have said about CIE pensioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy not climbing on the bandwagon since the Minister has agreed that the fund was being examined and if when examined it is found, as often happens, that there is a surplus, the pensioners will get the benefit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>It was stated in the last Dáil in reply to Parliamentary Questions that the fund was being examined but I am not satisfied with <Col N="1037" /> that.  Many of these men will have passed on before that examination takes place.  I want something positive done now.  They should get a lump sum payment of £200 right away.  This in some way would help to make up for the deficiency in the past.</P>
      <P>In regard to Dublin bus services, now that the survey has been made it should be quite clear to the company that a greater number of perimeter services should be operated. Recently a service was operated into the Ballyfermot area but one service is not enough.  This is an important matter in the lives of many workers who have to travel long distances to work and if CIE put on an efficient service the workers could do this more cheaply.  A man may have to travel to the centre of the city first and then take another bus to his place of employment and may have to travel a total of 20 miles to do so.  If there were perimeter services operating he might only have to travel five miles. I suggested a Ballyfermot service years ago and I was told that such a service would not be economic but now after a trial run has been made they find that it is economic.</P>
      <P>Recently I requested CIE to provide a bus to take factory workers to their homes in Ballyfermot for lunch and back again to the factory.  They provided the service but discontinued it because it was not a paying proposition. They failed to realise that they provided the service during the workers' holiday period.  Far more attention should be given to assessing the workers' travelling requirements. Their travelling expenses are considerable and CIE should take this into consideration.  If they are only interested in extracting the greatest possible amount of money from the workers then the present system is effective.  Workers are entitled to special consideration and an alteration in the morning services would be justifiable in order to ensure that workers can travel as quickly as possible to their destinations without having to spend so much time in buses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to consider the introduction of weekend bus services from Ballymun to Ballyfermot <Col N="1038" /> and Drimnagh.  Due to the expansion of corporation housing estates many people from the south side had to accept accommodation on the north side and they have to travel backwards and forwards to visit their relatives at weekends.  A direct bus service to Drimnagh and Crumlin would ease the situation.</P>

I am not satisfied with the services in such places as Drimnagh, Crumlin, the Inchicore area, the Bluebell area or the Ballyfermot area and suitable services should be provided.  I hope this matter will be rectified in the near future in order to ensure that people living there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Is it right that some sections may avail of low fares while other sections living on the outer perimeter cannot avail of this facility? There should be no privileged few and this facility should be extended to the entire city or not operate at all. It should be extended to where it is more important, in the perimeter areas where people have to travel considerable distances to do their shopping and do not want to go to the city centre.  They can go near the city <Col N="1039" /> centre, alight from the bus and then travel on another bus at a reduced fare.  This is crazy thinking.  An alteration in the Dublin bus services so that they would be terminated before the city centre would relieve traffic congestion. CIE are responsible for quite an amount of the traffic congestion in Dublin by running buses to the city centre.  If this matter is not given further consideration it will soon be impossible for buses to move in the centre of the city and there is quite a volume of them there at present.</P>
      <P>In regard to industrial relations at the Inchicore workshops this is one point on which I am in agreement with Deputy Murphy, that we should have more say in the affairs of CIE and other State bodies.  Something should be done immediately by the trade unions and the management in order to put the industrial relations position there on an effective basis.  There are two groups, one semi-skilled and the other unskilled, who have been receiving rough justice over the years. They have endeavoured to rectify the situation by every means, including taking their problem to the appeals board of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The appeals board on the 8th July, 1968, stated that meetings with CIE had not been held between September, 1967, and January, 1968.  This indicates the type of thing that leads to large-scale disruption.  A more effective system could be evolved with the help of the management and the trade unions.  It is up to both to ensure that there is no disruption and to ensure that there is contact between the men on the floor and the management. Any workshop the size of the Inchicore workshop would have had a grievance between September, 1967, and January, 1968.</P>
      <P>The semi-skilled and the unskilled groups feel that they are being unfairly treated.  They took the matter to Congress and the appeals board decision was that it appeared to them that there was a general feeling of dissatisfaction in regard to the working of the group not only among the members but among the unions as well. This is the real source of the difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1040" /> It can be dealt with, they said, under two headings, first of all, by the voting procedure and, secondly, servicing by the group.  They went on to say that they recognised the difficulties that existed in the provision of an adequate service for the group but it was their opinion that, unless some solution was found which would provide substantially better service to the group, this widespread dissatisfaction amongst the members concerned would continue. That is the decision of the appeals board of Congress which recognises that there is a problem in relation to the group system in operation in CIE; in relation to the question of a worker having his problem brought to the attention of the management, through his union.  First and foremost, this places responsibility for the dissatisfaction that has existed and that exists in CIE.  I trust this matter will be rectified speedily so that workers will have a fair crack of the whip and that their grievances will be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The semi-skilled and the unskilled groups are the first victims of a decision to reduce staff.  They work under very bad conditions.  Let me give an example. Tradesmen receive 4d. an hour diesel money and 3d an hour dirt money in what they term unusual conditions. The labouring and semi-skilled group contend they are given this because of health hazards.  Although entitled to these rates, they do not receive them.  Before the tradesman who receives dirt money because of unusual conditions, because of the dirty nature of the job, goes near the job, it has to be cleaned by a labourer who is more entitled still to dirt money. Time and time again I have outlined the many small grievances and problems of this particular group and of other groups and this is an example of one of the problems that agitates this group.  There are many others.  It is an indication of the way CIE lower-paid workers are treated.</P>
    <P>There has been a substantial reduction over the years in the number of labourers in CIE.  We never hear of a manager being laid off; we hear of more managers being appointed.  It is always the labourer, the man earning <Col N="1041" /> the small rate, who is laid off.  At times when one hears of a large volume of labourers being laid off, a large reduction in the number of skilled and semi-skilled workers, one may find that there is an increase in management. This seems crazy and it should be examined.</P>
    <P>The CIE labourer who has to travel to work from Ballymun or from Dún Laoghaire to Inchicore gets no free travel on the bus whereas other sections get free passes to and from their employment.  This seems wrong.  Certain clerical officers and certain other officers in CIE get these passes but the man with a low pay packet gets no addition whatsoever.  If CIE are prepared to give concessions of this nature to one section they should give them to all sections, especially to the lower-paid workers.  It seems very wrong that some supervisors and clerical officers in CIE should get passes while tradesmen, semi-skilled or unskilled, do not get the same concession.</P>
    <P>Recently, another group in CIE have been receiving the usual threats of demotion. These are charge hands who have given loyal service for the past 12 to 15 years.  Many systems have been built up and developed by these men some of whom are now told they are on the way down.  At the same time, other people, who were far behind them in the way of promotion, are now taking over their duties.  Many of these charge hands have over a number of years concentrated very efficiently on the jobs to which they were assigned. When notice went up in the shops looking for temporary foremen they did not apply because they felt they would be divorcing themselves from this particular duty.  They now find that the people who answered the advertisement and were appointed temporary foremen will take over the jobs which they held for 12 to 15 years. These men have a number of plus rates; if there is any loss of pay to them, if there is any loss in their situation, the matter would merit some comment from the Minister.  I should not like to see any man's pay packet reduced after having given loyal and efficient service.  I feel the same way about these men as I do about the <Col N="1042" /> pensioners.  I would ask the Minister to ask CIE to have another look at the question of the reduction of so many charge hands in CIE which appears to be the case there at the moment. Naturally, these men are concerned&mdash; concerned about their future, concerned about the efficiency of the situation there.  They are dedicated men who have given loyal service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy mentioned that many appointments in CIE are given to Fianna Fáil supporters.  I can say, in relation to Inchicore workers, that if a man discloses he is a Fianna Fáil supporter he is not promoted.  A man has to protect himself against this hazard by never indicating his politics.  It seems to me that there is victimisation in the CIE workshops of people who tend to support Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should look at the fares which are being charged in rural districts in comparison to the fares being charged in other parts of the country.  The return fare <Col N="1044" /> for a journey of 31 miles in Kerry is £1 4s and the fare for the same distance around Dublin is about 14/-.  We are told that the services in rural districts are losing money but it is very easy to see the reason why.  As Deputy Murphy pointed out, if three or four people hire a hackney car they can travel much cheaper and much more comfortably.  The Minister should try to reduce the fares in rural districts and thereby encourage people to travel by CIE buses.  That would serve another purpose.  There would be less car traffic on those roads and accidents might be prevented.</P>
      <P>It is good that free transport has been provided for old age pensioners, but it is rather hard on those people to have to produce their pension books to the bus conductor.  CIE should issue a card or a book of vouchers and the old age pensioner could hand a voucher to the bus conductor instead of having to produce his pension book.  I strongly appeal to the Minister to consider that point seriously.</P>
      <P>Like previous speakers I should like to compliment CIE, by and large, and especially on their hotels.  They provide a top-class service, but one thing bothers me.  I do not mean this criticism in any political sense and I hope it will not be interpreted in that way. Down through the years when tour buses from England or the North of Ireland came to the Great Southern Hotel in Killarney, very often there was an over-flow which was diverted to the old-established hotels in Killarney. Of late, especially since Ryan's Hotel was opened there, all the over-flow is being directed to that hotel. People are saying&mdash;I do not know whether they are right or wrong&mdash;that because Frank Lemass was at one time managing director of CIE and Seán Lemass is managing director of Ryan's Holdings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>People are saying that this is happening because of the tie-up in the management.  I would appeal to <Col N="1045" /> the Minister to leave things as they were and let the old hotels in Killarney which have provided a service down through the years and must keep their staffs going, get a fair crack of the whip.  The buses should go in rotation to each of those hotels.  Locally this is causing a fair share of resentment, and this resentment could easily be mollified if the Minister told the management of CIE to leave things as they were and give Ryan's Hotel one bus and not all the buses.</P>
      <P>I should also like to join with other speakers who said that the CIE pensioners are getting a very raw deal. There are people in Kerry who became redundant because a line was closed. I have one man in mind who is in receipt of £3 12s. a week from CIE. He is crippled with arthritis.  He is a married man with two children under 16 years.  It is disgraceful in this day and age that that poor man should have to keep his wife and children on the paltry figure of £3 12s. a week with rates and everything else to be paid. If it is humanly possible the Minister should do something for these people. It would be welcomed on all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a point in relation to the drivers of school buses. Recently in Kerry a strike was threatened.  In fact, I do not know how the strike was averted.  There must have been some appeasement at a later stage.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that these drivers get a few shillings more.  They are part-time drivers but their day is a long one from 7 o'clock or 7.30 in the morning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to refer now to the transport of greyhounds.  Recently CIE published their annual report in which it was stated that they have 75 greyhound boxes.  In my part of the country the greyhound industry is playing an important part.  If you want to get a box for a dog that is going to England, or if you have a bitch you want to breed, you have to wait two days before there is a box at the station.  There should be a number of greyhound boxes in every station, ready at all times, because two days make a lot of difference, especially if you are breeding a greyhound.  I would strongly appeal to the Minister to have three or four greyhound boxes in Tralee station and in the Killarney station and at Farranfore.  They are the only stations we have in Kerry.</P>
      <P>The last point I want to make is in connection with the CIE catering service. The service is top-class but there is one omission which I should like to see remedied, that is, that you can never get soup on the train.  Those of us who travel by train from Killarney to Dublin, especially when we are not drinking men, like a good hot bowl of soup.  For the little extra it would cost, soup should be available to the passengers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that this Bill has the full support of the Labour Party, and I want to raise a few points briefly on it.  I propose to leave the questions of the efficiency of CIE services, of industrial relations, of working conditions in the company and so on to the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" /> While we welcome this measure we regard it as being somewhat <i>ad hoc</i>, a classic example of the pragmatism of the Government in relation to the operation of public transport, whereby in the early 'Sixties they decided to give £2 million per annum subvention to CIE and coming into the 'Seventies they decide to raise that to £2.6 million and then as a Government they wash their hands of the whole problem of the operation of CIE.  I would strongly fault the Government for not having some form of national transport strategy embodied in a Bill of this kind. Nowhere is planning required more urgently than in our national transport system.  We have the daily tragedy of lives lost and people maimed on our roads.  There are the growing discomforts and the considerable delays in the journeys of many of our work force in going to and from their work.  We have the summer week-end paralysis on many of the trunk roads in the large urban areas.</P>
    <P>The points I have just raised are some of the unsolved problems of public transport in this motorised age we are now living in.  There is very urgent need for a plan covering the national network of roads and rail, general communications, particularly ensuring that they are co-ordinated with the air services which are growing considerably, with the coastal shipping services and with the general port services. This overall co-ordination does not exist at present.</P>
    <P>CIE can play a major role, in fact the major role, in achieving the necessary growth of industrial efficiency, in increasing exports and in improving the balance of payments.  I would therefore suggest to the Minister that in considering the need for a Government White Paper on national transport, the following points should be kept in mind.  Public transport, if it is to be viable, must be completely modernised. Whether at the railside, for example, we finish up with liner trains, or whether we finish up with the integration of bulk carriage at the railhead of CIE, there should be a rapid and cheap public transport system in operation. CIE have made considerable strides in <Col N="1048" /> modernisation but a great deal remains to be done in the years ahead.  Secondly, transport must be fully planned as a whole, and I have already outlined that aspect very briefly.  Thirdly, we have to take into account the social and economic needs of the country.  It is here again that the question of subvention inevitably arises.  I for one regard the current subvention of £2.6 million as necessary in terms of social needs.</P>
    <P>There is a special problem which the Minister could deal with in respect of urban transport, a problem requiring a combination of measures.  Unless the Minister takes urgent action and unless he and the Minister for Local Government get together with the Dublin Corporation, with the Dublin County Council and the Garda authorities in the greater Dublin area, the capital city of this country will grind to a halt as far as public and private transport is concerned.</P>
    <P>There are no easy alternatives. Everybody wants to come into Dublin in his own private motor car.  Everybody wants to leave Dublin perhaps twice a day and come back again in the evening in his own private motor car.  Then perhaps the commuters in the suburban areas go berserk when, because of that social phenomenon, the bus schedules go completely haywire. The choices open to the Minister&mdash; and I do not propose to comment that much on them because I come from a constituency which has the highest density of motor cars in the country, Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown&mdash; are not politically popular, but they must be faced.  I am convinced that within CIE, particularly with men like Mr. Higgins, the Dublin city manager, within the road traffic planning section of CIE, within the Garda authorities and within the traffic personnel of Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation there is sufficient expertise to considerably ease the transport chaos into which we are drifting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This House has a preoccupation with paper, with replies, but whether they will ever be translated into action on the streets of Dublin in respect of traffic is an entirely different point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Many steps have been taken, but they are never sufficient either here or in any other city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but the remedies and palliatives open to us have not been fully explored as yet by either Minister.  The Government need to take much more urgent action.</P>
      <P>I support the Minister in saying that public transport has a social role to play and that it cannot operate without some form of financial discipline. We must have elementary financial accountability and discipline in public transport.  The Minister should inform the House what happened the request of CIE for £6 million of a State grant for the capital expenditure programme. It is said that that request of the company has been cut back by the Government by £2.5 million and that, for instance, the continuous welding programme of the rail side of the company has been severely curtailed.  It has also been said that the road stock renewal programme has been likewise curtailed.  I should like some information from the Minister on these points. It would be quite futile to raise the subvention of the company to £2.6 million from £2 million and simultaneously cut back the capital programme by £2.5 million over the next two years.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on Government policy in respect of what I regard as the wasteful, undesirable and highly questionable direct competition between private haulage and publicly-subsidised public haulage on rail and road freight.  I strongly suggest to the Minister that it is quite hypocritical for the Government to liberalise the private haulage system on the one hand and simultaneously to hand £2.5 million to CIE to subsidise public haulage in the country.  There is a complete clash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current attitude of the Minister for Transport and Power who proposes to liberalise road freight in the <Col N="1050" /> country generally&mdash;which is in many respects the most lucrative and viable sector of CIE's operations&mdash;is not wise. Are the Government to come back here in 1975 and say that public transport is no longer viable because everybody is running around with cutthroat private haulage and automatically undercutting CIE who want £3½ million?  There is a clash of priorities here which the Minister should clear up without delay for the benefit of the taxpayer and the House.  I do not believe in liberalising public haulage in the country, north and south, and simultaneously asking CIE to pay top rates of pay to run an effective road freight service.  In many cases the private haulage operators flout maintenance and loading regulations as well as the driving hours regulations.  There is confusion of Government strategy arising largely from political pressures on the present Minister for Transport and Power.  Government policy should be clearly and emphatically changed.  I will elaborate on these points at a later stage during the debate on the Estimate.</P>
    <P>The Government now seem to be accepting the rather belated conversion of the former chairman of CIE, Mr. Frank Lemass, who has admitted that CIE have certain social priorities built into the company internally and that viability, in the purely financial sense, is not the sole criterion for the company's operations.  Much of their operations must necessarily be a charge on the community.  There is need for the Government to spell out to the taxpayers, the travellers, the commuters and the users of public transport the alternatives open to the people in public transport in the country.</P>
    <P>In the year 2,000 everyone may have his own private helicopter, jet or car.  There may be a glut of what I call transport individualism.  There is need not just for a Bill of a very <i>ad hoc</i> nature, such as the Bill now before us, but for a Government White Paper on transport.  I do not recall reading such a White Paper in the history of the State.  I read the Pacemaker Report.  The Department are not involved in terms of internal <Col N="1051" /> general transport.  The Department of Transport and Power react to events and provide money after such money is needed rather than shaping the course of public transport in the country and trying to build up an efficient system.  Bearing in mind the low density of population here and the fact that our areas are not vast, it should not be difficult to build up an efficient system.  It is open to the Government to build up an effective public transport system of considerable flexibility and latitude.</P>
    <P>The 20,000 workers in CIE have adapted themselves in recent years to meet the demands of public transport developments.  Many of them are quite cynical and unconvinced about the general strategy of the Government, but they would co-operate in building up an effective transport system.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister's attention will be directed to these matters not only in his reply but in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>I feel as a Dublin city representative I must take every opportunity of expressing my own thoughts on CIE.  The people of this city pay very heavily for their services.  I feel I should make some suggestion for a more streamlined service by the company. I also wish to record my appreciation of the action of the Government in providing further subsidy for CIE.  CIE have taken action to make their organisation a viable one with a view to becoming a self-contained unit eventually, which could at least pay its way.  It may seem to be a Utopian vision: to suggest that a public transport company which must maintain good standards of service, must pay proper wages to staff and workers, and must meet competition from other sectors should still strive to become a businesslike organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This time next year CIE may have a much bigger headache.  I feel that the golden egg which, for many years, has been laid by the Dublin goose&mdash;I refer, of course, to city bus services&mdash; may no longer be there.  This may be no fault of CIE but rather the result of a combination of factors which will tend <Col N="1052" /> to reduce the surplus from the Dublin city services.  CIE must find that money somewhere else.  Recent figures showed a surplus of over £300,000.  We can all see that figures in the city are falling. People are turning more and more to other means of transport.  Commuters who must come to the city daily are using other transport.</P>
    <P>There is no easy solution to this problem.  It is only by a thorough and clinical examination of all the operations of CIE, particularly in the city where we are told traffic congestion is costing almost a quarter of a million pounds a year, that we will reach a solution.  People may ask what the solution is.  I suggest that CIE must carry out some reorganisation as far as the city of Dublin is concerned.  They may have to shed the city bus services just as they have had to shed the rail services in the remoter parts.  It will be necessary to do this unless the Government decide further to subsidise the services or else that another body should take over the city services.</P>
    <P>The Minister might give thought to a suggestion that the bus services be transferred to a city transport authority, perhaps even a part of Dublin Corporation.  This might well be successful because we would then have a single authority in which was vested all facets of the transport service because it is obvious that buses must have proper thoroughfares on which to run and there must be adequate traffic regulations.  I know that the latter is the ultimate concern of the Garda authorities.  If we had a traffic study group in the city composed of corporation officials and Garda officials they could examine this whole matter of Dublin transport as it affects CIE. The vast majority of the people must still rely on CIE for public transport but if we are trying to run a 20th century transport service in an 18th century city something must give somewhere.  We must examine this very important matter of Dublin city traffic as it affects CIE or, if you like, as CIE affect Dublin city traffic.</P>
    <P>CIE are a much maligned body.  Any Deputy living in the city gets many letters of protest from his constituents with regard to the failure of CIE to <Col N="1053" /> provide an adequate bus service.  We know that CIE are faced with many difficulties but unless the problem of Dublin traffic congestion is solved, things will become much worse and this will have an adverse effect on the finances of the company.  It is possible that in a few years time there may be a Bill before the House seeking subsidisation for the Dublin city bus services. The Government accept that a public transport service has social as well as economic obligations.  As the last speaker said, by the year 2050 each person may have his own helicopter. That may be so but until that time arrives we must think of the public who rely on CIE.  If a man wishes to maintain his employment it is necessary that there should be a good transport service to get him to and from his place of employment.  This problem of Dublin city traffic is the greatest problem confronting the management of CIE.  The company have made great progress and they have done some great things but with regard to this specific problem there has not been the progress that we would like to see.  The fault does not lie entirely with CIE.  We must provide modern thoroughfares so that the bus service will be a viable and profit-making proposition.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister might consider giving us a combined traffic and road authority.  This would make for faster moving traffic in the city, more people would use the bus service and the people of the city would be saved from rising blood pressure because of a failure to provide a really efficient bus service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not propose to detain the House very long on this Bill.  Many of the points that could be dealt with might be more properly dealt with on the Minister's Estimate which will cover a wider field.  In his speech the Minister considered that a deficit of £642,460 over and above the grant of £2 million a year during the last five years ending 31st March of this year was not bad.  I suppose that at a superficial glance the figure could be accepted as not being an alarming deficit.  However, we must consider <Col N="1054" /> this deficit in the light of the fact that 126 miles of railway line have been discontinued during that period and 69 stations have been closed.  I always understood that the rail service of the organisation was blamed for the losses incurred but the loss here has exceeded the anticipated loss by between £½ million and £¾ million while, at the same time, the cause of the loss has been substantially removed.  Therefore, it may well be that there is need for better organisation within the company.</P>
      <P>I wish to add my voice to the appeals that have already been made on behalf of CIE pensioners.  This has been ventilated in the House during the year and the Minister must accept that these pensioners have been badly treated.  The pension of these people at 70 years of age has varied down through the years between 25/- and 12/-.  It is true that they qualify at 70 for the old age pension but we must remember that they have contributed to that.  It is generally accepted that the old age pension, be it contributory or non-contributory, is only sufficient to keep body and soul together.  It is the minimum on which an old person can be expected to live and indeed, in some cases, local health authorities find it necessary to supplement old age pensions by payment of home assistance or outdoor relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we are dealing with people who have served a national transport organisation or, indeed, any other State-sponsored organisation, we must realise that they are entitled to expect more on their retirement than the amounts I have mentioned.  They are entitled to expect, when they retire, that they should be able to live in frugal comfort at any rate.  That has not been the experience of retired CIE workers in the lower grades.  I understand in 1963 there were between 1,000 and 1,100 such pensioners. I appeal to the Minister and to the Government, even at this stage, to do the right thing by those pensioners. Indeed, the State are less than generous and even less than fair to their retired workers.  They are inclined to forget about them and let them drag substantially behind more recently retired <Col N="1055" /> workers.  State pensioners who have retired for four, five, six, seven or eight years are allowed to fall very far behind the people who retire as of this date, because as salaries and wages go up, the pensions of retiring personnel increase.  However, people who retired a few years ago are not given anything to compensate them for the increase in the cost of living.  Many of them died before justice was done to them.</P>
    <P>Many workers who were taken over from the Great Northern or other transport undertakings are deprived of a gratuity because the length of service necessary to qualify for a gratuity is too great.  I am not sure of the exact period, but I think it is as much as 25 years.  It is certainly a very long period.  There are a number of those retired people who did not qualify either for a pension or a gratuity.  The Minister should look into that matter.</P>
    <P>On the question of the general policy of the CIE road transport, the section which operates the buses should show good example in regard to traffic congestion and parking.  In some towns CIE operate a bus service without any proper terminus and without proper parking places and they create congestion near dangerous junctions or near dangerous bends.  If we are to have a road transport service in the years to come&mdash;with the rapidity with which things will happen in the next ten years we will be using the sky rather than the roads&mdash;then having regard to the increasing number of vehicles on the road, CIE will have to ensure they do not create traffic hazards and congestion in towns and that they will have mini bus terminals to cater for their vehicles.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the salaries of part-time drivers in the school bus service are being adjusted.  All I can say is that I hope there will be no cause for complaint.  It is a fact that those men are only part-time drivers but their time is badly broken up between the morning run and the afternoon run and the rest of the day is not much use to them.  I would also appeal to the Minister to ensure there is no cause for complaint about the <Col N="1056" /> standard of vehicles operating the scheme and that there is no overcrowding in them.</P>
    <P>I am glad that CIE hotels have shown a surplus and that the operating surplus has increased from £145,000 in 1964/65 to £234,000 in 1968/69.  Many people think that hotel charges in this country are much too high.  The general policy of CIE hotels should be to keep hotel charges within reason and to attract tourists here.  The fact that the hotel section is showing a profit must mean that tourist traffic is increasing.  The tourist industry here is very important.  If the CIE hotels are to continue to show an operating surplus everything possible should be done to encourage tourists to come here by car ferry and otherwise.  I approve of the car ferry system but it is also necessary to develop tourist traffic in other ways. This industry suffered as a result of unsettled conditions in Northern Ireland.  It is essential to do everything possible to encourage tourists to come here so that the CIE hotels will enjoy more business and can contribute to cutting CIE's costs.  We should have conditions here which would encourage tourists to come here.  As I said, the tourist traffic suffered this year through conditions in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Government should not do anything either collectively or individually to discourage tourists.  I cannot help thinking that the statements made by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in the last few days can only be calculated to have a very harmful effect on the tourist business here.  It is very easy for people in Great Britain and elsewhere to say: &ldquo;There is trouble in Ireland&rdquo; and a word dropped here and there across the water can damage our tourist business very seriously.  People who hear this kind of thing will not make inquiries but they will probably go elsewhere. Therefore, Ministers should look before they leap and consider the effect their statements are likely to have on the general economy, whether tourist or otherwise, and should ask themselves how it will affect the taxpayers of the country.  I shall not deal with this at any greater length on this <Col N="1057" /> occasion but it is relevant on this Bill which is providing money for a number of purposes, one of which is to run hotels for the reception of tourists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I welcome the subvention to CIE.  We all realise CIE have a highly concentrated male labour content and it is important that we keep up standards and if possible improve them.  I shall speak on a subject already referred to, that of CIE pensioners. There is a section among them getting a deplorably low pension.  I have here a document from the pension association which states that CIE have £5,571,447 in the pension fund.  This document, which I am informed is authentic, shows that CIE could easily improve the pensions of the lower-scale workers and I shall be obliged if the Minister sees his way to intervene in this matter.  I believe there have been representatives from the pensioners association with the Minister for Transport and Power in the last month or two and that the Minister is looking into it.  The sooner we bring about an improvement for these people, many of whom have worked for 40 or 50 years with CIE, the better. I know several of these people in Inchicore and it is regrettable to think that nothing has been done for them.  I think the Minister is sympathetic on this point and I hope that in the near future an improvement will be made. Another point mentioned to me is that they would like to see more workers represented on the pension board; they informed me they have only one representative on this board and they believe greater representation should be given them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore has dealt with the problem of traffic in Dublin.  We have a good public transport system in Dublin but unfortunately we have reached the situation with traffic congestion that movement is coming to a halt.  I notice that the surplus from the buses in Dublin has fallen again.  I do not think it is due to the fact that we have a bad service but they have slowed down considerably. People travelling to and from work each day know how frustrating this can be, though it is not the fault of the bus drivers but is purely due to <Col N="1058" /> the congestion.  In cases where people have deadlines to meet they are grouping together and driving a private car into the city because they consider this is quicker than using public transport. We need to get the Department of Local Government and Dublin Corporation together to try to solve this problem, as the number of cars travelling to Dublin each morning and evening is making it impossible for free movement and a decision must be taken at some future date on how to avoid the congestion that occurs in the centre of the city.  The Government will have to take a stand on this as we cannot allow this deterioration to continue. Certain roads must be made available for the public transport to get free movement into the city because, by and large, they cater for the many people who have not got private transport.</P>
    <P>I notice that CIE hotels have made a surplus.  This I would expect because their hotels command the best positions throughout the country.  I have not gone into the percentage surplus but if the shares were written up on the capital they hold I am not sure what they would return.  CIE run excellent hotels. They are expensive, but I am not sure whether they cater for the tourists we are trying to attract.  However, I am glad to see that they had an operating surplus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>When a Bill of this kind comes before Parliament it might be educational for Deputies to spend some time in the Dáil Library reading the speeches made in 1944 by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Lemass, when he was introducing what we may describe as his &ldquo;transport baby&rdquo; and the dreams he had for the success of that baby which 25 years afterwards we can describe as one of the greatest blunders of Mr. Lemass's public life.  It would be of interest to Deputies to read the debates and the expressed opinions on the Transport Bill, 1944. At that time, this House and the country were led to believe that one of the main reasons for taking transport from private operation and establishing a new company known as CIE, a State-sponsored <Col N="1059" /> company, given by Mr. Lemass was that it would provide cheaper and more efficient transport and that the workers employed would get a better deal from the new company than they had got from the Dublin United Tramway Company or the Great Southern Railway Company.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made in this debate to the fact that CIE have a surplus to their credit in recent times. Is it not easy to have a surplus when we find that they pay their pensioners &mdash;there cannot be many left who worked for the Great Southern Railway and I know something about this because I am the son of one of those men&mdash;pensions of 12/-, 15/- to 25/- per week after devoting their lives to the service of the transport organisation? It is easy to show a surplus if a company does not pay its workers or recognise its responsibility in justice to its pensioners.  It is easy to show a surplus if it strips the country of its railway lines, if it denudes rural Ireland of its important rail links and if it closes between 65 and 70 railway stations. That is the picture CIE are showing us at the moment&mdash;a favourable balance sheet but fewer services, fewer railway lines, fewer railway stations, mean, petty pensions for men in the winter of their days, men who devoted their lives to building up the transport organisation in the service of the Great Southern Railway.  Anyone can show a surplus in housekeeping if nothing is bought.  We will all have money in our pockets if we spend nothing.  It is quite easy for CIE to show a surplus when they are paying pensions like this, when they dismantle railways, close down stations and have the bridges removed for them by the county councils and at the same time have a very profitable sideline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a sideline in the nature of a gimmick that was brought in here by the Minister for Education together with the Minister for Transport and Power to organise the school transport scheme which put a little over £3 million into the kitty of CIE.  The whole idea behind the school transport system was that this was a contribution in disguise to pull CIE out of the <Col N="1060" /> red, to make CIE better off, to have better bookkeeping at Kingsbridge. That was the whole idea behind the school transport system.  It was not worry about children getting to school; it was to patch up CIE.</P>

      <P>A little over £3 million of taxpayers' money.</P>
      <P>In this House in 1944, in Carlow and in Dundalk when Mr. Lemass was speaking about the Transport Bill&mdash; I know this, I have it all at my fingertips&mdash;he said that the Government did not believe in subsidised transport.  I have a cutting here from the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of June, 1965, which deals with CIE subsidies and which says:</P>
      <P>Seeking to justify his course of action in taking over private companies, Mr. Lemass, at that time, told the Dáil that the Government does not believe in subsidised transport facilities.  Yet for years his Government has been subsidising his baby, CIE.</P>
      <P>Are we to continue subsidising transport or can we never hope to reach the stage when transport can stand on its own feet?  One of the main reasons why we must have State subsidy to such a great extent is that there are not transport experts on the board of CIE.  One would imagine that when a board was being set up by the Government, the first board or the present board, the Government would devote all their energies to picking out the very best transport experts the country could provide.  Of course there were other considerations and the other considerations had to come before the national consideration of providing the very best experts on transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The biggest blunder in the political life of Mr. Lemass was the setting up of CIE.  This &ldquo;baby&rdquo; of his has now grown to manhood and we might now describe it as retarded.  His dreams of more efficient transport have faded, his dreams of cheaper transport have gone and the transport system that was operated before CIE is now nonexistent. <Col N="1061" /> Railway tracks have been pulled up and the steel sold.  Much of it is being used in railways on the Continent.  There are fewer men employed.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister for Transport and Power when some degree of sanity is to be restored in regard to the whole transport organisation.  We have a transport company operating an hotel business. I do not want to be critical of an hotel business.  It is very praiseworthy and very necessary but how many strings are to be attached to the board of CIE?  Is it the business of a transport company to operate and compete in the hotel business?</P>

      <P>I would not like to prophesy what kind of transport we will have in the year 2050.  There is no doubt but that Mr. Lemass's prophecy to this House that we would have a more efficient and cheaper transport system has not materialised. Instead, the taxpayer is continuing to subsidise CIE.  Surely the time has come for a complete review of this whole situation?  I should like to know if there is one trader in this country who has experienced cheaper transportation of his merchandise via CIE than he did from the old Great Southern Railway.  I was of the opinion in 1944, and I have not altered my opinion, that this was a wrong move. I think we could have had a cheaper <Col N="1062" /> and more efficient transport system from private enterprise.</P>
      <P>Transport in the city of Dublin is chaotic.  This is a matter for the Dublin Deputies to press the Minister on.  I feel the time has come for the possibility to be examined of Dublin Corporation&mdash;when it comes back into existence&mdash;taking over the transport problems of this city, in the same way as London Transport, the city of Manchester Transport and the city of Bradford transport systems.  There would be nothing wrong in having the transport systems of the city of Dublin, the city of Cork and even the city of Limerick controlled and administered by the local authorities.  I think they would do a much better and a much more satisfactory job than CIE are doing.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, and in the opinion of many outside this House, CIE were wrong in drastically reducing our rail services.  I think it was a penny wise pound foolish step.  One of the main reasons why CIE can show a surplus is that they are operating fewer services.  I should like to know if it is more important for CIE to balance their books than to provide a transport system for the people.  The board of CIE have devoted all their energies to diving deep into the pockets of the taxpayer.  One would not mind them doing so if it were in order to pay their workers and their pensioners, but it is not.  It is very evident that the efficient and cheap transport system promised has not materialised and the taxpayer is still paying subsidies.  I suppose there is little we can do to change that.  We would like to know from the Minister if CIE are going to continue to raise bus and rail fares.  The rates of fares in the city of Dublin must be intolerable for workers who have to use the services two or three times a day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE are getting £3 million from the Department of Education for the school transport service.  I should like to know when bus shelters are going to be erected in rural Ireland for the children waiting for the school buses. It is very injurious for these children to have to stand out in bad weather. I do not know if this is the responsibility <Col N="1063" /> of the school manager, the Department of Education or CIE, but if it is the responsibility of CIE I would ask the Minister to take the necessary steps to see that these shelters are provided.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if the board of CIE have finished their pruning down of the railway lines.</P>

      <P>There are not. I am prepared to take the Minister's word for it.  I only hope his word carries a little more authority than the opinion expressed by Mr. Lemass when he was dealing with this matter in 1944.  I am quite satisfied, from information which I have, that the board of CIE will review the entire structure in 1973 and unless it can be shown that there is a satisfactory financial return we may experience a further pruning down in this regard.</P>
      <P>I am very anxious to raise the matter of the £5 million in the pension trust fund.  Is it true that CIE have £5 million in this pension trust fund while they are paying pensions of 12/- to 25/- per week to some of their pensioners?

      <P>Deputy Thomas Fitzpatrick of Dublin said that the pension fund was £5 million.  Pensioners are receiving 15/- to 25/- a week.  Why, then, should CIE have to use the contributory old age pension to shield the workers from the company's own failure?  That is something I cannot understand.  Pensioners are entitled to a decent pension from an employer in appreciation of the service they have rendered.</P>
      <P>The bigwigs in CIE do not use the transport provided by CIE.  There should be some explanation as to the necessity for such a vast number of staff cars.  These must cost a substantial sum.  Is it necessary to provide a rail and road service and simultaneously a fleet of staff cars for the bigwigs in Heuston Station?  This fleet of cars is paid for by the taxpayer.  These bigwigs should be put in the dock and their activities on the board of CIE investigated. I am not satisfied that the board is constituted of experts.  It never has been.  One or two members may have certain qualifications.  I do not want to be critical but there is room for inquiry into the workings of this group.</P>
      <P>CIE have on their payroll approximately 20,000 workers.  If these 20,000 workers were not members of trade unions I am certain they would warrant a great share of sympathy from the Members of this House.  There is a great degree of insecurity hanging over the heads of many of these workers.  It is wrong that any man should feel insecure.  The workers of CIE up and down the country should be guaranteed permanent employment and a greater security than many of them enjoy at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that CIE have run rail and bus services in competition. <Col N="1065" /> I believe the railways never got a chance.  CIE signed their death warrant.  That can be proved.  While operating the railways CIE simultaneously took passengers from the railways on to the roads.  This was a cleverly designed scheme to kill the railways.  The railways could not pay while they were in competition with the roads.  The Minister should make some formal statement with regard to taxi owners who are providing a very essential service.</P>

I merely want to pay tribute to the courtesy and efficiency of the employees <Col N="1066" /> of this company.  They discharge their duties with great integrity.</P>
      <P>We lack a great deal in regard to cheap and efficient transport.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us we shall never see the day again when we can have transport any cheaper than it is now, but surely it is not impossible to provide in many parts of the country higher efficiency for both traders and the general public.  In saying that, I am not casting any reflection on CIE employees who do their best to give the best possible service that the company enables them to provide.  A much different picture of CIE is being painted by the Government today from that painted by them in April and May of 1944.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) (for the Minister for Transport and Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been an interesting debate.  The first thing I want to note for the House is the fact that we have had only two really fierce critics of CIE, Deputy O.J. Flanagan, who did, however, praise the courtesy and kindness of the staff, and Deputy Murphy, who suggested there should be a complete investigation into the company, and that there might be gigantic waste of which the Dáil would not be apprised and so on. There was constructive criticism by other Deputies.  That was inevitable because no company is perfect and CIE is not perfect.  Proposals and suggestions were made, all of which, I think, the Minister for Transport and Power should examine to see if they should be put forward to CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much was said about statements made by the former Deputy Seán Lemass and myself in relation to subsidies for this railway enterprise.  It is a fact that growing losses on railway operations have been a feature of all railway operations practically everywhere in the world, even in the USA, where railways were operated by private enterprise, although subject to some State and federal rules regarding their operation.  I do not think any Minister for Transport could ever see sufficiently far ahead the effect of inflation, where it existed, on an enterprise whose labour costs are 65 per cent of total operating costs.  When <Col N="1067" /> there is inflation, every State enterprise with a very high labour content is inevitably affected to a greater degree than enterprises with lower labour content, such as the ESB as compared with CIE.</P>
    <P>I think it is a fact that most Ministers of Transport in various countries did not predict correctly the enormous impact of the private motor-car on railway passenger traffic and on certain types of freight traffic, arising from the construction of better roads.  That is a fact; let us be honest about it.  We were not worse than any neighbouring countries.  I still hold to everything I said about subsidies.  I do not like the idea of a subsidy for a State company if it can be avoided.  I think any State subsidy must have some effect on the efficiency of the company but, having said that, I think that the kind of subsidy we have given CIE is one in which there is a considerable degree of discipline. If you tell a company they have to live on £10 million of subsidy over five years and they only overspend that by about £500,000 during a bout of very serious inflation, one can say that if you must have a subsidy, that is a good kind of subsidy.  That cannot always be applied.  Evidently, there are some State enterprises that require almost open-ended subsidies of some sort but, in this particular case, I think it worked fairly well.</P>
    <P>I should mention in passing that the new subsidy happens to be the same percentage of total revenue of CIE in 1969 as the £2 million subsidy was in 1966.  If you take the present subsidy of £2,650,000 at the 1964 value of money and allow for the fact that the subsidy would have to increase to cover the loss in the value of money, unless productivity and traffic had grown by a fantastic degree, then the subsidy in real terms is only up by some £10,000 on 1964.  I am not saying that by itself is an indication of the efficiency of CIE but it is quite fair to look at the £2.65 million and apply to it the loss in the value of money since the previous subsidy was arranged in 1964.</P>
    <P>During my time as Minister for Transport and Power, I had the advantage <Col N="1068" /> of being very closely associated with the European Conference of Ministers of Transport, whose permanent headquarters are in Paris, and it was possible for me to study at very close quarters the operation of other railway companies, many of which had different conditions from those applying to CIE.  One can read a vast number of reports and inquiries into these railway enterprises and one can also watch the slow deterioration of profitability of railways in Europe which still remained profitable in the 1950s.  As Minister for Transport, as long as I could see the Swedish railways, the Dutch and Swiss railways still making ends meet, I thought, perhaps, we might be able to make ends meet here.  Many of the European railways have, of course, quite different operating conditions from ours.  The fact is, however, that now there is not a single railway company in Europe which pays; the Swiss railways are the nearest.  I do not think they require a subsidy because the deficit is so low.</P>
    <P>I think it is true that when we studied this question we did not, perhaps, have sufficiently close connections with European railways.  We always tended to look to Great Britain and say that we could not possibly compare Irish with British railways where the situation was so totally different. If we had closer connections with Europe at that time, we would have been able to study railway economics to a greater degree.  Now, we are able to do this.</P>
    <P>The main consideration in relation to Ireland is that even with the lines that have been closed it has one of the longest mileages per 1,000 of the population of any railway company in Europe.  Equally it has no transit traffic because it is an island railway and, to that extent, is at a great disadvantage compared with the Swiss, Dutch or Belgian railways which have tremendous transit traffic passing through the countries.  Unfortunately, in spite of the excellent development of all the traffic in the country, part of which is carried by CIE, we do not have the advantage of very heavy ore traffic which is an enormous help to the commercial viability of any railway company.  Finally, if the arterial <Col N="1069" /> lines were 300 miles long instead of being roughly 130 to 150 miles long I think the railway portion of the operations of CIE would be more successful. It is impossible to make any commuter railway service in the world operate without a very heavy loss because of traffic peaks and their effect on operational expenses.  It is almost impossible to make a railway service operate efficiently where its arterial distance is about 150 miles.  If it were 300 there would be far more incentives offered to certain types of passenger and freight users.  It is the short distance which makes it very difficult for a railway to pay.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about line closures.  I thought we had ended that discussion but, apparently, people still regret the passing of certain branches. I shall not go into this in detail except to say that the net financial betterment to CIE from the closure of 620 miles of line between 1958 and 1964 and 126 miles of line between 1964 and 1968 is close to £1 million per annum.  I do not know if Deputy Murphy would like to come forward with a resolution for a supplementary sum of £1 million a year in order to keep the railway going.</P>
    <P>The closing of railway lines has been universal.  It is going on all over Europe.  It has been going on under railway managements that have been reorganised and where new directors have been appointed.  Closures of lines are unavoidable in the case of any railway where the position is reached that it is literally nothing but a bus service forced to run along a railway line and stop infrequently in a sparsely populated area.  That is a simple way of putting it.  There is no point in running a railway such as the West Cork Railway where, from what I can remember, the average number of passengers per train load was 30&mdash;that compares with a bus load&mdash;and where the average number of tons of freight carried on the train was 45 tons.  When the Farranfore-Cahirciveen branch line was closed, I think it was replaced by one lorry and one bus.</P>
    <P>The branch lines that were closed were, for example, in the very lowest category of the Beeching Report in <Col N="1070" /> Great Britain.  As listed in the British Railways report on line closings they were in the category where automatically the line would be closed.  I think it was perfectly right at that time to close those lines.  The railway system that has been left still does not pay. Some sections of it are more profitable than others.  Some sections may be profitable for both passengers and freight; some for freight only, but as I have said, there was a lack of proper economic prediction of the operation of railways everywhere and we suffered from it here.  I and my predecessor were responsible for not having this capacity for prediction.  I think this was largely because the science of railway economics was only developing at a time when the railways were beginning to lose money.  If it had been developed, say, about 20 years ago, I think we would have been able to make our predictions more accurately.</P>
    <P>I might also say as a matter of interest to the House that when <i>Pacemaker</i> was published in 1963&mdash; that very brilliant report published by CIE which is a great credit to the directors and management of CIE and to all those engaged in its preparation &mdash;at that time in the whole of Europe and even in America there were very few closely analysed documents in regard to railway economics.  I am not sure if <i>Pacemaker</i> was the first but it was certainly one of the first well-conceived economic analyses of a railway company.  That is a good illustration of the fact that railway economics have been recently developed and that CIE, in producing <i>Pacemaker</i>, were in the forefront.  I think I have said enough on this general subject that railways no longer pay.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond referred to the overall planning of transport in this country.  As Deputy Desmond knows, the Minister for Local Government and Foras Forbartha have been working on the question of road structures and road definitions.  I think CIE can be said to be fitting into this planning. There has also been a survey of freight traffic throughout the country which led to certain decisions by the Government&mdash;for example, the liberalisation of cattle traffic.  The question of <Col N="1071" /> further measures to liberalise road freight transport is under examination. There have been at least two reports by Professor Schaechtele for the Dublin Corporation.  A committee consisting of members of Dublin Corporation, of the Department of Local Government, of the Garda and of CIE are examining the question of Dublin City traffic.  I think two reports have been published already including the one proposing, if I remember rightl, an inner ring road in Dublin.  Other reports are awaited.</P>
    <P>Of course, let us be frank about it: if you read the greatest report that has ever been published on traffic congestion&mdash;the Colin Buchanan Report &mdash;the proposals he makes for eliminating road congestion are financially impracticable, even for Great Britain. The question of solving traffic congestion is a very difficult one indeed.  I cannot go into that except to point out that CIE have been playing a very active part.  They have pointed out that some 51 per cent of people in Dublin go to work by public transport and that, if more are to go, there must be some way of guaranteeing the movement of the buses.  There has been no final decision about this.  It has been pointed out in other countries, too.  In any road traffic arrangements, if people are to have cheap and effective transport, the public bus carrying a large number of passengers must be given some kind of right of way through the city.  That is one of the problems.  As I have said, there is a great deal of planning going on in relation to transport&mdash;perhaps not quite what Deputy Desmond wanted, which was a huge overall transportation plan.  Nevertheless, I would say that roads are being planned with the knowledge of the CIE railway system in mind and that there has been a good deal of work in relation to Dublin street planning.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond referred to the cut back in CIE's capital payment.  The actual position is that, in common with other State-sponsored bodies, CIE's capital allocation has to be determined in the light of the priorities in the Public Capital Programme.  That <Col N="1072" /> applies to every Department in which there is a tremendous competition for capital.  Deputy Desmond knows the total amount of capital that has been raised by the Government or by State companies for public services has enormously increased in the last three years.  But capital has to be got either by borrowing from abroad or from the savings of the people.  There is an absolute limit to what can be made available to any one particular enterprise.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies suggested the transfer of the Dublin bus services to Dublin Corporation.  It is very difficult to see what advantage could be gained by that.  A good many overheads would also have to be transferred to the Dublin Corporation relating to the general operation of the entire national transport system.  There is the question of the linkage between the Dublin railway system and the bus system.  I doubt whether there would be much advantage to such a policy.  It would be very difficult for me to pronounce on it at the moment.  I certainly would not like to predict what the Minister for Transport and Power would say.  I do not think he regards this as likely to provide a better or more efficient Dublin bus service.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made that we have given a great deal more liberty to the road freight licensed hauliers.  In fact, the number remains the same. They have been given more flexibility. We do not believe that CIE will suffer as a result.</P>
    <P>In fact, the position is that we have far too much transport in this country that is probably uneconomically carried by owners of private vehicles.  We gave this flexibility partly as a concession in return for the whole of the carriage of cattle becoming free from restriction, and partly because I think the present number of licensed hauliers and CIE together ought to play a greater part, particularly in long distance transport, in containerised transport, in groupage transport, than they do at present.  I hope that my successor will give particular attention to this question.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell mentioned the reference to non-commercial costs of <Col N="1073" /> CIE and sought clarification on this point.  Non-commercial costs refer to the social services which have been provided by CIE during the past five years at the request of the Government: school bus services, free transport for old age pensioners and Old IRA men, the cost of which has been quantified and is paid for by the appropriate Departments.</P>
    <P>It also relates, to some extent, to the normalisation of accounts.  Deputy O'Donnell said it would be a good thing if CIE had this system.  One could say that CIE's accounts have been partially normalised but the definition of normalisation is not universally accepted.  If you had a railway service that remained open, for example, entirely at the request of the Minister for Defence, the loss on that service should under normalisation of accounts be recouped to the railway company. The question of normalisation of accounts is something about which one could have very considerable discussion.</P>
    <P>The railways, the canals and the vessels can be described, to some degree, as social services and the losses on these services are being met by the annual grant from the Exchequer, plus the profits on the board's other services. The service from Galway to the Aran Islands, for example, makes a considerable loss; but this is regarded as an essential social service.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies suggested that they did not know what was happening in CIE.  I hope they read the accounts of CIE which give quite clearly the profitability of the various sectors of CIE operations, and indicate quite clearly the losses where they exist in the case of the railways, canals and vessels.  I do not think there is any lack of detail in the accounts.  Occasionally we give figures in the Dáil about the proportions of the services that lose in various sectors.  For example, <i>Pacemaker</i> revealed that 35 out of 79 Dublin city bus services lose money; the rest either break even or are remunerative. Further information could be given in relation to the provincial bus services &mdash;some of them highly profitable and others, which are essential in the interests of local communities, uneconomic. <Col N="1074" /> In the past year, as the House knows, there was a surplus both on the provincial bus services and the Dublin bus services.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies suggested some kind of detailed inquiry into the whole operation of CIE.  They felt that if there were some kind of parliamentary committee the result would possibly be the revelation of excessive lushness, inefficiency and excessive costings.  I am afraid the House will have to accept my word and that, I am sure, of my successor.  We do not believe that such an investigation would prove any gross inefficiency or gross excessive costings on the part of CIE.  We believe that the Pacemaker Report is still valid.  If you apply the changes in the pattern of traffic, the changes in the volume of traffic such as have occurred, the securing of additional traffic by CIE in competition, in many cases, with other services and then, at the same time, apply the increase in costings both for the purchase of materials and for salaries and wages, there is no reason to believe that a request for an additional £650,000 for the next five years is the result of inefficiency of operations.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister I made comparisons as far as I could between the subsidy paid to CIE and those paid to other European railway enterprises. Although there was not a single railway with which you could really make an exact comparison, if you just looked at the various features of each railway, you could only come to the conclusion that the subsidy actually paid to CIE by the taxpayers is by any definition a reasonable one and cannot be regarded as an indication of extravagance on the part of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to keep the House by reading the tables from reports of the European Conference of Ministers of Transport, upon which we based these decisions in our Department&mdash;the endless tables, so many vehicles, so many freight ton miles for each railway in Europe over <Col N="1075" /> a period, the changes in the costs, the subsidies for each railway per £ GNP, per £1 million GNP, etc.  You can never firmly say that there is any comparison between one railway company and another but you can make a series of comparisons and arrive at conclusions.</P>
      <P>I feel quite confident about that, much more confident than I would have been in 1962 or in 1964, the period about which Deputy Murphy was speaking, when I knew hardly anything about railway economics in the modern sense of railway economics and economic analyses.  This has been very highly developed since the middle or early 50s.  We have now learned a lesson on how to discuss their accounts with CIE, and a lesson on how to debate all the various profits or losses in the different sectors, and I think we can do this very competently now.</P>
      <P>One Deputy referred to redundancy compensation.  I am very glad to say that there have been no recent complaints to me or to my successor on the general arrangements for providing compensation for redundancy recurring as a result of the closing of railway lines.  It all worked out very well and there are methods of appealing. Redundancy arising from liberalising road freight haulage is not anticipated.  The road freight section of CIE are doing very well and developing liner traffic and other forms of traffic, and they do not anticipate that there will be any redundancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may interrupt the Minister, it was I who referred to the question of redundancy but it was within the context of the forthcoming Bill to liberalise road freight transport. I made the point that certain operators in the road freight section of CIE expressed concern to me about the possibility of redundancy.  I said that I felt those fears were groundless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I misunderstood the Deputy.  I think it is possible for CIE to continue the road freight operations very profitably even allowing for liberalisation measures. Of course, as the Deputy knows, CIE were not taking any great volume of <Col N="1076" /> the cattle traffic by road in any event. The liberalisation partly relates to the freedom of that traffic.</P>
      <P>The heating on the trains will be very much improved when the new heaters are in operation.  That is an answer to several Deputies.  CIE were unable to construct heating vans at Inchicore because of a serious shortage of skilled staff.  Heating vans were ordered last year from the Dundalk Engineering Works by CIE and they are now seeking tenders for 40 more.  I hope that these heating vans will be made in this country.</P>
      <P>Deputy McLaughlin raised the question of cheap fares from Dublin to Sligo.  The cheap return fare is £1 8s. People boarding at Sligo for the return journey to Dublin were asked to pay the full fare of £2 11s.  I understand that in future CIE will allow people from Sligo to travel on this service for £1 8s.  No doubt Deputy McLaughlin will be pleased at that and I think that is a very wise decision on the part of CIE.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of cheaper fares.  The entire list of concessionary fares by CIE is very considerable and they have been expanded over the years.  I hope my successor will do what I did, that is, have fairly regular conferences with the general manager and press him to consider concessionary fares, partly because of the arguments that have been raised here about whether you cannot fill the trains and even the buses with more people if as many concessionary fares as possible are given.  I should also say, however, that CIE have excellent methods of calculating all this and working out the result by cost-benefit analysis and so forth, and it is a matter for constant review and examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell quite naturally expressed the hope that there would not be a complacent attitude by management and workers in CIE as a result of the raising of the subsidy.  I think it is true to say that the subsidy is being placed at a level which will be a challenge to CIE in the sense that they will have to show the utmost productivity and the very best sales management <Col N="1077" /> if they are to live through the five-year period without requiring any further subsidy.  It has been calculated on that basis.  I feel quite pleased with the £10 million arrangement&mdash;with the excess of £542,000 over a period of five years&mdash;that it was a fairly good effort at prediction when we recognised that a subsidy was inevitable.  It was predicted fairly accurately, and during the whole of that period it had a disciplinary effect on CIE in a way that an open-ended subsidy would not have had.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies asked about bus service operations.  I want to repeat that surveys are constantly undertaken to see whether the bus services require improvement.  They have taken place in connection with the Ballyfermot service.  There have been a number of changes in the Ballyfermot bus routes, and special bus services have been arranged from that area to the seaside in summer.  The area managers are constantly examining this position. Deputy Flor Crowley asked about a survey in relation to the train services in Cork.  As far as I can recall that was undertaken to see whether there was a justification for having a very early train from Cork even though there was a train leaving at 9.15 a.m. It was an excellent example of well-conducted market research.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond mentioned the welding of the line to Cork.  That has to be postponed because the cost is prohibitive within the limits of the capital available to CIE.  I hope that some time or other within the next five years it may be possible to weld the line which will enable the speed to be very considerably increased, and this line is a very successful part of CIE's operations.</P>
    <P>While I am making these remarks, may I appeal to all Deputies, when they have minor complaints such as there being no soup in the restaurant car or buses being late or suggestions that a bus service might be changed, to keep in touch with the area managers? The area managers of CIE are efficient people and they are willing to listen to complaints and Deputies and other people interested in public service, interested in the improvement of transport, should, if possible, preseat <Col N="1078" /> them with not just verbal evidence but written evidence or express their point of view or their complaints in such a way that they are capable of being well analysed.</P>
    <P>Somebody referred to the Harcourt Street line being turned into a road. That was examined by the Dublin Corporation quite a number of years ago and it was regarded as being uneconomic.</P>
    <P>I come now to the pre-1963 pensioners. As the House knows, I was able to get agreement with the Government that CIE should give an ex-gratia increase on two occasions to these pensioners, and by 1st January, 1970, a married pre-1963 pensioner will be getting £9 between the contributory old age pension for a married person and the pension of £1 7s 6d a week.  Some Deputies are inclined to speak as though the £1 7s 6d were the sole resource of the person concerned.  I am glad to tell the House that what will be the third increase in this pension is now under consideration by CIE and the Minister.  I hope a sympathetic attitude will again be taken towards this.</P>
    <P>In reply to those people who complain about stations and railways being closed, may I say that within two years of the closing of these railway services I could report that the freight services in those areas had been expanded by an even greater amount than would be warranted by the mere closing of the railway service?  That was certainly true of the closing of the west Clare railway and part of the west Cork railway service.  There were replacement bus services in every case and I do not think it is true to say that when a railway station or a railway was closed there was an absence of proper transport services.  Transport services were reorganised in the area.</P>

      <P>I was dealing with the question of adoption when the reply to my Estimate was being dealt with in the House on the last occasion.  I covered most of the points raised by Deputies on that issue.  I do not propose to go into some of the other matters that have arisen on this issue about adoption societies.  I have dealt with them by way of answers to parliamentary questions from time to time.  The general feeling among our people, and particularly among those with practical experience is that adoption societies are doing a good job and deserve public commendation.  They are doing very necessary charitable work and deserve the thanks of all for the very fine job they have done.  Since they started their operations there has been just one unfortunate case. According to those who are most familiar with that case, it probably would have happened no matter what precautions were taken beforehand. The people chosen as adopters were well known to the man in charge of that society.  He is a respected clergyman. His judgment at that time was that they were suitable people to adopt a child.  Human nature being what it is, cases of this kind may occur, very rarely occur, without anybody concerned with the adoption being at fault.  Taken as a whole, the system we have here is working very well and has been admired by outside observers.</P>

      <P>The Deputy seems to be under a misapprehension about inspections. The Adoption Board uses the services of local authority officers.

      <P>There is another aspect of my Estimate which I must return to because of a leading article in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>.  It says:</P>
      <P>Mr. Ó Moráin's charges in the Dáil on Tuesday against Serjeant Sullivan, for example, passed by with ominously little stir&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is further criticism of me for an attack on a dead man who cannot answer for himself.  I want to put on the record of this House that I did not attack Serjeant Sullivan.  I quoted here his own words in public print in his own book.  I was dealing with the strong balaclava of Deputy T. F. O'Higgins about what wonderful men the leaders of the Irish Bar were down through the years and how they stood up to the executive.  This book is not by some author about Serjeant Sullivan.  It is the written word of Serjeant Sullivan himself.  Nobody can <Col N="1082" /> accuse me of quoting him at second-hand because these are his own words. Furthermore, the book was written by Serjeant Sullivan not in the heat of the troubles of 1916, but years afterwards in 1927.  He was then a mature and certainly an old man.  There was no excuse for him, if he changed any of his views, to set them forth in print. Instead of attacking him I have been quoting him.  Serjeant Sullivan boasts of the stand he took in those days.  He sheds tears here for the British Foresters and tells how he offered his services to Dublin Castle, and how he threw open his house to the British military at the time.  He even went further at the end in 1919 by writing to the public press.  I was dealing with what Deputy O'Higgins said about these men standing up to the executive. This is how Serjeant Sullivan stood up to the executive.  This is his own plan of which he boasts.  He sets it out at page 248 of his book.</P>

      <P>I am accused in a leading article in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> in relation to the words of this man and his plan in 1919.  He said the emergency needed instant and drastic action.  He said it was not a case for half measures.  I quote:</P>
      <P>I proposed the abolition of trials by public process.  The information &mdash;the ample and conclusive information&mdash;at the command of the Crown, should be submitted in each case to judges...</P>
      <P>He went on:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the tribunal was satisfied that there was a case to be answered notice would be served to show cause why the accused should not <Col N="1083" /> stand convicted of the crime of which particulars would be given.  If no good cause was shown conviction and sentence were to be recorded. Membership of the IRA was to be sufficient evidence of participation in IRA crimes in the place where the accused usually resided.  It was not pleasant, but it was bound to be effective.  In a short time a couple of hundred criminals would have been sentenced to death.  There would have been no necessity to execute them.  Upon the murder of a policeman, six condemned might be hanged, at the next shooting ten, at the next twenty.  Murders could not be organised any longer.  Those condemned on evidence of membership of the IRA might be released under sentence so long as their district remained free from bloodshed. If they failed to prevent outrage by their comrades they would suffer for it.  Within three months the horrible reign of blood-sodden cowardice would be broken.</P>

      <P>It is <i>Old Ireland: Reminiscences of an Irish K.C.,</i> by Serjeant A. M. Sullivan.  I have been quoting from pages 284 and 285.  That was Sullivan's view about the miscreants, as he called them, at a time when the Black and Tans were running through the streets of this city.  He was entitled to that view and let not the <i>Irish Independent</i>, in a leading article of today's date, think that I am not also entitled to quote his written words.  I will not bother the House about what Sullivan had to say about the other Irish leaders at that time, <Col N="1084" /> particularly Jim Larkin and Connolly. It is true he was a personal friend of William Martin Murphy and was his guest around 1916&mdash;&mdash;</P>

But when it is suggested to me that I am attacking somebody by quoting his written word I must reply.  I will not have Deputy O'Higgins misrepresenting history about the Irish Bar and giving his version without me giving mine.</P>
      <P>I shall go on to another matter raised here by Deputy Sweetman.  First, let me say that when Deputy Sweetman told the House two nights ago that he had handed over his business to a partner when he was Minister for Finance, he was either misleading the House or, as the records show, he misled the Incorporated Law Society, because there is a register of solicitors and an official book known as the <i>Solicitors' Calendar</i> published by the Incorporated Law Society.  I have looked in the register in that Calendar as revised up to 30th October, 1955, and as published by the Incorporated Law Society.  The register shows a practising certificate from the Incorporated Law Society as having been issued to George D. Fottrell and Sons, 30 Lower Baggot Street, and it also gives the name of Deputy Sweetman&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Have you not looked at the current register?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, but Deputy Sweetman denied&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> He did not.  He said he handed over his practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Sweetman was not practising, if he handed over his practice when he was Minister for Finance, why is that not shown in the register under his firm's name?  That is the rule of the Incorporated Law Society: if you have a partner you must, under their regulations, set it out <Col N="1085" /> in this register.  Otherwise you are in breach of the Incorporated Law Society&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which covers the year up to the beginning of that year. This record should show, if it were a fact, that Deputy Sweetman when Minister for Finance did have a partner and who the partner was, but the record does not show that: it shows Deputy Sweetman had paid his £25 for his practising certificate.  The record shows that he was a practising solicitor, that he was listed as such under the firm of George D. Fottrell and Sons, 30 Lower Baggot Street, and that nobody else but he owned that firm at the time.  Either he was withholding vital information against the rules of the Incorporated Law Society or he misled this House, because this is the official register.  Where did he keep or why did he keep this partnership so quiet and secret; why did he keep this partnership under the bed or under the table and how is it that the public were led to believe otherwise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the official publication of the Incorporated Law Society, Deputy Sweetman, Minister for Finance, was (1) a practising solicitor and (2) the sole owner of George D Fottrell and Sons.  Let Deputy Sweetman explain his position to the Incorporated Law Society or let him withdraw the allegation he made in the House that he had nothing to do with George D. Fottrell and Sons when he was serving here as Minister for Finance.  Indeed it is notorious as we <Col N="1086" /> all knew that from time to time he could slip up to his firm, and no blame to him so long as it did not interfere with his work as Minister.</P>
    <P>However, we have this public crawthumping by Fine Gael and it is well we should put on record the fact that Deputy Sweetman was a practising solicitor, the fact that he owned and was sole owner of that firm, and that his good, decent colleague from Donegal, Deputy Patrick O'Donnell, opened a legal office convenient to the Custom House from which he could keep an eye on his clients.  These are facts that were known to all and sundry at that time, and when Deputy O'Higgins can spare time, after drawing legal aid in the Four Courts, to come and see us here in the evenings he may tell us that he well knew of these facts because he was a colleague of their's.  Deputy O'Higgins made a virtue of necessity saying that he could not practise in the Four Courts and talk here.</P>

      <P>I am very concerned that suitable measures should be introduced with a view to providing stability in commercial potato production.  I do not, however, consider that it would be feasible to introduce a guaranteed price for potatoes having regard to the fact that the quantity of potatoes which is sold commercially is small in relation to the total crop.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

All questions arising in relation to claims for benefit are decided by deciding officers appointed under the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  In dermatitis cases, medical advice is obtained by the deciding officer before giving a decision.  To obviate hardship in cases where decisions on claims to occupational injuries benefit have to be deferred disability benefit is paid as an interim measure where the person concerned is incapable of work and satisfics the normal conditions for that benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the number of gardaí engaged in the protection of banks (a) in Dublin and (b) in the rest of the country; what equipment they are issued with both in order to apprehend persons attempting to rob banks and to protect themselves against armed attack in such cases; whether any onus is placed on the banks themselves to take suitable precautions, and if he will give details.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the total number of gardaí currently providing security services for commercial banks in the State; and if such banks pay any fee for service to the State for such protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to <Col N="1097" /> take Questions Nos. 20 and 21 together. As I have previously explained to the House, I regret that I cannot agree to supply information about security arrangements.  There is, of course, an onus on banks and indeed on all firms to take reasonable precautions themselves and these precautions must be all the greater in places of special risk. Banks do, in fact, take special precautions. On the other hand, we have to recognise that there is a limit to what they can do by way of precaution against certain types of criminal.  Fees are not charged to banks for Garda services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that responsibility for bank deposits should more and more be the responsibility of the banks themselves rather than the Minister's Department? Would he not agree that the banks should, in the main, be shouldering the responsibility for safeguarding their deposits, thereby releasing a large number of gardaí who are obliged to do constant duty in this regard with inadequate equipment in the event of their being assaulted by armed robbers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree that the primary responsibility for security arrangements in places like banks, where money is kept lies with the bank authorities.  On the other hand, the Deputy will appreciate there are certain circumstances in which large organisations and most unusual risks may be involved and in those cases it is very necessary that the gardaí would also take a hand in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not seen the tabular statement but a very great number of gardaí are engaged virtually full-time on such duty as guarding banks to the exclusion of the many other potential areas of crime in this country.  In those circumstances does the Minister not agree that the rationalisation of work leaves a lot to be desired?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he accepts there is a fairly reasonable case to be made that the commercial banks should, in respect of the tremendously heavy protection given by gardaí to their premises during working hours, be asked to pay some proportion direct to the Department or to the State of the cost incurred by the State in that regard? Every bank does not ring up the Department and get a garda&mdash;we now see one stationed in front of every bank&mdash;just on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state (a) for himself and (b) for his Parliamentary Secretary the cost of officially provided Christmas greeting cards sent in 1968; if the postage was provided free by his Department and, if so, the cost in each case; if he can give an estimate of cards on order for this year under each heading; and if the cards will be sent post free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of official Christmas greeting cards sent by me in 1968 was £41 12s 6d.  It is not possible to give the exact cost of the postage as it is included in the total bill for postage for my Department but it is estimated at £14 approximately.  It was paid for by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1100" /> It is estimated that the cost of official Christmas greeting cards and postage this year will be similar and will be borne by my Department.  The personal cards which I send are stamped and paid for by me personally and not out of State funds.  As regards my Parliamentary Secretary, the cost of Christmas cards sent in 1968 was £36 12s 10d and the cost of postage was £11 7s 6d.  It is estimated that the cost of cards to be sent this year will be similar.  The postage in 1968 was paid out of the Vote for the Office of Public Works and will be similarly paid this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance why, when stating in reply to questions that the likely size of the current external deficit in 1969 was £55 million he did not explain that this figure depended upon an exceptional export of second-hand aircraft.</P>

    <P>26.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether the external trade deficit for the 12 months ended October was £54½ million worse than in the calendar year 1968; whether in view of the fact that the current external payments deficit for 1968 was £20 million this means that the deficit for the 12 months ended October would have been £74½ million, if there had been no improvement in net external receipts this year; and whether it is the case that even if the whole of the £12-15 million improvement in net invisible receipts estimated by him for the calendar year 1969 took place during the first ten months of this year the current external deficit for the 12 months ended October would have been at least £59½ million to £62½ million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>27.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the grounds on which he believes that the rapid deterioration in the external payments position during the first ten months of this year will be halted or reversed in the last two months, as is implicit in his Dáil <Col N="1102" /> statement last week that the external deficit for the year would be £59½ million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 25, 26 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>My pre-budgetary forecast of a £55 million deficit in the balance of payments in 1969 was based on a calculation of aircraft imports net of certain sales of aircraft which were expected to take place in the last quarter of the year.  It was decided within the past month that, for commercial reasons, these sales should be postponed and the projection must, therefore, be adjusted accordingly.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Deputy's second question, it is not possible to give an accurate figure for the current external deficit for the 12 months ended October, as balance of payments estimates are available only for the calendar year.  However, in regard to the Deputy's calculation, I would draw his attention to the fact that the figure of £54½ million to which it refers is the extent of the disimprovement in the external trade deficit in the ten months ended October and not in the 12 months ended October, as suggested. I should also point out that the latest published figure for the balance of payments deficit in 1968 is £22 million and not £20 million as indicated in the question.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the figure of £12 to £15 million for the improvement in net invisible receipts in 1969, given in reply to his question on 5th November, was an extremely tentative estimate.  There are indications now that the increase this year may be in a higher range but any estimate at this stage is of course still very tentative.</P>
      <P>In regard to the third question, I indicated in my reply to a question by the Deputy on 13th November the reasons why I consider the trend of external trade should improve in the last few months of the year, compared with the trend of earlier months.  Imports of an exceptional nature contributed to the large import excess in October.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that old age pensioners in county homes have their pensions paid over to the authorities and have £1 returned to them each week?  Would he not consider introducing a scheme such as I have requested for these people?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think a scheme along these lines would be administratively practical but the Deputy can be assured that the Minister for Social Welfare and myself will be discussing the position of old age pensioners and other social welfare classes in the context of the forthcoming Budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that various Ministers have previously said in this House that it was administratively impractical to provide free transport and free television licences?  These are now available and the Minister should seriously consider what Deputy Kavanagh has requested. It should be possible to classify such needs of old people in these institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to do something on these lines I do not think this is the best way to do it. I do not think the Deputy is right in suggesting that the question of free transport was ever ruled out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Childers ruled it out; it was ruled out as impractical in the last Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatBrowne" hpid="Mr. P. Browne Mr. P. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will consider making old age pensioners exempt from income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No liability to income tax can arise in the case of a person in receipt of a non-contributory old age pension; the award of this pension <Col N="1106" /> would have been subject to a means test.</P>
      <P>A contributory old age pension&mdash; which is paid irrespective of the recipient's other income&mdash;is, for purposes of income tax, regarded as earned income.  But persons whose only source of income consists of a contributory old age pension are not liable to income tax.  I would remind the Deputy that a person whose income is wholly earned is not liable to income tax unless the total earnings (inclusive of any contributory old age pension) are&mdash;in the case of a single person&mdash; more than £332 per annum or more than £565 in the case of a married man.  So far as the question is concerned of exempting contributory old age pensions from income tax the Deputy will appreciate that it would be difficult, if not altogether impossible, to differentiate in principle between such pensions and other pensions, particularly where the other pensions are small in amount, and modest incomes from other sources such as investments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that the Minister said that the contributory pension is not taken into account for assessment of income tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No. A contributory pension is treated as earned income. If a man and his wife have nothing other than the contributory pension they are not liable for income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the pension was provided by the man himself during his years of working?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why it is treated as earned income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, should not the person be assessed only on whatever other earnings or income he may have other than the contributory pension?  The present system is to assess him on the full amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If he has only a contributory old age pension income tax is not payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Most people would not be assessed on the normal part-time employment in which they might be engaged at that age, but by virtue of <Col N="1107" /> the fact that they have provided a contributory pension they are being taxed in their old age, which is most unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>A contributory old age pensioner only contributes one-third but the whole pension is treated as earned.  The situation is if he has only a contributory old age pension, or a contributory old age pension with some other small amount, he is not liable for income tax.  If he has any other income which renders him liable for income tax then surely the right way to look at it is that his contributory pension is free of income tax and it is the other income which is taxed. There are people living on small fixed incomes and it would not be fair to exclude contributory old age pensioners and not the other cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>What about people such as school wardens who are in part-time employment earning, say, £6 a week which brings them into the income tax bracket?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my last Budget speech I have already decided to accept in principle parity of pensions but because of cost considerations I have to move towards it over a number of years.  As a start all State pensions, including those of retired members of the Garda Síochána, have been brought up to the level of the pensions of equivalent colleagues who retired with the benefit of the general pay increase of 1st February, 1964. The question of further adjustments is one for consideration with other matters appropriate to the Budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Donegan is not right.  It is only in comparatively recent years that the Central Bank have taken upon themselves the role of advising on the volume of credit made available to the community.  It is a fairly modern innovation.  When they came to deal with this problem, to try to ensure that the amount of credit made available from time to time was directly related to the needs of the economic situation, they found that the mechanisms available to them for control were not very effective even with the full co-operation of the commercial banks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very important factor in the situation which has made the directive power of the Central Bank somewhat ineffective and that is the overdraft system, which operates in such a way that the total volume of credit made available by the commercial banks sometimes is not entirely within their control either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister ensure that, in any new arrangements, steps will be taken to avoid drastic fluctuations in the volume of credit so that industry and trade can be assured of a relatively stable flow of credit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that this is very desirable.  In fact that would really be one of the main purposes behind the new mechanisms which we hope to set up, to ensure that the Central Bank will be much more fully in control of the situation with the co-operation of the commercial banks, and able to ensure that the community gets as much credit as it needs from time to time, not too much and not too little.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the maximum rate of interest permitted to be charged by tontine societies; and whether there is any maximum rate of interest prescribed by law for similar bodies making small short-term loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Friendly Societies Acts, 1896 to 1966, do not lay down a maximum rate of interest which may be charged on loans issued to members of a society registered under these Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> I assume this is the type of society the Deputy has in mind.</P>
    <P>The only statutory restriction on interest rates charged on loans by similar bodies is that contained in the Credit Union Act, 1966, which lays down, in respect of credit unions, a maximum rate of 1 per cent per month on the amount of the loan outstanding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister if he means that there is no limit to the rate of interest which can be charged to people who borrow from tontine societies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

      <P>The Department of Lands has commissioned An Foras Talúntais to carry out a programme of research on mallard duck.  Since the project was initiated in 1966, a sum of £13,332 has been expended.</P>
      <P>Mallard are legally classified as game-birds and, as such, are afforded protection by law.  This protection includes provision for an annual close season during which the taking and killing of this species is prohibited. The period of protection in the current year was 1st February to 31st August, the close season which has been customary for some years now.  I am not aware of any damage caused to mallard by oil pollution on the River Dodder.  Some 340 birds of various species&mdash;including 80 mallard&mdash;were inspected last week on the stretch of the river between Ballsbridge and Ringsend and were seen to be fully healthy and oil-free.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission have been endeavouring in recent years to secure an adequate pool of land to be used as a working basis for the resettlement of small and fragmented holdings in this part of County Offaly. To date six properties, comprising some 360 acres, have been acquired by way of exchange, purchase and resumption and a substantial part of this acreage will be utilised in a comprehensive scheme for rearrangement of a number of intermixed holdings.  However, the acquisition of additional land is an essential pre-requisite to the work.  With this end in view negotiations are in train for the purchase of two further holdings, containing 80 acres, while inquiries are being made regarding the suitability of a third property of 57 acres.  Any further opportunities for obtaining land, by way of either migration or acquisition, for the area will be fully examined as they arise.  I might add that this particular district of Offaly is on the fringe of the Bord na Móna bog-complex which includes the Lumcloon, Boora, Turraun and Leamonaghan works and my information is that there are good opportunities for employment in these works.</P>

      <P>In the financial year 1968-69, 423 acres of land were acquired for forestry purposes in Leitrim and 238 acres in Sligo.  In the first six months of the current year, 1969-70, 346 acres were acquired in Leitrim and 817 acres in Sligo.</P>
      <P>Funds for the acquisition of land are not allocated on a county basis but the Deputy can be assured that the total available in the grant-in-aid fund is adequate to meet any demand.</P>
      <P>The area of land which may be acquired over any given period depends mainly on the rate at which offers of suitable land come forward and price agreements are made and, more significantly, on the rate at which the legal formalities of purchase are completed. These matters are largely outside the control of my Department and I could not give an estimate of what lands may be acquired in 1970-71. Indications of future prospects may, however, be gained from the fact that at the 30th September, 1969, agreement had been reached for the purchase of 1,754 acres in Leitrim and 983 acres in Sligo.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education how many of the schools which opted into free education scheme still charge school fees, and in what amounts; and whether he has any information that parents with children attending such schools have had to remove their children, either because of lack of means or because they were so advised because of inability to pay the fees required.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I will take <Col N="1157" /> Questions Nos. 86 and 87 together. The basic condition for entry into the free education scheme was that every school concerned would cease to charge school fees.  Before the formulation of that scheme and of the scheme of grants for secondary schools building there were a number of schools which had incurred large capital debts.  Such schools were allowed to seek voluntary contributions from parents towards the liquidation of the debts.  Seeking such contributions did not violate the terms of the scheme of free education provided it was made clear to parents that there was no question whatsoever of a charge being placed on them and that in making a contribution they would be so doing of their own volition.</P>
      <P>In a few cases where there appeared to be a breach of the spirit of the free education scheme strong warnings were given to the schools concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not being a little naïve when he uses the word &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo;?  Is he not aware that, in fact, the principle of free secondary education is breached in a very large number of schools by the insistence, in effect, at the risk of discovery, upon additional payments for such concealed things as recreational and sporting facilities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy says.  As I explained to him, this is not in breach of the free education scheme provided it is made clear to the parents that there is no question whatsoever of a charge being placed on them and that, in making a contribution, they would be doing so of their own volition.  In any case where we were informed of what appeared to be a breach we got in touch with the school concerned and we gave a very strong warning.  This year we only had one complaint and we are investigating it.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister if he would suggest to the schools that are incurring this expenditure, that they should seek other ways of paying off their debts rather than compelling some of their pupils to pay?  This is what is implied.  They should seek some other means.</P>

      <P>Could I ask one final supplementary?  I distinctly recall the inventor of the free secondary education scheme, the late Deputy Donogh O'Malley, saying on television that he would regard such additional payments as a breach of the scheme in principle and that it was his policy to make sure that it was not breached in that way.  Can we be sure that this is still the policy of the Minister and the Department and that the scheme will not be breached by theoretically voluntary, but in fact compulsory, payments of this kind?</P>

      <P>Under the free education scheme no charge can be made in respect of (1) instruction in any subject of the Department's programme for secondary schools; (2) recreational or study facilities, where all the pupils are expected to avail themselves of them as part of the school programme; and (3), any other school activity in which all pupils are required to take part.  A circular letter including the above provisions was sent to all the schools in the scheme on the 11th May, 1967.</P>
      <P>The circular continued&mdash;and this is in relation to what can be done in regard to voluntary subscriptions&mdash;&ldquo;There are a number of schools which involved themselves in large capital debts in respect of building projects which were begun before the scheme of building grants was introduced. Some of these schools have considered entering the free education scheme on the basis of parents making a voluntary contribution towards the liquidation of these debts.  Such an arrangement would not contravene the terms of the scheme, provided it was made absolutely clear to parents that there was no question whatsoever of a charge being placed on them, and that in making a contribution they would be so doing of their own volition.&rdquo; As I said, it was strongly urged that it should be left to the representatives of the parents to make the arrangements for collecting the voluntary contributions.</P>

Apart from this fact I am not aware that parents generally are experiencing any great difficulty in securing places in secondary schools for their children.</P>

This is not a very satisfactory kind of answer; it would be in a libel action but not in a Parliamentary Question.  What I want to know is if he is aware that there is a problem.  While it is not one for which he is to blame in any way, is he considering what can be done about it?  I appreciate it would not be easy to solve it but he ought to face the fact that there is such a problem. Would he look into it and see to what extent this is a problem and what proportion of secondary schools have these preparatory sections and what proportion of places at the moment in the first year of the secondary schools are held by pupils from the non-aided preparatory sections of these schools, so that we would know the scale of the problem?</P>

      <P>Take two groups of schools in the city of Dublin.  One group has a non-aided preparatory section attached to it.  In principle this is an excellent arrangement, but the difficulty is that this group of schools has very limited entry for children from the national school. There is another group of schools which does not have a non-aided preparatory section and national school children can go there.  This is socially divisive.  I do not know the answer. I am not suggesting it is the Minister's fault.  We have a potential cause of social division arising out of something which is in itself a good thing, that is, streaming the whole way through the schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not seem to answer the question at all.  In every school at any given moment there are children sitting in classrooms being taught by a teacher.  Does the Minister seriously say that the Department does not know what is the position as regards the size of classes?  Of course the size of a class may vary because of pupils transferring from one class to another during the course of the day.  However, that is something which can be got over by finding out what the position is at 11 o'clock or any particular time on a given day.  Is the Minister suggesting that this minor statistical difficulty has prevented him from getting information and that he has no idea of the size of classes in secondary schools?  I should have thought that at this stage, with his development unit there for four or five <Col N="1166" /> years now, all this information would be readily available.</P>

While it is interesting to have this figure, it is meaningless.  I appreciate the Minister's difficulty because classes vary, but surely this can be covered by simply asking each school to furnish a return of the numbers in a class at, say, 10.30 a.m. on a particular day and get a picture as to what the position is at at any given moment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply of 23rd July, 1969, in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>As stated therein the goal which has been set is that there should not be more than 35 pupils in any class.  As we have now an average of one teacher for about every 32 pupils it will be seen that if maximum utilisation of the existing teacher force could be secured then no additional teachers would be required.</P>
      <P>Any estimate of additional teacher requirements must take cognisance of the fact that while maximum utilisation is not likely to be achieved the extent to which it can be achieved has been vastly increased by the policy of closing small schools and securing larger school units.</P>
      <P>As the effect of this policy is a continuing one, it would be mere conjecture to base an estimate on it at the present time.  What is certain, however, is that we have now reached the stage that due to increased recruitment close on 200 teachers in excess of normal requirements will be turned out annually.</P>
      <P>This coupled with the implementation of the policy to which I have just referred will enable us to reach our goal in a reasonable period of time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. J. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the introduction in June, 1957, of the revised pattern of investigation of entitlement to the service (1917-1921) medal, 16,110 persons have applied for special allowances under the Army Pensions Acts. Since the inception, following the 1968 <Col N="1179" /> Budget, of the free travel, etc., concessions scheme for veterans of the War of Independence, 9,853 persons have applied for the free travel concession and 7,230 persons have applied for the free electricity concession.</P>
      <P>These figures are not mutually exclusive. As the records are maintained separately, it is not possible to say what the extent of overlapping may have been, or how many individuals are actually involved.  A figure of 20,000 individuals would possibly be a reasonable assumption.</P>

A number of medals were awarded in a way that is not now considered to have been satisfactory.  Since 1957 a new system of examination of applications for the award of service medals has been adopted because the system up to then was found to have faults.  When a person applies for a special allowance or for any other concession his whole case is re-examined.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Defence Force Regulations an Officer of the permanent Defence Force may, on the recommendation of the chief of staff, be promoted by me, as Minister, from one rank to the next higher rank.  The regulations specify in detail the factors to which the chief of staff must have regard in recommending an officer for promotion.  These include his fitness to fill an appointment in the higher rank to which he is to be promoted, his reliability, devotion to duty, zeal, industry and initiative.  The chief of staff must also take account of such things as the courses which the officer has successfully completed, his health record and, except in what are known as fixed period promotions, the officer's place in the seniority list.</P>
      <P>Under the arrangements for fixed period promotions officers in certain ranks may, after specified periods in those ranks, be promoted to the next higher rank&mdash;subject always to their being otherwise qualified and suitable for promotion.  Generally fixed period promotions apply only up to the rank of captain but in the case of certain professional officers such as medical officers and engineer officers there is provision for fixed period promotion up to the rank of commandant.</P>
      <P>The regulations prescribe that, apart from fixed period promotions, officers may be promoted only to fill vacancies in establishments.  There are general regulations and detailed instructions relating to promotion in the non-commissioned ranks of the permanent Defence Force.  Promotion in these ranks can be authorised by prescribed military authorities.  The prescribed authority for promotion to the rank of sergeant and higher non-commissioned officer rank is the adjutant-general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the factors which must be taken into account in considering men for promotion are length and nature of service, seniority, courses successfully <Col N="1182" /> completed, tests and examinations passed, age, physical fitness, conduct and character.  Promotion to the rank of sergeant and higher non-commissioned officer rank is made through the medium of interview boards who examine and place those found suitable for promotion in order of merit. Promotions can be made only to fill authorised vacancies in establishments.</P>
    <P>What I have said applies specifically to promotion in the permanent Defence Force.  There are separate Defence Force regulations governing promotion in the reserve Defence Force which comprises the first line reserve, An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí.  However, the broad principles governing promotion in the permanent Defence Force also apply to promotion in the reserve.</P>

      <P>Transatlantic calls are not ordinarily accepted from coinbox telephones because of the difficulty of <Col N="1195" /> collecting in the coinbox the large number of coins required to pay for such calls.  I am not aware that many coinbox renters suffer hardship as a result of this.  Special arrangements are made, on request, to enable coinbox subscribers to make transatlantic calls as a regular arrangement without the insertion of fees in the coinbox. In addition, individual international calls of a particularly urgent or important nature are accepted without prepayment from any rented coinbox telephone.</P>

If usage of that kiosk became sufficient to indicate there appeared to be greater demand in that area then we would be justified in re-investigating. However, when we have a kiosk such a short distance from the area to which the Deputy is referring and it is not sufficiently used, a case does not seem to exist for the provision of this kiosk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The actual telegram forms constitute the Department's record of telegrams sent and no special record is considered necessary.  I should, perhaps, explain that no payment is made in respect of official telegrams sent from my office, or, indeed, for any other official telegrams on Post Office business.  Similarly, no payment is made for telephone calls on Post Office business.  As stated in my reply to the Deputy's Parliamentary question on 27th November, the telegram forms for the period prior to 1st April, 1969, are no longer available.  Accordingly, it is not possible to give particulars of telegrams sent before April last.  Telegrams to the value of £15 approximately were sent from the office of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and Transport and Power during the periods 1st April to 22nd May and 20th June to 1st July. No record is kept of telephone calls dialled from my office.  It is not possible to distinguish between telephone trunk calls made from the Minister's office and those made from the former office of the Parliamentary Secretary. The total value of telegrams and telephone trunk calls made through an operator from both offices in the 12 months ended 30th September, 1969, was £150 approximately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Deputies spoke about our prisons and prisoners and the work of the visiting committee of St. Patrick's Institution.  Deputy Tunney who is a member of the visiting committee had some interesting points to contribute.  He has had, with others who have given their services to this work, considerable experience of what happens in these institutions.  He agreed with what was elicited by Deputy Bruton in a Dáil question that the average term spent by inmates is only four months and that we have to realise that training comparable to that given outside in a three to four year period, is just not feasible.  This, of course, is quite apart from the low level of intelligence and education generally among many of the inmates of these institutions.</P>
      <P>In his view&mdash;and I shall come to this in a moment because there has been some criticism&mdash;the food there is adequate and comparable to the food of many breadwinners though he makes the point that there should be a woman on the staff.  The psychologist that we get from the Appointments Commission may well be a woman and, if a second welfare officer is appointed, this officer may also be a woman.  Apart from that, I shall give due consideration to what was urged in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to assure Deputies who spoke about prison conditions for both staff and prisoners that there is no complacency about the position so far as my staff are concerned.  I attach considerable value to having a continuous review of every aspect of the prison system.  That is why I appointed a working group of governors and departmental officials to meet regularly <Col N="1204" /> and see how the system we have can be improved.  This does not suggest that we have not made very considerable improvements in these institutions in recent years, or that we have anything to be ashamed of in comparison with other countries.  We are employing a very sophisticated system of phased release to employment, utilising the temporary release provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say what objection he has to allowing a small group of Deputies to have a look around Mountjoy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that when I come to it.  I was giving an example of the system of phased release.  As I mentioned in my opening speech I am conscious of the need to develop an after-care service.  At present I have a report before me on this aspect of prison reform as well as on the probation system and I hope to be able to announce considerable progress when next year's Estimate comes up for consideration.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond suggested there was no good social reason why prisoners should not receive wages on the same basis as ordinary workers, with deductions for the maintenance of the prisoner himself and his dependants.  Under the hostel system in operation in Mountjoy and the system in St. Patrick's Institution of temporary releases for employment we are already releasing persons to earn full ordinary wages, from which we make deductions for dependants, as suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are difficulties of a very practical kind in paying prisoners ordinary wages for working inside a prison.  Many prisoners on committal would not be skilled enough, by commercial standards, to do the kind of work which can be provided and it would be difficult to provide training for the short time they are normally there.  Deputies will appreciate that the amount of work and the type of work that can be provided in a prison is very limited.  Those who were already highly skilled would be in receipt of higher wages and, accordingly, they would be better off <Col N="1205" /> than the majority of other prisoners and this could give rise to considerable friction.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned just a few of the difficulties of such a scheme.  I am, in principle, well disposed towards any scheme which would help to maintain a prisoner's self-respect and which would not interefere with the proper running of the prison, but this does not mean that you can have normal life in a prison.  Prisons exist for deterrent purposes as well as to rehabilitate prisoners.  In St. Patrick's and in Shanganagh there are chances of rehabilitating the young offenders but for the old lags who are coming back regularly to prison there is no great hope of doing much by way of rehabilitation.  I will, however, consider any scheme which could reasonably be worked within our prison system.</P>
    <P>Members of the St. Patrick's visiting committee have arranged with an electrical firm in Dublin for lampshades to be assembled by prisoners. They will be paid the ordinary rate for assembling each lamp.  This venture is still in the experimental stages, but I shall be very interested to see how it turns out.  I mentioned that to show Deputies interested in this field that we are trying new ideas in so far as it is possible to do so in these institutions.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Desmond that the existing prison buildings in Mountjoy, Portlaoise, and Limerick are out of date.  This problem faces many countries.  The cost of replacing prisons is such as to make it a very long-term prospect.  In fact, the buildings in Mountjoy&mdash;whatever they look like from outside&mdash;have been favourably commented on by visitors from other countries.  There is a good atmosphere inside, the buildings are bright and clean and, so far as prisons go, although the structures are very old, they are reasonably satisfactory.  I agree that they are old buildings and that it would be very nice if we could afford to have them replaced by modern buildings, but we do try to maintain them as best we can.  Another suggestion made by Deputy Desmond was that prisoners' insurance cards should be stamped for the duration <Col N="1206" /> of the prison sentence.  This would require legislation, but apart from that I do not know if this is an idea which would be generally accepted.  Certainly it has never been suggested to me before and many Deputies would consider it as going a bit too far in removing incidentals which would lessen the effect of the prison sentence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that some 200 prisoners leave prison every year without an address, let alone an insurance card, and that these are serious social problems?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with these problems in a moment.  I attach great importance to the desirability of prisoners being able to resume employment on release and I shall look into the suggestion but, as I have said, I can see many difficulties in implementing it.  In other countries, and we are starting it here now, there are hostels to which prisoners can go immediately they are released; this enables them to look for employment. There is a move in this country by some very public spirited people to establish one of these institutions in the city.  I would like to wish them well with their efforts.  This kind of work has been done in other countries, including England, by voluntary effort and charitable organisations and they are fulfilling a very useful function for prisoners.  I accept the criticism being made that it is inviting prisoners released with no money, and particularly those with no home ties, to sin again if they are helpless and left in that position.  This new venture, to which I have referred, would be a start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that some means might be devised for continuing the insurance stamps of the insured worker during his prison sentence?  He may come out and he may not qualify for another year and this is a crucial period in his life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall have the suggestion examined bearing in mind always that people have to suffer some disability when they get a prison sentence. Reference has also been made to the improvements of pay and conditions of prison officers.  A pay claim is being processed through the conciliation machinery of the Civil Service for these officers at present.  Claims relating to other conditions of service, such as overtime and allowances, are also being dealt with.  As will be evident from my replies to recent Dáil questions I have in mind the extension of training facilities for prison officers, particularly those who have to deal with young offenders.  I am glad there appears to be general agreement about the policy being pursued in Shanganagh, the open institution for young offenders.  Shanganagh provides a promising field for experimentation and I have no doubt that the venture will prove a worthwhile one.</P>
      <P>Some suggestions were made in regard to Shanganagh.  Some Deputies said they were surprised, and one Deputy said he was shocked, to learn that we were contemplating having only 50 people there.  The very best advice I can get is to the effect that this open institution would lose its effectiveness if there were a larger number of people there.  The fact that there are only this number means that they can be divided into groups and looked after in this special way and I am certain this is a far more effective way of trying to rehabilitate these young people.  I have already pointed out that these are picked from those in St. Patrick's Institution, young people who are in for the first time possibly and who seem anxious to benefit from the training they get there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the people whom, for their own protection, it is desirable to keep away from associating with some boys who have been in trouble before. It is ideal to have a rather small number in Shanganagh.  If there were too many there it would not be possible to give them the same attention, treatment and training. Results will take some time because we are only learning by experience in this field and it will take some time <Col N="1208" /> to discover whether or not what we are doing in Shanganagh will give permanent results.  So far, I am glad to say, it seems to be working very well. It is a vast improvement on anything we have had up to this.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy Dr. O'Donovan about the transfer of the lady who was the probation administration officer to the post of senior welfare officer in the Adoption Board, the salary of the post has not yet been officially settled and, accordingly, the Civil Service Commissioners have not yet been asked to decide whether it is necessary to have recertification in relation to the transfer.  The position is that the post of probation administration officer is now vacant and, as I explained, I do not propose to fill this vacancy, at least not until I have reached decisions on the various proposals in the comprehensive report to which I have referred with regard to probation and after-care services.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan raised the question of the recent disturbance in Mountjoy.  As I indicated in reply to a question tabled by him, charges are being preferred against the prisoners concerned and consequently I cannot discuss the matter since it is <i>sub judice.</i> I was pleased to hear the Deputy's good account of Portlaoise Prison though this is something I already knew myself.  His apprehensions with regard to Mountjoy will be dispelled when I tell him that the governor he met in Portlaoise, and to whom he paid tribute here, has been governor of Mountjoy since August last and the officer second-in-charge in Portlaoise, to whom he also paid tribute, is now deputy governor of Mountjoy.  That is not to say that the quantity or quality of the food supplied varies with anybody in charge.  The menu is there. From a dietary point of view it is adequate, irrespective of who administers it, so long as they ensure it is properly served.</P>
    <P>Because of the publicity about the food in Mountjoy I should like to put on the records of the House the fact that the diet in Mountjoy is both wholesome and adequate.  Breakfast consists of one pint of tea, eight ounces of bread, three-quarters of an ounce of <Col N="1209" /> margarine or one ounce of jam, and porridge and milk for anybody who wants it.  That is the breakfast prescribed. Dinner consists of six to eight ounces of meat, 16 to 20 ounces of potatoes, four ounces of vegetables, half a pint of milk, two to four ounces of bread, and milk pudding.  From the point of view of variety, in the case of meat there is mutton two days a week, beef two days a week, corned beef on one day and bacon on another.  The evening meal consists of one pint of tea, eight ounces of bread, three-quarters of an ounce of margarine or jam; and supper consists of one pint of tea, four ounces of bread and three-quarters of an ounce of jam.</P>
    <P>The food is sampled daily by the governor.  It is inspected by members of the visiting committee who, in the course of their unscheduled visits, regularly look over the food.  It is under the general purview of the resident medical officer.  I should like to say&mdash; this is something that should be said as it surprised me when I became Minister for Justice and it will probably surprise others&mdash;that practically every prisoner in Mountjoy puts on weight. When a prisoner starts to lose weight instead of putting it on, unless he happens to be slimming for his own good reasons, he is immediately checked by the medical officer.  Because of the criticisms and protests it is only right that these facts should be made public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>What serious objection has the Minister to the request from Deputy Dr. O'Donovan and myself that we should visit the prison with two members of the Labour Party?  We are not going for the purpose of embarrassing the Minister; we want to see for ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy got my letter and I explained fully to the Deputy my reasons for not acceding to his request, especially at this particular time.  I am quite sure that members of the Labour Party, if they want to visit Mountjoy, are well able to write to me and ask for my permission.  As I said, there are charges pending, serious charges, against these prisoners at <Col N="1210" /> the moment and it would be undesirable in the circumstances to allow Deputy O.J. Flanagan to visit there. There is a visiting committee of public-spirited citizens who visit regularly. When the trial of these people is over I will consider letting Deputy Flanagan in to see conditions for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan also raised the question of paying for the work performed by the prisoners. Deputies may not realise that one-fourth of a prisoner's sentence is remitted for industry and good conduct. The question of providing work for prisoners sufficiently productive to enable payment at ordinary rates to be made to them is not uncomplicated. It is understandable that in a situation of less than full employment there are reservations in some quarters with regard to industrial activity on any real scale in prisons outside of what might be regarded as therapeutic work. I have the rate of gratuity paid to prisoners under review at the moment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton covered a great deal of ground.  He said he was not unappreciative of what has been done and is being done by my Department to bring about reform in this field. I welcome his approach.  I expect the progress that has been made to continue, particularly on the probation and after-care side and in the efforts to rehabilitate those committed to our prisons.  Anybody who has experience in this field will recognise the severe limitations that are imposed by the small number of prisoners, the short periods they spend there at any one time, the intelligence factor and lack of education of many of them.  Apart from these limitations there is the effect of institutionalisation, living in a wholly artificial community, which militates always against the prospects of rehabilitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not deal with all the points made by the Deputy but I shall try to cover some of the main ones.  Some of the points he made were quite interesting.  I want to deal with the problem he mentioned of overcrowding. <Col N="1211" /> We have accommodation at present for slightly over 1,100 and we can take some comfort in the fact that, taking yesterday's figures, the total population in custody is 602.  By and large, we are still in the happy position where our prisons are only half full notwithstanding the great number of them that have been closed through the years up and down the country. There was some overcrowding in St. Patrick's Institution last year but this problem seems to have resolved itself at least for the present.  I checked yesterday and there were 187 detainees in St. Patrick's where officially there is accommodation for 229.  I have already dealt with what Deputy Bruton said about Shanganagh and I have told him and the House that a figure of 50 or 60 is generally thought to be an ideal figure for an open institution.  I gave reasons for this.  The position is that the sort of individualised rehabilitation that we are trying in Shanganagh can best work with a number of the magnitude I mentioned.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the Deputy's views about visiting committees. Primarily, these committees are there to ensure that prisons are properly administered and prisoners properly treated.  There is no necessity for such people to be competent in criminology or penology or any of the other sciences the Deputy mentioned.  We want people of integrity with commonsense who will see that the prisoners are properly looked after and who will make suggestions as to what can be done with them or suggestions to improve the kind of work provided for them and who will ensure in particular that the food prescribed for them is served to them.  We are fortunate in our visiting committees.  I have every confidence in them.  I have met them since I took office as Minister for Justice&mdash;I knew some of them before&mdash;and I know they are dedicated to the work they do.  I know how public spirited they are, not alone in doing their duty as members of a visiting committee but in the personal interest that very many of them have taken in trying to provide employment for prisoners they know inside, and keeping up an interest in them <Col N="1212" /> when they leave the prison which, I suppose, we can broadly call after-care. Very useful work has been and is being done by these people.  I do not know what would be achieved by having professionals of the type advocated on a committee of this kind. It is far better and more effective to get people who give their time, particularly business people who, perhaps, can provide employment themselves for some prisoners or can persuade their business friends to do so.  This is the kind of person who is particularly needed if he is prepared to sacrifice his time in this great charitable work.</P>
    <P>As regards compensatory education in St. Patrick's, that is, education which tries to compensate for the prisoner's lack of earlier education, the Deputy is pushing an open door as far as I am concerned.  We have reached decisions as to how the process is to be organised with a psychologist to assess the individual needs of educationally-backward boys and to programme the particular instruction to be imparted and to co-ordinate the work generally.  Instructors will be provided and, in addition, the services of student teachers from St. Patrick's Training College, Drumcondra, will be integrated in the new system.  These students generously offered their services about a year ago.  Pending the reorganisation of compensatory education in the Institution and their integration into it, they were asked to participate on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  They have done this and it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge it and pay public tribute to them here for their interest and work.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with what the Deputy suggests regarding the placement of prisoners in employment.  There are two distinct factors here.  One is the assessment of the person concerned as to the range of occupations for which he has an aptitude and the other is to find a vacancy for him in the employment sector indicated.  The first task, I accept, gives scope for a psychologist and we shall have the psychologist in addition to the psychological services outside the prison which will be available as heretofore. The second task is for placement officers.  At present most of this <Col N="1213" /> work is done by the welfare officers as part of their social work for prisoners. What is needed for the successful placement of an offender&mdash;or anybody else &mdash;is a knowledge of where the type of employment indicated is to be sought and also good relations with a wide range of employers and other placement services and, of course, an aptitude for the task.</P>
    <P>The success of our existing welfare officers in the matter of placement discloses an expertise far in advance of the mere goodwill and enthusiasm which the Deputy mentioned.  They have been quite successful.</P>
    <P>The report on probation, prisons, welfare and after-care which I am considering at the moment deals also with staff training for the prison service. While the smallness of our services presents substantial difficulties we are trying to overcome them.  There is no easy way out of this.  These difficulties cannot be overcome nearly as easily as Deputy Bruton suggests.  I should like to know what I should do about vacancies that arise in the prison service between the time they arise and Deputy Bruton's proposed entry date for recruits in the following April.  We would have a big gap there and for the most obvious reasons, custodial reasons, posts must be manned and this results in staggered entry.  In view of the small number of officers in the whole service, the withdrawal of a sizeable group at any one time to undergo special training could also create a very grave if not insurmountable difficulty. But we can have a look at the position.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy O'Connell's contribution about drug users in Mountjoy, I do not know what more can be done. I had instructions issued to Mountjoy and St Patrick's last October that drug users were to be put in contact either with the newly-opened clinic in Jervis Street or the unit in St. Brendan's even during the currency of their sentences if the resident medical officer considered that this would be beneficial.  I am prepared to operate the temporary release provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, to facilitate this development in cases where the resident medical officer so suggests or advises.</P>
    <Col N="1214" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the RMO has asked for such a unit in Mountjoy for the treatment of those in custody?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The RMO in Mountjoy has been operating the system to which I have referred here.  I suppose that, like any other doctor, he would welcome a complete hospital of his own there.  Mountjoy is a prison and it is not a prison for curing drug addicts.  It is a prison in the normal sense, as that term is understood.  I am pointing out that where the RMO, in his wisdom, considers that a prisoner who is a drug addict should get treatment which he himself cannot give him with the facilities he has, he can send him out to where he can get such treatment.  I think that is reasonably satisfactory.  The small number involved in this does not make a great difference so far as the prison is concerned.  Authority has been given so that the RMO may have them sent out if he feels that this should be done.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell also raised the case of an 18-year-old girl who was in the Central Mental Hospital.  This unfortunate girl was committed on remand to Mountjoy on 31st May last by the Dublin District Court.  On 4th June she was again remanded in custody until 6th June and a further remand, I am told, was made on 10th June.  Evidence was given by the Mountjoy resident medical officer of the defendant's inability to plead.  She was remanded in custody again to 17th June. In the meantime, on 11th June, she was certified to be of unsound mind by two doctors and as being likely to benefit from being placed in the Central Mental Hospital to which she was removed on 13th June.  On 17th June this defendent, who was then in the Central Mental Hospital, was remanded in custody to 16th September.  On that date, she was again remanded to 14th October.  The case against her was then dismissed under the Probation of Offenders Act and, as far as my information goes, she was discharged in care of her parents This is the history of this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1215" /> The Deputy wrote to me about this girl on 2nd July.  He said he was writing on behalf of the girl's father who was upset about his daughter's being committed to the Central Mental Hospital as she was not a criminal. The Deputy said the father was anxious that I would initiate investigations into the reasons why she was not granted bail and that she be permitted to go free under the protective custody of her father.  I want to put it on the records of the House that the Deputy got this reply from me through my private secretary:</P>
    <P>Miss Murphy was remanded in Mountjoy Prison by the Dublin District Court on 31st May last on a charge of malicious damage to a shop window.  While on remand, she was certified by two doctors to be of unsound mind and to be likely to derive benefit from being placed in the Central Mental Hospital. Accordingly, the Minister ordered, on 12th June that she be removed to that hospital.</P>
    <P>On 17th June the District Court ordered that she be remanded to the sitting of that court on 16th September at 2 p.m.  You will appreciate that the grant of bail to Miss Murphy would be exclusively a matter for the court and that the Minister had no power to order release, temporary or otherwise, in cases of this kind.</P>
    <P>These are the facts about this case.  I really do not know what the Deputy's complaint is because, in accordance with law, two doctors found this unfortunate girl to be a mental case and they expected that she would benefit from this treatment and she was sent where she would benefit from it.  In that situation, neither do I know how any court would release this girl to the custody of her parents when she was in this condition.  These are the facts of the case which were given to the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

      <P>Deputy Bruton ranged across the Landlord and Tenants Acts from 1931 and suggested we should codify the law and do the same with the Deasy's Act. There is a big amount of Deasy's Act, 1860, already gone.  At all events, the Conroy Commission on landlord and tenant law set up in 1966, was given the task of reviewing and consolidating the entire landlord and tenant law and have already reported on occupational tenancies and on certain questions arising on reversionary leases and on the purchase of ground rents.  There are two interim reports, as the Deputy probably knows.  The legislation to which I referred in my introductory speech is designed to incorporate the recommendations of the reports in a consolidating landlord and tenant Bill to replace the 1931 and subsequent landlord and tenant legislation.</P>
      <P>The commission are now engaged on the final stage of their inquiry, that is, the amendment and consolidation of the general body of the law of landlord and tenant.  This will involve not only a restatement of what is left of Deasy's Act but also the incorporation of the proposed new Act and, indeed, probably of the Rent Restrictions Act as well.  What I said in my introductory speech, in case the Deputy is interested, was intended to cover all this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>When we get a report from the commission it will have to be studied by my officials.  It does not follow that we will accept it all.  Generally we do in legal matters of this kind, but there are other matters which we often add to the legislation, particularly when we are dealing with a codification.  I could not say offhand how long it will take because, in legislation of this kind, apart from the calls on my staff, there are also the calls on the Parliamentary draftsman.  I would not be able to tell the Deputy the exact timetable, but I can say that the legislation is on the way and that it is being worked on.</P>
      <P>So far as the newspapers which Deputy Dowling handed to me are concerned, I believe they must have come in, as he suggested, as packing material of some kind.  All I have to say about the checking of productions of this kind is that it is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners or in other words for the customs officers.  I know that they operate at ships but possibly they would not be on the lookout for stuff of this kind.  From inquiries I have made I do not believe they are coming in here&mdash;the stuff which Deputy Dowling handed me&mdash;as papers in the normal way.  I believe they must be coming in, in the form of bulk packing for some goods, and possibly people get hold of them for the purpose of selling them.  At all events, I have conveyed what the Deputy had to say about them to the Revenue Commissioners and no doubt they will check on how they are arriving here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of courthouses which was raised is the responsibility of the local authorities and not my responsibility. I and my predecessors have regularly asked the local authorities to carry out their statutory responsibility which is provided for under the Courthouses (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935.  Deputy Andrews and some other Deputies complained about this.  Speaking for myself, I think that if you had even one decent courthouse in each county it would be a <Col N="1219" /> very fine thing, particularly in view of the new plans I have referred to for the decentralisation of the courts.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, as every member who serves on a county council knows, councils are not prone to use any of their resources on the maintenance of courthouses or their improvement or their building.  It is possible that we will have legislation here before very long on which the House can discuss this matter, assess the position as between the local authorities and the State, and we can see if a more satisfactory system can be worked out. I know from my own experience&mdash;and, indeed, I had deputations on this matter recently&mdash;that local authorities do not want to spend any money on courthouses. I suppose they generally take the view in one way or another that some outside Santa Claus should provide money for this purpose.</P>
    <P>At all events courthouses are necessary and must be provided.  Many of those buildings, as we all know, are very old and very difficult to maintain in a proper state of repair.  Unfortunately, this is a field long neglected that will have to be dealt with by someone if not by the local authorities. At the moment, however, I wish the local authorities would concentrate on having proper accommodation at least in the county town or the capital town of each county.  Generally, these are the places specified for the holding of the High Court and the circuit court. Under the new proposals I will be bringing to the House, they are the places where the High Court judges will sit to hear original actions, of which there will be more in the future. I hope the local authorities will take due note of that fact.</P>
    <P>I come now to the personal letter written by me to a constituent.  As this was the only contribution made by Deputy Sweetman to this debate&mdash; he came into this House for the sole purpose of producing this purloined letter&mdash;there are a few facts about it which I want to put on the record to keep it right.  Mrs. Quinn was one of the ladies in this case.  She had a very young and expanding family.  At this particular time&mdash;I am talking <Col N="1220" /> about a considerable time ago because Deputy Sweetman has been hatching this letter for a long time&mdash;she was on the housing list of the local authority. She was second on that list for rehousing and she was in a very bad way at the particular point of time I am speaking of in regard to getting accommodation.  She was expecting an addition to her family.  She was with me and I was trying to help her &mdash;as would any working Deputy in any part of the House.  Deputy Sweetman might not appreciate this, but Deputies work for their constituents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This good lady came to me.  She had been with me a number of times trying to get housing accommodation and she came to me with what she thought was good news on this particular day.  She told me that her cousin, Mrs. O'Malley, who was a tenant of the council in a good new house, a good modern house, was intending to leave the town to go to friends in England and that she was prepared, as the woman put it, to sell her the key.  In other words, if she was in a legal position to do it, I take it that she would be prepared to transfer her tenancy for money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I told Mrs. Quinn that I would see the officials about the matter that very day&mdash;on the Monday before I left for Dublin&mdash;and try to ascertain the position. She said Mrs. O'Malley was going to take her in there and then, that very week, and I told her to move in by all means.  I said: &ldquo;This is a God-send for you,&rdquo; which it was.  I went and I saw the officials to discover&mdash;I want to put the facts before the House&mdash;that Mrs. O'Malley, who was the official tenant of the urban council, had not purchased her cottage, had not applied for the purchase of the tenancy under the law as it stands.  She had not exercised her option to purchase and, at this particular point of time, I ascertained that she was late under the scheme to exercise that option.  There was evidently a time limit under the law, and the officials told me that this time <Col N="1221" /> limit had expired and that Mrs. O'Malley could not at that point of time exercise her option to purchase because if she could she obviously would have done so and enabled her cousin to come in for whatever they would agree on as regards price.  She would, of course, have to be approved, as these cases have to be, by the county officials or the county manager.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There was a purchase scheme for tenants and they had to opt to purchase within a certain time, not purchase in the sense the Deputy understands it by paying a lump sum of money, but the amount would be put on to the rent which would go towards buying out the house in question.  This woman, Mrs. O'Malley, had been in this house for quite a long time.  She evidently did not bother exercising this option and the time had expired for her to exercise it.</P>

      <P>Legally.  When I had inquired as to what the legal position was from the official concerned, I came back, at about four o'clock in the afternoon, to see this woman who was so anxious to find out whether she would have to pay some money or what the position was.  She was out doing her shopping.  She had the door locked with her children inside it.  I had to wend my way towards this city the following morning, and because this was an urgent matter I wrote to this lady confirming what I had already said to her verbally, to go into the house where Mrs. O'Malley was willing to take her, confirming the legal position as ascertained from the officials about purchasing the house, that the other woman, Mrs. O'Malley, her cousin, had no right to charge her key money, that she was late to exercise the option, and that she herself should move into the house quietly.  For obvious reasons I told her what to do with the letter. Although Mrs. Quinn was second on the waiting list she would have to go <Col N="1222" /> through the usual red tape which officials have to apply in these cases.</P>

Mrs. O'Malley was in this house for several weeks after that.  This woman did not break into any house. She was not advised by me to break any law.  She did not break any law. This woman did at least have the comfort, that I suppose Deputy Sweetman would not understand, of washing her new baby in a nice modern house with plenty of room.  The working Deputies in the Fine Gael Party sitting behind Deputy Sweetman will understand, because they would not be here otherwise, that Deputies try to help their constituents, particularly constituents in the need that this unfortunate woman was in.  A gentleman came along to this woman's door demanding to know how she was there.  She told him the situation and that she had had this letter from me, whereupon he grabbed it and ran away with it.  That gentleman has hawked that letter from Galway city to Sligo town trying to get somebody low enough in this House to use it.  He has been at that for 12 solid months.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The widow&rdquo; FitzGerald will not cross-examine me. I shall deal with this in my own way. Deputy &ldquo;Sir Gerald Nabarro&rdquo; Sweetman would not understand the vicissitudes of a woman like Mrs. Quinn.  He is much more used to going into his manor down in Kildare and, when the châtelaine announces that there are agricultural types outside, taking off his riding clothes and coming down to meet them.  He would understand the worm-cutters of Kildare lifting their caps and opening their gates for him.  He would not understand the unfortunate position of this woman with a large family in a crowded room and the opportunity there was for a working Deputy to help her out of her misery.  That is something Deputy Sweetman does not understand and that is why Deputy <Col N="1224" /> Harte has his butcher's knife out to remove him from the front bench of Fine Gael, and it might be a good thing, because, perhaps, it would enable the front bench opposite to be manned by working Deputies who know what is going on in the country and who know how people should be helped by working Deputies.  The one profit Deputy Sweetman thought he would get out of this letter was that he would spring it upon me when, in fact, people who were concerned in this letter well know, as Deputies in the House well know, what obviously Deputy Sweetman does not know, that they should and must do their best to help and be concerned for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Allegations were made by Deputy L'Estrange about the theft of meat from the mental hospital in Limerick.  I have made inquiries and <Col N="1227" /> the following are the facts.  The three accused men were charged with the theft of £800 worth of meat.  They pleaded guilty and were sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment each.  It is possible that further quantities of meat were stolen and this has been freely suggested.  But there is no evidence whatever to substantiate that suggestion. The sources of such evidence, if it existed, would be the hospital authorities.  They were not in a position to supply any such evidence.  On the contrary, they had been totally unaware of what had been happening until they were informed by the Garda who commenced the investigation on their own initiative.  Deputy L'Estrange tried to convey the idea that the trial judge in this case complained about suppression of evidence.  He did nothing of the kind.  Unlike Deputy L'Estrange, he recognised that in a case of this nature what can be proved is not necessarily all that happened.  The Deputy forgot to mention that, far from suggesting the accused were not being adequately punished, the judge gave one of them the option of commencing his sentence there and then or after a lapse of one year.  This was to enable him to make arrangements for the conduct of his business before going to jail.  The man did not avail himself of this particular option which the judge gave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well known to everybody who has the slightest knowledge of criminal procedure that where money or goods have been stolen over a period and the loss has not been noticed by the injured party it is practically impossible to prove the charge in relation to the full amount unless the accused person sees fit to admit it.  Accordingly, the prosecution had to confine the charge to the amount that could be proved to have been stolen unless the defendants were prepared to admit to more than that.  The Deputy might ask how could a charge of stealing meat six months previously be sustained when the people who were supposed to have had the meat stolen from them could not even say whether any meat had been stolen at that time.  it is utter nonsense to suggest that the police in Limerick suppressed evidence.  They <Col N="1228" /> could not have done so even if they wanted to because the hospital authorities would have known the facts and would have objected.  These are the facts in connection with these people who were convicted for stealing this meat.  They were convicted in respect of all that could be proved against them.  If more meat than that was stolen, the hospital authorities were unable to give evidence of it.  These men got sentences of 12 months imprisonment. Let me say for the record that about a fortnight ago I got a petition in respect of one of these men to release him for a period before Christmas, a petition which I, in my wisdom, refused.  These are the facts in connection with this case.</P>
    <P>Let me also say for the record that I understand Deputy L'Estrange here alleged that the State Solicitor in Cork was involved in an accident and that something was fixed up for him.  I am glad to say that the State Solicitor in Cork was not involved in any accident and that it was incorrect to make such allegations.  Deputy L'Estrange has made several other allegations and I want to put it to this House&mdash;particularly to Fine Gael, because Deputy L'Estrange was back again with allegations of corruption against judges on another Estimate&mdash;he returns weekly to this point like a dog to his vomit&mdash; that the judges of this country are there to uphold our Constitution, that they are independent people and that it is for them to decide each case as it comes before them on the evidence that is put before them.</P>
    <P>Do Deputies want the Dáil to assemble here and reverse decisions of the courts without hearing any of the evidence? Is it to be the practice that we are to criticise a judge for what he has done with the benefit of all the evidence and of all the people in the witness box?  If we want to preserve the judicial system, as we have it in our community, as an impartial body, if we are to preserve these men as upholders of the Constitution, let us do one of two things.  Let us put an end to these irresponsible charges being made by Deputy L'Estrange, week in, week out, for his own miserable political purposes.  Let Fine Gael either <Col N="1229" /> disown him or follow the procedure that is laid down to deal with judges, that is to put down a motion in this House to impeach any particular judge they are dissatisfied with.  That is what is provided under our law, under our Constitution, and let us have no more of this responsible Deputy &ldquo;Gerald Nabarro&rdquo; Sweetman sitting nonchalantly in the front bench while his irresponsible Deputy L'Estrange comes in here alleging that judges are being bribed or are subject to corruption. Let us put an end to this farce.  This is a serious question.  This is a question of democracy.  It is a serious question for Deputies and it is a serious question for our people.</P>

      <P>I will deal with Deputy Desmond in my own time.  Whether I practise or do not practise has nothing whatsoever to do with the question of the judges we are speaking about.  Judges in this country are independent people; many of them differ in their political views.  They were appointed by different Governments, and we have a situation, from the Supreme Court down to the district court, that if there is a complaint about a judge there is a procedure whereby it can be brought into the Dáil and it takes, under our law, speaking from memory, two-thirds of Dáil Éireann to impeach any particular judge and to remove him from office.</P>
      <P>It is the duty of those who allege there is a corrupt judge operating to say so in the way that can be answered here.  It is their duty to make the case in the way it can be answered here, but this niggling performance week in, week out, by Deputy L'Estrange, making wild allegations that cannot be substantiated about judges and court cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is up to Fine Gael to put these complaints through the proper procedure or to end their allegations about bribery and corruption and leave the leprechaun L'Estrange outside to his own irresponsibility.  We have reached a stage in this House when the House must take due notice of this because it is too important to be overlooked. I have dealt with all the main points that were mentioned by different Deputies in as broad a way as I could in the time at my disposal.  Deputy O'Brien had some comments to make&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an expression in America to the effect that you have got to go to the source.  Perhaps in this case I should ignore the source, and, if I did, I am sure some of the Deputies sitting behind Deputy O'Brien, his colleagues, might not take it amiss.  At all events, there are a couple of things I wish to say about him.  I have been misquoted and I must deal with it. When I say &ldquo;misquoted&rdquo; I want to make it clear that what I mean is that Deputy O'Brien, undoubtedly taking advantage of his Ghanaian training, picked out part of one sentence out of five pages of my speech for the purpose of twisting it towards his own ends.  He picked out this:</P>
      <P>.... the conflicting claims of those who want to use the streets and of those who want to go about their lawful business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He picked out that sentence or part sentence which I uttered when I was dealing with riots.  Deputy O'Brien was quite careful not to quote me fully, although I demanded it.  He said he did not have to recite every word.  It is to be expected of Deputy O'Brien, from <Col N="1231" /> his training in this field and his practice in that temple of liberty, Ghana, that he would just pick out part of a sentence and hang it round somebody's neck and allege it represented the whole sense of his speech.</P>
    <P>On that occasion I was dealing at length in the House with this matter of protest.  I was pointing out the conflicting interests that undoubtedly there are between protesters and those who want to use the streets at the same time for other purposes.  Of course there is a conflict of interests.  I am on record in the House as saying that I, as Minister for Justice, would protect Deputy O'Brien in so far as I could when he is protesting, and he has long practice in protesting.  While I would protect Deputy O'Brien, little as he deserves it, on occasions, other people have a right to use the streets, too.  Although we give protection, no matter how unrepresentative the protesters, we also try to ensure that the ordinary man and woman can go about their lawful occasions. That has been my policy and it will be my policy while I am Minister for Justice.  I will not willingly allow a crowd to sit across the street and stop the ordinary working man going to his work or the ordinary woman going to or coming from her home.</P>
    <P>I have said all this time and again but he picked this out to suggest that I would seek to deprive him in some way of his right to protest.  Deputy O'Brien is very lucky to be in this country.  He did not do much protesting while he was Nkrumah's pet lapdog for so long.  Protesting would not get him very far there because, when he was there, Nkrumah himself either cut up and murdered his opponents or else castrated them.  That was the position when Deputy O'Brien was Nkrumah's guide, philosopher and friend.</P>
    <P>When he goes to America he can afford to protest because he knows he is in a democracy and, even though he clashes with the police, he gets away with it.  Is he not the great man for the travelling&mdash;to Katanga and back, to Ghana and back, and to Mexico and back all in one week, but in all <Col N="1232" /> his travels the only places he has done his protesting were in the Republic of Ireland or some other democracy where he could feel quite safe.</P>

      <P>I cannot allow him to misquote me in what I have been saying on this particular issue.  I do not know how far his philosophy is adopted by those who sit beside him because it would appear that he has a philosophy of his own for every occasion.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party in this three-quarters of a nation has been dominated for years by dismal poltroons, on the lines of O'Casey's Uncle Payther.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was in the year 1966 and not ten years ago.  This is Deputy O'Brien's concept or opinion of his own colleagues. Is Deputy Michael Pat Murphy a poltroon?  Is Deputy Corish a poltroon?  Is Deputy Dan Spring a poltroon?  Mark the way the word <Col N="1233" />&ldquo;poltroon&rdquo; is defined in two dictionaries. In one dictionary&mdash;the Concise Oxford Dictionary&mdash;it is defined as &ldquo;a spiritless coward&rdquo; while in the Oxford English Dictionary it is given as &ldquo;a mean-spirited worthless wretch; a craven.&rdquo; This is how Deputy O'Brien terms his colleagues.  This is his opinion of the Labour leaders in this country for many years past.  This is the new socialist.  This is the new Nkrumah.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say to the three Irish Labour Parties as well as to the five Fine Gael Parties that the quicker they have a look at the poltroons around them and the quicker they weed them out the better or they will be in the same trouble as Fine Gael have been in for the past fortnight. Fine Gael are stuck with the question whether Deputy FitzGerald or Deputy O'Higgins is to be the new leader. They are stuck with this infiltration that is coming in the dead of the night with all the warring factions to cut poor Deputy Cosgrave's throat.</P>
      <P>They must take those steps in time so that the same fate will not befall the Labour Party as we have witnessed with the Fine Gael Party in this House. As far as I am concerned I will try to ensure protection for them even if I have to use the legal process of binding them to the peace, but I ask them to save me that trouble by behaving themselves.</P>
      <P>The three of them can sit together on the Fine Gael front bench over there for the first time in a month now that they have reached the stage of unity and harmony but let us say a silent prayer to the gods of the Ó Moráins: From the fury of the long knives of Fine Gael, may the Lord protect Deputy Liam Cosgrave!</P>

The House will be aware, due to the close down of the mines in Castlecomer, there was a grave economic catastrophe facing that area and in order to overcome it it was provided that the area would be entitled to the level of grants which would otherwise be available only in the then undeveloped areas.  A similar situation was dealt with in Dundalk on a limited basis, that is, for a period of one year.  It is to cover that kind of situation that the power is being asked for here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish quite understandably intervened in the discussion I was having with the Minister. The Minister has not really clarified this point at all.  I should like to refer to the two clauses and I would like the Minister to distinguish between them and explain to me why one is of broader scope than the other. The 1952 Act says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Act applies to each of the following areas, the congested areas and (b) any other area to which <Col N="1240" /> by order of the Minister the Act is for the time being declared to apply.</P>
    <P>The new wording is:</P>
    <P>() any area which the Minister from time to time, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, declares by order to be a designated area.</P>
    <P>The wording is different but I am not at all clear as to why the second wording is necessary.  Could the Minister explain the nature of the legal doubt that has arisen in connection with 3 (1) (b) of the 1952 Act?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have the point that Deputy FitzGerald is making.  He can correct me if I have not.  Perhaps he would look at paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).  Paragraph (a) is clear enough; (b) is included to cover those areas to which the application of the additional grants was applied and (c) is to cover future cases that might arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister left this particular power in 3 (1) (b) in existence, would that not cover the case?  As I understand it, the Minister has not repealed 3 (1) (b).  If this has not been repealed, then it is continuing and he has added another power which seems to be worded in a different way with exactly the same effect except that it has this limitation &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;. It seems bad practice to have two different powers identical in effect, one of which requires the consent of the Minister for Finance and the other which does not.  This will cause legal confusion which the Minister is hoping to avoid by introducing this additional section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand it was considered necessary not to repeal the section to which the Deputy refers because some areas have been scheduled under it but any such case which would arise in the future would be dealt with under 6 (1) (c) of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister is saying, therefore, is not that there is legal doubt, but that he or somebody has decided that in future the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="1241" /> shall not have the power to make this declaration on his own account but must have the consent of the Minister for Finance.  This is a different proposition to the one the Minister put to us earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy is correct but in case he wants to make any point about it I should tell him that the provision that this should be done with the consent of the Minister for Finance was my proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is interesting but it seems to me an extraordinary procedure and one I have not come across before in a short period of four years of legislative experience.  To introduce this new section with limited power while continuing the old section, which is of identical effect, does not seem a good practice.  I would ask the Minister to say whether he is standing by his earlier statement that there is a legal defect in 3 (1) (b) or if there is some limitation in it.  If, on the other hand, his point is that he wishes to limit the power in 3 (1) (b) of the 1952 Act by introducing this requirement &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo; would it not have been better to introduce that as an amendment to the section already there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only tell the Deputy with regard to the legal difficulty that I was informed there was legal doubt about it, but I cannot tell him what it was.  I should, perhaps, remind him that under the Finance Act free depreciation applies to the undeveloped areas and, therefore, if any action were to be taken to include another area in what we will now call the &ldquo;designated areas&rdquo; it would be necessary for the Minister for Finance to be concerned with this because of the application of free depreciation. This is one of the reasons for the provision in regard to the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The Deputy will appreciate that in an instance where town X was to be scheduled under this, in order to apply the provisions of the Finance Act to make available free depreciation in that area, <Col N="1242" /> this would involve the Minister for Finance and this is one of the reasons for this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that point; I can see the reason for including the Minister for Finance and I quite accept that.  However, that does not really deal with the point.  Frankly, I think it is unsatisfactory to come into the House and say there is some legal difficulty that requires something to be changed.  The Minister has a duty to explain the reason for the change of wording.  There is a practice of hiding behind the Parliamentary draftsman but at this stage it seems the Minister is hiding behind general legal advice. We should be told about that and I should like if the Minister could arrange to find out and let us know at an appropriate time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not really necessary because I do not think the Deputy has yet made it clear&mdash;certainly not to me&mdash;exactly what his point is, what is his objection to the wording of the section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Some areas which were scheduled under that Act are still scheduled in that way.  It would be a more complicated amendment to repeal section 3 of the 1952 Act and provide for the inclusion of those areas scheduled under it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister really must explain to us more clearly.  The Bill he has brought in has in section 6 (1) (a) and (b) made that provision. The Bill tells us:</P>
      <P>Each of the following shall be a designated area for the purpose of this Act&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the congested areas as defined in section 3 of the Act of 1952,</P>
      <P>&mdash;that repeats 3 (1) (a) and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1243" /> (b)  an area which before the commencement of this section was declared by an order under section 3 of the Act of 1952 to be an area to which that Act applied,</P>
    <P>This means that the Minister has specifically covered the provisions of section 3 (1) (a).</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Why has the Minister not repealed it then?  He has given no explanation of the failure to repeal that.  He has incorporated the present position out of 3 (1) of the 1952 Act in this measure and there is, therefore, no reason to continue the powers under 3 (1).  I want to know why he has continued them.</P>

The Minister has explained the reason for continuing it because the areas already covered must be maintained as undeveloped areas but in section 6 (1) (a) and (b) of this measure he is doing this.

The point of the Deputy's question is really what criteria will be used as regards the length of time, for instance.  This will depend on the circumstances.  As I said, in the case of Dundalk one year was applied.  In the case of Castlecomer, it has been in operation for a number of years and continues to be in operation.

      <P>My objection is, as a matter of principle, to retaining a provision in an old Act and supplementing it by a provision in a new Bill which appears to be identical in effect, though with a restrictive clause in it, because this creates a situation in which the Minister can opt for one or the other.  It seems to me to be wrong.  In any legisation it should be quite clear under what legislation a Minister is acting and whether or not there is a restriction in it.  I do not think the Minister should have this double option in this matter.  It is simply bad legislation.</P>

      <P>In this section there is a provision, and indeed this applies to other sections as well, which explicitly excludes the Shannon Customs Free Airport and the activities of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company from the provisions of this Bill.  This is a good thing.  I would not quarrel with it in any way but is it not the case that Gaeltarra Éireann have similar powers in parts of the country and could the Minister say how those powers are reconciled with the powers here?  They are obviously not excluded from the provisions of this Bill as the SFADCO powers are.  Is there a reason for this? I must confess that I am not at this moment familiar with the details of the Gaeltarra Éireann powers but I understand they have powers akin to those of SFADCO and the IDA. Could the Minister say what these powers are and to what extent they will be subsumed in this Bill or to what extent the IDA will be given power to take over their function as there is no explicit exclusion of Gaeltarra Éireann here?</P>

      <P>Gaeltarra Éireann's powers are largely similar to those of the IDA; they are not exactly the same.  To some extent they are broader but in substance they are the same powers.  However, Gaeltarra Éireann's powers can be exercised only within the Gaeltacht areas.  There is co-ordination between Gaeltarra Éireann and the IDA.  In fact, what happens is that the IDA advise Gaeltarra Éireann on projects which are assessed and have to be of course in relation to the possibility that there might be similar projects in the pipeline of the IDA.  This would mean they would have to make up their minds which one they would go for.  Administratively, there is very full co-ordination and co-operation between the two bodies but it is possible, and indeed it happens on occasions, that somebody might wish to obtain a grant in the Gaeltacht areas but would not be willing to comply with all the conditions imposed by Gaeltarra Éireann some of which include requirements in relation to the use of the Irish language. Somebody might wish to obtain a grant but not to comply with these conditions in which case he would be entitled to deal with the IDA but could not deal with Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not quite explain the position.  I quite accept that there is co-ordination; I did not suggest that there was not.  I must say that the system outlined by the Minister seems, <i>prima facie</i>, to be reasonable. The IDA have obviously much more expertise than it would be right or proper for Gaeltarra Éireann to build up.  This is only one aspect of their work.  That Gaeltarra Éireann should use the IDA to assist them in their work seems quite proper.  What I am concerned about is that this section specifically excludes Shannon Free Airport, as do other sections, and it seems to me that we have two schemes operating here, the IDA scheme and the SFADCO scheme, separately.  I see merit in this but I am wondering why the same thing is <Col N="1248" /> not done with Gaeltarra Éireann.  Of course there is consultation but there is also consultation with SFADCO. The Minister surely is not suggesting that SFADCO are going ahead with projects without consulting the IDA? There is very close consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Therefore, this question of consultation does not explain anything.  There is a different treatment of Gaeltarra Éireann from SFADCO.  There must be some reason for the different treatment.  I am not objecting to it.  I am merely asking why there is different treatment.  In both cases the bodies provide a grant in specified parts of the country; in both cases they consult with the IDA.  I am sure that SFADCO would not only consult in order to co-ordinate but would also make use of the expert skills and services of the IDA where appropriate.  I see no reason for treating Gaeltarra Éireann in a different manner.  There may be a reason which I have not thought of and I would ask the Minister to say what it is.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy was diverted when I gave it.  The reason I mentioned was that Gaeltarra Éireann apply certain conditions which include, very often, provisions about the use of the Irish language.  Some promoters might wish to promote an industry in the Gaeltacht but they might not wish to comply with that condition.  They would not, therefore, be able to obtain a grant from Gaeltarra Éireann and if the powers under this Bill did not apply then they would not be able to obtain a grant at all.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to state his attitude to the Irish National Productivity Committee. Under section 11 (1) the IDA is the body with national responsibility for the furtherance of industrial development and in that context it could be meant to include the INPC, which is a move I would not agree with.  Section 11 (3) deals with industrial estates.  At the moment, at least, in Waterford they are catering for a small specialised type of firm.  I should like the Minister to state if he would be favourably disposed to the establishment of heavier types of industry in these industrial estates.  Section 11 (4) comes into conflict with the objectives of the National Building Agency.  The National Building Agency is properly financed and well equipped to provide houses for employees on industrial estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first point, it is clear that the IDA is the body which must have national responsibility for the furtherance of industrial development.  It may be true in one sense to say that the INPC is a body concerned with industrial development, but in the same sense this could be said of numerous bodies in this country such as work study associations.  I do not think there is any problem here as far as the INPC is concerned.  I do not think anybody could quarrel with the statement that the IDA is the body having national responsibility for the furtherance of industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the second point raised by Deputy Collins I would not say that heavy industry is excluded from industrial estates.  In practice it has been found that the kind of <Col N="1250" /> industries which tend to be attracted to industrial estates are the somewhat lighter industries.  Of course, if a heavy industry wishes to locate, for instance, in Waterford, it is not essential that it should locate on the industrial estate. In general I think we can assume that lighter industries tend to locate on industrial estates.</P>
    <P>What is happening to the National Building Agency, as I think I mentioned on Second Reading of the Bill, is that the building of houses by the IDA, except in most exceptional circumstances, will be carried out by the National Building Agency as agents for the IDA.  This is being done in Galway on behalf of An Foras Tionscal which is being merged with the IDA under this Bill.</P>

      <P>Under the new composition of the IDA and the new powers being given to it, will the IDA consider on of its functions to have more direct liaison with the section of the INPC which directly assists small industries?  They must by now have built up quite a reservoir of experience from dealing with small industries around the country.  Similarly, the IMI must have gained considerable experience from dealing with small employers.  Does the IDA, in any of the new sections, envisage closer contact being maintained with these specialised agencies, if not to act as general co-ordinator, at any rate to gather together, in a more convenient form, all the experience that is now available in this area?</P>

I should say that it would probably be difficult to have more effective or closer co-ordination than that which is already in existence between these bodies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am puzzled by this section.  I do not understand how it is intended to operate or what it is intended to do.  I had thought that the purpose of it was, or would be, to enable the IDA to be regionalised in its activities and to provide authority for this but, in fact, it is not what it says. What it says seems to be almost meaningless in its generality:</P>
      <P>The Authority may in the exercise of its functions have regard to the extent to which an industrial undertaking will serve to promote national objectives for regional development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I would gather from the fact that <Col N="1252" /> the clear distinction between designated areas and others is maintained in this Bill that this does not mean the authority can give out grants other than the different grants that are given in designated areas so that, whatever this means, it does not mean more money for some areas other than those covered by designated areas; and the Minister could hardly use this clause to get behind that particular power and to provide, say, the 40 per cent grants in a non-designated area.</P>
    <P>What I should like to ask the Minister is: What does it mean?  Is it simply general waffle or is it intended to enable someone to do something he could not otherwise do legally?  It seems to me in its present form an odd kind of section to have in the Bill; there may be some good reason for it which I do not understand.  I would hope the Bill would contain specific provision to regionalise the IDA so that it would, in fact, be developed in its internal functions into a series of regional offices with considerable autonomy.  I have raised this point before in regard to the obvious success of SFADCO and the extent to which its success is attributable to the fact that it is an autonomous body and could undertake its own activities in promotion as well as in the development of a particular area.</P>
    <P>I recognise, of course, it would be unsound to have a number of different bodies carrying on industrial promotion abroad without being co-ordinated nationally, but that, of course, is not a great problem because SFADCO's promotional efforts are at present co-ordinated with the IDA and that does not, therefore, seem to me to be a reason against autonomous bodies similar to SFADCO carrying out these functions in order to encourage regional development.  These autonomous bodies would not, of course, supplant the IDA with its essential core of expertise&mdash;indeed, they have considerable expertise which it would be too expensive and impossible to duplicate at a regional level.  I quite see that, but it seems to me that this clause in this connection may be intended in some vague way to encourage the IDA to regionalise.</P>
    <P>Now, first of all, I am not sure that <Col N="1253" /> it does that.  I cannot see that it has any practical effect whatever.  Secondly, even if it does have some such effect, I would regard it as inadequate because it still would not give to other regions in the country, other than the mid-west, the same kinds of advantages the mid-west region has through the activities of this remarkably successful organisation, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, whose function the Minister very properly centred in the mid-west some time ago with, I think, considerable success. The Minister is, I am sure, even more familar then I am with the plans that SFADCO prepared for this region and I must say that when I read them&mdash; I read them carefully because I have a particular interest in that area and in Shannon Airport in particular&mdash;I was struck by the care and thoroughness with which the plans were prepared and the manner in which SFADCO and the authority had sought to balance, on the one had, the requirement of the clear desirability of having industrial development throughout that region with, on the other hand, the importance of developing a particular centre on quite a large scale.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that a remarkably fine balance was maintained between these two requirements and, indeed, many of the arguments that might develop, but did not seem to have got going, on the Buchanan Report are potentially answered by the SFADCO plan because I am afraid&mdash;I may be partly responsible for this&mdash;the Buchanan Report is being discussed in much too black and white terms. I have myself been discussing it in too black and white terms, but that is because I am responding to a very black and white discussion.  The discussion seems to be all black at the moment as far as the Buchanan Report is concerned, and blacking it out.</P>
    <P>I think that the whole problem has been oversimplified.  It has been put into too simple terms of black and white and a polarisation of attitudes is taking place, which is unfortunate. I believe that, in fact, the way in which to develop the hinterlands of the main centres of this country is to develop a growth centre and satellite towns <Col N="1254" /> around it.  I believe that the SFADCO plans&mdash;I hope they are developing favourably&mdash;show this in operation and therefore their plans for the mid-west region will secure not just Shannon and Limerick but that each part of the region will secure industrial development of a magnitude appropriate to the employment of each part of the region and without prejudice to the development of major facilities in the key centres of the region, Limerick and Shannon itself.  I think this is an excellent example of how this whole problem of regional development should be tackled in a manner which will not undermine in any way rural Ireland but will, on the contrary, build it up, and build it up not just in the major centres but build it up in the hinterland of these centres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not leaving out Ennis at all, but the designated major centres are Limerick and Shannon.  Now, a great many other places are, as I said, being built up. What is so satisfactory in the SFADCO plan is the manner in which it provides for industrial development, not just in Limerick and Shannon, but in, as Deputy Carter properly said, Ennis and in other centres ranging right down as far as Newcastle West in Limerick, with an appropriate magnitude of satisfactory development in each area.</P>
      <P>While some people may be sceptical as to whether these plans will work out and as to whether all these factories will be built and all be filled with industry, my own belief is that this body has shown itself so efficient in the promotion of industry and the development of industrial estates, and has shown itself, so far, well able to secure the industrial development required to build whatever factory space it is given money to build, that I am reasonably confident that its efforts to secure industrial development throughout the region will, in fact, succeed.  This seems to be the proper approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not happy with the fact that the Government have set their face <Col N="1255" /> against any extension of this experiment and that, throughout the last couple of years when these issues come under discussion, they have insisted that everyone else must be organised centrally by the IDA.  It is not that I feel it is not a function for a centralised IDA.  On the contrary, there are many specialised functions which it would be impossible, and impossibly expensive, to duplicate in each region; but what it is not impossible to do, and what it is not impossibly expensive to do, is to duplicate the activities of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company in each region.  I simply refuse to believe that what has been successfully done in one region cannot be done anywhere else.  There is no reason why that effort should not succeed elsewhere.</P>
    <P>That region has, of course, the advantage of the Shannon Airport.  This has meant that in one particular centre a particular pattern of development is possible, a pattern which will not be possible in other areas which have not got an airport.  But the fact remains that that body has shown by its method of operating the enormous advantages of autonomous bodies staffed by people with a commitment to development in that area and which are, at the same time, remarkably co-ordinated nationally to ensure they do not duplicate each other's efforts and that they do not in any way compete with each other abroad in a manner that would, perhaps, be selfdefeating. I do not understand why the Minister and his Department have set their face against further developments of this kind.  I am not satisfied with the proposal that the IDA should be simply regionalised and I am particularly dissatisfied with the fact that if this is the long-awaited and, might I say, trumpeted regionalisation of the IDA, if that is what this section is meant to convey, it seems singularly ineffective for that purpose.</P>
    <P>It does not speak in those terms at all.  It says that the authority may, in the exercise of its functions, have regard to the extent to which an industrial undertaking will serve to promote <Col N="1256" /> national objectives for regional development.  I do not know if that means anything in practice but it does not mean that the IDA will be regionalised with regional offices.  If the IDA are to have regional offices this is something they will do under their general powers which do not confine them to an office in Dublin and do not lay down any restrictions as to the manner in which the authority is to be organised.  It is in the exercise of that general function that they will, perhaps, set about developing on a regional basis.  I do not think this section helps in that direction.  If it does, if it has some hidden meaning that I have missed, I shall be glad if the Minister will tell me what particular actions by anybody will be made legal by this section that would not otherwise be legal.  Perhaps there is some reason for this clause and it is not the window dressing that it appears to be at first sight.  I should like to be told what particular functions are involved.</P>
    <P>I should like to press the Minister again to reconsider his restrictive centralised attitude to industrial development and indeed to the general problem of national development.  There is a real conflict in the Government's stated attitude&mdash;by that I do not wish to suggest that the Government do not genuinely feel their stated anxiety, which I believe to be real&mdash;to secure development throughout the country and not just in Dublin on the one hand, and the practical effect of the way in which the Government organises its administration.  I am certainly not getting involved here with decentralisation of Government Departments, which is quite irrelevant; but the whole of the Government's attitude on this seems to be rather one of promising to do a couple of spectacular things of that kind but not in fact devolving authority at any level and not encouraging autonomous development in the regions but keeping everything centrally controlled.</P>
    <P>There is, it seems to me, a fairly basic difference in philosophy between this side of the House and the Government, a difference that has not emerged very clearly because it has been rather fudged by arguments on <Col N="1257" /> the Government side.  Yet, I believe it is there.  We must judge not by what people say but by what they do; and what the Government have done and are doing in this Bill is to maintain a position in which, but for this one exception which somehow escaped through the net the Government set up to prevent regional development, I would almost say, everything else is to be organised centrally.  SFADCO was the one that got away.  It is there; it cannot be suppressed; let it continue to do its job but let us not have any more successes of this kind.</P>
    <P>I do not understand this attitude. I know SFADCO arose from a particular situation.  It would not have happened but for the airport.  Much of the development there, however, has been independent of that and I think the development that has occurred is of such a character as to show pretty clearly that it is possible for a body of this kind, even if it had not got an airport, to do a particularly useful job locally which will not be done in the same way, with the same energy, skill and devotion and in particular the local patriotism, which is important in these matters.  It will not be done in the same way by the IDA as by a regional body.</P>
    <P>I address myself more particularly than usually, perhaps, to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in making these particular references and I suggest to the Minister that, first, he should explain to us what this section does and, secondly, that he should show himself prepared to reconsider this attitude of over-centralisation and not only to have regional offices of the IDA but to create them on such a basis of local autonomy that they would generate the same kind of local enthusiasm and patriotism which SFADCO has done.  SFADCO is peculiar because of its amalgamation of regional identity on the one hand and professionalism on the other.  In this country there are thousands of amateurs in industrial development.  Every town and village is full of enthusiasts for industrial development and many of them are doing a very good job within the limits of amateur effort, preparing brochures and sending them out.  Some of them <Col N="1258" /> do, as a result of their efforts, amateur though they are, attract industry but they cannot do it on the same scale or in the same way, and cannot make the same impact as a highly professional body like SFADCO.</P>
    <P>What is peculiar to SFADCO is that it has this regional identity and is yet professional.  It is unique in this. I think that if we are to have a genuine regional development, if the different parts of the country are to secure the rate of development required not only to keep up with Dublin but to catch up with Dublin, pass out Dublin and leave it in the shade, it will need something more than regional offices for the IDA, something more on the lines of SFADCO.</P>

      <P>I hope that section 12 will mean that the Industrial Development Authority will have offices in provincial areas and in some of the larger towns, especially in the west of Ireland.  I think this is necessary because it inhibits an industrialist in the west if he has to come to Dublin quite often, with the waste of time and expense involved, to discuss matters which could be settled initially locally or at least in the general area of the provincial or county towns.  I should like the Minister to say if this is his intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like clarification of regionalisation because I think you cannot have very many large areas like Shannon scattered along the west coast.  This would not be advisable.  In some of the county development plans the planning authorities have opted for dispersed growth rather than centralised growth and in the nature of things I believe that the type of industry that will most benefit the west of Ireland generally is the smaller type in which transport costs would not be high.  I suggest that rather than have large regionalisation we should have dispersed regionalisation with an IDA centre suitably located to cater for an area such as this.  Many towns in the west have the services necessary for industry; they have surplus housing, water and sewerage services.  There are fairly decent roads into these towns. In Dublin industrial development has <Col N="1259" /> outstripped the progress in housing and other services.  At the moment the Minister and the Government might well consider a moratorium whereby the services in Dublin would be allowed to catch up on industrial development there because this development is adding to the other problems existing there.  The regionalisation mentioned in section 12 would help to relieve the situation in Dublin and help to develop the west.  Another Minister has indicated new policies in connection with land and the type of farming he would envisage which would be part farming and part industrial work.  I think this section will give an opportunity for this sort of development.  I should like the Minister to clarify these points.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy FitzGerald would agree that when he cites SFADCO it would be very hard to find a position now or in the near or even the distant future which would equal the position of Shannon.  We know that the Maud, Buchanan and the Lichfield Reports have been issued and I think the Minister is wise in taking the best out of those reports and in trying to apply some of their recommendations blended with his own knowledge and the knowledge of the agencies under him in trying to promote industry.</P>
      <P>We know very well that Shannon Airport was there earlier and that the encouragements offered towards exports, especially towards air freight exports, and so on, succeeded in building up Shannon.  In this respect, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company did very good work. Over and above the reports issued by experts who were invited here to give their opinions, those of us who live in the areas know a certain amount about the difficulty of promoting industry in the various areas.  One might suggest that field officers for county development teams starting in a small, progressive way might be as good an idea at any stage as talking about opening regional offices to disperse the IDA.  That would be all very well providing, as the Yanks say, that industry began to escalate here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1260" /> We know that some continental industrialists show a preference for an area that is not designated as an industrial estate area.  There are reasons for this which I shall not go into now.  If one has any conversation with some of those men, some of them family industries or family-promoted industries, I think they will give good and sufficient reason why they select areas where there might be a good pool of fresh labour that would not be initiated in industry at all; why they would undertake to take part in a scheme for the training of this labour.  There are many reasons for this.  In so far as this goes, I would think the Minister is wise in culling what he can from those reports, blending it with his own knowledge and the knowledge of the various agencies under him which advise him and trying to apply it to the industrial arm here.  It does not mean to say for one moment that if we had even another area designated like Shannon&mdash;if we had an area comparable, say, to Shannon&mdash;we would be any more successful in other parts of the country in siting industry.</P>
    <P>Our aim should be&mdash;I think it is the aim all along&mdash;to try to provide industries as evenly as possible throughout the country and thus avoid larger concentrations.  We know very well that oftentimes&mdash;this may be said to be a slogan&mdash;revolution starts around the chimney stacks.  If we could succeed in aiming at, for example, what the Germans are aiming at, what the countries of the Common Market are aiming at&mdash;diversifying industry&mdash; it would be better for us to go in this direction rather than to be thinking in higher terms, in terms which might be out of our reach.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, there are many reasons why Shannon is so successful.  Indeed, it is not solely on the grounds that it was designated an industrial area.  There were other factors as well.  There are a number of satellite towns of Shannon.  I assume that each of those towns would be as anxious to secure an industry as SFADCO might be.  If those smaller areas can provide sites and labour, and if they have the initiative to go forward <Col N="1261" /> to try to develop, even in a small way, I think they should receive every encouragement.</P>
    <P>It is all very fine for plans to be put on paper.  It is much easier to build a castle in the air than to build a castle on the ground.  Therefore, I would not see anything at all wrong with the fact that the Minister would strengthen the communications between the present county development teams and the IDA and provide good leadership from the IDA, on the ground. When we speak in terms of regionalisation, Parkinson's Law could catch up on us here, too.  We must not lose sight of the fact that it is industry and exports that we are after, not office jobs. Therefore, good field men, backed up by good county development teams, backed up by the necessary leadership, could, I think, help us in this regard.</P>

      <P>The object of this section is to ensure that the IDA, as regional policy develops, carries on its functions within the framework of regional planning.  There will be regular consultation between IDA, the Department of Local Government and the Department of Industry and Commerce to ensure that the necessary co-ordination between these functions is obtained as regional planning develops. It is, of course, a developing function.</P>
      <P>On the general issue raised on this section, I am somewhat at a loss to understand on what Deputy FitzGerald bases his statement that the Government have set their face against regional development.  All the arguments he used in its favour have been used by me in the past&mdash;in particular, when entrusting to SFADCO the responsibility within the region of Limerick, Clare and North Tipperary. May I remind Deputy FitzGerald that I was the Minister for Industry and Commerce who did that and a member of the Government of which he was talking?</P>

      <P>On the Second Reading, this point was raised.  I explained that it was possible to deal with the Limerick, Clare, North Tipperary <Col N="1262" /> region as we did because of the existence both of SFADCO and of the Lichfield Report.  I agree entirely with the laudatory remarks with regard to SFADCO which Deputy FitzGerald made.  On the Second Reading, I went on to explain the point Deputy Carter was making, that is, that we cannot reasonably expect to produce the equivalent of eight other SFADCOs overnight.</P>
      <P>What we can do and what has been announced as the intention to be done is to set up a regional office of IDA in each of the other eight regions which were announced in the comments by the Government on the Buchanan Report.  We intend to get these offices working in conjunction with the local authorities and the local development associations.  I stated on Second Reading that I hope to see evolving in each of the regions a somewhat similar structure and organisation to the one at present in SFADCO in the Limerick/Clare/North Tipperary region.  It is not possible or realistic to expect that you could do this overnight.</P>
      <P>In the light of that, I am at a loss to understand what Deputy FitzGerald had in mind, or on what he based his statement to the effect that the Government had set their face against regional development.  The exact opposite, in fact, is the position.  What I have said about the offices in each of the regions is, I hope, a reply to the point Deputy Cunningham raised.  I might tell him in passing that one of the eight other regions is County Donegal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I gave the impression that I was not giving the Minister and the Government credit for what they have done in regard to SFADCO.  I give every credit to them both as regards founding it in the first instance, and giving it its head at the beginning when it might have been felt to be a rather chancy experiment, and in regard to extending its activities. I also perfectly accept that you will not get eight other SFADCO's overnight. Of course you will not.  It will take time for that to emerge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am concerned about is that <Col N="1263" /> there is no sign of anything appearing, never mind overnight, even over years. Again, as in so many other cases, the pace of progress on the part of the Government in carrying through policies which they claim to be committed to is disturbingly slow.  I would have hoped that with SFADCO established for ten years now and off the ground as a regional development authority for several years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <P>In any event, it has had this wider function for 15 to 18 months, if the Minister is correct.  I would have thought that at this stage we would have seen several others getting under way on a small scale, perhaps. The first thing you do is to appoint a chief executive and he starts to get some people together.  Nothing has happened and all we hear at this stage is that the Minister contemplates the possibility of this emerging out of the regional development offices of the IDA.  The whole thing is unsatisfactory because of its slowness.</P>
      <P>It is hard to think that the Government are serious about this whole regional operation when, in fact, they are so slow about doing anything about it.  I do not wish in any way to reflect on the Minister in regard to SFADCO itself.  I accept what he says now, that he envisages an ultimate development of other organisations like SFADCO. There is nothing in this Bill to provide for that.  This clause here has apparently, as I thought, nothing to do with it.  It does not empower the IDA to establish autonomous bodies.  It does not empower the Government to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1264" /> If the Government are contemplating further SFADCOs a year and a half or so after the first regional authority of this kind established by extending the powers of SFADCO to the whole area, they must be contemplating them so far in the future that they see no point whatever in making provision for them in this legislation.  If the Government had any immediate intention of doing anything about this, other than talking about it, they would have introduced into this Bill clauses to cover this.  At least this would seem to me to be the appropriate thing to do.</P>
    <P>The absence of any such provision from this legislation suggests to me that the Government are thinking in terms of further SFADCO-type companies a long time hence and that, in fact, what they intend to do is to get the IDA to develop the regional offices.  If I know anything about the pace at which the Government work, and the whole pace at which our public administration works, to get those offices off the ground will take some years, and that it is only when these offices are established and have been going once again for some years, so that there are some years experience on which to judge their success, that the Minister will decide to do anything practical about getting other bodies like SFADCO established.</P>
    <P>The whole experience we have had of the pace of policy implementation in this country from the time when the first idea is put forward, from the time when the first Government commitment is entered into, to the time when anything is done about it, is that the pace is deplorably slow.  I do not think this can be said often enough.  The quality of public administration in Ireland is in many respects high.  It is efficient, particularly in negative activities, in controlling, and it is sometimes also efficient in development work in getting things done. The pace at which changes are effected is incredibly slow.</P>
    <P>We are persistently facing the position that we in this country are quite alert enough, and even the Government are alert enough, when ideas are put forward, whether from the Opposition, <Col N="1265" /> or commissions, or bodies, or councils of one kind or another, to pick them up, latch on to them and say: &ldquo;Yes, we think this is a good idea.&rdquo;  That side of it is all right.  On the whole I think we have been quicker to change policies in theory, and to announce changes of policy in many areas, than the British for example.  We have had several years lead on them in respect of a number of policy changes, but then we find that the British have their scheme in operation years before ours.</P>
    <P>It seems to me from observing the pace at which certain things have been done here, and things done that are connected with industrial development, such as development of training and the whole growth centre policy, that the gestation period for policies in Ireland, from the time they are thought of and approved to the time they are implemented, is about double what it is in Britain and other countries. My experience of other countries is limited but what I know of countries like France suggests a much more rapid process in getting things under way.</P>
    <P>It is only when one sees business men and civil servants facing each other across the table and discussing common problems that one realises the gulf between them as regards the pace of getting things done.  Much of the frustration that exists between business and, indeed, I would say also at times the trade unions on the one hand and the Government on the other, lies in this fact that business men and trade unionists used to dealing with business men are used to decisions being taken fairly promptly and implemented fairly promptly.  If they were not many of our business would be bankrupt at this stage.  Then they find themselves dealing with a public administration whose idea of getting anything done is to operate at a tempo which is, if one had to put a figure on it, something like one-quarter to one-fifth of the tempo at which the rest of the country works.  The whole of our development in Ireland is held up by this.</P>
    <P>We have here a very clear case of it. After all, it is now seven years since the whole idea of regional development <Col N="1266" /> around growth centres was first put forward and put forward, be it said, with the greatest difficulty in getting over the opposition of the Minister's own Department.  It required considerable effort to persuade them to adopt this suggestion which was first put forward in the CIO report of that year.  Lest anything good should come out of that quickly it was referred to another committee.  I need not go right through the routine.  I have had to go through it before. Year after year passes.  Other committees sit.  Other reports are made. Things are held up.  Reports are received and kept for nine months and finally they are published and no decision is announced on them.</P>
    <P>We are now here seven years after this policy was first put forward unanimously by trade unionists, business men and, with some reluctance in the case of the Minister's own Department, by civil servants, but with much greater enthusiasm in the more progressive Department of Finance at that particular point in time.  Now, seven years later, we are at the stage when nobody can tell us what the Government's policy is on this matter and when in respect of the actual implementation of this facet of the policy, the industrial development facet, the most the Minister can say is that he is contemplating at some stage that the regional development offices of the IDA which do not yet exist will, when established, evolve at some time in the future into bodies like SFADCO.</P>
    <P>I do not think that pace is adequate and if the Minister thinks I am wrong let him put a figure on it.  Let him tell me that I am wrong and that it will happen quicker and what year it will happen in.  I would think from my experience of the way these things have been done and the pace of the development of policy that you will not see any of your SFADCOs established and operating for three years, and you will not have more than two or three operating in five years time. That means it will have taken 15 years from the time SFADCO was established until you will have had any significant development of this concept elsewhere.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1267" /> It will have taken ten years from the first CIO report to the point where we have any further regional development authority of this kind actually moving here apart from SFADCO, accidentally established.  It will be about 13 years before we have any significant number of them.  If the Minister thinks I am wrong let him say so; let him say he expects to see regional development authorities with the autonomy which SFADCO has in operation here, that he hopes to see the first next year, two more the year after and so on.  If the Minister made such a commitment I would accept the reality of it.  I would not say the same of other Ministers.  We all have had the experience of other Ministers and some of their promises.  We are busy on the Health Bill at the moment.  I forget how many years ago Mr. O'Malley told us it was coming in six months time.  We have had the same experience with education.  In March last year the Minister for Education said quite firmly we were going to have training colleges offering university degree courses this October and therefore, because the interval was so short, there was no point whatever in extending these new university grants to them. He knew, or should have known, and his successor knows that nothing of the kind will happen in regard to all of these training colleges for years to come; it may start with one or two in the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>We have this whole process of promises not being fulfilled, but the Minister is not that kind of person and if he says here the development will be much quicker than I am suggesting I shall take his word for it, but I should like him to say whether he will make such a commitment.  If he does not I shall know what to think.  My assessment from a long and close experience of public administration is that it will take years before we get anywhere.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to do something about the slowness of policy-making which is a particular defect of this Government.  I do not know that it is primarily the fault of the Government in the sense that decisions are held <Col N="1268" /> up at Government level, but it is, however, the fault of the Government if they fail to force the pace of administrative policy-making, and if in some crucial instances they deliberately hold up policies which they know are necessary in the national interest, because they fear they may be politically unpopular. I press on the Minister to set his face against this holding up of national development for political reasons and to set his mind on getting his Department and other Departments operating at the same pace, or even at half the pace of the private sector.  We would then be really getting places.</P>
    <P>On the section itself, the Minister's explanation of it does not get us anywhere. He says it is intended&mdash;I cannot remember his exact words&mdash;to enable the authority to operate within the regional development plan, or something to that effect.  What this clause says is:</P>
    <P>The Authority may in the exercise of its functions have regard to the extent to which an industrial undertaking will serve to promote national objectives for regional development.</P>
    <P>Supposing that clause were not there, is there anything the authority could not do?  It only says they may do something. It does not require them to do it. If the Minister could tell me that its deletion would inhibit the IDA in any way I would be quite happy to leave it there.  What the Minister has said so far is quite unconvincing.  The section has nothing to do with what we were talking about before, having regional branches or offices of the IDA or having a development on SFADCO lines. Could the Minister tell us why he wants the section in?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the section were to be deleted it could have an inhibiting effect on the IDA in so far as there are certain criteria laid down which the IDA must follow in the allocation of grants.  In the absence of this, it could <Col N="1269" /> be argued that regional development policy is a criterion which should not be taken into account by the IDA.  For that reason I would not like to see the section out of the Bill.</P>
      <P>On the question of the evolving of other organisations similar to SFADCO in the other regions, Deputy FitzGerald has approached this on a rather theoretical basis.  He has overlooked certain fundamental facts, one of which I mentioned earlier and have mentioned on many occasions as being one of the reasons that we were enabled to do what we did in the Limerick-Clare-North Tipperary region, the existence of the Lichfield Report.  No similar report exists in regard to any other region, and the idea of trying to set up something similar to SFADCO without this simply would not make sense at all. In actual fact, the IDA, some months earlier this year, did commission consultants to carry out an exploratory study aimed at preparing a guide to the preparation of regional industrial plans.  The consultants were asked to advise on such matters as the assessment of the magnitude of the problems involved in the particular region and the best way within the region of going about them.  This was not the preparation of regional plans but rather the guideline for the preparation of regional plans, and for the purpose of their investigation the consultants considered in relative depth the Sligo-Leitrim region and the south-east region, that is, Wicklow, Wexford, Waterford, Kildare and South Tipperary, as being likely to offer a cross-section of the regional development problems which would be encountered in the remainder of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That report has recently come to hand.  It is under examination by the IDA and will be used on the setting up of the regional offices to lay down the guidelines for preparing within each region the programme for industrial development for that region.  This is an essential operation if we are to do the job that we want to do.  It would be very nice if it could be done in an easier or quicker way, but I am afraid life is not like that.  This is <Col N="1270" /> the way it has to be done, and this is the way we are doing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is most revealing. I am glad the Minister has confirmed what I said about the way in which the Government act and the time table and pace involved.  Let us recap where we stand.  Was it in 1962 or 1963 that the physical planning areas were established and, at that time, six or seven years ago, two regional studies were commissioned, the Lichfield Report for the Limerick area and the Wright Report for the Dublin area?  The Government then did not commission any other studies, and then they announced, three years ago, that they were commissioning a Buchanan study which was to fill these gaps in the other regions and which, incidentally, because one firm was going to do all this planning, would provide a co-ordinated picture into which the Limerick and Dublin plans would be built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It did not fill the gap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Buchanan Report was then produced.  It does not seem to me that it has filled the gap in the sense of providing regional plans of the kind that exist in the Dublin and Limerick areas; the Limerick one is particularly detailed and valuable. That is what was announced but it has not done that.  The Buchanan Report has great merit as an overall plan for regional development of the nation.  It does not seem to me to provide the kind of basis we have in the two other regional plans.  I agree with that.  I should like to ask why it has not done that when the Government said that was what it would do.  I do not accept that the fact that these detailed regional plans do not exist prevents the establishment of a body like SFADCO and such a body doing a useful job.  If the Minister suggests it prevents that, he is making charges against his own Government of failing in the first instance to commission studies like those of Lichfield and Wright seven years ago and then of following that failure by commissioning the Buchanan Report to fill the gap&mdash;which, in fact, has not filled the <Col N="1271" /> gap because the Government have not ensured that the report did the job it was meant to do&mdash;and at this stage of having reached the point only of commissioning somebody to prepare guidelines for reports which will provide a basis for taking decisions in the future for regional industrial development. That whole process of neglect, of failure to act, of letting things drift, of postponing things, of setting up committees to decide whether to set up other committees to do something, shows a deplorable lack of any concept of urgency.  I have complained about this throughout.  The Minister has aggravated the position and confirmed the charges I was making in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask what is the relationship between these new regional industrial development plans and the regional physical planning plans.  I am interested in this development.  Hitherto the responsibility for physical planning has rested with the Department of Local Government.  The Lichfield Report has much to say about industrial development.  I do not want the Minister to tell me that physical planning is one thing and industrial development planning another.  The Lichfield Report deals in great detail with industrial development.  It provides a blueprint for such development. Is it now proposed that the responsibility for preparing regional physical plans which the Government had neglected to provide for some of the areas has been shifted to the Minister's Department?  Is his Department now initiating studies with a view to initiating other studies of industrial development which are themselves studies which will have to be paralleled by yet other studies carried out by the Department of Local Government into which the industrial development plans may or may not fit?  To what state of confusion have we now got? The Minister should tell us how he sees regional industrial plans fitting into regional physical planning plans.  Are there to be other reports like those of Lichfield and Wright?  Are the Department of Local Government going to organise similar studies?  Is the position <Col N="1272" /> that what we will have for the other regions is the Buchanan Report which is very useful from the point of overall strategy of regional planning, plus industrial development reports for certain regions prepared by the Minister's Department?  Is it possible that physical planning has come to a stop?  Are industrial plans to be prepared by the Minister's Department and parallel plans for general development prepared by the Department of Local Government?  We seem to have got into a state of general confusion or, perhaps, I may have worked myself into such a state of confusion.</P>

Perhaps, the Minister could deal with those few points.</P>

      <P>I think so.  I am not quite sure as this matter has not been under my Department and I am not terribly familiar with it.  These reports are concerned with industrial development and also with many other matters. Contrary to the picture that the Deputy was painting, I was quite impatient at having to wait for these reports. I wanted to get on with the job of regional development in industry. Consequently, I instructed the IDA to have these studies which I mentioned carried out but they were carried out in consultation with other people&mdash;it may have been the Buchanan people&mdash; who were doing the other reports so that they could be co-ordinated.  Since other matters were involved which might hold up the reports it seemed possible, by doing this and by getting guidelines in consultation with the physical planners, to get going on regional development for industry at any rate.  This was the reason that this study was carried out.  The report has recently become available and is being studied by the IDA.  I can assure the Deputy and the House that it will be implemented just as fast as it is possible to do it.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister look into that?  This is a study with a view to seeing how we go about this job and there is a question of case studies for this purpose.  Nevertheless, for the purpose of arousing public interest in this I would ask the Minister to consider publication of these reports.  From the point of view of general public interest the Minister's policy should be to publish unless there is good reason for not publishing.  I am not happy with an answer that &ldquo;it is not customary to publish such reports&rdquo;. I am quite prepared for the Minister to say it would not be in the public interest to publish a certain report. I might argue about it.  I recognise his right to say that.  I recognise there are cases where there might be confidential information about individual firms.  On the whole, we have suffered from a dearth of publication of material which could be useful and particularly anything to do with developments at local level.  I would urge the Minister to look into this and unless he finds good reason to the contrary to publish the reports.</P>
      <P>May I go back to the section?  I am still not happy that I understand just how the section helps.  The Minister suggests that if it were not there he could not operate the criteria on a regional system, that he would be inhibited by having to advert to other criteria.  Are these the general functions of the IDA as set out in the 1950 Act or are they the criteria for the giving of grants under sections 33 and 34?</P>

      <P>I do not propose to discuss them but to read them and see how they relate to section 12.  As far as section 33 is concerned, it is the one which lays down certain minimum criteria for the giving of grants.  If industries do not pass the criteria they do not get grants.  Regionalism does not come into it.  The amount of grant fixed in section 33 is not subject to variation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister envisages a situation where the IDA might be asked to give a supplementary grant under section 34.  They would be examining the industrial project to see if it falls within the section or not.  If it does not fall within the section, section 12 does not add anything to it because the criteria there are so specific.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting a clue at last.  What the Minister is suggesting is that the discretion the IDA have as to how much of the 20 per cent maximum they may give could not be exercised in favour of regional development unless we had section 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly did not. What I said was that it was possible that it could be argued that if we did not have section 12 in applying the criteria, the IDA might not be able to have regard to regional development. By having this section in, it is possible for the IDA in considering the amount of grant that would apply on the basis of section 34, perhaps to raise the level of grant because of regional policy. They would have the discretion to refuse or to reduce the amount of grant under section 34 because of regional policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has put it in such weak terms and in the context of such a remote contingency that it is rather difficult to prove that such a remote contingency could not exist.  Either the IDA have complete discretion to decide whether the percentage is to be one, two, three, four or up to 20 or they are fettered.  Where they are fettered is in the giving of the grant at all.  Once the criteria are fulfilled the IDA can give any amount up to 20 per cent and nobody can challenge it.  There is nothing in the industrial grants legislation to fetter them and I fail to see, when the discretion is unfettered, how section 12 can improve the position or can give more discretion.  I am not trying to get involved in section 34.  I am trying to see the need for section 12 arising out of the Minister's expressed interpretation of section 34.</P>

Reverting to a point raised by Deputies Gibbons, Corish and FitzGerald in relation to the report, I feel that in many cases the type of report referred to could be published.  I have not seen the report referred to but I will undertake to the House to examine the question of whether it could be published.  If so I will see that it is published.</P>

      <P>I am rather unhappy <Col N="1277" /> with this section in its relationship with section 5 of the 1950 Act.  It is a bit untidy.  I accept that the new functions of the IDA are such as not to require the power to summon witnesses but as the Minister is saying that where the IDA do not need the power they should not have it, the correct thing to have done would be not only to restrict the power in relation to this section but to restrict it in regard to section 5 of the 1950 Act. The reason for the inclusion of these powers in the Act of 1950 was because the functions of the IDA included certain investigatory functions unrelated to industrial development.  These powers are being carried out at present under the IDA's industrial promotion role.  For none of these was the power to summon witnesses required.  The IDA had other functions carried over to the prices commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes&mdash;to examine any revision of tariffs, quotas, <i>et cetera.</i> This was introduced into the 1950 Act without any limit on the aspects of the authority's functions to which it related. If I had been here I would have suggested that it was not very well drafted, that the power to summon witnesses should have been confined to cases where it was needed.  However, it does not matter very much but if the Minister is now saying that this power to summon witnesses should be restricted to cases where it is needed, it should, therefore, not apply to these additional five functions.  It seems to me to be commonsense that the same principle be extended to the functions set out in section 3 of the 1950 Act, functions 1 to 5 and 8, number 8 being to advise on matters relating to industrial development.  It is illogical to take away this power in relation to some industrial development functions and to leave it for others.  If the Minister is trying to tidy up the Act he should have done the job thoroughly and not in this untidy fashion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is doing what it was intended to do.  It is taking in the power to summon witnesses in relation to the functions conferred on the authority by this Bill.  It is quite <Col N="1278" /> clear to everybody that the IDA do not need and should not have that power in relation to these functions.  Nevertheless, it is conceivable that the functions might be added to it at some time in the future in which case this power could be needed.  This is the manner in which it was dealt with in a previous Act where the power was being taken away in relation to functions of the IDA given under an Act which has now being wholly repealed but the same procedures arose and the same procedure was followed.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say why it has been decided that they shall have the power to summon witnesses for these five things while it has been decided not to include similar provisions in respect of the other functions of the IDA for which summoning of witnesses is necessary?  Paragraph (v) seems to say that they cannot have the power to summon witnesses when fostering the national objective of regional industrial development but that they would have it in relation to advising on any matters of industrial development.  If it is required for one it is required for the other but, in fact, it is required for neither.  I do not wish to press the matter because the answer is simply to put down an amendment on Report Stage which can be discussed then.</P>

      <P>There were many opportunities.  When section 11 says &ldquo;The Authority shall have in addition to the functions assigned to it by section 3 of the Act of 1950 the following general functions&rdquo; I think section 13 covers that.  Section 11 says:</P>
      <P>The Authority shall have, in addition to the functions assigned to it by section 3 of the Act of 1950, the following general functions&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1280" /> and then there is a clause inserted in addition to the functions assigned to it by the Act of 1950.  I dispute the Minister's interpretation.  The words &ldquo;in addition to&rdquo; are explanatory only.  In the position previously adopted by the Minister, he was on reasonably firm ground but he is now in a position which I think is incorrect. Section 13 does not remove the power to summon witnesses in respect of anything under section 3 of the Act of 1950.  I do not think that any practising lawyer would argue that the inclusion in an explanatory manner of the words &ldquo;in addition to the functions assigned by section 3 of the Act of 1950&rdquo; confers those powers on the authority.  The authority have them already.  This Bill merely asserts that they have been assigned by another Act.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In this section we provide that the local authority may, in advance, provide for the factories with the power of compulsory purchase. Another part of the Bill provides that the authority concerns itself with the provision of houses for persons employed in the industry to be set up and I should like to inquire whether there are powers of compulsory purchase in relation to land for the housing of employees who may be working in any of these advance factories and I inquire as to the kind <Col N="1281" /> of compulsory purchase intended under this section.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boland is worried about our Constitution barring us from control of land prices in the environment of the city for the provision of houses. I am making the point that we provide under the section compulsory powers for the purchase of factory sites.  The Bill refers to the necessity of local authorities concerning themselves with housing for prospective employees because the experience had been that in setting up such new industries in different parts of the country the lack of housing had been a severe impediment to the recruitment of key workers in many parts of the country.  The art of house building had been forgotten and it was important that the State should recapture the art in certain remote parts of the country where the population had fallen consistently during many years.  I am asking what kind of compulsory purchase powers are held here.  Will the power of purchase be utilised for the factory portion of the land or can it be applied in the provision of land necessary for the provision of housing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also inquire, in relation to advance factories in different parts of the country, whether the authority will work in co-ordination with existing voluntary groups and whether there is real investigation work behind many such bodies.  One reads a great deal about such bodies.  The chairman of the local group will announce that three German factories are to start in the area.  One wonders whether the IDA will maintain contact with such groups and provide facilities for them. Deputy FitzGerald was worried a while ago about the regional aspect of the IDA's work.  Here at least, whatever about delays in the production of specialised reports, we see regional development groups having done real work in promotion, attracting industry into an area.  The IDA should help such groups along by specialised advice and so on.  In the case of such a group acquiring the promise of an industry what kind of co-operation will there be between the IDA and such a <Col N="1282" /> group in the matter of providing a site for an advance factory?</P>

      <P>I am advised that the answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The power does not extend to the acquisition of land for houses.  I might point out, in passing, that the Deputy referred to a statement made by the Minister for Local Government. I think he will find the Minister was not referring to the legal difficulties of acquisition but rather to the level of compensation which would have to be paid, which is a different matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going into that but, since the point was raised, I think in fairness to the Minister for Local Government I should say, and I repeat, because I know it is so, that the point he was making was that, while it is possible to acquire land compulsorily for houses, he had been advised it would be equivalent to the confiscation of property if, having acquired it, compensation was paid which was below the market value level.

On the second point raised by Deputy O'Leary, there is of course very considerable help given at the moment by the IDA to the bodies to which he referred, and this will continue. <Col N="1283" /> However, it is not intended, if this is what the Deputy has in mind, to assist such bodies by, say, allowing them to build an advance factory. This would be done by the IDA who would assess the need for it.  They would have to reserve this decision to themselves and not leave it to, say, a local industrial development association.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> In my remarks on the Second Reading of this Bill it happened I dealt almost exclusively with this very section.  Section 15 gives authority to provide sites, buildings, services and facilities in any part of the State where the authority considers or anticipates that industrial development will or is likely to occur. I made it clear on the Second Reading that I approved of that because I believe within this section authority is taken to direct industries to a part of the country where they should be established and where employment is needed.  In that way we would be enabled to provide a proper balance between the city and the country.  I understand from the Minister that the powers contained in section 15 do not confer compulsory powers of acquisition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Then I want to develop my argument a little.  The Bill confers on the Minister, plus the authority, the right to acquire land as sites for development or as a site for an advance factory.  If that is so the Minister should take unto himself under this Bill the right to acquire buildings in which the State have invested a considerable amount of money for the purpose of establishing an industry with a certain employment potential where that industry has failed miserably to measure up to the promise which it gave in anticipation of the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I can be accused of any extreme views here.  The Minister is taking the right to acquire land from <Col N="1285" /> private individuals.  Those private individuals have got no injection from State funds.  The land is required as a site for a factory which will give employment. I have in mind a factory in the town of Cavan which was built, if not exclusively, very substantially out of State funds to the tune of approximately £175,000.  I am not in a position to say how much private capital has been put into it but I venture to suggest that it is not much.  This undertaking got an enormous grant from State funds on the understanding that it would establish a factory and thereby give employment.  For one reason or another, maybe the fault of the promoters or perhaps due to the fact that it was built in anticipation of our immediate entry into the Common Market, it has given no worthwhile employment.  It has now passed into private hands.  The Minister should have the right to acquire this factory on payment of fair and reasonable compensation over and above only the State funds that have already been put into it.  The Minister should have the right to acquire it and to make it available for another undertaking that would give employment.</P>
    <P>In this section the Minister is apparently going to take power to acquire sites and erect buildings for the purposes of establishing industries, whereas there may be abortive efforts to establish industries throughout the country.  The buildings are there and they may be used for purposes for which they were never intended, which do not give worthwhile employment, and it would not be an infringement on the right of a private individual if the Minister were to move in and acquire these buildings on payment of fair and reasonable compensation and make them available to other industries in that area.  If the Minister did that he would probably have readymade factories&mdash;and that is the purpose of this section&mdash;at a much more reasonable cost than if he were to start from the beginning.</P>
    <P>I am urging this course because, as I said on Second Reading, I have seen an example of this on my own doorstep; a factory was established with a considerable amount of pomp and <Col N="1286" /> ceremony, the former Taoiseach coming from Dublin especially for the opening.  The best thing about the whole venture was that the building was erected quickly but since then it has proved a very considerable disappointment in the area and has caused frustration to people who had expected to get employment there.  I hope that in my few remarks I have given the Minister food for thought on this point.  I conclude by asking; if we are entitled to move in and acquire virgin territory from private individuals who have not received State assistance in the purchase or erection of the buildings, surely we are entitled to move in and acquire a property which has been erected with very considerable State assistance for a purpose it has failed to achieve?</P>

On the general proposition, I think it would be very unwise to introduce such a provision because I could well see it being represented and perhaps understood by potential promoters as a method whereby we were going to confiscate their factories; that having induced them to come, having set up the factories and got some &ldquo;knowhow&rdquo; from them, that by this method we were taking back the factories.  I am sure the House will appreciate that any such suggestion would be very unwise and would be unhelpful in our industrial development programme.

      <P>Will the Minister say why, if we can use compulsory powers of purchase in relation to land for factories, we cannot use similar <Col N="1287" /> power in relation to land for housing? What is the reasoning behind this difference in both cases?  In the next section we provide for subsidisation of rents so, therefore, we accept a certain financial obligation in the matter of providing housing.  Why are there two different approaches in relation to housing for the workers and the factories they work in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic thing is not so much why we should or should not, but rather what the section provides. It provides a transfer of powers from another Act which themselves do not provide the power to acquire houses. As to why we should not have this power, offhand I am not aware of any occasion on which the IDA have actually exercised this power in regard of factories.  They may have done in some cases but I am not aware of it. I know they are extremely reluctant to do so.  It is not always the most helpful or hopeful way in which to start a factory, compulsorily to acquire the land.  Whether, if one were to acquire a site for a factory one should go further and acquire sites for houses is arguable either way, but since the power is so seldom exercised in relation to factory sites, to provide for such power for the building of houses would be quite unrealistic.  I could not see it being exercised even if the power were there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to section 16 I can see here that the IDA may provide the housing themselves.  I also see in subsection (2) of this section that they may do so in conjunction with the NBA.  However, they apparently have powers under section 16 (1) to actually provide the houses themselves. This seems to me to be an unnecessary duplication of the functions of the NBA.  It is conferring the same powers of provision of houses for industry on two authorities, not only on two authorities but on two authorities which come under the aegis of different Ministers.  If the NBA were under the same Minister as the IDA there might be some hope of having them properly co-ordinated but here we have the provision of housing for industry under the auspices not only of two authorities but of two Ministers. This goes back to the theme which speakers from this side of the House were developing on Second Stage, namely, the proliferation of authorities to deal with special problems which have become so numerous that industrialists who are seeking assistance are likely to boggle at the large number of different authorities to whom they might go for assistance.</P>
      <P>We should do everything we possibly can to streamline these matters and to ensure that as far as possible one authority carries out all these functions. Instead of that this Bill seems to be moving in the opposite direction in that it is providing that two authorities will do the same job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Instead of streamlining the position that could, in fact, have the exact opposite effect because one would have a situation in which the NBA, which as the Deputy points out, operates under the aegis of a Minister other than a Minister for Industry and Commerce, could decide whether they would or would not provide houses and they could, conceivably, be coming to different conclusions from the IDA's conclusions as to whether the houses were needed or not.  The NBA are, as the name implies, an agency only for the building of houses.  They do not make decisions as to where houses are needed or where they are not.  They simply build on an agency basis.  I think this is as it should be.  The responsibility for a decision of this kind should be vested in the Industrial Development Authority which, as is defined earlier in the Bill, is the body entrusted with national responsibility for industrial development.  The Deputy will see, if he thinks about it, that what he is suggesting could, in fact, be a much worse situation than the one that he sees at the moment.</P>

There is one feature of this that is puzzling and a little worrying from the point of view of the actual finances of the country and that is the growing gap between the amount paid and the amount approved.

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall reformulate my point.  The point is that if we take industrial grants, as distinct from adaptation grants, at 31st March this year £48 million was approved and £23 million had been paid.  The position of adaptation grants is different because the nature of the operation there of making adaptations, additions and so on, to existing industries as such means that the time lag is relatively short and the time between approval and payment is in many cases negligible.  The industrial grants which are the major part of total payments currently are in a different position. Their time lag is quite substantial.  I think it is just over two years on average although because of the problem of those approvals which lapse because they are not proceeded with it is a little difficult to make this calculation from the published figures. The fact is that the relationship was one of over two to one in March this year and adding the undeveloped areas grants with the grants for the rest of the country one gets this total.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is disturbing that there is such a disparity, in the sense that at any given moment this country now has an enormous outstanding liability as <Col N="1292" /> and when a particular industry gets going.  For us to be in the position we were in March this year where we owed in a sense, or we were liable to have a call made on us for, £25 million, is pretty disturbing.  It means that the fluctuations that can occur in the amounts which have to be paid in a particular year are becoming very large.  The fact that the figures are now so large and that the amounts being paid in a given year are large enough for fluctuations in these amounts to be of a disturbing magnitude is a reflection of the progress being made in that area, and I do not hestitate to say that.  We are now reaching the stage where this is something of a financial problem.  There are certain payments in our system of budgeting which do get a kind of priority.  It seems to me where we approve of a grant there is an obligation to pay it as and when it becomes due.  It seems to me that in certain areas, such as this and hotel development, the problems of forecasting the amounts of money required to be paid in a particular year are introducing some element of instability into our budgeting.  I am putting this to the Minister without having given great thought to it and with no suggestion of what the answer is as to whether we do not need to reconsider our system of budgeting and perhaps to some degree the system of giving grants to get over this difficulty.</P>
    <P>Up to now the system of budgeting in this country has been pretty tight. The Dáil votes Estimates which are sometimes exceeded and when this happens the Minister comes back for a supplementary estimate.  Although supplementary estimates have in recent years been disturblingly large, and have even involved second Budgets, their magnitude when all sources of Government expenditure are put together is no larger than the kind of fluctuations which can now be introduced from this source alone.  I am wondering whether we can accept this situation with our present system of budgeting.  The amount of uncontrolled expenditure which we are committed to pay when it becomes due, without knowing when it will become due, is <Col N="1293" /> becoming so great a proportion of the total, particularly in this area, that the whole concept of a tightly controlled Budget, with something going over the top occasionally and as a result occasionally the introduction of a supplementary estimate, is being undermined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Indeed, on the current side you get these problems too, but as far as this is voted expenditure, and I am right in saying it is voted expenditure, it comes within the framework of the Votes of this House and requires a supplementary estimate. The fact that the money has to be borrowed rather than be found from taxation does not necessarily make the whole thing any easier.  Indeed, the fluctuations in the Government's demand for credit from year to year, and even from period to period within a year, are already causing considerable problems.</P>
      <P>I am wondering whether the Minister has given any thought to the problem and whether he has any ideas as to what ought to be done about this open-ended commitment which has reached the sum of £25 million owed and payable on demand, with no control over when it is going to be due. The Minister is probably in a position to forecast it to some degree as he knows the sums only recently approved for projects which are going to take a year or two to mature.  Nevertheless it is a very large sum and there is a large unpredictable element in it.  Has the Minister given any thought to this problem and its implications on the system of budgeting?</P>

Nevertheless, I think I should say I am aware of the problem which, as Deputy Dr. FitzGerald has said, is becoming more acute with the progress we are making and with the <Col N="1294" /> advent of large scale operations which I think is what Deputy Dr. FitzGerald was calling for.  We already have budgets under consideration in respect of which grants for one project might well be in the region of £25 million or more.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I did not say we have them; I said they were under consideration.  The House will understand that the problem mentioned by Deputy Dr. FitzGerald has crossed my mind.  I cannot say what I think is the best method of dealing with it.  I have certain ideas in my own mind about it and the Minister for Finance is also concerned about this.  The basic situation is that if we want to have industrial development and if we want it to proceed to the level of sophistication and technology which we talk about then we are going to have to face up to the fact that we will have to find the money.</P>
      <P>The budgeting arrangements in that connection are really a separate matter from the discussion of this Bill and I do not think I can go into that aspect in any detail.  As Deputy Dr. FitzGerald raised the question of the actual amount of grants, I might give some figures as at 31st March this year.  In the case of industrial grants the amount approved was £48.75 million and the amount actually paid was £23.13 million; adaptation grants approved amounted to £21.7 million and adaptation grants paid amounted to £12.45 million.</P>

      <P>Whatever our experience may have been in the past it would not be a very accurate guide to the future. It might be accurate enough in relation to the length of time elapsing between the commitment to pay and the actual payment but I do not think it would be very accurate in indicating how one could forecast what the likely commitments were, because the level of grants involved are considerably higher now than they were, say, five or ten years ago.  There is considerable difficulty in forecasting the amounts to be paid under these grants and to forecast for some years ahead what our likely commitments are going to be based on the likely approvals, is almost impossible.</P>

      <P>In the Industrial Training Act of 1967 provision was made for the transfer of the powers mentioned here from An Foras Tionscal to An Chomhairle Oiliúna.  That was the Act which established An Chomhairle Oiliúna and it could be said, to that extent, that An Chomhairle Oiliúna has got the power.  Provision was made to give these powers to that body.  Because of the merging of An Foras Tionscal and the IDA in one body we are making similar provision here.  The transfer will be made when it is considered An Chomhairle Oiliúna can handle this.  The ultimate intention is that all this training should be a matter for An Chomhairle Oiliúna.</P>

      <P>That may not be quite accurate.  There could be certain training programmes in respect of which a grant might be given which would be carried out by the promoters themselves either in their factory here or in a factory abroad.  Other cases would require training by or under the supervision of An Chomhairle Oiliúna.  It would not, I think, be correct for me <Col N="1297" /> to suggest that every case in which a training grant was given would be subject to supervision by An Chomhairle Oiliúna.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="1298" /> elaborate on this section?  I am concerned with the brevity of the section itself and the brevity of the comment in the explanatory memorandum.  I have no objection of any kind to the employment of consultants or advisers but I am concerned with the fact that, in an operation of this kind, there may be a tendency on the part of the consultants or the advisers virtually to fix their own terms of contract payment. If consultants or advisers are employed, nationally or internationally, they will know they are putting their reputation at stake and I am rather worried that the authority may find itself hamstrung to some extent.  I think the Minister should clarify this. Secondly, the IDA does not seek either to consult with or get advice from the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards and CTT.  These bodies are quite competent to give advice. The Minister might consider a closer liaison between these bodies and the IDA.  The idea seems to be that one cannot set up a project and simultaneously get advice from two State bodies so intimately involved in industrial development.  The Minister might give us some indication of his general thinking on this.  I can assure the Minister I am very much in favour of this and I welcome the provision.  If the advice of consultants rather than the advice of politicians&mdash;I exempt the Minister from any responsibility in past developments&mdash;had been sought in the past we would not have had a ten per cent failure rate.  It would have been down to five per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister comment on allegations made from time to time that we tend to take our advisers and consultants from the larger countries with populations several million times larger than our own and there seems to be no attempt to seek advice from or consult with countries the size of our own?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume Deputy Dr. Gibbons has in mind allegations in <Col N="1299" /> regard to general planning rather than in regard to individual projects.  In the latter, where the consultant comes from is largely related to the experience of the consultant in a particular field.  It has no great significance whether that experience was in a large or a small country provided it is adequate and first class.</P>
      <P>In regard to co-operation with Córas Tráchtála and the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards there is something in the point raised by Deputy Desmond about the difficulties that have arisen due to the necessity for confidentiality.  To some extent this has been overcome recently but there is room for further progress in that regard and it will take place very soon.  No matter how desirable this may be there can be a big problem of confidentiality.  I should not like to dismiss this as though it were not a real problem; it is a real problem but methods are now being devised which will tend to reduce its size to considerably lesser proportions than was the case in the past.  I agree that we should make use of the expertise available in CTT and in the Institute for Industrial Research.  I should make clear that this has been done by the IDA in relation to a number of projects.  As I think I mentioned when the Bill was last before us, the IDA have also used some of our university people as consultants in relation to certain projects where particular expertise was available. I am afraid I did not quite get the first point made by Deputy Desmond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>With the high risk factor if, to put it crudely, they make a hames of the report on the feasibility study, the inevitable tendency is for them to charge what I call high risk factor fees to the IDA which they would not charge to any other notable concern.  It is an inevitable difficulty which should be faced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be something in this but the IDA will have to assess whether they should incur such expenditure or not in each individual case.  Heretofore, the IDA did not have the power to engage such consultants <Col N="1300" /> on their own initiative: this had to be done with the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance.  This section gives them power to do it on their own initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of giving the power.  Indeed, on Second Reading I said something in favour of the greater employment of consultants but I was thinking of consultants particularly not as consultants but, perhaps, as advisers taken on, perhaps, on short-term contract by the IDA possibly from outside the country who would have such expertise.  When it comes to employing a firm of consultants to produce a report, and while this is necessary in many cases and I would be the last person to discourage it, there is a tendency here in relation to our general administrative problems to over-employ such groups.  It is a standing joke in what might be described as the Irish corridors of power that when everybody within and around the public service has decided what needs to be done and you want to get the politicians to do it, you employ Arthur D. Little for £20,000 to tell the Government what, in fact, all the advice service within and without the public service is telling them already and the report can then be waved around and the Government will do it. There can be bad as well as good use of consultants.</P>
      <P>A very good example of this is the report on the IDA.  I am not convinced that it contained anything very novel.  I am not really giving my own views on this: they are views that are very widely shared.  There is not much in it on which the Minister's advisers inside and outside the Department could not have advised him, and perhaps there is not much on which they would have advised him.  But there seems to be a feeling in cases like this that when you get the stamp of some international firm on the proposal it carries more weight than on-the-spot advice.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a large <Col N="1301" /> number of cases of this.  We should beware of an over-use of consultants in that way.  On the other hand, I am quite clear that we do not have in this country the enormously wide range of expertise needed to deal with the highly complex technological problems raised by many of the industrial projects which we either get or might get if we set about it in the right way.  I should like the IDA when dealing with problems like that to be quite uninhibited in employing people or firms who have that kind of expertise which is not available here.  What I am unhappy about is employing people to advise on how we administer our affairs when we are capable of working this out ourselves even if we are very slow to implement these ideas.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a more technical question: to what extent does what is here modify or add to what is in section 9 (3) of the 1952 Act?  This deals with officers and servants. These are rather old-fashioned terms we still use in much of our legislation. Section 9 (3) says that the Minister may, at the request of the board&mdash; that would be An Foras Tionscal&mdash; and with the consent of the Minister for Finance, as the Minister said, appoint technical advisers to the board and such advisers may be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Is the clause here additional to that?  I am just checking&mdash;am I right in thinking that the first schedule to that Act has been deleted and that, therefore, this is something replacing it rather than something additional?  I think this seems to be the case.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to give us more detailed information about the precise intentions in this section.  Admittedly, it says in the second schedule that the authority shall consist of not more than nine members of whom one shall be chairman and of whom two others may be deputy chairmen.  The Minister might elaborate on the calibre of the individuals he may have in mind on a part-time basis for this authority.  The tone and general expertise and the calibre of this, I would say the most important State-sponsored body in the country, is of major and fundamental importance and there is a tremendous change from what we had in the last authority in terms of size, personnal and of general function.  I should like the Minister to comment on how much he intends to pay them and what kind of people we might expect on it, bearing in mind that it would be rather difficult to have any deeply-involved public <i>entrepreneurs</i> on the authority on a broad basis.  I should also like to ask the Minister if he accepts the <Col N="1303" /> proposition I put to him on Committee Stage of adding persons either on an <i>ex officio</i> basis or on an assured basis.  I would suggest the director-generals of particularly the three bodies involved in major site arranging bases with IDA&mdash;the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, CTT and AnCo.  I suggest this for the reasons I have already given, namely, effective liaison, effective co-ordination of functions, and because I think the Minister is as familiar with the internal power politics of these organisations as indeed I was from a trade union point of view.  Therefore, with the new general manager of CTT, with the new chairman of IDA, with the growing dynamism of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the change now in AnCo, there is a golden opportunity to fuse them effectively in the IDA and ensure that there is a cross-fertilisation of functions and, above all, that the old power politics &mdash;if I may classify it as such&mdash;are not in fact brought forward into this transitional arrangement.  I would ask the Minister for his views on that.  I would welcome the broadening of the general service of members of the authority.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister, finally, if he could spell out what is envisaged in the terms of the contracts of service for members of the authority.  It is not entirely familiar to me in that sense, as contracts of service for the part-time members seem to be envisaged.  I am quite <i>au fait</i> with the contracts of service for the full-time executive officers of the authority but does that extend to the part-time members as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of the word &ldquo;contracts&rdquo; in this section perhaps connotes something that is not intended. It is largely in because it is the phrase used in previous legislation in relation to members of the board.  If I say what is intended is that it would simply be the equivalent of the normal warrant of appointment in relation to a State board, that might convey more clearly what is intended there.  I should also say that I have not given any serious thought to the actual persons <Col N="1304" /> to be members of this board nor have I determined what the level of remuneration will be.  All I can say at this stage is that the kind of board I visualise&mdash;I do not wish to be tied down to this in the future if I find that, when I am trying to apply this in practice, it just is not feasible&mdash;would be, in general terms, a part-time board with the exception of the recently-appointed Mr. Killeen who would be a member of the board but would not be chairman.  I visualise that the other members of the board would be part-time; that they would include people who would ensure the kind of close co-operation and liaison that Deputy Desmond was talking about and, on the other hand, that there would not be so many of them as to give a majority on the board to people who are public servants.</P>
      <P>As to the calibre of the non-public servants on the board, I can only say that I want to get people of the highest possible calibre both in relation to their own achievements and also their standing so that there can be no question of any suspicion that such persons might utilise their position to their own advantage.  I would hope to be able to appoint people in connection with whom this suspicion just could not arise.  I am just outlining my general thinking on it.  It may be that, in the practical application of that thinking, I shall have to change some of the things I have said.  I shall try to avoid that as much as I can but I do not want to be tied rigidly to the outline I have given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make a suggestion to the Minister in relation to the appointment of the nine persons on this board?  I want to assure him that I am not making any special pleading, in terms of jobs, for the trade union boys but one should consider placing a nominee of ICTU on that board.  I have certainly found that, with new industries coming into Ireland, there are crucial and major problems of industrial relations.  It would not unbalance the board.  It would be a major broadening factor on the board of IDA if there was a trade union representative on it, not in a representative capacity.  I have in mind, now. <Col N="1305" /> somebody with lengthy and effective trade union knowledge and experience. I am not making any special pleading.  I am slightly cynical about the way the Government appoint trade union people to State-sponsored boards. I have a considerable measure of cynicism on that aspect of political patronage.  In respect of IDA, however, I know some trade union people who could make a major contribution &mdash;a person, for example, who served on NIEC, a person of the calibre of people who have been involved in taking a close look at IDA.  He could make a major contribution, not necessarily in a representative capacity, but in ensuring that when foreign industrialists come to Ireland there will be on the board a member with the necessary specialised and complex information available.  Would the Minister favour that?</P>

      <P>It is an item which I certainly would have been considering anyway but I shall be more particularly considering it in view of Deputy Desmond's remarks.  I do not think I should elaborate on the pros and cons of the Deputy's suggestion.  He will appreciate that there are both.  I shall certainly be giving it serious consideration. I should also add that, when I say I want the members of the board to be part-time, other than the exception I mentioned, what I have in mind is that the board would not be so involved in day-to-day operations of IDA as to find it very difficult to stand back and look at overall policy and strategy in industrial development. That the functions of the board would largely be policy-making and issuing directives to be carried out by the executives and their staffs and the assessment of performance by the executives and staff in attaining the policies which would be laid down.</P>

      <P>I am doubly surprised by the recent discussion.  I had proposed to raise these issues on the Second Schedule.  They seem to be more appropriate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion is certainly relevant to this section, though <Col N="1306" /> I had not realised this would be the best place to raise the issues.  It might be better, perhaps to complete the discussion now and we shall not have to spend so much on the Second Schedule.</P>
      <P>Perhaps, I read the Bill or this part of the Bill somewhat cursorily, or, perhaps, I was just prejudging something, but I had rather assumed from the wording of it, and from the absence of any contrary indication that I am aware of, that the Minister had intended to continue the present practice of the IDA of having full-time members.</P>
      <P>This seemed to me to be clearly indicated by the mention of fixing their remuneration and terms of employment and conditions by contracts.  I did not think that this was the case with directors or part-time directors of State bodies.  It seems to be a new development to me.  I can quite see that it may be the case and has been the case for full-time directors of the IDA who are not, in fact, just directors but are also members of the authority. They are the authority.  They have a rather peculiar role but it is a rather particular role.  They are full-time and it is quite proper that they should have contracts of employment.</P>
      <P>When the Minister referred here to contracts I had assumed that they would be full-time members and I did not find anything in the Second Schedule to contradict this impression.  Perhaps, I was wrong in just assuming that this was the case.  The fact that there is to be a chairman and two deputy chairmen clearly implies to me that they would be full-time.  One does not normally in a State body have any deputy chairman, never mind two.  The fact that the authority may act with any three of its number implied to me again a situation where you have a full-time authority and any three of them can act, rather like the Labour Court, breaking up into sections and with a number of groups working separately on particular projects and taking decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very taken aback to discover that this is not the case.  I am not necessarily against the Minister's proposal.  Indeed, I have not had long enough since he revealed his hand to <Col N="1307" /> make up my mind one way or the other.  I am wondering whether it is simply that I have not followed the debate closely enough that I have just discovered this or was it made clearer earlier on?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Deputy was talking I was trying to remember whether, in fact, it had been made clear.  I cannot recall precisely whether it had.  If the Deputy was not aware of it it must not have been made very clear.  Perhaps, while I am on my feet I should say that the drafting of the section is such that it could cover the situation which Deputy FitzGerald visualised.  It can also cover the situation which I have outlined.  I have told the House the way I think this should operate.  It may be that experience will show that this is wrong and that I or a successor of mine might well decide to approach it in a different way, in which event the section as it stands will enable that to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  So what we have here is a situation where the practice has been to have full-time members. The Minister has in mind changing this but he does not want to prejudge the issue.  Some time in the future some other Minister or the Minister himself might revert to the full-time board.  That had not been at all clear to me.  It is important that we should know the Minister's intentions because the IDA, as distinct from An Foras Tionscal, has hitherto operated on the basis of full-time board members and they carried great authority in negotiating. It seems to me that the fact that they are members of the board, as distinct from executives of a company, who have to refer to the board for decisions, has given them a particular authority in negotiation and this is, perhaps, appropriate to the function they have to carry out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be dogmatic about this and, indeed, the Minister has not been dogmatic.  I have not had time to think out what is the best policy.  The job of these people is in large measure to negotiate new projects to come here. They must run the office as well and other functions of that kind, but their function is not that of running a large <Col N="1308" /> organisation, so much as being negotiators with all kinds of industrial interests to persuade them to come here.  In those circumstances a part-time supervisory board supervising the carrying on of the affairs of an organisation does not seem to me to be necessarily the most appropriate scheme for this body.</P>
    <P>The Minister, of course, is obviously much closer to this than I am and, from his experience and knowledge of the working of the IDA and An Foras Tionscal, which is the grant-giving authority at the moment and has part-time directors, may have reason to feel this change would be beneficial but I would have thought what might be a solution might be a mixture of the two. In fact, when the Minister started to speak I thought that he was going to say that what he envisaged was a number of full-time members who would be responsible for negotiations, and a number of part-time members who would join with them in discussing general policy and in bringing an outside view to bear.</P>
    <P>While I would not be dogmatic that that is the solution, I would ask the Minister to consider it.  If he has not given deep thought to all this already, and he does not seem to have made up his mind definitely about it, he ought to consider whether he may not weaken the authority in its negotiating function by leaving it in a position where no member of the executive staff other than the&mdash;what is he to be called?  the general manager?&mdash; is, in fact, a member of the board and, therefore, there will be the problem of constant reference back to the authority.</P>
    <P>In the experience I have had of the IDA, and it tended to be some years ago rather than recently.  I was always impressed by the authority with which the members of the board could speak and act.  I would fear that there might be diminution in their ability to do their job effectively if they no longer had that authority and, at the same time, I appreciate the Minister's desire to bring in outside people to bring an outside view to bear on these problems. Every State body and every private company is in constant danger <Col N="1309" /> that the management will become so close to the tasks to be done that they will fail to see the wood for the trees. I had this experience myself in working in a State company, as a member of the staff of Aer Lingus.  I think we did a good job and I think they still do a magnificent job, but there were times when we became so involved in dealing with the immediate issues that we failed to see the broader national context in which we were working.  The function of the board of the company was to bring a bit of outside light to bear on our work and to show us where we were being too narrow-minded.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible that the Minister may feel that the IDA has lacked this and that, while it has done a wonderful job, it would have helped if it had some part-time directors who would help to give it this outside view.  At the same time, if these are part-time directors who are also particularly involved in different aspects of the Irish economy they could bring particular expertise to bear. Deputy Desmond's suggestion is one I would heartily endorse.  I would endorse it in this instance, not particularly as some kind of token contribution towards worker participation&mdash;I could scarcely think of a less relevant case for this; I am not saying that those concerned should not have some voice in running it&mdash;but in view of the nature of the IDA and even the small size of the staff this is not really the major issue, for the reasons which Deputy Desmond mentioned.  Deputy Desmond concentrated on one particular aspect, that is, the value of having somebody with experience in industrial relations from that side on the IDA.  I can see this is a valid point.</P>
    <P>Indeed, some of my experience recently have suggested that a little more of that kind of experience on the trade union side might have helped or might help in the future.  There is more to it than that.  Deputy Desmond also referred to the kind of people who have represented the trade union movement on the NIEC.  From my own experience of working with the NIEC I found that the trade union contribution was uniformly constructive.  Indeed, the same was true of the Committee on Industrial <Col N="1310" /> Organisation.  There was no tendency on the part of the trade union representatives any more than the management representatives to try to fight their corner.  They were concerned with achieving national objectives and they worked harmoniously with their opposite numbers on the other side of the table and with the civil servants to achieve objectives.</P>
    <P>Their great experience brought to bear on the problems has always been valuable and I would think that from that point of view their general knowledge of and interest in the economy and the angle from which they view the economy would be helpful on a board of this kind.  Therefore, I would favour part-time representatives because they could bring this kind of angle, this kind of view, to bear.  The same is true on the industrial side.  If we had several leading Irish industrialists, perhaps a leading banker, who would also bring a knowledge of private industry to bear, this would be valuable.  Many outside interests who are dealing with us, particularly if they are American, have a strong preference for dealing with private businessmen rather than public servants.  This has been one problem of the IDA to some degree.  Europeans are used to dealing with public servants but many Americans have a strong prejudice for dealing with people who are businessmen or lawyers like themselves who can understand their point of view. From experience I have had over a number of years with the IDA, it would be of benefit if we were able to send to the United States, for example, from time to time representatives preferably with the status of board members who could speak as private ambassadors, as representatives of the private sector, in terms their opposite numbers could understand and be sympathetic to.  Their special respect for people who are <i>entrepreneurs</i> like themselves may seem curious and not particularly a serious attitude, but they do have this attitude.</P>
    <P>The case that seems to me to emerge is one for a board with an admixture of full-time and part-time members: full-time members who would be bearing the main <Col N="1311" /> burden of negotiation, and part-time members who could occasionally get involved, who could be effective representatives of the board, especially in cases where there is this preoccupation with private enterprise, and who would bring not only an outside view but a special point of view from their own experience to bear on the problems involved.  I am not asking the Minister to commit himself now, because I know he has yet to make up his mind on this, but I should like him to bear in mind these points and the points raised by Deputy Desmond when considering the appointment of the board.</P>
    <P>Another point I want to press, it is one the Minister will have in mind anyway, is that there are some cases where the appointment of people for political reasons is more damaging or less valuable, whatever way you like to put it, than in other cases.  There are some State boards which have more than their share of political appointments, because it is felt perhaps that their function is not of such vital importance and that they can carry them. There are others where the Government are careful not to overload them with people who are put there for reasons of patronage.  I am opposed to the patronage system, as the Minister will know.  All I am saying at the moment is that it is still there, and it will not disappear so long as the party on the other side of the House is there. I hope the Minister would be slow to involve himself in the exercise of patronage of this kind where so much is at stake, and I would expect from him, and be reasonably sure we shall get from him, a board of people who will be appointed for reasons that will be non-political.</P>

      <P>Briefly I want to comment on the last point raised by Deputy FitzGerald.  I would suggest that he really ought not to make the kind of remark he did about this side of the House in regard to political patronage, because the record of his own party and of his party's erstwhile colleagues in other Governments does not exactly indicate the situation that seemed to be indicated in what he said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to that, the various points to which Deputy FitzGerald referred, including the question of the status of members when they are negotiating, are matters to which I have given a great deal of thought.  Lest I misled the House, I should like to make it clear I have my mind made up in regard to all of the members being part-time other than one I have mentioned.  I have not got my mind made up either as to who the people are to be or exactly the composition, the representation and so on. I do not want to involve the House in any detailed discussion of how this thing will work, because, while I have the broad outline quite clear in my mind, the operation of it may be somewhat different from that broad outline. However, Deputies will have noted that there is provision in one of the schedules for the delegation of functions by the board.  Consequently, I am hoping to get the best of both worlds by having full-time people who will have delegated to them certain <Col N="1313" /> functions of the board which would enable them to negotiate and take important decisions on individual cases, and thereby to get the benefit of what we have had up to now, together with the benefit I hope to get, some of the benefits to which Deputy FitzGerald referred, by having part-time members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that while that provides a solution, such a person, though he may have the authority to take decisions, might not carry as much weight in negotiations, particularly in dealing with directors of other private companies, if he were not himself a member of the board.  When he says to the directors of some large American or German corporation: &ldquo;I am an executive of the company, but I have had some power delegated to me and I am in a position to make a deal with you,&rdquo; I could see many private businessmen who often have a sense of status quite as acute as one finds in other areas, including the Civil Service, feeling they were not perhaps dealing at the right level, that there was another level to which they ought to go to get a final or a better decision.</P>
      <P>It has been the strength of the IDA that this has not been necessary up to now.  Would the Minister tell us why he is committed to this idea of all of them being part-time?  There may be good reasons for it, but the Minister has not given us any reason.  I have put forward quite strong reasons to the contrary, based on the experience of the IDA as I have observed it, at a much greater remove than the Minister of course.  It seems to me the Minister's proposal will weaken the authority of those people to engotiate. Could the Minister say what he has got against full-time members and, in particular, what he has against having some full-time members on the board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a valid point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should repeat that I have given a great deal of thought to this problem and to all the angles of this problem, and I have come to the conclusion I have indicated to the House.  I cannot give all the reasons I came to this conclusion, but I <Col N="1314" /> can give some, why not to have a part-time and full-time board combined, that is, some part-time and some full-time. I believe that almost inevitably in such circumstances the full-time members would be much more familiar with the various items coming up.  They would tend inevitably to exercise real power and part-time members would simply find it almost impossible to impose their views where their views should be imposed.  I have been asked why not have all full-time members as we have at the moment.  I have indicated my reason for that earlier.  No matter how good and capable people may be when they are engaged full-time with various projects there is a great deal of pressure on them and it is virtually impossible for them to stand back and take a look at policy. It is very necessary that policy should be looked at fairly regularly in the IDA.  It is also impossible in those circumstances to have any proper assessment of performance by the IDA in relation to the targets which it should have set and in relation to its officers and servants.  While these are not the only reasons, they are some of the reasons and are good enough for me to have decided to do this the way I have indicated to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand the Minister's thinking on this.  It appears that he is referring to a board which will be mainly responsible for the future industry of the country.  What he suggests here tonight is a continuation of a system which will allow the glamour boys of industry&mdash;we could all name them&mdash;to appear on practically every board in the country and particularly on the more recent boards with big powers.  If what the Minister suggests is carried out, is there not a very grave danger that, instead of a group of people whose only job is to see that the job they have will be properly done, there could be a group of people who have their irons in so many fires that they can only do a particular job part-time?  Is there not a grave danger in doing this that we would get people who would be excellent in their own way but who are already so busy that they just could not afford to give the board the necessary <Col N="1315" /> time and attention?  The establishment of an inefficient board must be prevented.  That could easily happen. If the Minister adds to the managing director a group of part-time people, either the managing director is the absolute ruler, and does what he thinks he must do, or the advice which he will get from the part-time people will simply be advice from &ldquo;part-timers&rdquo; and he will say &ldquo;I have spent all my time at this and I know what I am talking about.  I have gone into this very fully.&rdquo; Most of those on boards will be people who are already very busy in other jobs in other industries. Does the Minister not consider this is a very dangerous approach and would it not be better to have people who would be so interested in making a success of a particular job that they would be prepared to devote their full time to it?</P>

      <P>Therefore, a Cheann Comhairle, I am raising this question as a matter of principle.  The Minister would not be detained here at this late hour of night if he had answered the supplementary question that I put to him this afternoon.  I can assure the Minister and he can convey to his colleagues that in so far as I am concerned I shall seek my rights and any Minister who fails to respond to a supplementary question will be detained here provided I have the authority of the Chair to raise my question on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>I addressed the question to the Minister in connection with the supply by him to the public of Christmas cards.  I have asked him what was the cost of providing Chrstmas cards in 1968 and if the postage was provided for by his Department.  In the course of his reply the Minister informed me that last year Christmas greeting cards were provided by him at State expense to the extent of £278 8s. 2d similar replies have been given by other Ministers with the cost ranging from £300 down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1319" /> However, in this particular reply I can see some juggling because the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary has his Christmas card account credited to the Department of the Gaeltacht.  I respectfully submit that when a question is put to the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to the amount incurred by the provision of Christmas cards to the taxpayers of the country, he should give the amount for both himself and his Parliamentary Secretary.  Of course, it may be very embarrassing for him to answer because of the very high cost of his own cards but it would be doubling embarrassing if he had to include the sum in respect of cards sent by his Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>In the course of this debate I have been accused of sending 3,000 Christmas cards.  If I did, I paid for them myself but a disclosure was made today that one Deputy, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, sent out 4,000 cards last year and the cost of these cards together with the cost of the envelopes and postage was provided by the State.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce who is responsible for the high cost of living and who was responsible for making an order to increase the cost of bread and flour&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This year, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has an order for Christmas cards to the extent of £216 5s 8d.  Can he tell us the precise amount in £sd which the despatch of those cards will cost, taking into account the salaries of typists who prepare them and what will be the cost of postage?  These cards are usually sent in closed envelopes so that they cost the taxpayer 6d each for postage alone.  Can the Minister tell us how many cards he is getting for this £216 because the Minister for Labour tells us that his cards cost 3s each?</P>
      <P>It is a display of disrespect to the public and it is underestimating the intelligence of the public when Christmas cards are addressed to them by the Minister and his colleagues because while the constituent may think that a favour is being bestowed upon him, he is himself paying for the card he receives.</P>

      <P>Therefore, the recipients of these cards are now being used by members of the Government as a Christmas gimmick and I am warning the public to expect these cards from the Minister and from every other member of the Government. We can describe this as a political fraud because in sending these cards to the taxpayers of the country, the Government are dipping their hands deep into the pockets of the taxpaying community.  If the taxpayers had any courage they would mail back all the cards sent to them by Ministers at the same expense as it originally cost to mail them.  There is no point in the Minister for Industry and Commerce telling us that cards are sent only to those interested in Irish industry because these cards go out to everybody in his constituency.  Last year, the Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Lalor, sent 4,000 cards into the homes of the people in his constituency of Laois-Offaly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with <Col N="1321" /> you, Sir, but they all seem to be tarred with the same brush so that what I say about the Minister for Industry and Commerce relates to every other Minister. These cards are not paid for by the Ministers.  The staffs of the Departments are employed in their issue and despatch.  This practice is an abuse of the privileges attached to ministerial office and it is wrong.</P>
      <P>I wish to associate myself with the remarks of Deputy Dr. O'Donovan when he said that during his term as Parliamentary Secretary he paid for his own Christmas cards and when Mr. Costello was Taoiseach we had to pay for our own cards.  Therefore, I cannot understand why the taxpayers should be asked to set themselves up as a benevolent institution to satisfy the hysterical whim of a group of Ministers of Fianna Fáil, including the Minister, to despatch those cards as a bluff and a gimmick to convey greetings and good wishes, at the expense of the taxpayers. How many of those cards will be going to the old age pensioners? How many will be going to the widows and orphans?  How many will be addressed to the working-class people? How many will be addressed to those whose cost of living has been increased by the Minister in order to amass funds in his Department to supply some £200 worth of those Christmas cards&mdash;thus making a total of approximately £3,200 to be paid for cards collectively for all the Ministers.</P>
      <P>I want to express my disapproval at this abuse of privilege.  It is despicable. An effort should be made to expose the injustice, hypocrisy and foul means by which the Government are endeavouring to hoodwink the people.</P>

      <P>I want this to be a lesson to the Minister for Industry and Commerce so that if he is asked a supplementary question in future he will answer it and he will then be off a little earlier at night.  I want him to convey to his colleagues, if they do not realise it, that Deputies have a duty and a responsibility to use <Col N="1322" /> Parliament to seek information and that Ministers have a duty to give that information.  If they give it, if they are polite about it and co-operate with Deputies, they will not be detained on the Adjournment; if they will not do their job we have a responsibility to see that they do.</P>

      <P>I want to express my horror at this expenditure of close on £300 from the funds of the Minister's Department.  This money could be more wisely spent, with more beneficial results to the taxpayers.  No wonder this last straw is breaking the back of John Citizen.  No wonder the taxpayer's patience is almost exhausted, because they see money they have paid out in income tax and otherwise being spent this way.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and all his colleagues may gloat for the 12 days of Christmas, having sent out felicitations at the expense of the people.  I want the people to realise that this is not done at the expense of Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries; it is done at the expense of the taxpaying community.  It is a disgrace and a practice which should cease.</P>
      <P>Whilst Deputies enjoy the privilege of 300 free letters per week, this practice of sending Christmas cards is wrong and the Taoiseach and the Govrenment should realise the unfair competition there is particularly in constituencies represented by Ministers, on the one hand, and by ordinary Deputies on the other.  It is an injustice which must be exposed in this House and outside it.  It can be described as one of the greatest abuses of the rights and privileges of ministerial office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised at the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who recognises high standards in high places and speaks of high standards in high places and also the Taoiseach, who speaks of high standards in high places.  It is only right that the taxpayers in every constituency in which a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary is a representative should be forewarned of the gimmick which will be <Col N="1323" /> used between now and the 24th December.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan said he was raising this matter on principle. So far as I could ascertain, the principle on which he was standing was that he was not treated with respect by me at Question Time today.  I would like to assure Deputy Flanagan, and indeed every other Deputy, that I have never, nor do I ever intend, consciously, to treat Deputies of this House with disrespect or lack of courtesy. However, Deputy Flanagan, despite his long years in this House, much longer than mine, for some unaccountable reason today failed to benefit by that experience, got up to ask a supplementary question and got so carried away by stretching it out to include all sorts of other matters that he did not finish his question.  That is the only reason I did not answer him.  I could not answer a question which he did not ask.  This is the only reason and no discourtesy was intended to Deputy Flanagan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, cards of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries very frequently are ones which display, I hope to advantage and very often in the right quarter, works of art of Irish artists, or of the treasures of the National Gallery.  This I admit adds to the cost but in my opinion it is worthwhile. Deputy Flanagan also suggested <Col N="1324" /> there was some form of fiddle.  I think that was the word he used.</P>

      <P>Was that the word?  He suggested there was some sort of juggling in the fact that the figures in regard to my Parlimentary Secretary were attributed to the Department of the Gaeltacht.  In fact, the explanation is much simpler than that.  The Parliamentary Secretary has his office located in the Department of the Gaeltacht and purely as a matter of administrative convenience it was dealt with in that way.  However, Deputy Flanagan did not go on to say he did not get the information.  Of course, he did get the information.  The main thing I want to say is to repeat a remark which was made here yesterday or the day before by the Taoiseach, that it is rather sad to think that this is the kind of thing which this House and this country are presented with as being in the nature of constructive opposition.</P>

If they cannot do better than this they can resign themselves to a shrinking position on the opposite benches.  As far as I am concerned this matter and the manner in which it has been dealt with by Deputy Oliver Flanagan can only be treated with <Col N="1326" /> contempt.  I do not wish to treat him with contempt but I treat the tactics he has adopted with contempt.  However, despite that, I should like to wish Deputy Flanagan a very happy Christmas.</P>
