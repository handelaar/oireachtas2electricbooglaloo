    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 17 together.</P>
      <P>At the Ministerial talks in London last week all the matters arising from my meeting on the 29th November with the British Prime Minister, including in particular the working of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement in all its aspects, were further considered.</P>
      <P>On the agricultural side, British Ministers repeated the assurance already given on behalf of their Government that their agricultural expansion programme will not frustrate the agricultural objectives of the Agreement. Irish Ministers had strongly emphasised the importance for Ireland of a continuing satisfactory trade in agricultural products, especially cattle, beef and dairy products.  In particular, they pressed for adequate access for the projected quantities of dairy products which Ireland would have available for export.  Discussion of these matters is to be continued at a further Ministerial meeting to take place in Dublin this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was also a full review of developments affecting Ireland's exports of industrial products, including the implications for the Irish economy of the measures taken by the British Government to restrain domestic demand and imports.  British Ministers foresaw a growing improvement in Britain's balance of payments and a trend towards relaxation of these measures.  They recognised the special character of the economic relationship between the two countries, and agreed to discuss at an early date the special <Col N="2014" /> problems for Ireland arising out of British balance of payments measures.</P>
    <P>The possible need for Ireland to consider some modification in the programme for dismantlement of tariffs on British industrial goods was discussed and will be among the matters to be discussed further at the forthcoming Ministerial meeting.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Import Deposit Scheme, Deputies will be aware that the enabling legislation is for one year only and, while there is provision for its termination at an earlier date, there is no provision for its extension beyond one year.</P>
    <P>The opportunity was taken during the London meeting to have a general exchange of views on EEC developments.</P>
    <P>As will be noted from the communiqué following the talks, British Ministers agreed that their Government is now prepared to waive the remaining payments of the annuity of £250,000 payable to the British Government for a period of 60 years to 1985 in respect of damage to property in Ireland after the 21st January, 1919.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach say there were discussions with the British Government with regard to further reductions in our tariffs next July?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that was mentioned. It will be discussed further at the meetings to be held this month in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the point of view was expressed on behalf of the Government here that if selective decisions were made as have been made by the British Government we would reserve the right to reconsider the liberalisation of tariffs accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can take it that all relevant points like that were discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I inquire if with special reference to achieving exports from this country it was thought expedient to remind the British Government that we made an agreement with them in 1947 when I think my predecessor, Deputy Patrick Smith, was Minister for Agriculture, to expand the <Col N="2015" /> output of eggs at the request of the British Government and that they subsequently altered their own domestic policy with the result that they themselves became exporters of eggs and ceased to buy Irish eggs or indeed Danish eggs at all?  Might we recall that one breach of the spirit of an agreement at that time is quite enough and that if we entered this trade agreement with them in anticipation of an expanding market for commodities like cheese we would reasonably expect it to be honoured not only in the letter but in the spirit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to discover the question in that peroration but if the Deputy is suggesting that we should have made the point that our expansion in agricultural products, notably cheese, must be taken into account, certainly that point was made very forcibly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister for Agriculture might have reminded them of the circumstances surrounding the egg agreement of 1947 where exactly the same situation occurred.  We accepted the British Government's request to expand egg production because they were short of eggs.  At the end of a five-year period we discovered they were expanding their production to the point of saying they had no market left for any eggs at all.  I do not think the British Government ought to do that twice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The two cases are not on all fours.  In the case of eggs the production came from within.  In the case of cheese it was a question of large-scale imports of cheap cheddartype cheese that caused disruption in the British market.  As far as overall agricultural production is concerned there is a programme in Britain which seeks to increase the British contribution to the consumption of agricultural produce in Britain but that increase is expected to take account only of some expansion in consumption which will arise in the years ahead in Britain and therefore the British Government were able to assure us that that programme will not in any way hinder our projected expansion of exports to the British market.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach say if the facts were explained that as a result of unilateral acts by the British in the past year and their serious impact on the whole economy here, if we were driven to the point, we would, in fact, consider abrogating this particular Agreement? Was that viewpoint expressed? Does the Taoiseach think the Agreement calls for this kind of expression on our part at this stage in view of the pretty serious consequences of certain British acts in the past year in the life-time of this Agreement?  Does the Taoiseach think it calls for this or did our negotiators express this viewpoint?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our negotiators certainly impressed on the British Government that acts of this nature that are in contemplation should be notified to us in advance.  The question is still open whether the unilateral acts as suggested by the Deputy are actually in breach of the Agreement.  That has not been established or agreed.  Nevertheless, if there was a clear case of a breach of the Agreement by the British then it would be a matter for us to take whatever action we would think to be proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied that our negotiators expressed the serious conception which we have in regard to the severe threat to us because of certain acts by the British in the past year?  Did they indicate to the British Government in no uncertain fashion that a continuance of those acts or failure to give a satisfactory explanation of those former acts would mean that we would think about abrogating this Agreement because it was becoming too expensive from the point of view of our whole economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be sure that our negotiators expressed such complaints very forcibly to them in relation to acts of that nature.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Did they say that the British had broken the Agreement and we were not going to tolerate any further breach of the Agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach say if there was an indication from the Irish representatives to the British Government that we were considering a discontinuation of the reduction in the tariffs next July and, if so, what, if any, reaction there was from the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter will be further discussed and I do not think there is any point in talking about reactions at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that a payment of £10 million made or agreed to be made by this country to Great Britain about 30 years ago was in settlement of all outstanding financial matters between the two countries up to that date?  Is the sum of £4 million mentioned by the Taoiseach in his reply not one of those outstanding matters?  Will the Taoiseach explain if it was not covered by the £10 million which we paid in 1938? If it was not how was it excluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was specifically excluded in the Agreement subsequent to 1925.  It was provided for in the Agreement of 1925 and the British insisted on its payment up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the £10 million we paid in 1938 not cover it?  I thought that covered all outstanding financial differences up to that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Payments in respect of damage to property are one of three financial obligations specifically excluded, the other two being payment in respect of agency services or ordinary inter-governmental transactions, payments in pursuance of any agreed arrangements in respect of unredeemed bank notes, withdrawal of British silver coin, trustee savings banks and double taxation.  Those were three specific exclusions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>If our EEC ambitions were referred to in the discussions presumably the rupture in relations between the British and the French Governments was mentioned.  If it was mentioned is it the view of this Government that we side with the British statement of their side in this dispute? Do we accord in fact with the British view of this disagreement with France or do we take a neutral position in this dispute?</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach inform the House as to what specific agreements the British Government made in relation to our agricultural exports in view of the fact that it has been mentioned that Britain herself is expanding exports?  What specific guarantees did we get other than the word of British Ministers on which one cannot rely too much because of what has happened over the past two years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received such guarantees from the British Prime Minister and the British Minister for Agriculture.  Those guarantees have been repeated by the Ministers who met our negotiators in London last week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>CIE have offset to a substantial extent the impact of rising costs by new business and by greater productivity.  The Board has informed me that, during the five-year period ending 31st March, 1969, new business has been gained amounting to an estimated £6.5 million, representing an average annual increase of 6.2 per cent on the Board's basic revenue of £20.8 million in 1963-64.  The figure of £6.5 million excludes additional revenue due to increases in fares and rates. It also excludes additional revenue secured by the Board under the Department of Education free transport scheme for school children.  CIE also estimate that there has been a growth in productivity of approximately 13 per cent during the same period.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the WSB that electricity was introduced into all rural areas in the South Kerry constituency under the initial Rural Electrification Scheme completed in 1965. The following rural areas in the constituency remain to be covered by the planned post development scheme under which the ESB are giving a further opportunity to unconnected house-holders to take supply: Glenbeigh, Killorglin, Ballydavid, Ballyferriter, Kilgarvan, Templenoe, Sneem, Waterville, Caherdaniel and Tuosist.  The ESB regret that it would not be practicable for them to give the information by townlands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The best present estimate is that all <Col N="2047" /> the aforementioned areas will be completed by 1973.</P>
    <P>I explained the position regarding the progress of the rural electrification scheme in reply to parliamentary questions on 12th and 19th February, 1969.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that the Minister now agrees with me that the scheme is a cod and should never have been instituted and that, in fact, we are now selling back to the merchants the oats purchased from them which in the meantime have acquired transport costs to and from storage areas?  If they had been left where they were they would have been sold on the market at the ordinary cost of delivery without any extras.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That just shows how little the Deputy knows of what has happened.  If we had no scheme much of this oats would have been bought at a price which would have been depressed at the time it was offered because of the fact that there was a floor price.  Therefore, we did not have the depressed price for oats that had become a feature of our market for many years, commencing with the Deputy's adventure as Minister for Agriculture.</P>

    <P>The officer concerned received the permission of the Minister for Educacation to contribute the article mentioned by the Deputy.  This permission was given on the understanding that any views expressed would be personal ones and could in no way be <Col N="2070" /> taken as reflecting the views of either the Government or the Minister.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not the Minister agree with me that this departure from the general practice is highly undesirable in that it creates utter confusion in the public mind if an Assistant Secretary of a Department of State publishes an elaborate policy statement and, at the same time, the Minister for Education presiding over the Department of which this officer is the Assistant Secretary accepts no responsibility for the policy advocated in the statement while the public generally believe that the officer concerned is primarily interested in advising the Minister on education policy generally?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that this is a fairly difficult area.  The situation has changed a great deal in the past decade or so, I believe, and it is the view of the Government, that the policy for any Department should be enunciated by the political head of that Department.</P>

      <P>However, it is true to say that by now in the civil Service we have accumulated a great deal of technical and specialised knowledge and, from time to time, Ministers are faced with demands from technical bodies and organisations of one sort or another to have their officers who have this specialised knowledge at their disposal read papers or initiate discussions on particular aspects.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is difficult at times to draw the line between what is, if you like, technical and specialised knowledge and what borders on policy. I myself in my own Department find this difficulty facing me from time to time.  One does not want a situation where a great deal of the valuable knowledge which is stored up in Civil Service Departments is not available to the public and cannot be used as a starting ground for useful public dislishe <Col N="2071" /> cussion on problems of one sort or another.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make two points on that.  First of all, the Deputy will appreciate that sometimes a situation will arise where a Minister may have to ask the head of his Department to read a speech or statement on his behalf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The second point is this.  I am told&mdash;I am not sufficiently expert to know&mdash;that the particular article to which the Deputy is referring would not normally be regarded as being a statement of policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister for Finance if he has not read it would he consider reading it?  The Minister for Finance is the head of the Civil Service.  Would he consider reading the article and considering the general question as to whether matters of policy are appropriate matters on which civil servants should take up public positions, fully recognising the vast reservoir of expertise there is in Departments but bearing in mind the over-riding question that the public should be reassured that this country is governed by Oireachtas Éireann through an elected Government and not through an anonymous bureaucracy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that one of the strengths of the Administration of this country has been that the civil servants, the Ministers' advisers, were supposed to be anonymous and not to seek publicity?  In this instance I cannot see what particular reservoir of technical knowledge was available to the Deputy Secretary that was not available to a great many other people. Was not the borderline between a statement of policy and an expose of the technicalities of education a very thin one?  Does the Minister not feel that the general public in this instance at least thought that a civil servant was dictating policy for the Government and expressing it, and that the Minister was there simply to endorse it, so to speak?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Any such impression on the part of the general public, for whatever reason it might be held, would be erroneous.  May I quote from the paper?  The writer says:</P>
      <P>I am speaking my own mind and the responsibility for everything I say is mine alone.  Neither the Minister for Education nor his Department is accountable for any opinion, speculation or forecast that I may offer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>He had the opportunity of pressing that point of view on the Minister which no ordinary citizen has, and what is the ordinary citizen to believe in circumstances like this but that it is the civil servant who is dictating policy and not the Minister who is formulating it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated my opinion that this is a difficult area.  I can only fall back on the statement of principle with which I began, that policy decisions and their announcement are matters for the political head of the Department.  I do not think, however, at this stage of our development, with so many complex technical problems facing us in so many different fields, Deputies would not be prepared to permit the type of technical papers to which I have been referring to be published by civil servants. I want to point out to the House that the demands for the expert knowledge which our civil servants have <Col N="2073" /> acquired by now in the different fields of economics, sociology, and so on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Always, when the Bank of England rate is changed, discussions are held, sensible mature discussions between the Minister for Finance, the Central Bank and the commercial banks and we endeavour between us to decide what is the best for this country in view of all the circumstances obtaining.  Deputies will realise that we do not always follow automatically the change in the British rates.  Sometimes we follow partially and sometimes we do not.  We try to decide, in the light of all the circumstances&mdash;the necessity to maintain our own savings at home in the form of deposits and so on&mdash;what change we should make.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Before moving the Adjournment of the debate I was about to pay tribute to the President of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Mr. <Col N="2100" /> James Dunne.  This has been done by quite a few people already and one of the main reasons for these tributes is the fact that employers and trade union members alike realise that in this man they are dealing with a man of integrity whose word is his bond.  They are not dealing with a man who is unreasonable in any way or looking for the impossible.</P>
      <P>It has become abundantly clear in the last few weeks that the trade unions themselves will be required to put their house in order by freezing out, if necessary, these unions that threaten the livelihood of the vast majority of workers.  The damage that has been caused by the present dispute will take quite some time to assess.  I wonder what the various strike committee members of the unions that are on strike at the moment will do about obtaining employment for the numerous workers who will lose their employment because of the present situation. They may not foresee how this will happen but it is simple to explain that orders have been lost abroad: orders will have been placed with manufacturers in other countries and, therefore, we shall have to work a long time to recapture the position we held before this strike.  We must start competing all over again on less favourable grounds. Unfortunately, it is the lower-paid workers, the men on the minimum scale, who will suffer most because most of them, being in unskilled trades, will be the first to lose their jobs as a result of the present dispute.  This dispute does not take into consideration the well-being or welfare of the lowly paid workers at all; there is no interest in them.  This is the tragedy that affects the vast majority of workers in Ireland at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that Mr. James Dunne will get support from other unions and I hope that he will take upon himself the responsible task of sorting out some of the people who are at the root of the present trouble.  If I interpret Mr. Dunne's speech correctly he has implied that there are subversive elements responsible for some of the trouble we are having with these people.  If that is so we should not tolerate it.  Many people look to the <Col N="2101" /> Government to intervene and ask: &ldquo;What are the Government doing about this problem?&rdquo; If the Government intervene, on whose behalf do they intervene&mdash;on behalf of the worker or on behalf of the employer? No matter how neutral they are in their intervention they will still be blamed in the final analysis for any settlement that is not pleasing to the other side.</P>
    <P>Certain speakers stated&mdash;Deputy Esmonde was one of them&mdash;that the Trade Union Bill did not go far enough, that we should enact stronger legislation.  I know this is the feeling of many people who say that strong legislation should be enforced, but I would go along with the Minister when he says that without the co-operation of employers and trade unions whatever legislation you introduce will not work properly.  Imposed settlements very rarely work.</P>
    <P>I should like to see as many unions as possible taking advantage of the group negotiating licence.  I have spoken with a number of trade unionists, particularly in the last few weeks, about this point and they have said emphatically that they are very much in favour of the idea of the group negotiating licence.  The Labour Party have implied that this Trade Union Bill will really solve nothing but I am inclined to think it will go a long way towards providing the workers with the instruments necessary to organise a consolidated body within their own industry instead of, as we know, two or three people, perhaps, keeping a whole factory out.</P>
    <P>Some people have been blaming the employers for the present industrial troubles&mdash;not specifically for this strike but for the long series of strikes we have had over the past number of years.  Unfortunately, in many cases, this is true: the employers are to blame. I should like to see one employers' organisation coming together and a policy implemented by that organisation to try to bring under modern conditions and modern thinking the role of the worker in employment.</P>
    <P>When he is engaged, the first thing a worker looks for is security of employment. Without it, he will not be very happy and, therefore, will not give of <Col N="2102" /> his best.  Employers should encourage in their workers a sense of belonging to the industry or organisation whether it be a chain store or a factory, and so on.</P>
    <P>Welfare facilities for workers could vastly be improved.  Canteens could be brightened up if they are shabby or shoddy.  In some factories, the toilets seem more like a cow byre.  All that is simply because the employers do not care about the workers: as some people say &ldquo;They are `them' and we are `us'.&rdquo;  Many employers have an awful lot to learn in relation to the worker who is doing not merely a job of work but who has a role to play in the industry and has a responsibility.  The worker is not told everything he has to do, unless he is absolutely stupid.  If his job is to sweep out the dock area then that is his function and, if people have a complaint to make about it, they come to him and say &ldquo;The area is not as it should be today&rdquo; instead of bringing him along and pointing to a corner and finding fault with it and then to another spot and finding fault with it and bringing him around to the various places which should have been swept.  A worker is not treated in that fashion unless he is an absolute moron which, most often, he is not.</P>
    <P>It is very important that industries in Ireland should take a look at themselves and at the people they employ. All of these people are very decent, when it comes down to it, and will be as good company having a &ldquo;jar&rdquo; with the boss in the &ldquo;local&rdquo; as any of his colleagues at management level. Workers will give much greater output if they know that the management care about their welfare.</P>
    <P>To come back again to the trade unionists, let me say that we have seen some outstanding trade unionists in our time.  &ldquo;Young Jim Larkin&rdquo; was one of those men of integrity whom we respect so much.  If he knew a man at the other end of the phone was also a man of integrity, then a problem could be settled without formal meetings.  I know many instances where his reply to somebody on the phone to him&mdash; who, he knew, had the interests of the workers at heart&mdash;was, in effect: &ldquo;Whatever you do will be OK in this matter because I know you will meet <Col N="2103" /> us half way&rdquo;.  We require this integrity in the higher echelons of trade unionists.</P>
    <P>The sooner the unions increase their size and become more powerful, the better.  Whenever unofficial action groups within unions challenge the leadership of a union and test their strength by way of strike action to settle domestic problems, they should be taken very firmly in control by the leadership of the unions.  We know there are some big cogs in very small machines in some of these smaller unions of maybe 100 to 200 members. They do not want to lose that position by going into a big union and becoming small cogs in a big machine.  They want to retain their individuality.</P>
    <P>I see nothing whatsoever wrong with bringing in the secret ballot.  It is the most democratic form of election.  I should be very suspicious of anyone who opposed the idea of allowing a secret ballot.</P>
    <P>I fear it is of no use my urging the workers to go back, as some of my colleagues have done, because I do not think my voice will carry that far. My urgings go to the trade union leaders to show their strength.  The country is behind them and wants them to do something&mdash;which is their responsibility. The country looks for leader-ship to the big trade unions here to sort out, once and for all, this continuous spate of strikes which we have been having.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>While not believing that the two measures before the House will do all which a number of speakers here have claimed they will do&mdash;that they will solve all the problems that these same speakers have said they will solve&mdash;I feel, nevertheless, this debate will be very fruitful and very helpful in regard to industrial relations in general in this country.  It is unfortunate that we are discussing these measures in the very unsettled climate prevailing at present in our industrial field.  It is unfortunate in the sense that the views expressed here may be narrowed to the present situation.  I think it would be wrong to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our industrial relations problem is not of a few weeks making.  It goes <Col N="2104" /> back many years.  Therefore, I shall attempt to speak broadly on this subject and I would hope other speakers would try to look at the overall picture of industrial relations as we now see it.</P>
    <P>The first conclusion one must reach is that the present system has failed miserably.  We must, therefore, look for new ideas and ways of dealing with worker/management problems.  A number of people have criticised the Labour Party for not examining this problem and producing a solution of it.  We have been very conscious of our responsibilities in this field and have studied all the problems affecting industrial relations.  We have produced what we feel is a very helpful guide to the solving of the industrial strife, the everlasting strife between employer and worker.  We have produced a document which we feel will be very helpful in eliminating this unending strife.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Briscoe advocating the same type of solution. He said that the worker should have a sense of belonging in his place of employment. Indeed, many other speakers from all sides of the House have advocated&mdash;maybe not to the extent that we have advocated it in our policy&mdash;giving the worker this sense of belonging in his place of work.  We feel that this is the principal root cause of the frustrations and difficulties that confront workers in this day and age.  It is a continual struggle for survival, a continual struggle of worry and of trying to meet rising costs of living, rising rates, rents and other social problems.</P>
    <P>We have had here for many years and still have a very serious unemployment problem.  Far too many employers took advantage of this unemployment problem and, indeed, are taking advantage of it at the present time by offering employment to people on a charity basis and more or less saying to workers: &ldquo;You are really only employed for charity and we do not need you at all.  We can do without you if you look for higher wages&rdquo;.  This kind of attitude is far too common particularly in rural areas.  It reduces the worker to a nervous wreck.  This situation also <Col N="2105" /> gives rise to many other difficulties in the employer/worker relationship. It gives rise to further frustrations because more often than not a worker finds himself compelled to accept employment for which he is not fitted or which he does not like or does not find fulfilment in.  This gets back to the old problem of not having a proper or adequate career guidance section in the Department of Education or the Department of Labour.  The absence of this for so long caused people to be placed in employment for which they were not suited and could not get the best out of.  In other words, they were square pegs in round holes.</P>
    <P>The biggest cause of industrial unrest is the lowly paid worker coupled with the attitude that a worker is lucky to be at work and should regard himself as very lucky to be at work and beyond that should not have any further concession or benefit of any kind.  I suppose this attitude has developed because of our critical and crucial unemployment problem for many years, the attitude that the principal thing is to be at work, no matter what one is doing or how he is treated, whether he is treated like&mdash;and in many cases they are&mdash;an animal or a machine.</P>
    <P>The present emphasis on maintenance men and their importance to the community highlights another aspect of this problem, that is the absence of the human maintenance men.  They have been referred to in this debate as personnel officers or people in management responsible for looking after the employees in a particular factory or plant.  We all know if an expensive machine breaks down in a factory or starts giving trouble the fuss that is created and the attention it gets.  No expense is too much to put the thing right.  Experts must be got over from England or in some cases from Germany to look at the machine.  Everything must be done to ensure that that machine is put right and kept right. However, the unfortunate worker who for some reason or other feels ill just has to go home.  In most cases he has to get up on his bicycle and cycle home even though he may be very ill and once he goes outside the door he is <Col N="2106" /> forgotten about and his place taken up by somebody else.  Nobody seems to care whether he ever goes back or how he is getting on.  Indeed, the only concern of the employer is that if he is not able to give of his best he should not be there.</P>
    <P>Before I go any further I want to say that we have in this country a number of extremely good, extremely Christian employers who not alone fulfil all their obligations to their workers but are at all times available to discuss problems with the workers' representatives and if possible to grant concessions and all the fringe benefits that the particular concern can afford. Nevertheless, these employers are in the minority.  Certainly great credit is due to them.  At times they have to suffer because of the wrongs that are inflicted by their fellow employers.</P>
    <P>Legislation such as the Trade Union Bill, in my opinion, does not help the good employer, but it does help the bad employer to continue being a bad employer.  In my experience there is only one type of language or argument that the bad employer will understand or recognise and that is the strike weapon.  Far too often I have seen cases where workers are paid low rates of wages and work under bad conditions of employment, and when the employer finds out that the workers have eventually organised themselves into a union, he sacks one or two of the men in the hope that he will frighten the rest of them, so that they will toe the line for him.  There is only one way to counteract that type of conduct from employers, which happens all too often, and that is to serve the employer with immediate strike notice to protect the other workers in that firm.  This will not be possible under the legislation proposed by the Minister. A meeting will have to be held, a ballot vote taken, and the result sent to the employer; and in the event of another union being involved that union has to be notified and has to go through the same process.  This may take many days or even weeks.  The only course open to these unfortunate workers is unofficial or illegal action. I do not like to see any legislation brought into this House which will <Col N="2107" /> help to protect the bad employer, but this Bill certainly will.</P>
    <P>Hostility to trade union organisation &mdash;I do not think it was referred to in this debate so far&mdash;is very common, particularly in country areas.  I have had many experiences of trade union hostility.  On one occasion as a trade union official I went to a certain factory in a rural area to meet the workers.  I arrived just at finishing time and stopped my car outside the factory on the opposite side of the road.  I called over the first worker who came out merely to inquire from him when the others would be out.  He came over to the car, looked at me and said: &ldquo;I have to go.  If the boss sees me talking to you I will be sacked.&rdquo;  I will never forget the look on that man's face when he saw whom he was called over to talk to.  He just scurried away like a frightened rabbit.</P>
    <P>This situation is not uncommon, and if there is to be an appeal for responsible trade unionists there must also be an appeal for responsible employers, and this continuing hostility by many employers to the organisation of their workers in trade unions should be brought to a end.  Some employers will co-operate initially with the trade union in order to find out who is responsible for organising the union in their factory or place of work.  They will try to frighten those and immediately the relationship is off on the wrong foot.  Particularly with so many foreigners coming into this country now and setting up industries, it is most important that a proper relationship be established even before the undertaking starts to operate.</P>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions recognise the need for close examination of their own position and the position of the various unions within Congress, and they have been actively engaged in studying the various problems that confront them.  Only in November last they had a delegate conference and arrangements are being made for further delegate conferences to go into all these problems.  They realise&mdash;and I think the Minister realises also&mdash;that those problems within the trade union movement cannot <Col N="2108" /> be solved by legislation, and they certainly cannot be solved by legislation of the type contained in the Trade Union Bill.  If the Bill is passed as it stands at the moment, we shall find that most of our industrial disputes will end up in the civil courts rather than in the Labour Court, and this, of course, is not by any means a satisfactory position.</P>
    <P>Take, for example, even section 14. I certainly have no objection to the taking of a ballot vote.  In fact, all the disputes in which I was personally concerned were conducted in that way. Most trade unions that I know of have always taken ballot votes on major decisions such as strike action or offers made as a result of wage demands. There is the legality that now surrounds this business.  If I was negotiating with an employer and things got difficult&mdash; I am sure Deputy Donegan would know this&mdash;one of the old weapons open to a trade union was to say: &ldquo;I am afraid if you do not concede this, I will have to serve strike notice on you.&rdquo;  Something like that was said.  Under section 14 you would be breaking the provisions of that section if you were to say such a thing before a ballot or a meeting was held.  I suppose that is said quite a number of times in negotiation matters but it is never really meant.  I expect it is meant in the sense that if the person does not get some reasonable offer he will have no option but to serve strike notice.  Those are matters which possibly could be cleared up on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This section creates another problem to my mind.  It has to do with the cumbersome nature of the procedure that once this decision is taken and all the exercises gone through, as laid down in the section, and there is an intervention by some civic-minded person in the dispute an appeal by that person to withhold or withdraw strike notice pending further discussion members of the union would be very reluctant to withdraw notice now because they will say that they will have to go through this very cumbersome procedure if the discussions break down. This section could mean that once strike notice is served it would be more difficult to withdraw it.  When strike notice is served in most of those cases <Col N="2109" /> it is withdrawn.  Most strike notices are withdrawn before the week's notice is up.  The local mayor or some local prominent civic-minded person may intervene and ask to have the strike notice withdrawn and it usually is. Now, if one has to withdraw strike notice having gone through all those procedures and having had further talks break down and having to go through all those procedures again this section could do the very opposite to what it is intended to do.</P>
    <P>The section dealing with the group negotiating licence is also one that gives rise to a good deal of doubt and one which may not do what it is intended to do.  It is something which could be looked at further on Committee Stage.  Section 10 restricts the application of sections 2 to 4 of the 1906 Act to an authorised trade union, which is the holder of an negotiation licence, and requests the union to have a ballot of all its members or the authority of its own executive.  In regard to any of the requirements that a group should adopt rules for the holding of a secret ballot in relation to any proposed dispute of its own there appears to be nothing in the Bill which would give legal sanction to any strike conducted by a group or would give the protection of the 1906 Act to any group.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the 18 months duration before the Minister would give his sanction to a negotiating licence.  This should also be looked at because it could in a good many cases be far too long.  In regard to the provision of the lump sum to be laid down this could hold up amalgamation of small unions because in the first place the amalgamation might not give the required number of members or then financial assistance might be required in the case of two very small unions and in such cases the legislation should facilitate the small unions to amalgamate.  As the Bill stands, there is nothing in it to facilitate the procedure of amalgamation.</P>
    <P>Again, on the section which deals with the picketing of a private residence of an employer this section will help the bad employer.  The good employer will go as far as he possibly can to try to avoid a strike.  He will do everything <Col N="2110" /> he possibly can to avoid a strike and if the strike takes place he will not act in any way to prolong it.  He will cooperate in every way possible but there is the bad employer who goes off to his private house, tries to do his business there and if he is in some kind of distributive trade he will try to bring a part of his business to his home and by doing so will prolong the dispute.  This makes it more difficult to end the strike. This particular section says that unless there is proof that this is going on nothing can be done.  If there is proof that this is going on the union can picket the place but if there is no proof which will stand up in a court they cannot picket.  The bad employer will not provide proof to his workers who are on strike.  He will do this type of thing in a very hidden way and it will be impossible for the union to get the necessary proof.  They will not know it is going on and it will, therefore, be impossible for them to get the proof. Any section of the Bill which gives that type of extended protection to the bad employer, who is anti-union and wants to beat the strikes, should be amended. That person should not be given further protection under this Bill.  That is the position under this particular section. An employer who is in dispute with his workers should not be permitted to fight out the dispute, to try to break the morale of the workers, to go to his own place of residence, to do his business on the phone and to do his business in a way that it would not be possible to get proof of it.  He could carry on working and the workers in dispute could not picket this place.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to have a look at that because, as I read it anyway, the section would not permit the picket of an employer's residence if he was not doing any business from that residence.  While the workers may know that an employer is, in fact, carrying on business at his residence, they could not prove it in court or at least it might be very difficult for them to prove it. Perhaps, on Committee Stage, we can have another look at and a full debate on sections like that because these things need to be examined fully.  In this legislation, the intention should be to help the good employer and the good trade unionist to solve their <Col N="2111" /> differences and to reach agreements quickly.  There should be nothing in these Bills which would help in any way the bad employer or, indeed, the bad trade unionist.</P>
    <P>As the Trade Union Bill stands at the moment, it comes down on the side of the bad employer as, in fact, most legislation up to now has done. However, I am not saying that this has been intentional because the intention of everyone in this House is to help those who are genuinely trying to create good relations as between employers and employees.</P>
    <P>I have just a few remarks to make regarding the Industrial Relations Bill. I believe that the Labour Court should be extended even more or that there should at least be power in the Bill for the Minister to extend it further.  I say this because there is a feeling among people down the country that the Labour Court is a place on which Dublin workers have first call.  It has been the experience of trade unions in country areas that cases which arose subsequent to theirs were heard in the Labour Court before theirs.  Therefore, I believe that the extension of the Labour Court could be expedited and that even further extension should be provided for.</P>
    <P>One thing, though, which must be guarded against is a tendency among certain employers to have a very casual approach to negotiations with the unions on the basis that if they get into difficulties they will refer the problem to the Labour Court where it will be solved.  I am not saying that that happens very often but I have on occasions come across this type of casual approach.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Labour Court should provide a national personnel service for people who are careless or indifferent and who do not take steps to provide this service for themselves. There is a problem here because, on the one hand, the Labour Court cannot ignore any appeal made to it for help but, on the other hand, there are people who will not get down to the problem of solving their own difficulties. Something should be done to <Col N="2112" /> prevent the spread of this type of attitude.  I suppose that it is due to the very good service that the conciliation officers of the Labour Court have given to Irish industry during the past number of years.  It is only natural, when any organisation gives good service, as they have done, that they will be called upon more and more as time goes on.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the coin, there are people who will not co-operate and who will not attend meetings with conciliation officers.  This does not arise very often but there are cases when there are point blank refusals to attend conciliation conferences by one side or the other.  However, I am glad to say that that practice is not widespread.</P>
    <P>I should like to place on record the appreciation of numerous employers and trade unions of the tremendous amount of work that is being done and has been done by the conciliation officers. On Committee Stage, I will deal further with the sections that I have mentioned.  I ask the Minister in the meantime to consider withdrawing the Trade Union Bill, at least for the present time, in order to have further consultations with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions because, as the Minister has said, there is only one type of legislation that is any good in this field of activity and that is legislation which has been agreed on by all sides.  The Trade Union Bill gives rise to too many doubts, to too many ambiguous situations and if it goes through it might place the solving of our industrial strifes not in the Labour Court but, perhaps, in the High Court or the Supreme Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We come to discuss this dual legislation on our industrial relations in this country at a time when everybody is horrified by the degree of industrial strife and the nature and the duration of the present dispute which involves directly very few but which at times has involved as many as 35,000 workers and at the moment involves as many as 25,000.  To that must be added the loss of profits, the loss of growth in our industrial effort, referred to by the Taoiseach yesterday&mdash;losses that cannot be made up.  It is like being <Col N="2113" /> short of sleep.  It has been said it is not the number of hours of sleep you lost that affects you but the number you were on your feet.</P>
      <P>It is the same in this industrial dispute. No matter how hard we may try, we cannot make up the goods that have not been processed during the past five weeks.  It is sad, therefore, that we have to address ourselves to this legislation, which has been on the Statute Book during the past two years, in the circumstances.  When it was first produced in its original form, in a statement of intent by the Minister, it was rejected by the ICTU.  The debate here has gone on many hours and the dispute has continued for five years, and the ICTU have again rejected this legislation.  The first thing the ICTU, the FUE and legislators must realise is that there is need for some form of legislation of this kind&mdash; that there is a necessity for change, for guidelines to be laid down and for better methods of conciliation.</P>
      <P>This debate has been widened partly because it is more or less a cross between a debate on the joint Estimates for Industry and Commerce and Labour and on the Second Stages of these Bills.  While we are discussing these things in general, we have on our hands a dispute situation which shows no signs of ending, and the introduction of this legislation at this time is obvious evidence that there must be some change.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the long months the Minister has waited, the long time he has spent trying to get agreement from both sides in industry.  It was forthcoming from the employers' side but not from the ICTU.  Deputy Briscoe said his voice would not make much difference to heads of unions, to the great number of unions involved.  My voice will not be any more effective but I add it to others to say that there should be an end to this impasse and that there should be some form of legislation accepted in this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Pattison dealt with the proposed Committee Stage of the Bill and he said it would be most interesting to him from the point of view of putting down amendments.  When we are on Committee Stage the Minister should <Col N="2114" /> accept amendments for the improvement of the legislation.  We may come from either side of the House, from any social stratum, but if we are to address ourselves properly to this legislation we must agree there should be amendments.  I am sure that in the drafting of the legislation there could have been ten different ways of doing what the Minister desires to do.  If that is so, accordingly there is room for amendment.</P>
    <P>My plea to the ICTU now is that they should remove their objection to the Bill, and I ask the Minister to indicate, when he is replying to this Stage, that he is prepared to accept reasoned amendments during Committee Stage. That is the only basis on which this legislation will bring good to the people of the country.</P>
    <P>I must, however, advert to a feature of life in this country which has been spoken about here by the Leader of my Party, Deputy Cosgrave, and which must come in whole or in part into discussion here.  It is the matter of a prices and incomes policy.  If Mrs. Barbara Castle, a Labour Party Minister for Labour in Britain, can stand up and say what in her view and the views of her advisers should be the percentage increase in money incomes which the British people can allow themselves without harming the economy, our Minister for Labour or any judicial body he might desire to set up, could come forward and say: &ldquo;If you want to get a real increase in prosperity, in your standard of living, the best increase in money incomes you should take in this economy in this year should be X, Y or Z.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We could then enter into discussion about what the lower paid worker needs by way of income improvement in relation to other incomes.  There could then be union argument anywhere you want to discuss it.  However, we need the Minister or some judicial body to tell us what we can afford. Unfortunately, the pattern during the past number of years has been the exact opposite.  There have been occasions when the Government have been extremely irresponsible, extremely at fault.  The first occasion that comes to mind was that on which Deputies' and Senators' salaries had to be increased. <Col N="2115" /> Of course, this should have been done during the years by measured amounts as they were required.  They were required but what happened is that during the years there had been so many elections&mdash;by-elections, a Presidential election, referenda and general elections&mdash;that no increase was given to Deputies or Senators.  When it came to be given it was so large that it indicated to trade unions that the proper thing for them to do was to go as high as they could in their demands.  That is what has happened in the present dispute.</P>
    <P>The Government in this respect have been politically-minded in their approach to Deputies' and Senators' salaries.  I do not regard the present rates as being a bit too high but I regard the manner of their award as being wrong.  At this stage I wish to throw my mind back.  Before I do so I want to discuss something that was emerging until about six or nine months ago and which was a good development.  I refer to the contract of service system and the fact that the Labour Court and joint labour committee&mdash;I served on one as did Deputy O'Leary and many others&mdash;were working over a wide spectrum of industry towards a system whereby you would have two-year contracts of service.  A typical one, on a joint Labour Committee on which I served, was 17s 6d on 4th of last April, a further 17s 6d on the anniversary date, two extra days holidays this year, three days extra next year to bring the employee to three weeks holidays; two and a half hours reduction in working hours, in two slices of one and a quarter hours each, in return for which there was a productivity agreement whereby workers agreed that they would co-operate with management in getting greater productivity within the particular industry.  This is the sort of thing we want, the sort of arrangement that must come and which would have seen to it that there would not have been a maintenance strike that would put 35,000 people out of employment.</P>
    <P>What is the record of the Government in this regard?  When there was a spate of by-elections pending, Deputy <Col N="2116" /> Lemass, whether as Taoiseach or Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;I forget which&mdash;indicated that the proper increase to be given to the Civil Service, local government, semi-State companies, State bodies and so on, was 12 per cent for two and a half years. This was right before two by-elections. The workers got 12 per cent.  It was wonderful that Saturday night but they forgot about the lengthy time involved. In this&mdash;and I say it deliberately&mdash; dirty political way the good labour relations that should have been cemented by a responsible Government were thrown away.  I do not want to advert to the former dereliction of duty.  I challenge the Minister to tell me that I am wrong.  Over a wide area of industry these contracts of service to which I have referred were coming into being and could have stopped this dreadful industrial holocaust that we have at present.</P>
    <P>In the Civil Service and semi-State companies the position was that prior to the referendum on 16th October last the Department of Finance had instructed all those semi-State companies and the Civil Service negotiating bodies that there was to be a two-year contract of service agreement, that the maximum increase for the period should be 11 per cent and that it was to be no more than 7 per cent in the first year and 4 per cent in the second year.  Eight weeks before the referendum they said: &ldquo;Settle for 9 per cent&rdquo; and there was no productivity arrangement and no two-year agreement. Now the position is that on 9th June next the whole horrible revolution can start again, not on the basis of a proper income for the civil servant doing his duty by his country, not on the basis of a proper income for the man working as hard as he can in a semi-State company but on the basis that they wanted to win a referendum. Even then they lost it by 267,000 votes. This is why the Minister for Labour found himself over the past two years unable to move from the day when he first produced his intentions in the form of this legislation and before that when he produced them in the form of a type of White Paper which was then rejected by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2117" /> Instead of the work which he could have done in that Ministry in cementing the system of contract of service and in trying to get a proper prices and incomes idea moving, on trying his best to get away from the &ldquo;hire them and fire them&rdquo; attitude and the strike attitude, there was the political government of which he was a member seeing to it very efficiently, from a political point of view until the referendum, that every wage increase, every movement in the advancement of workers would be prostituted for the advancement of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I am not exaggerating when I state these truths, when I talk about the 12 per cent.  It is all very well for Deputy Briscoe to make a highly responsible speech here but you cannot make that sort of speech and sit on those benches and speak in the same vein as those who have other ideas.</P>
    <P>We must also remember the Kildare and Cork by-elections.  Where is the biggest population of Army people? In Kildare.  Who got an increase six days before the Cork by-election?  Has this any relation to a proper approach to incomes for workers?  These are things the Government should be reminded of and I have every intention of doing so.</P>
    <P>The perfect situation for this country, although my words may be twisted and I may be criticised for saying this, would be if we had slightly lower money incomes than Britain but a better purchasing power because if that situation existed we would have a better standard of living and our exports would be cheaper.  But because of the dog-eat-dog philosophy, about which the Government have done nothing for their own political purposes, we have a situation in which it will not be very long&mdash;if it is not already here&mdash;before we have a lower standard of living than Britain with higher money incomes.  If that occurs, our exports are gone and our workers' jobs gone.  This is something that must be diligently guarded against.</P>
    <P>There is a necessity, whether or not we like it, for legislating to curb the activities of trade unions remembering at the same time it is very difficult to do it, because if a trade unionist is put in <Col N="2118" /> jail for breaking the law in relation to trade unionism, as far as he is concerned, this carries no stigma.  You can lock up a man for incorrect picketing but it is not like locking me up if I robbed money from the Minister's pocket.  If I was convicted of that crime my greatest punishment would be my conviction which would mean that my status in society had been taken away and I should be a convicted thief.  If the trade unionist, in pursuance of a strike, crosses the law and is sent to jail he comes out as a hero and so long as he moves in the same society as that in which he works he remains a hero and the punishment is merely the punishment of being locked up for whatever period he was in jail.  There is no stigma.  We proved that in the case of the NFA.  No man who was a member of the NFA and was incarcerated in Mountjoy is regarded in his own society as a convicted person but rather as a hero.  We can legislate all we like and impose penalties and fines but when we have done it the power to make the worker follow the law is not there.</P>
    <P>My plea, therefore, is that there should be a committee Stage to the Bill in which reasonable amendments would be debated, coming from the Labour Party which naturally would be supremely interested, from my Party and from Fianna Fáil.  If after a proper debate the House found that there had been produced by amendment a better section than the section at first produced by the Minister, the Minister should accept those amendments.  That is the way the Minister should approach the Bill.  Any other way, any forcing of legislation through the House would create a situation which might make our second position considerably worse than our first.  We must legislate, as we have been doing here, against the proliferation of small unions.  The decent worker will not pass a picket. If he argued the whole thing out logically and thought about his wife and family suffering privation at home he probably would decide to pass the picket, but his automatic reaction is not to pass.  In such a situation you cannot have proliferation of small unions where a few people&mdash;the present <Col N="2119" /> dispute is a classic example&mdash;can stop a whole factory from employing workers and carrying on with production. Even thinking about that is useless because it just does not work.  At the same time I can see a certain strength in small unions.</P>
    <P>I remember the late Mr. Feeley, Lord rest him, who was the head of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, maintaining that his strength lay in the fact that he represented only one section of agricultural production and could completely and absolutely disregard the other sections of agricultural production.  His strength lay in the fact that he could press home his point with regard to milk whereas other organisations had a broader spectrum to cover and therefore their strength was diversified whereas his was concentrated.</P>
    <P>It is possible that maintenance men could have been done without for quite a time but when the thousands of other workers refused to pass the picket, the strength of the maintenance men was multiplied a thousandfold.  To me, that appears to be wrong.  Not passing the picket is, in my opinion, a little bit like not telling at school; it has the same sort of aura.  We are all adults but, if there is a dispute with maintenance men and, at the same time, a contract of service with other workers who do not come into work, where are we?  The contract of service is gone. Everything is gone and one is in the horrible position of having the strikers outside one's gate.  If we can get a proper approach by the Government to incomes and percentage increases in broad perspective, together with an acceptance of the fact that the lower-paid workers must naturally enjoy a greater percentage increase than the general, and if we can avoid taking up positions from which we refuse to budge, then maybe the best thing that ever happened is this present nearchaotic position in industry because it may result in an approach to these two Bills which will ensure better legislation when they leave this House, legislation designed to obviate the sort of situation in which we now find ourselves with a maintenance strike involving <Col N="2120" /> thousands of workers who are not themselves directly on strike.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moore said last week that if the increase in Deputies' allowances was responsible for the present unrest then we should examine our consciences.  Deputy Donegan stated just now that the Government stand condemned because of these increases and he accused the Government Party of indulging in dirty politics.  Surely, if Deputy Donegan examines his conscience and reflects on the statement he made, he must realise that he, too, is indulging in dirty politics.  I merely mention this to keep the record right because statements like that are inclined to reflect on the accused if they are not answered.  If statements like this are repeated often enough the day may come when people will believe they are true.</P>
      <P>The increase in Deputies' allowances came about through the medium of an all-Party agreement. When the matter came before the House the Leader of the Fine Gael Party spoke on behalf of his Party and the Leader of the Labour Party spoke on behalf of the Labour Party.  The Minister for Finance spoke on behalf of the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party.  The matter was agreed. Let us not be under any delusion as to the Government being solely responsible for this increase in our allowances. The merits or demerits of the actual increase is another question. Perhaps we can deal with it at another point in time.  I would remind Deputy Donegan and any who may be tempted to follow his line of argument that no objection was voiced by anyone to this increase.  I certainly did not hear Deputy Donegan's protest.  It is essential that this should be said.  It is imperative it should be put on the records of the House in order to disabuse the public mind of the idea that the Government are solely responsible for the increase in the Deputies' allowances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to be personal at the expense of any <Col N="2121" /> Member of this House, least of all Deputy Donegan.  I merely want to keep the record straight.  Deputy Briscoe said earlier today that his voice will not make the least impression on the present chaotic situation confronting the country.  I frankly do not think that what I will say will make any impression either one way or the other.  However, we have a responsibility to express our point of view.  We have been debating these two measures for a few days now and, if anything, during those few days the industrial situation has worsened. What we have said to date, therefore, does not appear to have made any impression on the present industrial chaos.</P>
      <P>The Government have indicated that they have a clear duty in the field of industrial relations; that duty is to guard with special zeal the position of the weak and underpaid worker.  Later I shall give an example of what I mean by the underpaid worker.  If both sides are equal then, like the figure of Justice, we must hold the scales evenly between the two sides.  Our Party is dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal and, in the words of the American Declaration of Independence, they are entitled to life, liberty and the pusuit of happiness. When I say &ldquo;men&rdquo; I include women also.  It has been suggested that the Minister has introduced these Bills in precipitate fashion.  He has indicated that it took him a number of years to bring these two Bills before the House and in those number of years he was engaged in working out what we now have before us: the Industrial Relations Bill and the Trade Union Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People have suggested that the Minister has been doing nothing.  This is the Minister's idea: this idea of co-operation, of bringing people together to discuss the various problems involved. These two Bills have arisen out of those years of discussions.  So, there is no question but that the Minister has encouraged the trade unions on the one hand and the employers on the other to put their point of view.  Let us disabuse our minds of any suggestion that these two Bills are creatures of the Minister's own hand.  They are not. <Col N="2122" /> They arise out of consultation, as I say, between employers and employees.</P>
    <P>Again, certain of our newspaper correspondents and newspaper commentators have suggested that the Minister should do something about the present impasse.  We all agree that something should be done about it, but has anyone given us any lead as to how the Minister can on his own interfere with the present situation?  What is he to do?  The alternative was open to him to introduce stronger legislation.  As you know, Sir, it is unfashionable nowadays to use the word &ldquo;strong&rdquo;. Politicians, particularly, who use the word &ldquo;strong&rdquo; are sometimes misinterpreted.</P>
    <P>What sanctions should be contained in the legislation which these commentators suggest the Minister should bring in?  If agreements break down, are people to be sent to gaol?  Is that the ultimate sanction?  We on this side of the House say it is not and should not be the ultimate sanction.  So, what is the Minister to do?  Will the people who say these Bills are not satisfactory please give us an alternative?  That is what they want.</P>
    <P>In that regard may I refer to a statement made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, with great respect to that body?  I am sure they are sincere and dedicated men in the interests of their own, and fair enough.  They have suggested that the Minister should withdraw the Trade Union Bill.  I want to ask the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, again with the greatest respect, if the Minister were to withdraw the Trade Union Bill, can they give us an alternative to it?  Can they propose an alternative suggestion to the House?</P>
    <P>We want to get a formula for the improvement of industrial relations. The withdrawal of this Bill would achieve nothing.  Will those who suggest we should withdraw it please give us an alternative to it?  Better still, could the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, through the Labour Party or through any Member of the House, suggest amendments to this Trade Union Bill? Surely, it is not all bad?  Surely it is not all repressive, as they say?  There is no use in saying: &ldquo;Withdraw the Bill&rdquo; without suggesting some alternative.  If <Col N="2123" /> they feel very strongly about the Trade Union Bill let us have amendments.  Do not pretend, because the Labour Party shout long enough about their allegiance to the trade union movement, that other Deputies in other Parties are not also associated with trade unions and not equally interested in the worker.  We are all rightly interested in the worker.  Basically, we are all workers.  Is not that the truth of the matter?  I think the word &ldquo;worker&rdquo; is a misnomer in its present-day context. With great respect, the Taoiseach is a worker, and the Minister for Labour is a worker.  The man who wields the brush on the trade union floor is a worker.</P>

I do not want to be abrasive about the Labour Party.  This matter is too important for us to indulge in catch cries.  I do not want to offend the Labour Party but what I say, I say with conviction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>They are always calling for dialogue&mdash;another fashionable word&mdash;concensus politics, and all the cliches.  The Labour Party have produced their new document containing a section dealing with industrial democracy. Some time ago I was asked by the industrial correspondent of the <i>Sunday Press</i> to comment on it.  This was immediately after the document appeared.  Having studied it very carefully I suggested that it was utopian and, having examined it subsequently, my opinion has not changed.  I asked my clubs and cumann in Dún Laoghaire to help me&mdash;we believe in <Col N="2124" /> this sort of politics&mdash;and they came up with the same answer, that this document is full of slogans, full of piety, full of headlines but has no depth.  It seems to say: &ldquo;Wait, chaps, this is only the beginning.  There is more to come.&rdquo;  I say to the Labour Party: &ldquo;Do not give us any more, please.  We have had enough.&rdquo;  We have had enough of their industrial democracy and what they think of industrial democracy. Unfortunately, I did not bring the document in with me.  I have a number of copies.  It is important that I should have a number of copies so that we will know what we are speaking about when we come to talk about it.</P>
      <P>When he was speaking in this House Deputy O'Leary gave the impression that we must not criticise this document, that it was brought in with the best of intentions.  I am sure it was but, as a politician belonging to a different political Party, I am entitled to give my point of view on it.  That is what I have done and that I hope is what I am doing now.  I hope to do so in the future also, perhaps in more depth, because I do not think this is the place to discuss the Labour Party document on industrial democracy.  With respect, Sir, I can see that you are becoming restless at this point.</P>
      <P>We have also held certain rights of the workers to be self-evident.  The difference between us and the Labour Party is that we have recognised those rights; they have now become operative. We recognised the right to compensation for injury at work, the right to unemployment, sickness and other welfare benefits&mdash;all introduced by this Party&mdash;and the right to efficient health services, legislation in respect of which will be coming to the House shortly, we hope.  Recently we had legislation dealing with redundancy payments in the case of workers thrown out of work.  These are all matters which we recognised and brought into operation on behalf of workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Redundancy Payments Act was a tremendous piece of social legislation which, in my opinion, did not get the praise it deserved.  Maybe that was because Fianna Fáil were in the valley period of their political popularity and people were not prepared to admit the <Col N="2125" /> truth.  This Act should be and will be recognised in the future as a really magnificent piece of founding legislation. It is a beginning.  It is an extension of the thinking which influenced this Party.  It is there in black and white and it is working on behalf of the workers.  As I say, it is founding legislation.</P>
    <P>We must go further and strive for three things in particular, that is, first, that there shall be a minimum wage law; secondly, that men and women be paid on an equal pay for equal work basis&mdash;this arises out of an International Labour Organisation conference in 1962: these are matters we believe in and hope to see implemented; and, thirdly, that no man shall be sacked on the spot under any circumstances and that we should strive progressively towards a system whereby workers will always be given fair notice when their services are no longer required.  Undoubtedly, we need to improve the status of our trade unions.  We took over from the British the Trades Disputes Act, 1906, which was conceived out of the cauldron of the class war in Britain.  At some time in the near future we should have a look at that Act in the context of this country.</P>
    <P>I was a member of a trade union at one time: I am no longer a member of a trade union.  I often wonder what the real link is between the British unions and some of our unions here. Could we not have completely autonomous Irish unions?  One suspects, in some instances, that the British unions make decisions from London which are applied here.  Deputy Dillon may have dealt more forcefully with this point. These are matters which can be the subject of some future discussion but they can also be related to the present industrial unrest.  I do not decry everything British but we are people separate from the British which is as I should like it to be although still trading in the usual manner, of course.  It is desirable, however, that we should have autonomous Irish unions in this country, operating from Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>This debate has dealt specifically <Col N="2126" /> with unions.  That is all very fashionable: maybe a lot of people are criticising unions.  However, we must look at the Federated Union of Employers and see what they are doing for the worker, the person who is helping to put the profits in their pockets.  I do not suggest, of course, that there is anything evil about the profit motive, because, without it, there would be no work.  I believe that the concept of professionalism in industrial relations should become pre-eminent and that employers should recognise this fact. Are there personnel departments in many of our large and not so large industries?  We should look into these matters.  Without personnel departments and a decent, educated person who knows how to deal with employees, there is a breakdown in communications straight away.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge the Minister to recommend the Federated Union of Employers to have a look at the very nub of industrial relations, the shop floor, because, if you have a decent personnel department or a decent personnel manager there, you can stop many a problem at the very source and it would do away with the very office the Minister suggested in his Bill: however, I do not want to go into that at this particular point of time.  Many firms are just bumping along from crisis to crisis.  They are not, as it were, projecting their future. This comes down to professionalism. There is nothing wrong in the industrial relations field: we have so many professionals round about nowadays that an additional profession would be no harm at all.  From the point of view of the country, this is a very important profession.</P>
    <P>If we have personnel departments, let them properly be staffed with people who know about human relations and can break down a problem and follow it and bring it to a conclusion to the satisfaction of both parties. This is what the expression &ldquo;human relations&rdquo; is all about.  Indeed, in many areas in this country at the moment, if we had more humanity&mdash;&ldquo;evolution&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;revolution&rdquo; in industrial relations&mdash;it would be all the better for the community.  At this <Col N="2127" /> point in our history it would indeed be well if the Federated Union of Employers would recognise that such an approach would be beneficial for the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>In how many firms are the conditions of workers good?  How many firms have proper wash places for the workers, male and female respectively? It is all part of the scheme of human relations and of the dignity of a man or of a woman that they have a proper place in which to clean themselves. Some time ago, I was down the country and came back at 7.30 one morning. At Dún Laoghaire I saw workers going to work in indescribable clothes and, the same evening, I saw them returning from work and they were absolutely filthy.  We must talk about this sort of thing and we must solve any problems connected with it.  To continue bumping along in a crazy fashion achieves nothing and does nothing to promote the confidence of the employee or worker.  Again, this is a matter for the Federated Union of Employers.  With the greatest respect to them, I do not believe they are all they are built up to be or, indeed, that they are what they should be.</P>
    <P>When talking about the trade unions and the Federated Union of Employers, we should get the situation into perspective. I have already mentioned the importance of the shop floor.  If workers could develop the single channel system of representation&mdash;this idea is enshrined in the Bill, the idea of a group negotiation licence&mdash;and if we could have it accepted by the House, I believe it would achieve much more than a system of having 20 or 30 unions going all over the place and having 20 or 30 conferences.  Surely it is not unreasonable to ask that such a system be adopted, namely, that if there are ten unions on the shop floor they would come together and send up one representative who would be inter-union, as it were.  It is not reasonable for &ldquo;X&rdquo; to think that, if &ldquo;Y&rdquo; is the representative, then &ldquo;X&rdquo; and others will be done down and therefore &ldquo;X&rdquo; want their own representative to go to the employer.  It is desirable that it should be recognised that inter-union representation is the only answer to a <Col N="2128" /> multiplicity of unions.  The group negotiation licence might be the answer which can bring about single-channel representation where there would be a unified, robust representation by the unions in their own interests and in the interests of the workers, in particular.</P>
    <P>One gets time to read now and then. It is indeed instructive to read about rights of property which, again, is related to the worker.  Consider the position of a worker who has worked 40 years for a company.  When he retires, he has no ownership in relation to that company.  On the other hand, a man comes along one day and purchases a number of shares in the same company.  As a shareholder, he has more rights in that company than the worker has having worked 40 years in it.  This is a situation which has given rise to unease among workers and rightly so.</P>
    <P>The final point in this particular matter I am bringing out is that we should in some way affirm the significance of the employee's place in the firm.  This is self-evident.  It does not really need to be explained at any great length.  We hear about the employee being a cog in the wheel.  This, of course, is a euphemism for a non-being on a shop floor.  This, again, comes back to the question of human relations.  Do we believe in the dignity of man or do we believe in the dignity of woman?  It would be a good thing for an employer to say: &ldquo;Good morning&rdquo; or, as my colleague Deputy Briscoe said, to offer a &ldquo;jar&rdquo; as I know some employers do to their employees. I know this cannot be done in a concern like CIE because there are too many workers there but this would be a thing for personnel departments if they had their heads screwed on.  I know of two factories where they do not believe in this business of discussion, this &ldquo;Good morning&rdquo; idea or first name terms.</P>

      <P>I am not sure.  The Deputy could be leading me astray but I will accept that with reservations. This is very important and it is <Col N="2129" /> such an easy matter for both sides to bring about this situation.</P>
      <P>I should like to have adopted as a general rule what was said by the Fogarty Commission which inquired into relations in the ESB.  At page 19 of this Commission's report it is set down as a general principle that:</P>
      <P>Just as employees have an interest in effective and dynamic management...so the Board as well as its staff has a clear interest in helping the development of powerful and effective unions, able and seen by employees to be able to fight employees' battles for them.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the Minister thinks of Professor Fogarty.  Certainly, I had the pleasure of listening to him some time ago at a symposium organised by Comhchomhairle Átha Cliath at which he and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs were on the same platform. Apart from the Minister's speech, I was singularly impressed by what Professor Fogarty said.  I studied this Commission's Report at some length and it is all based on reason.</P>
      <P>Our present society does not seem to recognise that reason is the panacea for many of the ills afflicting us at this point in time.  Reason seems to have gone out the door.  Professor Fogarty had many reasonable things to say that evening, that very instructive and educative evening, as, indeed, the other members on the platform had interesting things to say, not that I agree with everything they all said but I was singularly impressed by the points the professor made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To sum up, I would hope that we could reach a stage of (a) increasing the rights and status of workers, (b) improving the status of unions and (c) as a long-term prospect, having agreements made which would have legal force and would be enforceable before the Labour Court.  This is a matter which the Minister cannot deal with in this Bill because apparently at this stage it is not acceptable to the people with whom he discussed these matters. We hear so much about going to the Labour Court.  I refer particularly to my last point, this idea of giving agreements which come before the Labour <Col N="2130" /> Court legal force and making them enforceable by this court.  You go along to the Labour Court at the moment, get a decision and either side can break it.  What is the point?  The Labour Court has done and is doing magnificent work but I hope at some future time the Minister can give Labour Court decisions finality.  There is no use introducing legislation that will send people to jail.  Maybe in future the Minister would introduce financial sanctions.  That would appear to be the only answer, to give the Labour Court this legal status I have been speaking about.</P>
    <P>I said I would give an example of what actually happens during a strike and the effect that strikes have on a family.  On Sunday last I had down with me in my bureau in Dún Laoghaire a member of a union.  He came to me and outlined the fact that he was a father with five children, that he was paying £3 13s 4d for a flat in Dún Laoghaire, that his union is paying him a fiver a week and that the Social Welfare Department do not see fit to give him unemployment benefit. This man is not involved in the strike as such.  He wants to go to work but he is being kept out of work by the maintenance men.  If you want to know about inter-union rivalry this man would tell you all about it.  You have the mother of those five children getting a fiver a week and you have some landlady, a Christian lady, pressing that family for an increase in rent.  If this is what strikes are all about, God help Ireland and God help that landlady who is pressing that worker for increases in rent at this time.  That is an example of the hardship caused by strikes to people who are not even involved in the strikes, who have nothing whatever to do with them, who are anxious to go back to work in the morning.  I would sincerely ask the Minister for Labour to try to come to some agreement in the future so that certain people who are not responsible for strikes, not involved directly in them but who are out of work as a result of them will receive some sort of social welfare payment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of quotations I want to give.  As I say, there are in this city a number of building contractors who have given valuable employment and made a very significant contribution to the building programme by making available many of the dwellings that we see around us today.  They are referred to as land and building speculators or, in some cases, as speculators in land, which is a completely different thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The corporation have in the past number of years purchased by agreement very large portions of land.  It is important that they should purchase by agreement.  The question of land is one that has been foremost in the minds of the city manager and members of the council.  Quite recently the Minister for Local Government, in answer to a question, indicated that the corporation had acquired over 2,500 acres of land for building, and the building programme envisages the provision on these lands of 16,134 dwellings. They are acquiring land for a further 5,030 dwellings, and in the capital programme for 1969-70 a sum of £2 million is earmarked for land acquisition.  This is an indication of the ever-increasing desire of the corporation <Col N="2133" /> to ensure that a large pool of land is available.  This land has been and will be obtained by agreement rather than by confiscation as indicated here particularly by some of the speakers from the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>It would be a sad day for this country if we embarked on a scheme of confiscation of one's property, particularly land.  I wonder how the farmers and other people who have land to which they are entitled would feel if that land were taken from them under some of the schemes that have been outlined here.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Leary and other Deputies here have ignored the fact that over the years we have been engaged on a large-scale programme of land acquisition.  This is very plain to be seen by anyone who has made any inquiries at all from the Dublin Corporation. Deputy O'Leary and Deputy Tully went to some pains to indicate that <i>bona fide</i> landowners should not be penalised.  I do not know what they mean by <i>bona fide</i> landowners.  The landowners with whom we have made an agreement were <i>bona fide</i> landowners, and this large pool of land to which I have referred has been made available as a result.</P>
      <P>It is undesirable that any group of people would try to force land up in value and put it out of the reach of people who want it to meet normal needs.  It may have happened in the case of one or two individuals or groups who are in the business for profit, but where land has been bought in an unserviced state, the matter can be rectified by the imposition of charges for the servicing of such sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite recently at the Dublin Corporation meeting a member of the Labour Party indicated in relation to house purchase that it was an evil thing to own public or private property. I do not hold with this, and I am sure all members of the Labour Party do not hold with this.  Nevertheless, there was an effort on behalf of that Party to impede the progress of <Col N="2134" /> the present scheme of house purchase. I am glad to say that this house purchasing scheme has now reached vast proportions and the citizens of this city who are desirous of owning their own homes are getting quite considerable assistance from the local authority. This was one of the things which the Minister for Local Government indicated some time ago as being desirable and necessary, that people should be in a position to own their own homes.  Only last night we passed quite a considerable number of applications for persons who are desirous of owning their own homes and whose cases had now reached an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the various deductions to which tenants of corporation houses are entitled range from £754 8s 0d down to about £400 and there are also some smaller deductions. Private property is something all of us cherish.  I trust that the time is not too far distant when every member of the community will get the necessary assistance to become the owner of his own home and thus have a stake in the community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne mentioned the amazing fact that some builders require very large deposits while the corporation demand quite small deposits of £150 or £170.  He did not mention that one of the factors in this was the recent Fianna Fáil Housing Bill which made available an additional £150 grant which is now paid by the local authority to tenants who are about to purchase houses on sites developed by the local authority.  It is interesting to note further that there is a £275 State grant and £275 supplementary grant in addition to the £150 site grant which goes to corporation tenants who are buying tenant-purchase houses.  This is a very desirable feature.  It is because of foresight and the type of policy this Government and this Party believe in that those additional grants were made available.</P>
    <P>Obviously there is a distinct advantage in buying a house from Dublin Corporation, that is a tenant-purchase house, in view of this additional grant which is now available.  As a result Dublin Corporation have embarked on <Col N="2135" /> a large-scale building programme of tenant-purchase houses, and will be in a position to do so.  This additional £150 brings the total amount of grant available to £700, in addition to which there is rate remission where applicable.  A tenant of Dublin Corporation who is able to obtain one of the sites which the corporation have at their disposal will get a total of £700 paid off his new home.  This is an indication of the progressive thought in this matter.  It was not necessary to confiscate land in order to produce houses at a cheaper rate.</P>
    <P>The question of the Ballymun scheme has been mentioned by some of the Labour Party speakers and one Fine Gael speaker.  I might mention that the Ballymun scheme came into operation because at that time the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Blaney, felt that Dublin Corporation were not making enough progress in housing development and that the target set by them was not adequate to meet the requirements of the people but was much too low.  We were aware then, as we are now, that when building by traditional methods there is a limit to the amount which can be produced in a given period.  It was the Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government at that time who suggested that Dublin Corporation should send members to a number of European cities to examine system-built structures and report back with a view to the adoption of such methods in this city.</P>
    <P>Members of Dublin Corporation, at the Minister's request, travelled to about six European cities and examined quite a number of systems.  They then reported back to the Corporation and the Minister and it was as a result of this that the Minister made land and services available for the development of Ballymun.  The Ballymun scheme was in addition to the Corporation's own housing programme, because we were impeded by a number of factors, one being the availability of skilled labour in our city.  The Minister set in motion a scheme which provided houses for close on 3,000 families.  This means that there are 3,000 families <Col N="2136" /> occupying accommodation at the moment that would not be available to them but for the fact that the Minister for Local Government of the day stepped in and said: &ldquo;You must get on with the job.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is quite untrue to say that the Corporation or the Minister have fallen down on the job.  The Ballymun scheme is a clear indication of the desire of the Minister and the Government to ensure that houses were made available in the quickest possible time.  I am glad to say that the Ballymun scheme, while it may have some defects, and while it will take some time for the entire group of families there to become used to the new type of structure, the new type of dwelling, central heating and other features, has been very successful. I feel sure that in time they will be satisfied with the very excellent accommodation that has been provided in Ballymun.</P>
    <P>While it is possible that many people would find it undesirable that they would have to reside on the sixth, the ninth or 12th floor the accommodation there is second to none. One outstanding feature of the Ballymun development is that decent accommodation is provided there for citizens of this city, in addition to Corporation requirements, at the request of the present Minister for Agriculture. People of this city who now have this accommodation owe it to the then Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>It is heartening to note from the recent Progress Report of Dublin Corporation the total development that has taken place in the city and which will take place in the very near future. The number of dwellings under construction at the end of January, was 1,959.  Of this, approximately 253 tenancy type houses were being developed.  In addition to the tenancy type houses, there are purchase scheme houses.  A number of other purchase schemes are now being made available.</P>
    <P>In addition to the 1,959 dwellings in Kilbarrack, building tenders have been sanctioned and contract documents are being prepared for the erection of 160 houses in that area; for 122 flats in the Poplar Row area; for 50 flats in the <Col N="2137" /> Dorset Street/Frederick Lane area; for 304 flats in the Emmet Road/St. Vincent Street West area and in the Kilbarrack East, section 2, area for the erection of 128 houses.  Work has already begun on some of these schemes.  In addition, there was the &ldquo;package deal&rdquo; which was offered and for which the contract documents are now being prepared.</P>
    <P>Building tenders have also been sanctioned and contract documents are being prepared for the erection of 342 houses at Old Bawn, Tallaght.  Work has commenced on these sites and I am quite sure that the development will not take very long to complete.  Building tenders and offers have been received and are under examination for the erection of 32 houses at Kimmage Road Lower, for 40 houses at Finglas 2K, for six flats and one house at O'Hogan Road, Ballyfermot and for 730 houses at Donaghmede.  Building tenders and offers have been invited for the erection of 198 houses at Kilbarrack East, Section 3.  These figures give a clear indication of the progress that has been made in relation to housing development.</P>
    <P>In addition to all that, development works are in progress on 124 sites in Kilbarrack East, on approximately 248 sites in Kilbarrack West, section 1, and on 256 sites in Kilbarrack West, Section 2.  Development tenders have been approved and work is about to commence on the development of 633 sites in the Rathfarnham/Holylands area and for the development of 718 sites at Tallaght.</P>
    <P>This gives a clear picture of the progress which one can expect from Dublin Corporation now that it has been pushed along its way by the successive Ministers for Local Government and, as the Minister indicated some time ago, all the moneys which the Corporation have sought have been made available.  In their capital programme for 1969/70, the Corporation have indicated that their requirements will be in the region of £10 million.  In addition to the sites I have mentioned, there is land for more than 16,000 sites and the further £2 million will make it possible to acquire a further 5,000 sites.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2138" /> Reference has been made here to small builders and in relation to those, I should like to point out that Dublin Corporation have undertaken a scheme that will ensure continuity of employment for these small builders.  The Corporation have invited tenders from small builders for small sections of development&mdash;development of six or eight houses&mdash;to ensure that the small builder will be able to maintain employment. These small builders have given substantial service to the city.  By ensuring their continuity, we are also ensuring that there will be greater variety of types of accommodation and a less monotonous approach to the question of development so that all our dwellings will not be practically identical. In the Kilbarrack area, four small building contractors have been accepted for the erection of 32 houses, each erecting eight houses which they will develop to their own designs and to our specifications.  For this scheme, we invited applications from small contractors and had applications from approximately 90 of them.  We will have further parcels of land in due course and we will again be in a position to offer other small schemes to small contractors.</P>
    <P>Servicing of land is one important problem that has been mentioned here and in which I have a particular interest. The time has come when the south city sewerage scheme must be got under way without further delay. There have been many groups and organisations who have tended to impede the development of the sewerage scheme by way of the canal.  This can only lead to the impeding of land development for housing purposes.  I am sorry but there are some members of Dublin County Council who would divert the Corporation from this particular line of thought.  I would appeal to members of all Parties to ensure that when this question comes before the council, it will get their support and approval.  It is unfortunate that up to now there have been many members of the Dublin City Council who have impeded the Corporation in their efforts to develop this scheme.</P>

      <P>The motion originally put down in the names of the Labour Party was tabled in the interest of a wider dissemination of private property in this city.  It was put down in the interest of the man who attempts to buy his own house. We put it down because we felt that the cost of an average housing site in the Dublin area is becoming quite unreasonable. We felt that the site cost was adding to the burden of a house for the prospective house purchaser. We felt that a large number of citizens who would like to own their own houses were prevented from doing so at present because of the high price of houses, and this motion was for the purpose of airing the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2140" /> Therefore, far from trying to push any nightmarish proposals, what we attempted to do by way of this motion was to ensure that private property in houses would be more widely shared by those in the city who cannot at the moment own their own houses.  We submit that this calls for certain action against land building speculators in the city.</P>
    <P>Those on that side of the House voice their illusions and their inaccuracies and sneers about our policy and they need to understand what our concern is.  We have said that unless the community acted against these gangsters in land speculation, the community would continue to be held up and there would continue to be what Deputy Seán Dunne called a racket in land purchase for building purposes in Dublin.  Only last week, some interesting information came to hand about the matter of site costs.  I mentioned it here for information purposes. The London Co-operative Permanent Building Society have put out a survey on the average cost of new houses in their area.  Considering an identical type house selling on the London and the Dublin markets, the Co-operative Permanent Building Society produced a price of £5,688 for the London house.  For a similar house in Dublin, a citizen is paying £5,082. That means that the Dublin price is very close on the heels of the London price and because the London prices have been pretty high&mdash;it is a much larger metropolis&mdash;it is clear that house prices in Dublin are going very high.</P>
    <P>The conclusion we can draw is that the prices of Dublin houses have been rocketing, because traditionally the London prices always have been ahead and if the gap is narrowing it shows the situation here is becoming alarming. I have taken the price of £5,082 for a Dublin house from our own Department of Local Government bulletin.  The Department of Local Government do not give us any information on site cost in the Dublin area and they do not give us how much it contributes to the price of a house. The London figures, on the other hand, give us some idea.  The Co-operative Permanent Building Society go on to say that the site cost of a new London <Col N="2141" /> house is £1,555, or 27.3 per cent of the eventual price.</P>
    <P>We can conclude, and it is our information, that on average a developed house site in Dublin represents £1,200 of the actual cost of the new house.  In Northern Ireland we know that the average price of a new house of the type we have been talking about in Dublin is £3,798, and we know that the site cost there is £553, or 14 per cent.</P>
    <P>Our whole point has been that because of land speculation the site cost in Dublin is becoming a larger element in the cost of a house to a purchaser and that basically the reason site costs are rocketing, going away beyond all reasonable value to be attached to them, is these speculations in building land in Dublin.  We felt that if we were to give the ordinary family in Dublin a look in, a chance to own their own house, some action had to be taken to curtail the price of the land which these people are charging.</P>
    <P>An element in the price of land being developed in Dublin for building is the rocketing cost of land for office development.  The price, for example, paid by the company who own the Stillorgan Shopping Centre, for Crawford's Garage in Earlsfort Terrace in the last week&mdash;presumably they intend to build an office block on it&mdash; was £300,000, estimated to be at the rate of £9 per square foot.  This, obviously, must have its consequence on the cost of building land in Dublin and people who have bought property on behalf of Dublin Corporation for municipal building will admit that the activities of speculators contribute to the situation in which the corporation have to pay more money for the land they need.</P>
    <P>There is another element.  The man who speculates, who lives on that sort of speculation and depends on it for his main business, will be in a position in which the community in Dublin, in the city area, must undertake, if drainage is needed, to connect the speculator's property.  The community are, therefore, subsidising the land speculator in any enterprise he <Col N="2142" /> takes on for his own gain.  I know that £4,500 an acre was paid quite recently in Artane by a private speculator. These prices do not really represent the cost to the speculator because he in turn passes on the cost&mdash;the money he paid when he acquired the land&mdash; to the house purchaser.</P>
    <P>Therefore, following the argument around, we can say that because the community stand aside and are complacent in this racket, the ordinary man and woman, the office worker, the manual worker who attempts to put by some savings, finally, because of our inactivity, must pay through the nose for the three-bedroom house and work for the rest of his life to do so.</P>
    <P>It often amuses me when I see the proponents of private property looking across at the Labour benches when they talk about our Party being somehow seemingly against private property.  The vast majority of the citizens of Dublin or any other city spend their whole lives in an attempt to own their own homes.  Very many of them do not succeed in their lifetime in owning them.  I wonder what kind of private property people are referring to when the majority of our citizens cannot pay for the property over their own heads.</P>
    <P>Our policies and our motion are designed at least to lower the cost of owning one's home and to ensure that it will be a possibility in one's lifetime to do so, a possibility which is becoming far more remote for the majority. These advocates of private property do not ask themselves how many of their fellow citizens are in a position to own their own homes.  The present situation is that they cannot own their own property.  Building societies can put up interest rates month after month as it suits their profit margins.  The person attempting to own his own home and who is chasing that mirage must scrimp throughout his whole working life and may find at the end that there are many more hundreds of pounds to be paid off.  He finds that the politicians who told him that they were in favour of private property could not guarantee that he could own his own home.</P>
    <P>It is time that this community <Col N="2143" /> stopped talking claptrap about private property when we cannot even guarantee that the majority of citizens who have incomes under £1,000 a year at present, can acquire their own houses. We are telling them lies when we say that they should be able to own their own homes because the cost of doing so at present has gone beyond their pockets.  They will spend their whole lives attempting to pay off the mortgage on their house and technically it will never be their own as costs are going at present.  A three-bedroom house which is built very rapidly, a house of very modest proportions in Dublin, cannot be bought for under £4,000 at present.  The building societies are not looking around for clients; indeed, one must be in a particularly secure job and wait quite a period before getting a loan.  If one is lucky enough to succeed with the building society one then starts the neverending instalment purchase plan attempting to own one's own house and be one of the few privileged to spend the rest of one's life in the attempt.  This will be difficult enough but at present we have a large number of young married people who cannot even get this doubtful privilege of coping with the mortgage sum and the interest that is constantly jerked up as each economic crisis arises.  Remember, the house purchaser must face a constantly rising bill for rates and, again, nothing can be done about that.  The man who attempts to look after himself in the community, the man politicians always say is the backbone of the community, the thrifty man who wants to be no burden to the community is constantly penalised.  In no case is he more acted against or his interests less well looked after than in the matter of housing.</P>
    <P>The community itself is very largely to blame for allowing a free market to develop in land speculation and land purchase in city areas.  This contributes to the rising cost of houses.  Nothing is done for this man who is lauded on all sides as the backbone of the State. He is on his own in paying for his house, paying rates on it and he is on his own when he must meet the bills each month.  He is the darling of all <Col N="2144" /> political Parties but he has not been looked after by any Government in regard to the cost of the site, the rates or the price he pays for the house.</P>
    <P>I saw this morning&mdash;perhaps as a result of this motion&mdash;that there is a conversion to the idea that more modest prices should be charged for building land.  I saw that Deputy Brennan made a speech on that subject. His master, the Minister for Local Government, spoke on the same subject nearly two years ago but has not done anything about it.  We put down this motion in the hope that the Minister would produce some action two years after his speech.  I do not know if we can give the same interpretation to Deputy Brennan's essay into speech-making this morning on the same subject and whether we will be here in two years time again asking for action.  Action there must be.  It is no use attempting to smear us in this House by suggesting that our proposals are somehow unconstitutional. What we have suggested is that the price of land for building purposes in city areas should be stabilised, that the element of racketeering should be eliminated.  The Minister said this was unconstitutional.  He was merely repeating the same smear speeches as have been made for the past six weeks because of our policies, attempting to suggest that there was a big threat to private property in our proposals.  The truth is that the people whom he was seeking to influence by lauding private property, attempting to say to them: &ldquo;There is the Party that is against private property,&rdquo; are the people whose cause we are pleading.  We are the only ones who are aware that it is impossible under the present dispensation to own one's own house and, in fact, our motion is on the side of those who wish to own their own property, their own house.</P>
    <P>I presume the Minister was not making a speech in the interests of accuracy because this is election weather and we understand that all Ministers' speeches are now dictated by the approaching general election rather than by accuracy and possibly it is a vain hope on our part that they will see first what we say and then criticise us on that.  Probably all we <Col N="2145" /> may expect from now on is that kind of speech from those sources.  The Minister was quite wrong in suggesting that there was anything extraordinary in the motion, or that we called for anything unconstitutional. At present a local authority is empowered to acquire compulsorily land needed for building.  We could ask: &ldquo;Is this against the Constitution?&rdquo; Of course not.  Most communities in Britain and most Continental countries have done just what we have suggested in this motion, have provided that the price of land required for building purposes in an urban area which the community has built up should be stabilised and that people who are at present creating havoc in regard to site prices would have a stop put to their gallop in a situation where we see £4,000 per acre being paid for building land.  Obviously, nobody can compete against that.  Obviously, that kind of price being paid for land which is to be used for housing development is passed on to the housing market, to the consumer, the home purchaser.  It is not enough to say that, perhaps, this is only catering for those who want to pay £8,000 or £10,000 for a new house. If one income group begins to pay this price and if this tends to become the price for one type of house, like everything else in the world, at the other end of the scale, the £4,000 house begins to creep up to the £5,000 figure.</P>
    <P>We are all in favour of as many citizens as possible being able to own their own houses; of the State and the community so exerting themselves that costs would be kept down to the point where the citizen wishing to own his own house would be facilitated in doing so in the realisation that a democracy which has a majority of selfreliant citizens owning their own houses and attempting to fend for themselves is in the last analysis the most healthy democracy.  This is where we part company with many people here.</P>
    <P>We believe that the community must make its voice felt in this matter of housing and house purchase.  There is something profoundly unethical in making a social need subservient to the laws of the marketplace.  Housing <Col N="2146" /> should be regarded as a social service and, as in the case of every other social service, all citizens should be entitled to benefit.  All citizens should be entitled to afford, as it were, that particular social service.  Every citizen should be able to purchase his own house and sufficient houses should be available at all times for purchase by citizens.  Housing should not be dominated by considerations of private profit in the hands of a few.  I believe the community will yet grow wise enough to see that housing must be taken out of the marketplace and no man put in the position of saying: &ldquo;I make my money out of the needs of the people in this particular area.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>None of our measures was designed to put the private builder out of business. They are, if anything, to do the opposite and, if there is anything designed to put the private builder out of business, it is the present spiralling cost of land.  If our motion is accepted the private builder and the small builder will be helped rather than hindered.  The only people who might suffer are those who are in a position to pay the high prices they are paying for land at the moment in Dublin. Only a few tycoons will be affected by this motion if it is accepted.  The motion is designed to help the private builder, the small builder and the man desirous of purchasing his own house.  It will also make it possible for more citizens to own their own house; that is something they cannot do at the moment.</P>
    <P>It is time the Government stopped making speeches and realised that they alone can take the appropriate action. There is a crisis.  There is always a crisis when things become impossible for a great many people and it is now impossible for a great many people to set about owning their own houses.  We must take action to help them.  These people are not asking for charity.  They are merely asking for community help and the community help we can give them is to stabilise the price of land in Dublin so that the price of houses can be brought down to a reasonable level.  The cost of the site at the moment is nearly one-quarter the purchase price of the house.  Surely, if we bring the cost of the site down to a more reasonable level, the result in the <Col N="2147" /> cost of the house will be beneficial to those looking for houses?  It should be possible to take the strain off and make it easier for more people to own their own houses.  That is why we have tabled this motion.  That is why we look for support here for this motion. That is why we do not understand the smear statements of the Minister.  The only conclusion we can come to is that he has wilfully decided to misrepresent what we said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the cutting down of the forestry planting target of 25,000 acres annually to 20,000 acres, because of the hardships and consequential unemployment that will result to forestry workers and their families, instead of increasing the target for productive investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion was tabled by a number of Fine Gael Deputies including myself for the purpose of focussing serious attention on Government policy on afforestation.  It is extremely difficult for us to deal with a matter of this kind because of the link up between the Lands Estimate and the Forestry <Col N="2150" /> Estimate annually.  In view of the importance and urgency of the situation in relation to forestry, it was felt that time should be provided to discuss forestry.  That is one of the main reasons why this motion was tabled for discussion.</P>
    <P>It is to be earnestly hoped and trusted that, as a result of a discussion on this motion, the attention of the Minister will be directed towards a more enthusiastic and energetic forestry programme.  It is not enough to say that the Forestry Division go on from year to year planting in the region of 20,000 acres.  It is not sufficient to say that year after year we have the same number of men employed in our State forests&mdash;approximately 4,500.  Our aim should be a more ambitious, a more realistic, a more energetic and more determined programme of forestry.  No one knows better than the Minister who is responsible for forestry that there was one stage in our history when the entire country was a forest. Now we find that our forests are disappearing except for the activities of the Minister's Department in the Slieve Bloom Mountains, in the Wicklow Mountains and elsewhere. Vast areas of wooded land have tended to disappear in recent times.</P>
    <P>There are thousands of acres of cutaway bog in this country.  There are thousands of acres of mountain slopes. There are some thousands of acres of land of the poorest possible quality, unsuited and unfit for agricultural purposes, which could be turned into excellent and profitable forests.  I wonder if any survey has been carried out in the Forestry Division of all the land in the country.  We have two types of land&mdash;land that is available for agricultural purposes only, and waste land which is producing nothing and is of no economic value.</P>
    <P>I submit that thousands of acres of uneconomic land, mountain slopes, bogland and wasteland could be put to great economic use.  I put it to the Minister that in every county in Ireland today, side by side with useful and productive agricultural land, there is a vast amount of wasteland which is producing nothing and which has not been planted.  No effort has been made <Col N="2151" /> to plant it either privately or publicly or by any concern.  The Forestry Division will not in our lifetime reach on all the pockets of wasteland which are available for planting purposes.</P>
    <P>It is correct to say that nowadays the Forestry Division are concentrating on large tracts of land which could be developed economically for forestry purposes, but there are large tracks of land in isolated districts which, in my opinion, could be described as excellent land for planting purposes.  Fine Gael are deeply concerned about the whole set-up in relation to forestry.  We are dissatisfied with the progress.  We are dissatisfied with the amount of planting projected for the future.  We are dissatisfied at the absence of a progressive policy for forestry expansion.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Irish Forestry which was appointed by the Department of Agriculture in 1907 was the last of many commissions.  This commission was asked to make a report on the suitability of the land of this country for forestry purposes.  As I said on the debate on the Estimate, this commission, appointed by the Department of Agriculture in 1907, consisting of men of experience and expert knowledge, reported that, from the point of view of soil and climate for forestry purposes, Ireland is particularly well favoured.  There can be no doubt whatsoever of our capacity to grow timber.  Is it not extraordinary, in the light of the opinion of those outstanding experts, that no great drive has been put into forestry expansion. In any country with a prosperous forestry policy and where, in years past, a solid foundation was laid by the expansion of forestry and the planting of the wastelands, by the time these forests were growing for about 30 years, we saw, springing from them, the woodpulp industry and numerous other industries such as saw-mills, wood-working industries and paper mills.</P>
    <P>Now, with the manner in which our Forestry Division have been, shall I say, &ldquo;tinkering&rdquo; with forestry over the past 25 or 30 years, when do we hope in this country to be able to generate any of the industries that <Col N="2152" /> spring from forestry?  When do we hope to see an expansion of woodpulp? When do we hope to see an expansion of paper mills?  When do we hope to see the production of the other commodities that come from the byproducts of timber?</P>
    <P>Consider Sweden, Norway, Germany and other countries.  In comparison to the great expansion and the great drive they have in forestry, we seem just to be planting a bush.  Let us tackle this problem in a more courageous manner. Let us have a long-term forestry programme. Let us endeavour to plant every single acre of wasteland, every single acre of land that is not used for agricultural purposes.  For our size, there must be no other country in the world with as much waste and uneconomic land as we have.</P>
    <P>I agree very fully that it would be wrong to contemplate the planting of land that is suitable for agricultural purposes but, with our vast amount of bogland and wasteland which is yielding no return to its owners, the Forestry Division have a duty to give a lead and to carry out an extensive forestry programme which will also mean the provision of useful and valuable employment in rural Ireland.  Useful and valuable employment could be provided in the Gaeltacht areas and in the west of Ireland also by an energetic forestry programme.  I am satisfied a very substantially increased number of persons could be employed all the year round on forestry work&mdash;on the preparation of the land, on the seasonal thinnings and in forestry operations in the midlands as well as in every part of our country, if the Division will undertake the necessary progressive and extensive programme.</P>
    <P>It is no harm for us to take the example of Sweden where 150,000 men, the great majority of whom are small farmers and agricultural workers, are employed in the forests in winter and return to their own smallholdings and farm work in the spring.  By working hand in hand with an energetic and enthusiastic forestry programme, our small farmers and agricultural workers would have very convenient and very handy work in their own districts and localities.  What can be done in this regard in Sweden can most certainly <Col N="2153" /> be done in Ireland.  What has proved successful in Sweden in this respect can be proved successful in this country.</P>
    <P>Time and time again, we have been considering ways and means of keeping our people in rural Ireland.  I respectfully submit that one way is to provide employment for them there. Forestry is the most obvious type of employment that can readily be made available by any Government prepared wisely to invest money in it.  Investment in forestry will not pay dividends hastily.  Nevertheless, it is a sound national investment.  Any money we invest in forestry is money well spent. Our criticism, and the criticism of many people in this country, is that not enough has been spent on forestry here and that not enough acreage is being covered.  There is not evidence of scenery provided by trees and of the grandeur of trees in many parts of this country.  I have not had, and indeed this House has not had, any satisfactory explanation from the Minister for Lands on the occasion of his Estimate or on any occasion, nor indeed from his predecessor, as to why there cannot be a greater amount of work carried out in the Gaeltacht by the Forestry Department.  Is it suggested that it is because the climate is not suitable? With that I would thoroughly disagree. Is it because there is there an open, wide countryside which would afford no shelter from the great Atlantic? With that also I would disagree.</P>
    <P>I have been told and have read on more than one occasion that the strong Atlantic winds render the west of Ireland unsuitable for a great expansion of forestry activities in that area.  The French Government carried out extensive forestry development in congested districts and they had to face far greater natural difficulties than we have had to face here.  We have seen the extraordinarily fine forests on the shores of the Bay of Biscay, open to the full force of Atlantic storms.  Yet, the west of Ireland has been stripped practically naked of the trees that were there and no great exercise on the part of the Forestry Division has been carried out either to provide additional employment on forestry work or to beautify the country by substantial <Col N="2154" /> planting.  Our best effort is 4,500 men approximately on forestry work.  We have had a Forestry Division since the foundation of the State and if one is to judge their activities by the fact that there are 4,500 forestry workers, that in itself falls far short of an energetic forestry programme.  In 1967, 20,000 acres were planted.  That leaves room for substantial improvement.</P>
    <P>There are many people in this country who are deeply concerned about forestry development not alone from the point of view of beautifying the countryside but from the point of view of providing profitable employment in rural areas.  They are interested also from the drainage point of view. Where there is energetic forestry development the problem of serious flooding is mitigated and rainfall is reduced.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has had an opportunity of visiting forests outside this country.  The plantations and great forests which he saw must have induced a certain amount of envy because similar progress has not been made in this country.  It is high time that this matter was tackled in a more serious and determined manner.</P>
    <P>Even in England, a highly industrialised country, where there is a great division between the land used for agricultural purposes and that used for forestry, in recent years there has been a very considerable increase in the acreage for forestry.  In this country, as usual, we appear to be lagging behind. Until this matter is tackled county by county there will not be any progress.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether consideration might be given by the Government or indeed by an all-Party committee of this House at some future time to the question of whether it might be in the best interests of afforestation to abolish the Forestry Division as at present constituted and to set up a board similar to the board that was set up with such very good results for the development of our bogs.  If at the time Bord na Móna was established a similar board had been established and charged with responsibility for forestry, the acquisition of land for afforestation, the preparation of the lands, planting and the provision of employment, far <Col N="2155" /> greater progress would have been made because that board would have been called upon to give an account of their stewardship and would have been subject to more critical review than the Forestry Division have been subjected to here in the debates on the Estimates.</P>
    <P>I have little doubt that on such an important motion as this the Minister will intervene.  I would ask him to say honestly whether he is completely happy that the present forestry set-up is efficient, that it is providing the maximum amount of employment and is satisfied with the rate of progress?  I doubt whether any Minister for Lands can be satisfied with the picture of forestry as we see it here.</P>
    <P>There appears to have been no cooperation or no link-up between the Forestry Division and private planting. The board which I have suggested should also be obliged to assist private planting.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Adjournment I was dealing with the effect of a strike on a worker who has no say in the original decision to take strike action.  Through no fault of his own he is prevented from attending his place of employment by the erection of pickets.  I referred to a discussion I had on Sunday morning with a number of trade unionists and to the position of one man who is paid £5 a week by his own trade union, who is paying over £3 a week for his flat, who has a wife and five children, and whose landlady was pressing him to pay increased rent.  I have already expressed my view of the landlady concerned. I asked that the social welfare benefit be made available to a man in that position.  It has come to my knowledge that he can apply for public assistance, but the person I have in mind has never been out of work before and would find it very difficult to bring himself to go to the public assistance officer for help.  He is prepared to put himself into debt for a number of <Col N="2156" /> years ahead rather than suffer the indignity as he said, of going to the public assistance officer.  This man has asked me specifically to express the point of view that some social welfare benefits should be payable.  However, this is not altogether feasible inasmuch as many other people, taxpayers, who would have absolutely nothing to do with the strike would be paying him.</P>
      <P>I suggest&mdash;I think it is an original suggestion&mdash;that the union putting up the picket should have the responsibility of compensating the workers who did not have an opportunity of voting on the original strike action. A number of these unions, particularly the British-based unions, are very wealthy.  He cannot get social welfare benefit or public assistance or, as in the case of my constituent, the latter is unacceptable to him.  There is another point, that the trade unionist might not be in benefit with his union and if he does not get some benefit or compensation, he must live on fresh air or the goodwill of his friends.  My constituent is living on £5 a week and on the goodwill of his friends and will have to repay all the money he borrows from them.  I would urge the Minister that a union should be made pay compensation in the circumstances I have outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point of view put to me does not relate to a strike; it relates to this fashionable word &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo; which, as this worker felt, is a euphemism for redundancy.  In his Christmas pay packet from his firm he received notice that the factory intends closing down in five years' time.  This, of course, is what a happy Christmas is all about apparently in the view of some employers.  This man lives in Dún Laoghaire and the factory is to be re-located over 15 miles away. It intends to rationalise its whole operation in one area.  Fair enough, but this worker is a specialist who has been working in that firm all his life. As he said, it is not reasonable to expect him, on a salary of £15 or even £20 a week, to spend a lot of money on bus fares, which are very high at the present time.  This man is unemployable in his own locality in the sense that he is a specialist with his firm; there is no similar type of <Col N="2157" /> employment for him locally when his firm rationalises.</P>
    <P>I undertook to those two men and to a number of others, but particularly to those two, that I would express their point of view in this House.  I expect this is what representation is all about.  I have fulfilled my obligation to them.  However, talk is one thing; work and payment of subsistence allowances to people who are on strike through no fault of their own is another thing.  I would urge the Minister for Labour to take a look at these two cases which I have put before him when this whole strike has been concluded.</P>
    <P>If a worker has not security it is very difficult for him to talk of productivity, to increase productivity for the good of his country.  Basically life comes down to the family unit and the obligation of a man to his wife and children or parents-in-law&mdash;who in one instance I know of are living with the family.  Out of that security evolves. One has the duty to do the best for one's country but, as this man said, it is very difficult to be patriotic without security.  I frankly told this man that I could not give him an answer to that problem.</P>
    <P>In the context of the present strike it has already been suggested by a number of speakers that we should have a cooling off period similar to that applicable in the United States. This is a good idea, but, again, it is a matter possibly for future legislation as it is not acceptable to the trade unions at this time, arising out of the prolonged discussions they have had with the Minister for Labour.  The matter should be given some thought in future legislation.</P>
    <P>Coming specifically to the Bill before us, the Leader of the main Opposition Party, Deputy Cosgrave, made the point that there should be an all-Party Committee of this House set up to discuss the present industrial situation and generally the whole concept of industrial relations.  As I say, this is a matter which I think is being discussed responsibly and reasonably.  I always feel that the best place to discuss matters is in this House.  I am a firm <Col N="2158" /> believer in the committee type discussion, again relating to the Senate in the United States of America, but this is too important an issue to discuss behind closed doors.  I would respectfully disagree with the Leader of the main Opposition on this matter.  This is a matter of public concern and should be discussed in public.  If Dáil Éireann is not the place to discuss it, where else?</P>
    <P>The Minister provides in his Bill the concept of secret ballots.  It amazes me at present that there are trade unions and other types of organisations which express their decisions by a show of hands.  This is an anachronism and could be subject to great abuse if there are a couple of very strong personalities and a number of weak personalities voting on the same issue.  In such a case you would have the strong personalities looking down the body of the hall at some of the weaker individuals and the weaker individuals would not be prepared to show how they felt and even if their opinions were contrary to those of the stronger personalities they would vote with the stronger personalities. Therefore, the secret ballot must be welcomed.  Anything else is completely out of date.  In industrial organisations or any other organisations, the proper way to vote in a democracy is through the ballot box.</P>
    <P>The group negotiations licence must be welcomed.  I have already mentioned it.  I called it the single channel representation.  You could have a large number of people on a public floor all rushing to talk on one issue.  The question of industrial relations officers was also mentioned.  I know that the conciliation officers have worked very hard in the past and I have no doubt that, whether they are called by a new name or otherwise, they will work very hard in the future.  Again, with respect to those hardworking individuals, I would ask the Minister when appointing new officers to consider&mdash;I do not know whether the present officers have such qualifications or not&mdash;that they should have some basic knowledge, some degree or diploma or some training in sociology and psychology. This is very important in the field of human relations, a field in which there <Col N="2159" /> appears to be a breakdown at the moment.  It is very important that those people should have the basic knowledge as to how to deal with both sides if there should be a breakdown in trivial matters and with statements from one side or the other that do not result in decisions being reached.  This is a waste of time and money from the point of view of the individuals concerned.  This is a point I would ask the Minister to keep in mind when he is making appointments in future. I intend no reflection on the men who have acted as conciliation officers.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the amalgamation of unions I believe the unions would welcome this.  Again, it is a question of who is the chief.  If there are three or four unions going to amalgamate the House can appreciate that this is a human matter, and it is a question of who is to be the head of those three or four unions.  A, B or C may be the president at the moment. Who of A, B or C is to become head of those three unions when they amalgamate? This is a very human thing and I can appreciate it.  Rather than abusing A, B or C, they could be encouraged to appoint their head and should amalgamate under the one head.  I am not one of those who are wont to be jealous.  If a man is successful, good luck to him.  I do not profess to be a psychologist but I know this is a matter which could cause jealousy when unions are amalgamating.</P>
    <P>Basically, strikes are not caused by issues.  They take place because of lack of communication.  I know that has become a cliché and I am sorry to use it.  It expresses exactly what I mean and therefore I use it.  Strikes also take place because of paternalism and this comes back to the Federated Union of Employers.  It is not the accepted thing that you hit a worker on the head and say: &ldquo;Go on and do your bit&rdquo;.  That may have been accepted in the last century but it is not accepted now. Fear is basically responsible for many strikes.  The employer feels that he has more education than the man representing the union and maybe the man representing the union feels, because <Col N="2160" /> of lack of education, a bit inferior to somebody he feels is more educated than he is.  If an employer gives that impression he deserves in his firm any chaos which comes.  This is again a question of human relations.  As I said, fear may cause strikes.</P>
    <P>I have already discussed the ILO Convention of 1962, on the question of equal pay for equal work and there is just one final point I should like to make in that regard.  I refer particularly to the rights of widows.  It appears at the moment that a widow receives the pay of a single person but a widower with children is paid the same rate as if he were married, in other words, a widower is given an allowance for a housekeeper but a widow receives no such allowance. This is most unfair to widows and it is a matter which the Minister might consider at some future time.</P>
    <P>Finally, one point in regard to the present negotiations.  Since the present negotiations are an attempt to negotiate a national agreement, a settlement at high level will be just as bad as if the strike continues.  Anybody engaged in industrial relations will be well aware of what I am talking about in that context.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should like to pay tribute&mdash;a tribute from one Dublin family to another&mdash;to the late James Larkin for the significance of what he did for the trade union movement in Dublin and in the rest of the country. He was a man of great integrity and he came from a family with a great tradition in the history of this country. His father was a trade unionist at a time when it was very unpopular to be connected with a trade union and young Jim Larkin, as he was known, carried on this tradition.  He was an intelligent and worthwhile man and his monument will be the Workers' Union of Ireland and the trade union movement in general.</P>
    <P>I should also like to pay tribute to Mr. James Dunne, the President of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  There is a lot to be learned from that man. He, also, is a man of great integrity and a man who says what he thinks. Perhaps, if we had more men of his type in our society today&mdash;men who would be willing to express a <Col N="2161" /> courageous point of view and who would lay down guidelines as to what sanity is as distinct from insanity&mdash;we should be much better off.</P>
    <P>I should like, also, to thank the Minister for bringing such legislation before the House.  I may have an amendment or two and hope that the Minister will favourably consider these in relation to the Bills before us.  The Minister has brought these two Bills before us after long consultations.  It is not as if the legislation were drafted in one night at the Minister's desk.  The Bills have been brought into the House after long discussions and a lot of hard work by the Minister and his officials.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly cannot compliment the Minister on bringing in these two Bills because, first of all, they are badly timed and, secondly, there are some objectionable features contained in them.  What I am saying is very evident if one has regard to what has been said by every Deputy who has spoken up to now.  In particular, they made reference to the present maintenance dispute and I am quite sure that many people will be left wondering as to what is contained in these two Bills that could resolve the present dispute.</P>
      <P>Even if these Bills had been brought in last year and had been accepted word for word, there is nothing in them that could solve the present dispute.  There is no doubt about this and I hold that the Minister, through a certain amount of confusion, has been led astray to some extent.  Legislation of this kind should be introduced in a calm atmosphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tributes have been paid to trade union leaders who went before us. Reference has been made to the late Jim Larkin.  The tributes that have been paid to Jim Larkin could also be paid to the late Sean Conroy.  Both of these men, right up to the time of their deaths, were working hard to improve industrial relations but they did not accept the contents of these two Bills.  It is imperative that one looks at things in their proper perspective. It would be very wrong for people to get the impression that these two Bills will ensure that not only will the <Col N="2162" /> maintenance strike be settled but that a strike of its kind will never again occur.  This is not so.  It is important that we understand what is the cause of such disputes as these.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Labour Court, we know that they have done a very good job but everybody does not accept this.  We know that at times the Labour Court have issued favourable recommendations but that at other times they have issued recommendations that were incomprehensible and would seem to have followed a line laid down by the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance.  On the other hand, the chief conciliation officer of the Labour Court, Mr. Dermot McDermott, is an excellent man.  The trouble is that we have not enough Dermot McDermotts and the efforts that have been made to secure more men of his calibre have not been sufficient.  There is nothing in this Bill to indicate that any efforts are being made to secure more people of this kind.  To change the title of conciliation officer to industrial relations officer is not a good thing to do and, furthermore, in fairness to these conciliation officers, they should be properly equipped for the type of work they do.  I agree entirely with what Deputy Andrews said in that regard. I believe that many of our difficulties are due to this inadequacy.  In saying that, I am not for one moment decrying the efforts of the existing conciliation officers.  I marvel at the progress they have made, having regard to the equipment at their disposal.  Theirs is a very important job.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the introduction of these Bills in the atmosphere I have described, we cannot be unmindful of one happening last week.  We saw a change in so far as the labour relations machinery, arbitration, are concerned in the ESB.  Dr. John O'Donovan was replaced as chairman, a position he held for a number of years.  The workers did not always agree with him but he kept the ESB out of trouble on many occasions.  He made decisions in arbitration which the workers did not always endorse but there were times when the officials did not like it either and Dr. O'Donovan is now paying for the last decision he made.  This is <Col N="2163" /> purely a matter of having confidence in people and the workers in the ESB resented the action of replacing Dr. O'Donovan because they had learned to appreciate the seriousness of his endeavours.  Of course, there will be nothing more about this, though the ESB workers are protesting against it.</P>
    <P>Apart from possible defects in the machinery of the Labour Court, it is only right that on an occasion such as this we would try to ascertain the cause of strikes.  I say that the root cause of strikes is the inability of our people to make ends meet.  The Minister, and others of his Party, during contributions to this debate, referred to the lower-paid workers.  Though reference was made to them and to their predicament, there was no indication given that their situation would be relieved. Take, for example, a man with £12 a week living in Ballymun, paying differential rent and having to maintain a fridge because his flat is centrally heated&mdash;he has to pay for that, too&mdash; and he must keep his food, his butter, and his margarine, mainly, in proper condition.  He must get a bus from Ballymun to the centre of the city and very often he has much further to go.</P>
    <P>They are the things that inspire workers to seek more money.  We hear a lot of talk about productivity but at the same time representations have been made about hardship imposed on people through taxation of overtime. It has been suggested also that such overtime should not be reckoned in respect of differential rents.  Representations have been made to give lower-paid workers more social benefits, such as children's allowances.  Yet, when the workman indulges in the last resort, the strike, everybody screams about it.  At the same time, the people who have some power to control these things, the Government, do not take action about it.  They do nothing about price rises.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews very fairly painted a picture of a man living on strike pay of £5 a week.  There have been cases of people who were out of benefit with their unions.  In other cases, workers considered that they were not involved in a dispute and they should, of course, <Col N="2164" /> have got social welfare benefits but when they sought assistance it was denied.  All this is due to Government inaction and workers have the feeling that nothing is being done about their grievances.  They are expected to pay for all, to stay mum and not to look for more wages.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Andrews make a point about equal pay for equal work.  We in Labour have been screaming for this for a long time. So have the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and the Government have paid some lip-service to it.  There was opportunity in this legislation for the Minister to do something about it but he has failed.  Perhaps, he will accede to demands for it, particularly to the pleading of Deputy Andrews.</P>
    <P>We must pay serious attention to the provision in this legislation about ballot control&mdash;the control of the workers' ballots.  I agree with the secret ballot but how are we to get the idea across that the secrecy is to be respected in one direction only? The week end before last, we had a secret ballot in the maintenance dispute but it had been scarcely held by the workers when the press, radio and television were on to it.  On the 8 o'clock news on the Saturday morning the Radio Éireann newsreader indicated that the proposals would be turned down: he had information, despite the fact that many of the workers were still balloting throughout the country and that the result would not be made known until the following Monday.  Then, there was the heading in the <i>Sunday Press</i> which went something like &ldquo;Picture Looks Rosy&rdquo;.  We suggest that the workers should indulge in secrecy.  What about this interference&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and influence? This kind of thing happens in the news columns of newspapers and the leading articles castigate the unions on the management of their affairs.  Who is codding whom?  What control will be exercised on the way in which the employers make up their minds?  Who will supervise their way of voting?  We acknowledge that the FUE are a trade union and that the Minister is not <Col N="2165" /> spelling out the names of the unions in this legislation.  I hope that when the opportunity is presented to him by way of amendment he will ensure that this is not one-sided legislation&mdash;that if it becomes illegal for workers to take certain action, as it is now, despite the promises given by the Minister to the ICTU, there will be action taken also to deal with employers who conspire to extend the dispute.</P>
      <P>We have had an abundance of evidence of this in the maintenance dispute.  Cement Limited was one case. They were not affected but they dismissed a number of craftsmen.  There was a decision by four establishment men to picket and the company decided to lock out the others though they were not involved.  Surely this is one-sided and I should welcome an assurance by the Minister that he will ensure this kind of thing will not be allowed to continue&mdash;that employers will not be allowed to conspire to continue a strike just because they have a right to do so. They say they have a right to stand by their fellow trade unionists.  This is one-sided trade unionism and it is time something was done about it.</P>
      <P>The ICTU urged the Minister to extend the divisions of the Labour Court.  They said they would agree to four or five divisions.  What is the Minister's response?  It is that there should be a second chairman.  There is a lot more we will say in connection with this proposed legislation.  I have a few points to make and having regard to the fact that they are being recorded, I assume that the Minister will later comment on them.  They deal directly with some sections contained in this proposed legislation.  Section 11 mentions fair employment and rules which will apply.  It reads:</P>
      <P>make rules which apply to, and which, in the opinion of the court, provide for fair employment conditions for the workers and employers in that industry and are approved of by organisations representing a substantial number of the workers aforesaid and organisations representing a substantial number of the employers aforesaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are in existence at the moment joint labour committees.  I should like <Col N="2166" /> the Minister to explain, when replying, the difference between a joint labour committee and the body he is referring to in that section.  We know for example&mdash;and this is my real worry about it&mdash;that a joint labour committee is set up of representatives of the employers' and workers' sides and has a neutral chairman and whatever decisions they eventually arrive at become the minimum, whether the rates of pay or working conditions, and are legally enforceable.  What is the difference between that and what is proposed in the Minister's section 11 (1) (a)?</P>
    <P>In section 13 (2) reference is made to a &ldquo;body of workers&rdquo;.  What is meant by a &ldquo;body of workers&rdquo;?  Is one worker, for the purposes of this Act, regarded as &ldquo;a body of workers&rdquo;?  Also, according to this section, the rights commissioner may make a recommendation only if both parties agree.  What is the sense in this?  I have already adverted to what I consider to be the importance of people having more confidence in the Labour Court.  Now we are bringing another person along to be made a rights commissioner and people who could not obtain satisfaction from their point of view can go to the rights commissioner but only if both parties agree, because if both parties agree, whatever he says is binding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be glad to deal with it then?  I should also like to know from the Minister what is meant by section 13 (6) which also deals with a rights commissioner. It says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2167" /> A rights commissioner may provide for the regulation of proceedings before him in relation to an investigation under this section and may provide for the cases in which persons may appear before him by counsel or solicitor and, except as so provided, no person shall be entitled to appear by counsel or solicitor before him.</P>
    <P>In that connection what is the position of a non-trade unionist?  Does this apply to the possible fragmentation of trade unions?  After all, we had a number of speakers from the Minister's Party stressing the necessity for a smaller number of trade unions.  Subsection (9) (a) of section 13 dealing with the rights commissioner says:</P>
    <P>A party to a dispute in relation to which a rights commissioner has made a recommendation may appeal to the Court against the recommendation and the parties to the dispute shall be bound by the decision of the Court on the appeal.</P>
    <P>Why can they not go to the Court in any case?  What is the point in introducing the rights commissioner?</P>
    <P>What I say now refers to section 18 but I did already mention that the number of conciliation officers at present is insufficient.  We have frequently asked the Minister to do something about this. He is now changing their title to industrial relations officers, but he has not indicated to what extent he is going to make an improvement, not only as to the knowledge of the persons who will act as industrial relations officers, but also in regard to their numbers. If I am not mistaken the Minister did say that the present number of conciliation officers deal with 1,000 cases a year.  I believe they could deal with many more if they had time.</P>
    <P>I expect the Minister, on Committee Stage, to clear up section 18 (1B) which reads:</P>
    <P>Where the Court is of opinion, in relation to a trade dispute which, but for this subsection, it would be precluded, by virtue of subsection (1A) of this section, from investigating, that there are exceptional circumstances which warrant its so doing, it may investigate the dispute.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2168" /> This is rather loose.  I know there has been, at almost all times, a fair-sized queue for Labour Court sittings.  In some cases the Court have decided to fix a date for the hearing.  In other cases they have refused to fix a date unless the parties concerned agree to wait for a long time.  Very often the decision to fix a date is governed by the type of industry involved.  Having regard to that, there is great need to tighten up the section.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister would need to re-consider section 20 in its entirety because undoubtedly it means arbitration and we know how unfavourably arbitration is regarded by the majority of workers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass was very concerned about the group negotiating licence. He made a sort of a case, having regard to his trade union knowledge&mdash;he is a member of a trade union&mdash;and he pointed out how unfair it would be to a member union of a group if it was found that the other unions were voting against it.  He mentioned his own union which could be described as a very small organisation.  It was quite obvious that he did not know how groups within the Irish Congress of Trade Unions at present work and are expected to work and what Congress sets out to do because Congress policy on that matter has been: one union, one vote.  Under that policy, in a group of unions a union with a few thousand members may still have only one vote, as compared with a union which may have only ten members.  I fail to see the cause for Deputy Lemass' concern in this matter. Quite obviously, he does not know enough about it.</P>
    <P>The same applies to almost all the supporting speakers with the exception of Deputy Andrews who quite obviously set about finding out something about industrial relations and how trade unions operate.  The other Deputies displayed absolute ignorance of trade union negotiations.  That being so, it would be only right and proper that they should make it their business to get a little closer to the trade union movement.  I know for a fact that no trade union will object to any Member of this House going along to any of their educational programmes and processes <Col N="2169" /> and listening in.  For the benefit of the House it is only right and proper that I should say that there are thousands of pounds being spent annually by the trade union movement on the education of their members in industrial relations and allied trade union matters.  This is not generally realised. It is very seldom acknowledged, but it is absolutely true.</P>
    <P>It would not be a bad thing, I think, before we start going too far into industrial relations in this proposed trade union legislation, to do something to gear the Members of this House with a little knowledge of the problems that confront trade union officials, section committee members, shop stewards and what-have-you.  It is very easy to criticise.  To listen to some people here one would imagine that this problem could be solved with a wave of a wand.  What most people fail to realise is that not only paid officials but also rank and file members of trade unions work night and day in order to avoid a trade dispute.</P>
    <P>I have yet to meet the man who deliberatly sets about bringing about a trade dispute.  But I met a few in the last few weeks on the employers' side who were deliberately setting out to prolong the strike, and that at a time when there is all the talk about the nation's economy.  At a time of the year when things are not going too well and it is convenient for them to lay off people they jumped at the opportunity of extending the trade dispute.  There is nothing in this Bill about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing this legislation this evening in what might be described almost as a &ldquo;chatty&rdquo; manner.  That applies to the contributions from the Government benches, the Labour Party benches and the Fine Gael Party benches.  No one so far has captured the real atmosphere. The country at the moment is in the grip of a very serious crisis, a crisis which is threatening the way of life of many of our people and which may have repercussions on the entire economy.  This legislation, I suppose, scarcely presents us with an opportunity of trying to ascertain the cause of the present situation but it is, I <Col N="2170" /> think, worth saying that our people today seem to lack a sense of purpose in many of their sectional efforts.  We do not seem to know where we are going.  We do not seem to know why we are going in a particular direction or what kind of country we are aiming to make.  We do not seem to have distilled any national aims which find support and understanding amongst people in different walks of life.  The gospel seems to be each man for himself and the devil take the hindmost.  I do not say that by way of stricture on any section of our community.  It is, I think, a stricture which can be applied generally.  It stems from the fact&mdash;I regret having to say this&mdash;that in recent years the people have not been getting the kind of leadership they should be getting.  It is a cliché, but let us use it again: we are living in a competitive world, a world in which no country can survive unless it can trade at a profit with its neighbours.  Our standard of living, the services provided from central funds and through the local authorities, the things that the people demand in their homes&mdash;the things that Deputy Mullen talked about, the washing machines and all the rest of it&mdash; all these amenities depend in the last resort on our ability as a community to trade at a profit with neighbouring countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we cannot export successfully then we cannot maintain existing living standards.  That, surely, is a truism, it is surely something that all of us can state with credibility and with conviction. But many people, unfortunately, seem to forget that; they seem to think that our present standard of living is something that we can continue to have without making any effort to maintain it, to retain it, or to improve it.  But its maintenance and retention depend ultimately on our ability to enter into this competitive world and sell the goods we produce competitively on the export markets available to us.  It is another truism to say that our ability to trade depends on our selling goods which are not just occasionally excellent but consistently good and at prices which make their sale attractive.  This comes down in the net to a question of cost.  It surely should have been a matter of concern <Col N="2171" /> for all of us over the last four or five years to aim at a proper harmony between management and labour, with the question of the costing of the goods we produce as an important part of that common concern and common outlook, in the knowledge that the more we can export the higher and the better will be our standard of living. Surely that was something that could and should have been aimed at in our industrial relations?  It has been talked of.  It has been hinted at.  It has been referred to from time to time. What, I want to know, has been done about it?</P>
    <P>I am not for one moment suggesting that wages and labour costs are the only elements affecting the prices of our goods abroad.  They certainly are not, but they are an important element, an element which has an effect, and will continue to have an effect, on our ability to trade successfully.  To the extent that they had an effect in the past four or five years&mdash;I am referring only to the period of the present Dáil &mdash;it has been true to say that price increases have come about, and in one notorious instance were brought about, by direct Government intervention.</P>
    <P>In any event, they have come about and have been followed inevitably by increases in domestic prices which have corroded the very wage increases which were initially agreed upon.  In the past four or five years since this Government came into office, we have had a repetition and a continuation of the old cycle of prices following wage increases.  We had them all going around in a circle and no one any better off as a result.  That has led to instability and dislocation and a situation in which we make periodic advances in relation to our exports and then fall back, because domestic prices have risen, because wage increases have taken place, or wage increases have taken place because domestic prices have risen.</P>
    <P>The Government have presided over a situation in which there has been a complete jungle of confusion.  This affects industrial relations; this affects the economy; this affects stability of currency.  It has an effect on savings <Col N="2172" /> and it has an effect on the ability and desire of everyone to plan his own future.  No one knows where it will end.  Today everyone who has a £ note in his pocket knows that it will be worth considerably less 12 months hence.  Is it surprising that in those circumstances, people today are searching around, not knowing where to look, not knowing what to aim at, and merely concerned with looking after themselves?</P>
    <P>In the first days of this Dáil from these benches here, from the Fine Gael benches, we advocated and put forward a proposal that there should be a serious effort to establish a prices and incomes policy in this country. We put forward that proposal because of the experience we had in the previous Dáil of the effect of leapfrogging of wages and price cycles, causing instability and dislocation in our economy and in our trading.  We wanted a prices and incomes policy which would apply to all incomes and not merely to wages, because that is only one part of incomes.  The view advocated by Fine Gael was put forward in the terms of a Dáil motion some three and a half years ago.  The terms of that motion were accepted by this House and accepted by the Government, and one then felt that the initial steps would be taken towards establishing such a policy.</P>
    <P>Of course, nothing has been done towards achieving that end, nothing whatsoever.  The idea of a prices and incomes policy was considered by the NIEC who reported in its favour in their Report No. 11 some years ago.  What has been done about it?  I suggest nothing whatsoever. Apparently it is too difficult for the Government to embark upon this task. A prices and incomes policy related to the income of each person, whether he is an <i>entrepreneur</i>, a person living on capital, a member of management deriving returns from profits earned with his capital, or a wage earner in any capacity, connotes incomes tied in the appropriate way to the increase in the wealth of the country which is a very difficult thing to achieve, but it is essential to achieve it if the country is to survive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2173" /> It is only by establishing such a policy that a wage increase, coming as a result of an increase in productivity, will, in fact, mean a real increase in the earning power and the purchasing power of the worker affected.  We have not such a situation established here. Any wage increase is absolutely illusory and it is frittered away and disappears in a short space of time by reason of the consequential increase in prices.</P>
    <P>I charge the Government with complete neglect in relation to this aspect of our national affairs which could be the means of saving the country.  In my view this neglect is the source of our present difficulties.  Because we have not a prices and incomes policy, we have today complete industrial unrest. By sitting back and doing nothing the Government have led people to believe that our economy is a free-forall and that everyone just shoves his snout into the trough and tries to gobble up as much as possible.  How long will this continue?</P>
    <P>Bad industrial relations are merely one symptom of the real confusion and difficulties that exist in the community. The Taoiseach spoke sternly yesterday. He spoke well.  Má's maith é is mithid. A very silent man he has been for too long.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour brings these proposals into this House.  I shall not pass judgment upon them but I suggest that probably the truth is that Deputy Dr. Hillery has been in Labour for a number of years and has produced a mouse.  With the elements of crisis all around us, what is the sense in playing footy-footy with industrial relations?  A time of crisis is no time to try to lay down guidelines, as Deputy Andrews spoke about. A time of crisis is no time to talk about reconstituting the Labour Court, or anything of that kind.  This could have been done years ago.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be unduly hard on the Minister for Labour but I should like to know where he has been for the past three or four years.  If no other Member of the Government saw to it, it was his responsibility to seek to achieve some realisation within the Government with regard to an incomes policy.  The attitude, apparently, <Col N="2174" /> is to go along and, if there is no strike, if there is no industrial unrest, to forget about this awkward question of an incomes policy and whistle and hope for the best.  That attitude achieves nothing.  We are now beginning to reap the harvest of years of neglect of this important aspect of national affairs.  I am certain the inbuilt sense of responsibility in most of our people will overcome any less benign feelings and that, in the end, this crisis will be overcome.</P>
    <P>It is good to see, in relation to what is happening at the moment, that there have been men of principle and of courage who have not been afraid to speak out.  I have no doubt their words will prevail in the end and that this difficulty will be overcome.  When that happens, will the Government breathe a great sigh of relief and say: &ldquo;This is great.  We can forget about it now and think of something else&rdquo;?  I regret to say that that has been their attitude far too often up to this.  I fear that, next time, whenever it comes, the confrontation, the dilemma, the problem, the crisis, will be far more serious.</P>
    <P>The one solution to our problem of industrial relations is an incomes policy.  I know the difficulties, the very real difficulties, that surround it and that lie ahead.  They have been &ldquo;at it&rdquo; in Great Britain for some two and-a-half or three years.  It is not necessary to point out that they have not achieved any outstanding success: that may be so.  At least, they are walking along that road, perhaps slowly, in the right direction.  Here, we have not even started to mark out the road on the map, let alone start to walk along that road.</P>
    <P>I believe that this legislation which the Minister has brought forward consists of so many trappings, so much window dressing, but does not get to the root of the problem.  I agree with Deputy Mullen that perhaps the problem is not amenable to being dealt with by legislation.  It affects the way we manage our economy, the policy we embark upon and the way we order our affairs.  To that extent, what is proposed here appears entirely irrelevant. I have no doubt the Labour Court requires to be changed, requires <Col N="2175" /> to be strengthened.  I have no doubt that, if there is to be a strike, it should be decided by secret ballot.  I have no doubt many things can be done in regard to industrial relations which may lead to a better understanding but, fundamentally, so long as there exists a situation in which the labour force in any industry does not trust the management in that industry then we have the seeds of confusion and difficulty.  So long as we have suspicion, so long as the man employed does not trust the man who employs him, does not trust the management of his firm, does not understand what the firm is about, and, above all, so long as he does not know what profits the firm is making, then we have all the seeds of further difficulties of this kind.</P>
    <P>Unless we can remove the atmosphere of suspicion, unless we can get people to understand that, in a small community such as ours, we shall not be able to survive unless there is a proper partnership between management and labour, if that point is not driven home, understood and accepted, then we shall continue to have difficulties such as those we have at present. That is part of what is involved in an incomes policy.  It has been dealt with fully not only in the policy of the Fine Gael Party but also in the various reports from the National Industrial and Economic Council.  Involved in it is the question of not controlling prices, because that is a dead end in itself, not controlling profits.  Why should profits be controlled?  The profits earned by a firm or an industry should be of benefit to everybody employed in it but there should be a marching together of individual and personal incomes whether they are being earned by management or labour, related to the increase in productivity.  If we can start along these lines and if we can remove the suspicion that exists, which stems frequently from lack of knowledge, from lack of understanding, then, perhaps, we can make some headway towards better industrial relations in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say anything about the present dispute except to say again that it presents this country with a <Col N="2176" /> problem of crisis proportions.  How is it to be solved?  Deputy Liam Cosgrave, the Leader of the Opposition, said the other day that possibly an all Party approach might be a method of bringing about a solution.  I am quite certain that there are no politics in this and that the continuance of the present industrial crisis is a matter of concern to every political party.  It certainly is of deep concern to the members of the Fine Gael Party.  I am certain it is of equal concern to the Labour Party as it is to the Government.  I should like, in pursuance of what Deputy Liam Cosgrave said, to assure the Minister that if there is any help whatsoever that we in the Fine Gael Party can give or suggest towards bringing about a solution it will be fully and generously given.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I would like to see the leaders of the three political Parties in the Dáil&mdash;the Leader of the Government, the Leader of my Party and the Leader of the Labour Party, pooling their resources, asking people to come to meet them to try to end this present difficulty.  It would be, I suppose, an impertinence for me to suggest that there is another person who holds a high office in this land who might interest himself in this particular problem because if someone does not take the initiative, if we are going to have a situation in which there are people who whether it is faulty or otherwise have a particular point of view, and if they are going to dig themselves into an entrenched position, then a solution becomes more difficult as each day passes.  I would hope that, whatever the rights and wrongs of the dispute may be, everybody concerned with it would recognise their responsibility to the country and their responsibility to enable the people of this country to meet the challenge and the competition which exists and if there is any fear of a loss of face, surely the leaders of the political Parties in this House may be able to intervene and bring about some step towards a solution?</P>
    <P>When this present difficulty has been overcome as I am sure it will, what then?  The present Government or the next Government that will come after the next general election will be faced with the same problem, will have the <Col N="2177" /> same task ahead of them and that is to achieve sooner or later a situation in which the money which is earned by workers will have a reality, will have some purchasing power which will be associated with an increase in national productivity and that, when an increase in wages is earned, it will represent an increase in purchasing power?  Until we can achieve that we will continue to have this cycle of difficulties which leads and has led to considerable national weakness.</P>

      <P>It is a pity that we are discussing these two Bills which deal with workers and their relations with employers at a time of such serious crisis when a strike of major importance is taking place in the country. I feel it would be advisable that discussion of these two Bills should be deferred until such time as a settlement has emerged as a settlement must eventually come.  There is a grave danger that people speaking in this House will inadvertently, perhaps, say something that instead of helping will worsen the situation and make a difficult case much more difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was in an atmosphere such as this that we had that unfortunate piece of legislation the ESB (Special Powers) Act passed during an emergency and rushed through this House.  I think nobody in this House, after reflection, would take any credit for that particular piece of legislation.  It achieved nothing but it did put in the minds of the workers the fear that the Government of the day, which is the present Government, would in an emergency, not hesitate to do what they threatened to do in that Bill, that is, put workers in jail for exercising their right to withdraw their labour.  I remember saying on that Friday morning, in common with a number of my fellow Deputies of the Labour movement that you cannot legislate to make a man work.  You can do what Hitler did, hang him and jail him, but you cannot make him work unless, perhaps, you can intimidate some of the other workers and force them into an agreement which they have no desire to carry out.  No one in this House I am sure would desire such a state of affairs.  Panic legislation is a <Col N="2178" /> dangerous thing.  That is why I feel that it is most inappropriate in the midst of a serious crisis, as we are in at the present moment, to be discussing what should be discussed in a calm and calculated way during a period of reasonable industrial peace.</P>
    <P>I was surprised, indeed, shocked, to hear of the attack made by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party apparently on either the Leader of the Labour Party or the Labour Party in general.  I was surprised to hear his spiteful outburst and his reference to Cuban socialism. We in the Labour Party did not get our socialism from Castro or Mao Tse Tung.</P>

He did not have to learn his socialism from those latter day socialists, Castro or anyone else. Perhaps, Deputy Cosgrave wants us to take our political philosophy from Franco of Spain, Salazar of Portugal or somebody like that.  We have no intention of doing that and whether it be Cuba or anywhere else we are taunted with we are quite satisfied that we have our own type of socialism and that we got it from the teachings and the writings of our Leader.

      <P>I have been quoting what I heard.  As I say, not only one Fine Gael member but a second Fine Gael member has endeavoured, within the past couple of weeks, to ridicule and to pin to the Labour movement things that were never said or were never done.  Political writers in a certain paper take Deputy Corish to task because he has not intervened in this dispute. Deputy Corish has enough sense to know that well-meaning intervention can very often do more harm than good.  Deputy Corish took the natural step of consulting with Congress, the leaders of the Labour movement, and offering to them any help he could give in an effort to achieve a just settlement. No one can do more than that.  This has got to be solved in the way it is working out.  I heard Deputy Cosgrave asking the Minister to intervene.  What does he mean?  Does he want them to bring in the troops?  What can the Minister do?</P>

      <P>I do not know what they want.  They ask why does the Minister not intervene and why does the Labour Party not ask the Minister to intervene? We never want the Government to interfere with our rights to negotiate freely.  By all means if helpful legislation can be passed&mdash;I shall be dealing with that in a few moments&mdash;then certainly we shall avail of it if we feel it is for the good of the trade union movement and for the good of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was wondering would we have all these attacks if instead of saying we would not coalesce with any Party <Col N="2180" /> after the next election, we had said &ldquo;We will join an inter-Party Government with Fine Gael&rdquo;; would we hear anything about Cuban socialism or anything else like that?  Some other Fine Gael Deputy was talking about the pill and various other things that came up at our conference&mdash;figments of the imagination, of course.  It is amazing when you do not fall into line with a particular side, they always want to damn you.  I am surprised at the Leader of the Fine Gael Party demeaning himself to take part in this type of criticism or scurrility, because it is nothing short of it, and to avail of this Bill to hurl it at the Labour Party.  He certainly was not extinguishing any fires; he certainly was not pouring oil on troubled waters; rather was he throwing it on the fire and causing a further blaze.</P>
    <P>I was particularly impressed by a speech on this Bill by Deputy Dillon last Thursday week.  It was a sane, constructive speech intelligently given. The trade union members here in the Labour Party, Deputy Tully and I, who had a chance of hearing that speech agreed wholeheartedly with most of what he said.  He certainly gave an example of how to discuss this legislation without tending to cause further upset than there is already.  He pointed out something worth noting, that private firms, managements who own their own factories, very seldom have disputes with their workers.  The vast majority of our industrial disputes take place either in semi-State bodies where you have individuals who are aloof from the workers such as the ESB, Bord na Móna, the Sugar Company and so on, or where there is no personal contact and where they do not understand or care to understand the difficulties of the worker.  He pointed out that in private firms there are scarcely any disputes or if there is a dispute it is quickly settled because of the personal contact between worker and manager or owner.  In semi-State bodies and other companies the shareholders and directors are aloof from the workers and have no concern and no interest other than their profits.</P>
    <P>I have over 20 years' experience as <Col N="2181" /> a trade union official.  I have been involved in strikes; I have settled strikes, and have prevented them, and I know what causes a strike.  A just claim is put forward in respect of wages or conditions.  It is delayed, obstructed and dragged on.  It goes through conciliation; it goes through the Labour Court and there is delay in coming to an agreement.  Finally the workers will force their officials into saying: &ldquo;There is only one way to get a settlement and that is to withdraw labour,&rdquo; and this is true.  Anything the Minister can do either in this Bill or in any other Bill to stop these delaying tactics, to reduce the period of suspension and to permit the grievances to be ventilated and examined will be welcome. What very often starts like a thorn prick develops into a running sore and within a very short time causes an outburst that has no relation at all to the original grievance.  It is caused purely by the delaying tactics adopted by employers in general&mdash;not all employers, of course; as with all people, there are good and bad.</P>
    <P>I should like to come to what I really stood up to talk about, that is, these two Bills in particular.  They must be taken together, and even if the House did not permit them to be discussed together, certainly no sane trade unionist would talk on either of them without automatically switching his mind to the other.  In fact, most of us in the trade union movement, those of us who are active trade unionists anyhow, have a great worry as to whether we should include another Bill in our thinking about these two, that is, some parts of the Criminal Justice Bill.  It is unfortunate that some parts of that Bill have already appeared to workers to have a bearing on the possible future conduct of the Government in relation to strikes.  I hope that is not true.  I do not believe the present Minister would have any part in it, but that thought has already entered into the minds of many workers.  I would hope the Minister will assure workers, when he is replying to this debate, that the Criminal Justice Bill has no connection and was never intended to have any connection with industrial relations or proposals of the Government as to how to control industrial relations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2182" /> I should like to congratulate the Minister on his very sane approach in these two Bills.  He stressed in his speech, as indeed he stressed before on television, that this is permissive legislation to permit trade unionists to accept the offer he is making through both the Industrial Relations Bill and the Trade Union Bill, if they feel it is of interest to them.  I see nothing, certainly in the Industrial Relations Bill, that is objectionable.  There may be some parts of it that need some modification or examination.  In section 8, for example, it is suggested that the hearings of the Labour Court should be in private.  I wonder is that a sensible thing to do.  I feel there is always a suspicion caused in the minds of workers when something is heard in private.  Mind you, the negotiators who go into the Labour Court representing workers have to go back to convince the workers that when a decision is given that decision was a fair one. They have to endeavour, if they believe this is so, to convince their members that the Labour Court decision was a reasonable and a just one.  If the workers feel it is something which goes on in private, that they are not allowed to hear or read about it, then it will be more difficult for those who go to the Labour Court to go back and convince maybe 200 or 300 men that justice was done, that their case was put as fairly as it could be and that the decision arrived at was a fair one.</P>
    <P>We would all agree that private hearings are necessary in the case of rival firms and nobody would object to that. Nobody would object to the accounts of a firm produced before the Labour Court being kept private and not being discussed.  In fact, my experience up to date regarding the Labour Court is when they get accounts they do not allow any of the opposing parties, such as the trade union officials, to have any access to them.  They get them to look at them privately.  This is one part of the Industrial Relations Bill I feel the Minister should have a look at.  It is just a minor suggestion of mine.</P>
    <P>I think it was the Minister in his opening speech who remarked if anyone could advise him as to how he could induce workers to have more <Col N="2183" /> confidence in the Labour Court he would be very pleased.  He pointed out where nominees of the trade union took part and nominees of the Federated Union of Employers took part there is an independent chairman.  Would it be possible that the chairman, perhaps independent, perhaps the most honourable man in the world, would be completely independent?  If the workers and the employers joined together and had an agreed chairman, I believe this would strengthen the faith of the workers in the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>The chairman plays a very important role in industrial concerns of all sorts where wages and conditions of employment are dealt with.  We have employers on the one side and workers on the other.  They pair off and finally the decision rests on the three people appointed by the Minister who merely has to say what the wages should be or what the conditions should be. Again, in the Labour Court you have trade union nominees and you have employers nominees and they hold opposite views.  Then it is solely the chairman who decides.  If the chairman is a Government appointed man, be he a civil servant or a high court judge, there is always in the back of the minds of workers the feeling that this man, because he is a high court judge, is a man of a class and standing different from the ordinary workers.  It is only where they will agree with the employers federation or they get an agreed chairman that the workers will have more faith in the decisions arrived at. This is a personal opinion of mine but from my experience of over 20 years in regard to arbitration matters and settling of strikes in my own part of the country, I feel there is a growing feeling over the past few years that the Labour Court are not always impartial.  I feel it will be difficult to change that.  I cannot see very much chance of any great improvement in the confidence of workers in the Labour Court unless some change of that sort is made.  The same applies with regard to the deputy chairman who will be appointed by the Minister and will act as chairman in certain considerations.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister regarding the appointment of extra courts and <Col N="2184" /> two additional members so that we can have three courts.  Very often there is a minor strike but it could be a serious matter in a small town.  If there is a vast range of disputes listed here in Dublin we often find that we are left for six, eight or ten months before we get a Labour Court sitting.  It is true that we will have conciliation officers and they do a good job but when there is danger of a strike and there is delay in the hearing of the Labour Court and delay in coming to a decision it is much more difficult to settle a strike quickly.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the type of legislation which he has brought in which I say is permissive and has no compulsion in it.  However, there is a section in the Industrial Relations Bill which I am quite sure the Minister is quite happy about and which refers to workers employed by local authorities. I know there are a number of health authorities which are also local authorities.  I know there are four health authorities, Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Dún Laoghaire and the local authority and the health authority are combined, that is, the corporation and the county council but I am not quite sure that the expression &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; will cover workers employed by a health authority. If it does not, it should be written into the Bill and made definitely clear that it covers employees of such health authorities as I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>On the Trade Union Bill, I find it slightly difficult to make up my mind how section 4 should be interpreted. It is only a question of the phrasing of this section.  Section 4, paragraph (iv) reads:</P>
    <P>Any trade union the membership of which includes a number, other than a negligible number, of employees in the employments catered for by the authorised group.</P>
    <P>What is this small number?  Could the Minister indicate what kind of percentage would that &ldquo;negligible number&rdquo; that he would be prepared to include be?  Would it be five per cent or two per cent or does it mean just one or two people?  I think it looks like that <Col N="2185" /> but when this becomes law it will be interpreted either by a court official or by somebody else and I think it should be much more clearly defined. &ldquo;Other than a negligible number&rdquo;, could mean anything.  It could mean ten or 20 and it could mean as little as one or two.  It would be much clearer if a specific percentage of the numbers involved were given.</P>
    <P>For the Minister's information, I should like to say that section 10 is causing some concern to the Congress of Trade Unions.  They are not happy about this section and I understand that they have already sought legal advice and that they will be communicating with the Minister and with the members of the Labour Party in this connection.</P>
    <P>Some members of our Party have already discussed portions of this Bill with Congress and that is only natural since we will be the spokesmen on this. It will be the responsibility of Labour Deputies and especially of those of us who are active trade union officials to put forward our views and we should like to do this in a constructive manner, in a manner in keeping with the wishes of Congress and in keeping with the wishes of established and recognised trade unions.  Notwithstanding the fact that at the moment we may see many things that are objectionable in certain parts of the Bill, it will be necessary for us to have fuller definition and, perhaps, the Bill can be amended by us on Committee Stage.  Any amendments which we may put down will be in the spirit of trying to improve the legislation. The only change we want is change that will improve the position and the Minister has indicated that is also what he wants.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy P. Belton when he says that the Minister should endeavour to get firms to appoint experienced personnel officers and that on the agenda of directors' meetings the question of labour relations between the staff and the management should be one of the first items.  Deputy Dillon also touched on that particular point and I think it is a suggestion which, if adopted, would improve relations between management and staff.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy P. Belton also <Col N="2186" /> who mentioned British based trade unions operating in Ireland.  I am attached to a British based trade union and I should like to say that it is completely manned by Irish personnel and that we are not interfered with in any way in our decisions in relation to Ireland by our head office in Great Britain.  In so far as we are concerned, all our decisions are controlled by our head office in this country.  Most of our members would refuse to give up their connections with the British trade union because of the fact that if through unemployment, they emigrate from here their trade union card is invaluable to them in Great Britain.  By having this card they can secure employment and they will be welcomed in industry.</P>
    <P>The British-based trade unions have a very strict rule with regard to an unofficial strike.  If members go on strike unofficially there is only one way in which that strike can become legal and that is that the members must first return to work and then put forward their grievances and give the trade union proper notice.  I wonder if all the Irish unions do that.  I am not aware that they do but from the knowledge I have of my own union, I will say that before a strike is sanctioned, the workers must go through all the machinery which is available to them in the country in which they are operating.  We have to negotiate, first of all, with the employer and then if we fail to reach an agreement we must engage the services of the conciliation officer.  If we fail there we must then go to the Labour Court and wait until their decision is given before any question of strike sanction is arrived at and such sanction can only be arrived at after a valid vote and a majority decision to go on strike.  If the decision is for a strike, due notice must be given to the employer.  I would suggest that many of our Irish trade unions might follow that example.</P>
    <P>I should not like to conclude my discussion on these Bills without paying tribute to Mr. Dermot McDermott for the discussions in which he has taken part over a long period of time &mdash;discussions which, at times, must have been soul destroying.  The fact that a settlement has not been reached is certainly not his fault.  I have met <Col N="2187" /> Mr. McDermott during part of these discussions and I have seen how hard he worked, late at night and even into the early hours of the morning, giving his whole service to achieving a settlement. I should like to thank him for the efforts he has made towards securing peace in the building and engineering industries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I could hardly start off in a better way than by echoing the statement with which Deputy Kyne concluded his speech.  I might even go further than that and say that my experience of all the officials, including Mr. McDermott, has been of men who are really dedicated to their job and who, as Deputy Kyne has said, work all hours of the day and night to restore harmony where it has been broken.  I should like to try to follow Deputy Kyne's example and also to try to base my remarks on the two Bills which are before us.  There is a temptation to pontificate on industrial relations rather than to discuss as objectively as we can the terms of the Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an industrial relations Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is but, at the same time, some people&mdash;I do not include Deputy Dillon among these&mdash; have tended to pontificate rather irrelevantly.  We must try to keep ourselves as near as possible to the terms of the Bill in question.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kyne considered that both these Bills can be improved and developed in Committee, but I should like to mention certain sections.  Section 6 of the Industrial Relations Bill relates to the renaming of certain officials under the Labour Court as industrial relations officers rather than conciliation officers as at present.  I have only had experience of one operation with conciliation officers in the past and I found them excellent at their job.  However, I think &ldquo;conciliation&rdquo; was an unfortunate word and &ldquo;industrial relations officer&rdquo; shows a much more constructive approach to the whole problem and widens the scope of their activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 relates to the interpretation of employment agreements.  This I hope <Col N="2188" /> would enable the Labour Court itself to prevent disputes, to stop them before they start, but, of course, a difficulty arises here in cases where the recommendation of the Labour Court is not accepted by both parties.  I hope every effort will be made, both on the part of employers and trade unions, to encourage those whom they represent to agree in advance in all cases that the recommendation of the Labour Court shall be accepted as a final judgement in this matter.</P>
    <P>Section 8 introduces a very useful improvement in that it provides for investigations by the court to be in private, though the court may at its discretion, if requested to do so by a party to the dispute, conduct its investigation in public.  I think that wherever possible investigations should be in private because parties to a dispute are apt to adopt attitudes and to make statements which are much more propaganda statements for the benefit of their members than arguments such as would be advanced in a court of law.  This observation, however, does not reflect on one side or the other. If the press is present, there is a tendency to play to the press, but if the parties come together in the atmosphere of a private office they are not as liable to make propaganda statements to each other: there is a much greater possibility that they will give mutual understanding to the problem.  It is perfectly right that this provision should be there even though there is power given to the court, on request, to hold the hearing in public if it feels that is wise.  There may be a case occasionally where it would be wise to hold the court hearing in public, but in general my vote goes for privacy at all costs.</P>
    <P>Section 10 breaks new ground, and rightly so.  I hope this provision relating to breaches of registered employment agreements will not discourage any parties from entering into such agreements. We should build up an industrial system which is governed by employment agreements freely negotiated between employer and employee.  If we do not do this, if we do not have something done in this direction, there is always the danger that there will be misunderstandings.  My experience <Col N="2189" /> certainly has been that many more disputes arise from misunderstandings than out of injustice.</P>
    <P>However, where an employment agreement has been freely negotiated and signed, it is essential, as is provided in the Bill, that it should be also enforceable.  An agreement which is merely a collection of pious platitudes is not of any value to anybody.  That section reads on to section 11 and the question of fair employment rules.  Here the same comment should be made, that in far too many cases there are not any definite rules setting out the rights and obligations of the worker and the employer.  We should not forget that the employer also has his rights but in no case should those rights override his obligations.</P>
    <P>There is everything, therefore, to be said for the creation of a code of fair employment rules which will set out clearly for anybody, before he enters into employment with a company or an individual, exactly what his rights and obligations are.  If these are clearly set out and freely negotiated, a great deal of tension and uncertainty will be avoided, and uncertainty is the greatest single source of tension in the industrial scene.</P>
    <P>Section 12 relates to the continuing inspection of premises by inspectors appointed under the code to ensure that fair employment rules are being kept.  If we do not provide for regular inspection, there is always the danger that fair employment rules may be drafted, discussed, agreed and accepted and thereupon forgotten until some crux arises.  That is fatal, because when the crux arises and when a breach has occurred, it is almost always too late to solve it.  It is essential that we should have a body of inspectors going around, checking all the time to make sure that these fair employment rules are being strictly observed by both sides.</P>
    <P>Section 13 relates to the appointment of a new officer to be known as a rights commissioner.  This appeals to me enormously because, even with fair employment rules and everything else, anything in writing can be interpreted in slightly different ways and it is that which causes trouble.  When something <Col N="2190" /> has to be interpreted, it is all too easy for each side to take a different view and start an argument.</P>
    <P>In my experience recently we had a case put up by the employees to the management on the question of service pay.  It was a difficult point.  On the employers' side we were quite definite that a certain view should be taken; on the employees' side, an exactly opposite view was expressed, argued backwards and forwards and no progress was made.  I suggested we should go to a conciliation officer.  There was some reluctance and, without any acceptance in advance by the union, we went to a conciliation officer though I made it clear that from the company point of view the recommendation of the conciliation officer would be accepted.  We went to him and to my surprise I found that my view was wrong but nobody would have persuaded me of that.</P>
    <P>I was convinced I was right until the conciliation officer produced the evidence for me which showed quite clearly that if we took the matter to a full hearing of the Labour Court the decision would go the other way because a somewhat similar decision had created a precedent.  That, to my mind, was the end of it.  There was no purpose in going further.  No actual dispute had arisen, and in a matter of about ten minutes the whole thing was cleared up and the decision was given in favour of the employees in this case and we all drove back to the works together.  That seems to me to be something which we could achieve time and again but we could achieve it far better if we could go to the court and say in advance: &ldquo;We will accept your decision.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Even though the new rights commissioners will only have the power to make a recommendation&mdash;they will not be making a final ruling&mdash;somebody who is going to conduct a quick investigation with very informal procedure could in very many cases sort out conflicting interpretations of regulations or agreements to everybody's benefit.  I strongly support this new conception of an informal hearing before a rights commissioner.  Like Deputy Kyne, I agree very much with section 17, the extension of the services <Col N="2191" /> of the Labour Court to a wider number of people.  Under section 20, I think it is wise to give some indication of a different procedure where both parties agree in advance to accept a recommendation of the Labour Court. I think it is right that the court may, in other cases, at its discretion issue a recommendation.  I believe it is right that where both parties agree in advance to accept the recommendation of the Court, the Court should have no further discussion and must issue a recommendation which shall be binding.</P>
    <P>Section 21, relating to the dissolution of the ESB tribunals, is a good tidyingup measure because any tribunal which is dealing only with sections of the whole industrial fabric is bound to get out of step and in the past these have caused a lot of unrest by their findings. I think it is far better to centralise all these activities in the Labour Court and to eliminate in future these tribunals.</P>
    <P>In the Trade Union Bill, Part II, there is reference to the group negotiation licence.  There is possibly some looseness of working here and there with which we can deal in committee. The fact remains that this is a very wise provision.  I should like to stress that this is something introduced for the protection of workers against other workers.  There is plenty of power given to protect workers against their employers but as we have seen, to our grief, in the past couple of weeks one of the greatest dangers in the present set up is that workers will be set against each other and that people will be disemployed because of a trade dispute in which they have had no hand, act or part and which they cannot influence in any way.</P>
    <P>In any large or even medium-sized company there are various groups of workers, labourers, tradesmen, craftsmen, technicians of various sorts, clerical workers, sales staff and so on. There is quite a wide variety of people and there has been a tendency for one group to feel that it is in such a strategic position that it will use its power to its own advantage even where the use of power in that way is at the <Col N="2192" /> expense of fellow workers, much more than the employer.  This conception of a group negotiation licence by an organised group is something that I have heard criticised as being an attack on certain trade unions.  I do not view it in that way but as a way in which the existing unions structure can be used to the best advantage, a way in which a new team spirit can be built up in a large concern, a way in which all employees can be made to feel that they are their brothers' keeper in a very real sense.  That is something which some people seem to have forgotten at the moment.  They are stressing: &ldquo;We must get what we want,&rdquo; regardless of what it may cost somebody else.  There is no use in saying: &ldquo;This is a fault in the system; it is not our fault.&rdquo;  It is the fault of anyone who goes out on strike and pulls out other people after him who are not involved in it.  It is his fault if that happens and no legislation can stop him doing it if he is sufficiently bloody-minded to want to go on doing it.</P>
    <P>All we can do and all we are trying to do in this legislation is to show people that there is a better way of achieving a settlement and of building up a proper relationship between workers in one department and in another.  I look forward to the debate on this part of the Bill because I think it will be very interesting and constructive and I hope, helpful to the Minister.  As I see it, this is a chance to prevent the fragmentation of the labour force in medium as well as in large companies.  It will be a way in which a group decision can be taken, a way in which workers in one group can be made to see the difficulties and problems of other groups and in which they can be brought together to participate in management to that extent very much to the benefit of all concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of Part II relates to the statutory right of peaceful picketing.  It is an improvement, but here, again, I suggest it would be improved further if there was some restriction on picketing so that it would affect only the person or the company with which the dispute originated.  The spreading of picketing to another person or company indirectly connected with the <Col N="2193" /> company in dispute is an intolerable misuse of power.  Very often that company to which the picket is extended is unable to take any action to solve the dispute.  The picket outside its premises will prevent its staff from entering and carrying on their lawful work.  That is an intolerable situation.</P>
    <P>I believe it is a basic obligation on all governments to prevent the misuse of power by any sector of the community to the disadvantage of other sectors.  No society can hold together if sections are exercising brute force against each other and, however peaceful a picket may be, in the end it comes down to brute force in that there is a moral obligation on a union member not to pass a picket and, simply because of the presence of a picket, a man is compelled to discontinue his work and to forgo his wage packet.  Various reliefs may be given by trade unions in one way of strike pay, but it is asking a great deal of a man, and still more of his wife, when he has to go without his wage packet, not through any fault of his own, not through any dispute of his own, but owing to a dispute which is no responsibility of his good, bad or indifferent.</P>
    <P>I suggest seriously, therefore, that we might take a closer look at section 9 on the Committee Stage in order to prevent a proliferation of pickets, with disastrous results not only to the national economy, which is a somewhat intangible asset, but to individuals who are compelled to live in dire hardship. I know nobody enjoys being on a picket.  Nobody likes being out on strike or disemployed because of a strike.  It is bad enough for the pickets &mdash;I know that&mdash;but it is even worse for their wives and families.</P>
    <P>In Part IV, section 12 provides for certain additional restrictions on the grant of negotiation licences.  That is a wise provision.  I was glad to hear Deputy Kyne say that his experience of British-based unions was that the final control lay actually in Ireland so far as Irish members are concerned. That may be the case in certain instances, but in one instance of which I had personal experience it certainly was not.  The final approval had to be obtained from the United Kingdom.</P>

      <P>If that situation has been improved in the meantime I am glad, because the speed at which the approval was communicated from headquarters in Britain to the branch headquarters here was utterly ludicrous.  One would have done better by pigeon post or packhorse.  It literally took some weeks to get a decision.  The British headquarters were far too busy and the dispute here was of such comparative insignificance that it did not get the priority which we naturally thought it should have.  If the position has improved, so much the better.  I trust the improvement will continue.</P>
      <P>Section 14 deals with the serving of strike notice.  This I thoroughly support. At column 1358 of Volume 238 of the Official Report Deputy M. O'Leary is recorded as saying:</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that some are of the opinion that strikes take place for trivial reasons.  That is another fallacy.</P>
      <P>I do not think anybody enters into a strike readily or with any enthusiasm. A strike notice is a threat.  Everybody always hopes up to the last moment that the threat will not have to be implemented.  A strike notice is served when workers feel that all alternatives have failed.  I do not believe the average working man supports the serving of a strike notice otherwise than with the very definite hope all the time that the strike will not come off.  Small blame to him because a strike is no fun. Basically, a strike notice is a threat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion the strike weapon is completely out of date now.  Originally it was the only weapon which could be used by an exploited labour force against brutal and thoughtless employers. It was the only weapon when people were working for an employer who was also the proprietor and, by withdrawing their labour, they were hitting the employer in his pocket, hitting him where it hurt him most. <Col N="2195" /> That was the purpose of the strike weapon.  Workers now work where the proprietor is not the manager or the managing director.  The strike affects the owners, admittedly&mdash;that is, the shareholders&mdash;but only to a marginal extent in most cases.  It may make a one per cent difference in the dividend or it may make the difference between no dividend or a very small one, but the effect on the actual owners is, comparatively speaking, slight.  The dispute is between the employer and the employee, and the employer is the managing director.  He will get paid his normal salary, win, loose or draw, strike or no strike.  He will get his salary, his allowances and his perquisites even if there is a picket outside the gate.</P>
    <P>The whole thing has got completely out-dated because the person who is getting hurt by the strike is not the actual person whom the employee is fighting or disputing.  So, I say strikes are completely out-dated.  We should have outgrown them years ago.  A strike is still a very powerful weapon.  It is very like a nuclear weapon, very useful as a threat, but utterly disastrous if you have to use it because it blows up both sides.</P>
    <P>No one ever wins a strike.  One side or the other may achieve a certain result which it originally intended to get but, by the time it is got, it was not worth getting in the first place.  We cannot legislate strikes out of existence except, as Deputy Dillon very correctly said, by dictatorship.  It was a very wise warning to point out that while we say in a Parliamentary democracy we cannot legislate strikes out of existence, we can by the exercise of freedom, which is what we are doing at the moment in industrial relations&mdash;we are exercising freedom&mdash;achieve such chaos that people will be prepared to accept dictatorship as an alternative.</P>
    <P>We must remember that Hitler did not grab power.  He was given it.  The colonels in Greece at the moment are different in that they did grab power, but now apparently they are supported by a great majority of the Greek <Col N="2196" /> people simply because those very ruthless army officers, although they have abolished liberty, have at least restored law, order and discipline.  We must not let ourselves get into the position where law and order and discipline are gone to the winds, and where any section of our people will say: &ldquo;For God's sake give us a Government that will really rule, and tell us exactly what to do&rdquo;.  There is this terrible danger of a reaction against something approaching anarchy and so, we can only encourage other methods of settling disputes which are less costly to everyone.</P>
    <P>As I said before, no one really wins in a strike.  I heard this afternoon one of my fellow Members saying he was talking to a man who was on a picket and asked him: &ldquo;Is there any settlement which you would accept?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Yes, I think we would accept another 3d an hour.&rdquo; Granted that may have been an entirely irresponsible statement by one man only, but still it was his own statement made off the cuff: &ldquo;I would agree to another 3d an hour&rdquo;.  That is a man who under the proposed arrangement would be getting about £18 a week minimum. Another 3d an hour is another 10/-a week.  In actual fact, with a bit of overtime which I gather is very common he would probably earn £20 a week.</P>
    <P>Even under the existing scales he was probably getting £16 or £17 a week.  He is losing that at the moment. He could have got the extra £2 a week, but now he is standing out for an extra 10/-.  Even if in the heel of the hunt he gets the additional 10/- it will be six, eight or ten months, before he even catches up on the arrears of salary which he has lost through being out.  It is not only a question of not getting his regular weekly wage, but he is also running himself into debt, and into additional expenses, and putting additional anxiety on himself and his family and loading himself with a burden which he will carry for months and months and months.  That is a stupid way of negotiating wage rates. It is the most stupid, the most clumsy, and the most costly arrangement under the sun.  It was not consciously developed as a system.  It is something <Col N="2197" /> which, let us face it, employers and workers have walked themselves into. I do not like to keep coming back to Deputy Kyne but I hope it does not embarrass him to find me agreeing with him.  I do not think it would.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of the encouraging things about this legislation that we seem to be discussing it with such a common realisation of the real problems at issue.  We are working at it in the right way and, if we can get some way of working out a settlement of disputes whether they are wage rates, or what have you, otherwise than by tearing each other to bits, we will have done a very good job.</P>
      <P>One other matter arising from the Bill is the value of a majority of those entitled to vote being necessary before strike notice is served.  This is something that deserves a lot more consideration. It is generally accepted that when it comes to a union voting on strike notice, where clerical workers are involved there is a fairly high poll for the very good reason that clerical workers can leave their jobs in the evening and go straight down to the union headquarters and vote, whereas a tremendous number of men particularly&mdash;and in certain cases probably women too&mdash;who are engaged in factory work as such, are not prepared to walk down town and walk into the union office when they come out of the factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are tired after their day's work. They probably feel dirty and want to get home, have a wash and have their tea.  They say: &ldquo;We will go down to the office afterwards when we have had a wash and something to eat.  We will cast our vote then.&rdquo;  Human nature being what it is, after you have done a full day's work and then cleaned yourself up, changed your clothes and had your tea, and the fire is going, there is a terrible temptation to say: &ldquo;What difference would one vote make here or there?&rdquo; Goodness knows at every election we ourselves have to try to convince people that it is essential that every man and woman should cast his or her vote.  We cannot throw any bricks at trade union members <Col N="2198" /> who fail to turn out to vote.  It is a very human failing.</P>
    <P>We have to provide for the fact that a number of people, being human and frail, will not turn up to vote even though they do not want a strike. Therefore, it is right that a majority of those entitled to vote should be necessary before a strike decision is taken.  It is not a question of protecting the employer against strikes.  It is not even a question of protecting the community against strikes.  It is basically a matter of protecting the workers against irresponsible action by other workers. That is something which, to my mind, is very valid.</P>
    <P>Section 15 refers to financial assistance to be given by the Government towards the expenses of amalgamations of trade unions.  I am delighted to see that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing new in that.  It is exactly the same as the law at present.  There is no change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I like to see it in writing. If Deputy Tully does not mind I should like to go a little further.  The same encouragement should be given to employers because employers are just as much at fault in having a multiplicity of trade organisations. Some people say there is the FUE only, but there is a great number of other small trade organisations of all sorts.  There is just as much vested interest in employers' organisation as there is in trade unions.  There is just as much resistance against amalgamation. We cannot build a better system of industrial relations unless we have both sides of industry organised on a thoroughly efficient and effective basis.  This means we must have a strong, resolute and effective trade union congress and, on the other side, we must have an equally strong efficient and effective employers' organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not say for a moment that these two organisations should be at each other's throats all the time: far from it.  My experience is that a responsible approach to a trade union executive is something which has a very high chance of producing successful results.  One of the weaknesses, I <Col N="2199" /> think, in the trade union side is that very many trade union members do not appreciate the very high calibre of their officers and executives.  It is a very hard business to run a democratic organisation and to try to convince the membership that the executive is really doing its job but this is a problem which we all have as elected representatives ourselves and so it should not come as any surprise to us.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that we have got to develop a strong and effective trade union organisation with an executive with power given to it by the members. This is an awkward thing for some people to swallow.  People talk about industrial democracy as if this meant that everybody must decide everything.  That is not democracy in any shape or form.  Democracy is a system where the membership, if you like, accepts that, as a whole group, it cannot act effectively and delegates its power to a small executive to make decisions which are binding on the membership.  That is the only way to run everything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not very familiar with the trade union movement, to talk in these terms.  Does the Deputy want to create a new trade union movement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Over the past few weeks, we have become very much aware of its weaknesses.  We have got the basis.  We do not want to see a new one.  Too much has been built on that basis too rapidly, too weakly, and the cracks appear in all directions.  It is something far too valuable to allow to perish.  When I say &ldquo;effective&rdquo;, I mean effective and on both sides.  We have to have some executive which will speak for employers and will ensure that, when an employers' executive reaches a decision with the trade union movement, all employers will comply with that decision.  That can be achieved only voluntarily.  It is up to us, as leaders of public opinion, to persuade workers and employers to do this for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain points in general occur to me.  At columns 1349/50 of the Official <Col N="2200" /> Report of 19th February, 1969, Deputy Michael O'Leary is reported as saying:</P>
    <P>Too many Deputies think that there is a kind of short-cut to industrial peace&mdash;I referred to this before&mdash;and that the way lies as much as possible in bringing our industrial relations code into line with the sanctions of law in our civil courts.  Too many Deputies at the back of their minds have this kind of approach to industrial relations.</P>
    <P>This is a point which I think is worth discussing, even at this late hour of the night.  I should like somebody to tell me why every other aspect of human relationships in this State is subject to the rule of law with the solitary exception of industrial relations. What is so different which gives employers and employees the right to say in effect: &ldquo;We shall not bring our disputes before a court of law: we shall fight each other and the strongest man or body will win&rdquo;?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to the other point later but this was a point on whether it was entirely wrong to suggest that we should bring our industrial relations code into line with the sanctions in our civil courts.  Deputy O'Leary did not speak of bringing it under the &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; of the civil courts: he spoke of bringing it &ldquo;into line&rdquo;.  Are we to have industrial <Col N="2201" /> relations governed by the law of the jungle?  That is what we have at the moment and it is not good.  Let nobody say the law of the jungle means that the employer will always win, because he will not.  He has now lost his power. The greatest power now lies in the hands of the workers.</P>

      <P>They hear what suits them.  If the Minister says something which upsets the normal, orthodox, 19th century tradition of the Labour Party they do not hear it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how irrelevant one can get.  To try to get back to the point I was making about the absolute craziness of trying to <Col N="2204" /> settle disputes simply by force, nobody wins a war and nobody wins a strike. If the parties would only have the wit to submit their case to arbitration by an arbitrator or, much better, to have a hearing by the Labour Court or to go to a rights commissioner or to make use of any of the other facilities available that is the way to get a quick solution of the trouble.  Nobody in any dispute gets everything he wants but you can get a lot more than nothing by that means and by the extravagant use of the strike weapon far too many people are getting nothing and are losing an awful lot.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary at column 1350 referred to the ESB (Special Provisions) Act which was supported by the majority of Deputies.  He suggested, I think, that Deputies were out of date in their view that sanctions of the civil courts were involved.  Let us get the facts in that case.  There was a crisis in which electricity supply was being stopped and in which the entire economy of the country was grinding to a halt and in which a number of people might have been put in mortal danger. Can any Government tolerate such a situation where one small group can exercise its right to strike in such a way as to put other people in peril of their lives?  That was a case in which in an effort to get people to see sense we had to introduce emergency legislation and I think a number of people have seen sense.</P>

      <P>If we can get this new machinery working properly nothing will please the Government more than to repeal that Act.  I would be delighted if it could be repealed, not because it was bad or wicked or immoral&mdash;&mdash;</P>
