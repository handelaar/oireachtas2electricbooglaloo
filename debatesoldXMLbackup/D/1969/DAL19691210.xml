    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state (a) for himself and (b) for his Parliamentary Secretary the cost of officially provided Christmas greeting cards sent in 1968; if the postage was provided free by his Department and, if so, the cost in each case; if he can give an estimate of cards on order for this year under each heading; and if the cards will be sent post free.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of official Christmas greeting cards sent by me in 1968 was £337 12s 9d.  As postal charges on officially-provided cards are largely recouped to the Vote for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs on the basis of estimates prepared by that Department for all Departmental correspondence issued, it is not possible to give the exact cost of postage for 1968, but it is estimated at £42.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the cost of official Christmas greeting cards this year will be £303: the cost, together with the postage involved, will be borne by my Department.</P>
      <P>Cards for my private use are provided at my own expense; I also pay the postage on such cards.</P>
      <P>As regards my Parliamentary Secretary, the cost of Christmas cards sent in 1968 was £22 and the postage is estimated at £21.  It is estimated that the cost of cards to be sent in 1969 will be £56.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach not consider that it would be more decent and honourable in the event of himself and members of the Government desiring to send Christmas cards at random, that the cards should be provided and paid for by the sender and also the postage?  I think it is a most despicable practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This practice has been followed for many years.  When I became Taoiseach I found that the cards were sent to the Taoiseach's Department on behalf of and/or by heads of Government, heads of State, heads of institutions all over the world, religious and otherwise who have an interest in Ireland.  The practice has invariably been that the Taoiseach in his official capacity returns these cards and that is what I did.  As far as my own private cards are concerned, as I told the Deputy, I paid for them myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that members of his Government are at present in the course of sending out the electors lists to various Fianna Fáil Cumainn in their areas and having them suitably marked so that a Christmas card can be despatched?  Does the Taoiseach think that in the interests of the taxpayer that is wise and prudent spending? I think it is disgraceful spending.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will accord me the courtesy of allowing me to answer his second question, what he has said is totally untrue.  He has similar questions down to each of the other Ministers and they will answer for themselves and they will satisfy the House, if not Deputy Flanagan, that his allegations are unfounded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Regardless of what <Col N="835" /> has happened in the past, will the Taoiseach not agree that it is desirable where cards are sent by Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries to constituents, that the cost should be borne by their own pockets and not by the taxpayers?  It is different in the case of cards going to the heads of State or the heads of Government in other countries.  Irrespective of the practice in the past it is not right that public funds should be asked to bear the cost of Christmas cards for Parliamentary Secretaries or Ministers when these cards are sent to their own constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know anything about that.  I regard cards sent officially by Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries in an official capacity as an expense to be properly borne by public funds.  I think that is reasonable. I do not know anything about private cards but I know that when Deputy Flanagan was Parliamentary Secretary he sent out 3,000 Christmas cards&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I say that is not true?  Last year and the year before when I was sending Christmas cards I paid for them in Portlaoise post office and nobody knows that better than the Portlaoise people.  The allegation of the Taoiseach is not true.</P>

      <P>If it happened that I had, as a colleague in my constituency, a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary, does the Taoiseach appreciate the grave disadvantage there would be for me in that fact since I am a Deputy who sends no Christmas cards to anyone because I think they are irrelevant?  I never bother sending Christmas cards to anyone but I would not like to see a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary in my constituency ingratiating himself with constituents&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together and to circulate with the Official Report a statement showing for the year 1968 the external trading position with the countries which are the principal sources of supply of the basic commodities from which materials for use in the manufacture of margarine are derived.  These materials are also used for other purposes and it is not possible to determine directly from the external trade statistics the import cost relevant to margarine manufacture.  On the basis of information available from industrial inquiries, however, it has been estimated that the import cost involved is about £0.8 million.</P>
      <P>Balance of payments figures are not compiled for individual countries.</P>

      <P>The estimated number of persons unemployed in April, 1957, was 78,000 and in April, 1968, 61,000.  These figures correspond to the number of persons who stated that they were out of work at the time of the census of population, although usually in gainful employment.  They are derived by using live register statistics in conjunction with the most recent census of population results.</P>
      <P>The difficulty of obtaining figures of emigration for individual years has been stressed on many previous occasions. The only accurate information on this subject is in respect of net emigration for the periods between censuses of population.</P>
      <P>Estimates have been prepared of net emigration for individual years using the figures of net outward passenger balance by sea and air in conjunction with the latest available information for intercensal periods.  On this basis it is estimated that net emigration in the 12 months to April, 1957, was 42,000 and in the 12 months to April, 1968, 18,000.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is&mdash;members of the lower income group and their dependants.  In practice, however, accident victims generally are treated free of charge on an out-patient basis.  As regards follow-up treatment, my information is that, while it would be unusual to insist that the patient should go elsewhere for the removal of stitches, this may happen in the case of injuries which are not serious.  In regard to a second tetanus injection which would be given after an interval of six weeks it would be reasonable to ask the patient to attend his family doctor rather than return to the hospital for the injection.  If the Deputy will send me particulars of the case he has in mind I will look into it and let him know the result.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the powers available to the Garda under the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1934, are generally adequate to enable them to deal with drug offences under that Act. The position regarding certain other classes of drugs liable to abuse which do not come within the scope of that Act has not been satisfactory in the sense that there is no specific provision for dealing with the unauthorised possession of such drugs.</P>
      <P>However, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Dáil have accepted my amendment to the Health Bill, 1969, which will enable the unauthorised possession of such substances to be made a punishable offence.  This is intended as an interim measure.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that application for supplementary grant by a person (name supplied) in Swords, County Dublin has been refused on the grounds that it was made more than six months after the date of the contract although it has been established that the date on the contract is the date the deposit was paid, and that the contract was not in fact signed until more than three months later; and if, in view of this, he will arrange that the grant be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Housing Act, 1966, payment of supplementary grants is a matter for the housing <Col N="859" /> authority, whose decision as to the amount of a grant is, under the Act, final and unappealable.  I cannot, therefore, direct payment of grants in particular cases.  I am sure, however, that if the position is as stated by the Deputy, the housing authority will reconsider the case on submission of evidence as to the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that I have personally appealed to the housing authority in regard to this matter, that the housing authority have refused to review the case, and that this man categorically states, and has supplied evidence to the effect, that his application was received by the housing authority before the six months were completed?  Would the Minister take it upon himself to look into this case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very surprised if a housing authority were to adopt such an attitude.  If they received evidence that what the Deputy says is true, I would be surprised if they would not review the case and behave in a more flexible manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is most unlike the Dublin County Council to turn down a case like this if it is as reasonable as the Deputy says it is?  Would the Minister say if the reason for turning down many of these matters is that the county council have no money to pay for housing at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of money not being available.  This is a question of the date on which the contract was signed.  So far as I can gather from the Deputy's question it appears that the housing authority are taking a very rigid attitude in regard to the date.  If it is possible to produce evidence that the actual date shown on the contract was not the effective date on which the contract was signed, I will be very surprised if the housing authority do not accept that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The cost of the Christmas greeting cards sent by the Minister for External Affairs in 1968 was £171.  The cost of all official mail including Christmas greeting cards is borne on the Department's Vote.  A record is not kept of the postage on individual items.  The cost of Christmas greeting cards in the current year is estimated at £145.  The usual practice in respect of postage will be continued.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I shall take questions 78, 79 and 80 together.  I have received a copy of the report of the European Commission on Human Rights on the Greek case.  Since the Convention on Human Rights provides that Governments &ldquo;shall not be at liberty to publish it&rdquo;, I am not in a position to indicate the findings of the commission as contained in the report. The publication of the report depends upon a decision of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe after a period of three months has elapsed from the transmission of the report to the committee.  I would point out that, apart from the procedure under the Convention on Human Rights, there is before the Committee of Ministers a draft resolution for the suspension of Greece from the Council of Europe and this will come before the forthcoming meeting of the Committee of Ministers of the Council in Paris on 12th and 13th December.  As indicated in the Dáil on 4th December, I do not propose to say in advance of the meeting what the attitude of the Government is going to be in this matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(iv) persons elected by all the manual workers over 21 years of age employed by the board.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment was discussed by both Deputy M. O'Leary and Deputy Bruton on Committee Stage.  The case for the amendment is coercive.  I can see no reason whatsoever for the exclusion of the majority of the staffs involved from these health boards and this amendment proposes to give these people a voice.  It proposes no more than that.  The Minister's view on this is archaic; it belongs to ages past.  The Minister says that only the medical people and public representatives will be on these boards.  That is entirely wrong.  It is not just contrary to what has grown up and come to be known as industrial democracy, but it is contrary to common sense.  It is not only technologists or semi-technologists who make suitable representatives on public boards.  Representatives of the ordinary workers are just as effective&mdash;very often more effective&mdash;because they bring a great deal of common sense to bear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suggest there should be a <Col N="893" /> large number of these people on these boards.  On Committee Stage the Minister spoke about the size of these boards and he took a figure of 25 and 26 and then a figure of 33 or 35 and he said that would be too many.  This is not where the separation occurs. The separation occurs in very different territory.  There are people who believe that seven is the most one should have.  In governments, which might be regarded as super-boards, there are 15 to 20, not more.  When you get up to 20 it does not matter whether you have one or two more, but it matters a great deal whether or not the majority of the workers in hospitals and health services are represented.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme proposed by the Minister there is no representation for porters.  Speaking for myself, I believe that porters are very important people indeed.  I am not being sarcastic when I say this; I really mean it.  If you want something done, or if you want to find out something, in nine cases out of ten it is the porter you ask, and it is the porter who tells you exactly what you want to know.  Again, ambulance drivers and their assistants should be represented.  I just do not understand the official thinking on this.  I am not with it.  It is completely contrary to the most rudimentary form of industrial democracy.  There are numerous people involved.  The wardsmaids, the cooks and all these people are involved and I see no reason whatever why they should not have a voice on these boards.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton made a very strong case for this representation on Committee Stage.  I believe the Minister should accept the amendment.  I can see no great objection to it.  The Minister gave an example of nine representatives in the case of the medical staff; I do not ask for nine even though these people are much more numerous than the medical staff.  It is entirely wrong in the age in which we live that these people should not be represented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We support this amendment. It was canvassed by a number of Deputies on Committee Stage.  It is <Col N="894" /> highly desirable that everybody operating the health services should be involved in the running of the health boards.  By far the largest section so involved would appear to be excluded under the Minister's Bill as drafted. The Minister has had some experience as Minister for Transport and Power of appointing trade union representatives to the directorships of some of the companies he supervised.  That was done to ensure proper social democracy and involvement by those engaged in commerce, industry and administration.  The power of selection should be given direct to the workers themselves.  I believe this would confer great benefit from the point of view of the relationships which ought to exist between a board and its employees. That sort of policy is a progressive policy and it is in line with the Minister's anxiety to have a spirit of co-operation and mutual involvement in the operation of the new hierarchy of the health administration. We strongly recommend this amendment. It will not give revolutionary powers to anyone.  Its purpose is to ensure that the voices of the workers are heard in relation to matters directly affecting themselves.  Happy employees will mean happy health services and happier people being helped by the health services.  Therefore, we commend it strongly to the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy who first raised this matter on Committee Stage, I should like wholeheartedly to support Deputy O'Donovan's amendment. It is very important that, if we give any section of the employees of health boards representation we should give all sections of employees of health boards representation.  It is highly invidious to single out the doctors and to give them representation as employees of a health board and not to to give representation to all the employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that doctors are not singled out as being a privileged section of the employees of health boards as against the manual workers and other employees. I feel, and I am sure that Deputy O'Donovan and Deputy Ryan <Col N="895" /> feel, that these manual workers will be very closely affected by various decisions taken by the health boards in relation to their working conditions. It is only right and just and in the interest of good industrial relations that they should have some say in these decisions.  The amendment would give them a say.  It would also ensure that there was good morale in the entire service and that there was no feeling of inferiority.  The scheme outlined by the Minister, which does not give manual workers representation but does give doctors representation, would create a feeling of inferiority among manual workers in that they were discriminated against in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is just one thing that I am wondering about.  Does the term &ldquo;manual worker&rdquo; cover all people who are not represented at the moment?  Would ambulance drivers, for instance, come under the term &ldquo;manual worker&rdquo; in the amendment? If not, then perhaps the amendment is not adequate in that it does not cover all sections involved.  I would hope that this matter would be clarified and that steps would be taken to ensure that every employee of the health board would be given representation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I elaborate further on the concept very clearly outlined by the Labour Party amendment? With due regard for the Minister and conscious that he has been in an extremely receptive mood throughout the Committee Stage of the Bill and not being anxious to delay him unduly in implementing the Bill, we would point out to him that he is introducing and perpetuating and enshrining in legislation a completely discriminatory aspect of representation. I would point out to the Minister that not one single representative of the vast army of clerical staff employed by the health authorities and the health boards as envisaged will have any say whatsoever on the boards. None of the senior administrative staff, through their trade union organisations in a representative position or on <Col N="897" /> an elected basis internally will have any say whatsoever on the boards.</P>
      <P>I find it utterly contradictory and quite ridiculous that you should say to psychiatric nurses, &ldquo;You can put a psychiatric nurse on to the board&rdquo; and you say that there can be a surgeon, doctors, physicians, the whole sheebang, if I may use that expression, of medical representatives&mdash;a full nine of professional medical representatives on the boards yet, clerical staffs, administrative staffs, radiographers, physiotherapists, the whole catering staffs, dieticians, hospital attendants, the whole range of welfare officers employed by such boards, will have not one single representative.  There will be not one single representative of the hundreds and in some cases thousands of paramedical staff on such boards.  We in the Labour Party feel very strongly about this aspect.  We consider it to be built-in discrimination on an occupational basis being perpetuated by the Minister, perhaps inadvertently, in this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is a mark of a civilised, democratic and fully representative community that everybody gets the opportunity to be represented on such boards.  With due regard for the Minister's anxiety, about which he has often spoken, for representative democracy and for people having every possible participation in social and industrial legislation, I would suggest that all that the Minister need do is to bring in an amendment saying that the general staffs, paramedical staffs and all other analogous grades in the services shall, by nomination by the bodies recognised by the Minister, be represented.  I am thinking quite frankly of the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions who represent as a committee some 15 different trade unions.  A multitude of unions are co-ordinated in the public services committee.  They should be given a representational right of nominating, say, two&mdash;I would even be satisfied with one at this stage &mdash;from their general paramedical staff, on to such boards and within that trade union organisation they could have their own elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister allows the Bill to go <Col N="898" /> through as now proposed, in ten or 20 years time we can stand up in this House and say that he discriminated exclusively in favour of the medical profession&mdash;I do not think the medical profession want that&mdash;and gave a miserable sop: he allowed on one psychiatric nurse and one general nurse.  All other analogous grades are completely excluded from representation on the board.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I make a final plea to the Minister.  It is not impossible to concede what we want at this stage and it would be, perhaps, one of the major innovations.  We shall have a situation in, say, the eastern health board within two or three years where they would be spending £20 million on health services and employing thousands of workers in the hospital complexes. You will have a board very narrowly constituted of some 16 people employing thousands of workers without one opportunity open to them to make representations at board level as to the policy or conduct of the administration and the general outlook and tone of such a board.</P>
    <P>We make this point strongly as it was made earlier on Committee Stage by Deputy O'Leary and myself.  We were very strongly pressed by the workers concerned to make these representations and I do not think any almoner, social worker, clerical or administrative worker in the Dublin Health Authority will thank the Minister if he allows this opportunity to go by without making this fundamental and very elementary change in the Bill, a change which is very long overdue.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan)</i>: I do not like the word &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo; used by Deputy Desmond but there is much to be said for the amendment. It would probably, if accepted, create better relations on these boards. Deputy Lenihan is technically correct in saying that possibly none of the persons mentioned at paragraph 2 (a) (2) will be in the employment of the health boards.  I concede that is quite possible but it is likely that they will. The likelihood is that some of the medical people and those employed in <Col N="899" /> the ancillary professions will be in the employment of the boards.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan)</i>: Deputy Lenihan is correct in that they could be from outside the employment of the board but the likelihood is that these people will be recruited or elected from people in the employment of the board.  It is only reasonable that those described as the manual classes should be represented to some extent and should have a voice there.  In the end this would lead to more harmonious relations in the board and between the board and its employees.  When we are giving representation to the various categories mentioned in the section, to persons appointed by relevant local authorities and persons appointed by election by registered medical practitioners and by the election of members of such ancillary professions as are specified in the appropriate regulations under the subsection, the Minister should go the whole way and give some representation to the other interests involved.</P>
      <P>I know that the Minister could use the power conferred on him by the section, the power given him to appoint certain persons on the board, to appoint persons covered by the amendment; but at a time when we are moving towards industrial democracy it would be a nice gesture to write it into the section.  It would mean that the categories not covered by the section would see that they are entitled to representation on the board as of right. They will not have a majority on it; that is unlikely.  If they could be there and speak for those they represent it would lead to better relations within the board and between the board and its employees.  It would also probably lead to a better service for those being served by the board.</P>

      <P>I shall certainly not take issue with Deputy Desmond on the matter of labour relations.  I appreciate his vast knowledge in this field, but as a layman I can see one or two problems arising.  While we have been talking about democracy we may <Col N="900" /> be doing a disservice to democracy in that we are trying to sectionalise.  I think Deputy Desmond will be at variance with Deputy Murphy in this connection. Deputy Murphy has said he wants to see the public representatives having this power on the board.  The public representative may not be committed to one section or another and will have to face the electorate to give an account of his stewardship.  That system more or less is operating at present.  We have members of different unions as elected representatives of the local authority.  I think it would be unwise to take that power from them. These representatives are answerable to the whole community and that is how it should be.

      <P>I agree in principle with this amendment.  I should like to see the representative being one of the people working under the board.  I do not think that the medical profession are over-represented on any of these health boards.  I do not know if any manual worker over 21 could contribute anything to the health board which would result in more efficient health services; but purely from the point of view of making communication more readily available between the professional members of the health board and the manual workers, who in some cases have to work side by side with the professional members, it would be a good idea.  There is the contention among manual workers that professional people can look after themselves and sometimes they have the idea that a surgeon has never done a day's labouring and therefore does not understand the problems of manual workers.  This could possibly be true to a certain extent.  However, surgeons do work hard and in every way expend as much energy as manual <Col N="902" /> workers.  I feel that if manual workers of over 21 are going to be represented other interests should also be represented; in particular those who are paying for the service, the ratepayers, should have a specific representative&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Tunney's assertion in that regard. From my own experience, having worked in hospitals, I feel that greater communication between the manual employees and the professional staff, the professional representatives, would in some way help to render the service more efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I must turn down the amendment.  First of all, there are too many groups involved. There are not only manual workers but radiographers, physiotherapists, social workers, opticians, almoners, laboratory technicians and so on.  You have, too, the administrative and the clerical staffs and in my view it would be utterly impossible to devise a method by which you could have representatives appointed from all those different groups on the board without swelling the board to an undesirable size.  I want the boards to have between 25 and 32 members at the outside so that they can work effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to dispel the idea that the regional health boards will be concerned with conditions of employment and remuneration.  These matters are specifically left to the chief executive officer.  No doubt the board will be interested in these matters and will not want to make any decisions that would have the effect of making the life of the staff burdensome.  The fact remains <Col N="903" /> that staffs of these boards will have the new arbitration and conciliation machinery available to them.  I can say without disclosing any secrets that the basic document for this has been prepared. The staff will have an opportunity of bringing their grievances with regard to remuneration and also conditions of employment to the notice of the CEO who can determine the action to be taken and they can then have an appeal to the Minister for Health.  It just works that way and that has been found to be the best way, not to have the county councils or the regional health boards take part in specific matters relating to the conditions of staff. As far as I know, the system has worked fairly well and I have not seen any great reports that this kind of system has broken down and that as a result in the last five or ten years conditions of staff have not been thought about and considered on a reasonable basis.  The staff, too, have their own organised trade unions and associations in many cases.</P>
    <P>I realise, at the same time, that in the world in which we are living there is a greater desire for participation, but the difficulty is to get the right kind of participation.  I do not know of any means whereby one can ensure that if the manual workers in a particular group exceeded all others they would not have the representative appointed whom they wished to have, if we had one single person representing the manual workers.  There are all sorts of practical difficulties.  Having drawn attention to the expanded grievance machinery to which the staff would have access, I would say that there is nothing to deprive the regional health board from having a consultative committee of people not directly represented on the board. They can do this if they wish and they could have suggestions for the improvement of the service.  They can hardly have any suggestions for better remuneration or conditions of employment as that would be a matter for the chief executive officer and the unions using the conciliation and arbitration machinery.  Suggestions of this kind might lead to some useful results.  It might lead, for example, to the formation <Col N="904" /> of some kind of group who in the years to come could provide a representative.  Sooner or later this health legislation will be amended and at that point it might be considered if they considered consultative machinery was not sufficient.</P>
    <P>In relation to the professional classes of people on the board, they are not necessarily employees of the board.  A nurse could be elected from a voluntary hospital which was not run by the board; a pharmacist could be elected who was not employed in a hospital.  It is by no means certain all the professionals on the board will represent the people who are interested in running the board and who are also employees of the board.  I want to see a board which operates the health services.  Matters concerning staff or remuneration or conditions of employment and matters concerning the particular interests of a county should either be related to the conciliation and arbitration machinery or to the county advisory committee who will meet regularly and give their views.  I want these boards to be executive boards.</P>
    <P>I should like to have done this but I must shy away from increasing the size of the boards.  There is absolutely no way that I know of doing this without having far more than one representative because of the variety of workers and the difficulty of getting an understanding.  I am afraid I will have to turn down the amendment.  Let us start with the consultative committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Either the Minister completely misunderstood the purpose of my amendment or he is drawing a veil over it.  He partly understood it because of his suggestion about the consultative committee.  What I really wanted to do for this section was to bring it, so to speak, into the modern world&mdash;in the words of the famous report &ldquo;The world of 1980&rdquo;.  I am thinking of the 1970s.  It is possible the Minister might concede that other people should be represented also.  It is not my experience, nor that of people who deal with numbers of this sort, that somewhere between 25 and 30 will be an effective board.  For an <Col N="905" /> executive board&mdash;seven people.  The Minister says there could be a consultative committee but that complicates the matter, whereas my amendment does not.  There are elections nowadays of all kinds of bodies: some semi-State, universities, and so forth.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the grievance machinery.  I was not interested in grievances but in representation.  It is true, technically, for the Minister and for Deputy Tunney and for Deputy Lenihan to say, for example, that the medicos on these boards need not be employees of the board itself.  In the great majority of cases they will be employees of the board.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister consider this matter when the Bill goes to the Seanad?  The insertion of &ldquo;a person&rdquo; would satisfy what I want done here. It is one of the most noticeable defects remaining in the Bill.  One could not but admire the manner in which the Minister worked on the Bill.  I would ask him to think again on this matter.</P>

How can he justify that and yet deny the right of nomination to such boards of representatives of, for example, the Irish Local Government Officials' Union, representing thousands of workers in the health services, the Workers' Union of Ireland and the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union?

      <P>&ldquo;(2) The Minister may, by order made at the request of a health board, substitute in relation to that board a different rule for any of the following rules set out in the Second Schedule, namely, rules 15, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23.</P>

    <P>This arises out of a discussion on Committee Stage when Deputy Ryan suggested there should be some flexibility in connection with rules made for the operation of these boards.  I said that some rules obviously should <Col N="907" /> be left standard for all the boards but I agree that I should enable some rules which are referred to in the schedule to be left open to change by order if I were requested to do this.  The rules that can be changed in the second schedule are rules 15, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23.  I do not think the House will have any objection to this amendment to have a reasonable attitude taken towards this business of the changes that might be made in rules without, so to speak, creating anomalies in the general operation of the health boards.</P>

      <P>The point was raised by a number of Deputies that the Minister, in ordering the removal from office of the members of a health board, should do so only after a public local inquiry was held into the board's performance of its duties.

      <P>&ldquo;(3) Within two years of the removal from office of the members of a health board under this section, the Minister shall by order provide for a new appointment of members to that board&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This arises from a discussion on the possibility of health boards that were dissolved being left out of action for some time.  Having regard to the likely manner in which health boards will operate in future, I feel it is just as well that we should fix a period by which the Minister must reconstitute the board.  I put it at two years.  Some Deputies felt that was too long but <Col N="909" /> a dissolution of a health board might take place within two years of the end of the term of office of the members. If this were to happen it would be desirable to have flexibility so that the new board need not be appointed for a term of office that might last for a few months only.  If by any unhappy chance a Minister had to dissolve a health board within two years of a local election, when all the health boards would be renewed, there would not seem to be much point, after waiting to see what the position was, and examining what had gone wrong with the health board, in having to arrange for two health boards.  I think two years is a reasonable compromise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We must express our disappointment that the Minister, notwithstanding very strong representations from us, has refused to accept our suggestion of a one year period of vacuum on the dissolution of a board.  If in the last two years of a board's existence prior to the next local elections the board becomes alarmingly obstreperous, this is an incentive to the Minister to dissolve it and reconstitute it after the next local elections.  I suggest that it is quite undemocratic and undesirable in this age that there should be written into Irish legislation a provision which, to the best of my knowledge, is unique in the world, whereby any Minister of State can dissolve a board and not reconstitute it for two years.  It is a fuddy-duddy anachronism in terms of permissive legislation.</P>
      <P>Once a board is removed from office and immediate obligation devolves on the Minister to re-appoint it.  I would suggest that it should be re-appointed within a period of six months.  Otherwise the whole thing becomes a complete farce.  Before the Minister goes to the Seanad and has his head bitten off, if I may use that phrase, by Senators because of the nonsense contained in that section, he should agree to re-appoint the board within six months.  I do not think any board would be worth re-appointing if it were not re-appointed as quickly as possible rather than waiting for the next local elections.  I have these reservations about the section.</P>

      <P>If we have a publicly elected board and if the Minister deems it desirable to remove that board from office, that does not mean that the democratic principles should fall down and the board should be left <i>in vacuo</i> for a number of years, perhaps. When a board is removed from office&mdash;a democratically elected board &mdash;every effort should be made to have it replaced by the democratic process as soon as possible.  The Minister gives himself the elbow room of two years here, but I think the democratic principle obtains that a board should be reconstituted as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I have personal knowledge of a public authority which was removed from office for a rather small offence on the part of two or three members. The entire board was removed. Many members who had not done anything wrong were removed from office and the board was replaced by a commissioner for many years. Things happened during those years. Far greater excesses were indulged in than were indulged in by the public board.  What the public board did was open for everyone to see, but what was done by a commissioner was less obvious.  In general, it is far safer to have a board reconstituted as soon as possible if it is deemed necessary to remove it.</P>
      <P>The Minister has certainly improved the position in so far as he has departed from the idea of allowing himself an indefinite number of years. Until this amendment was introduced the board could be removed&mdash;I do not say the present Minister would do this but some Minister might, perhaps, for personal reasons or petty reasons&mdash;and not be re-appointed.  The amendment does not go the full distance. If a public board is removed it should be re-appointed as quickly as possible.  Otherwise there is no point in saying that we are trying to practise democratic principles here.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="911" /> This amendment also goes to meet a point raised on Committee Stage.  The amendment makes it clear that any modifications made by the Minister will only be such as are required for the mechanics of making the new appointment.  An example of a modification which might be required could be a change in rule 1 (2) which requires appointments of members to be made at the annual meeting of a council held next after every quin-quennial election of the members of the council.  It is simply to enable the board to be formed in the same way as before but enables slight alterations in the rules relating to the rest of the enactments in the Bill.

      <P>&ldquo;(2) (a) Where a chief executive officer will for any reason, other than suspension from performance of his duties, be temporarily unable to act as such, he may, after consultation with the chairman of the health board (or in his absence, the vice-chairman), appoint one of the other officers of that board to act as deputy chief executive officer for the duration of such inability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) Where a chief executive officer has for any reason become temporarily unable to act as such and either he has not made an appointment under this subsection or an appointment made under this subsection, whether by such chief executive officer or otherwise, has become terminated under paragraph (d), or on account of the death or resignation of the appointee, the chairman of the health board (or, in his absence, the vice-chairman) may appoint one of the other officers of that board to act as deputy chief <Col N="912" /> executive officer for the remainder of the duration of such inability.</P>
    <P>(c) The Minister may specify classes of officers who may be appointed as deputy chief executive officer and any appointment under this subsection shall comply with any such specification.</P>
    <P>(d) An appointment as deputy chief executive officer may at any time be terminated by the chairman of the health board with the consent of the Minister.</P>
    <P>(e) An appointment as deputy chief executive officer shall terminate on the chief executive officer ceasing to be such officer.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is related to amendment No. 24 under which a change is proposed to permit each board to elect its own chairman and vice-chairman. It is also related to points raised by Dublin Deputies in relation to section 16 of the Bill on Committee Stage when they urged me to apply, at least for the initial period, the provisions of the County Management Act to the eastern health board.  The difference between the existing subsection (2) and that in the amendment is that a change would be made so that the chief executive office, after consultation with the chairman or vice-chairman, would normally appoint the deputy. The procedure in the amendment is similar to that for the appointment of a deputy county manager.  As in practice it is unlikely that there would be disagreement between the chairman and the chief executive officer on such a matter, the effect of the amendment is not likely to be such as to alter the personnel who would be appointed as deputy.  However, the amendment does go somewhere to accentuate the point that the chief executive officer will, in fact, be chief executive of the board with the same status in the appointment of his deputy as a county manager. I think that makes the position clear.  It is to relate the choice of chief deputy officer to the change that is being made in relation to the appointment of the chairman.</P>

      <P>I am not very clear on this matter.  I was not here when this section of the Bill was being discussed. Neither am I an expert on local government officers' arbitration schemes. However, I understand there are some difficulties about their employment, which have been expressed by both doctors and nurses and I think the matter is applicable to this section. They state they can discuss salary with the county manager but they are apparently precluded from discussing conditions of appointment, such as <Col N="914" /> time off, under the scheme of arbitration. Further than that I am unable to help the Minister very much because, as I said, I am not very familiar with the ins and outs of the matter.  However, I think I have fulfilled my function if I draw his attention to the fact that there is some measure of dissatisfaction in this sector as regards that aspect.</P>

      <P>In page 11, to delete lines 12 to 16 and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) In the performance of their duties, the chief executive officer and the other officers of a health board shall act in accordance with such decisions and directions (whether of a general or a particular nature) as, subject to subsection (3), are conveyed to or through the chief executive officer by the board, and in accordance with any such decisions and directions so conveyed of a committee to which functions have been delegated by the board.</P>
      <P>(2) When the chief executive officer or another officer of a health board performs a duty in accordance with subsection (1), he shall be deemed to act on behalf of the board.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an interesting amendment.  It arises from points made by Dublin Deputies on Committee Stage, and subsequently I met Deputies Paddy Burke, Clinton and Dockrell with the city manager and officers of the <Col N="915" /> Dublin Health Authority.  The general tenor of the case made in the House and in my discussions with the Deputies and the local officers was that, because the scale of operations of the eastern health board will be so much greater than that of any of the other health boards, the managerial system which at present applies to the Dublin Health Authority should, for the initial period at any rate, be applied to the new board.  Fears were expressed that the administrative system might break down because of the enormous number of decisions that might have to be made by the health board if they operated the Bill in its literal sense and only left to the chief executive officer or any deputy officers the actual matters deliberately reserved in the Bill in relation to control of staff and so on.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, I should summarise for the House the management system as it applies in the case of the Dublin Health Authority or in the case of the Cork, Limerick and Waterford Authorities. The County Management Act, 1940, and the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, contained detailed provisions of how this system operates and how functions are divided between the elected members of a local authority and the manager.  The basis of the 1940 Act was that the manager exercises and performs for the council all the executive functions of such council, the executive functions being defined as all the functions of the council not reserved to the members.  The second schedule to the 1940 Act listed 22 reserved functions of the elected members.  Most of these, however, related to functions which are specific to county councils, such as making bye-laws, appointment of persons as members of other bodies, nominations of persons as candidates in Presidential elections.  For the purposes of the Dublin Health Authority and similar bodies, the only important functions actually reserved to the council lie in the preparation, adoption and variation of its estimates and the borrowing of money.</P>
    <P>As well as having these functions reserved to them, the elected members <Col N="916" /> had from the beginning powers to control the manager in the performance of the executive functions.  These powers were extended and improved under the 1955 Act, which provided that the members may by resolution direct the manager to inform them before he performs any of his functions, and they may, by resolution passed after due notice is given, require him to do anything within his executive powers, but they cannot direct him in the exercise of his powers in relation to the eligibility of individuals or in relation to the control of staff.</P>
    <P>In so far as the initiative lies mainly with the manager in the execution of policy, the balance of power in the management system is weighted towards him, as against the members. The fact is that he is liable to be directed by the members in the exercise of most of his functions, as I have already indicated, under the 1955 Act.</P>
    <P>We could have written into this legislation the management system as contained in the 1940 and the 1955 Acts.  My predecessor discussed the proposed regionalisation of the health services with all the health authorities and they suggested the system that we have now adopted in which the regional health boards have very wide powers other than those clearly indicated in section 16.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not depart from the management system to the extent of vesting all functions in the board.  It specifically states&mdash;in section 16 (3)&mdash; that functions relating to decision on eligibility will be reserved to the chief executive officer.  It is now intended that the executive functions will be exercised by decisions and directions of the board through its chief executive officer and, under him, its other officers.</P>
    <P>Deputies raised two issues on the Committee Stage.  The first was whether the Bill was specific enough in establishing the authoritative position of the chief executive officer in relation to the other officers and servants of the board.  I do not think there was really much doubt about this in the Bill as circulated because section 12 (1) indicates that the chief executive officer <Col N="917" /> will act as such; section 13 makes it clear that he will determine the conditions of employment and the duties of the other officers and the servants; section 15 provides for him to delegate functions to other officers; section 16 (3), as I have mentioned, reserves specific functions to him and section 30 (2) gives him a special status, analogous to that of the secretary of a Government Department in relation to the financial responsibilities of the board. Now, section 16 (1) was never intended to be interpreted so that the board would by-pass its chief executive officer in issuing decisions and directions but, to remove any temptation for a board to attempt to do this, the amendment now moved substitutes a new subsection making it quite clear that the board's decisions and directions will be conveyed through the chief executive officer in all cases.  I am assured that there can be no doubt but that the chief executive officer will be the undisputed administrative head of the board.  It is, of course, essential that this should be so for the evolution of a proper management structure.</P>
    <P>The other point of concern was whether, under the system proposed in the Bill, the board would become involved in so much detailed executive work that the members would either have to meet very frequently or else the administration would become entirely clogged.  This, of course, was never intended.  The basis of section 16 of the Bill was that the board would issue general policy decisions and directions and leave it to the chief executive officer and the staff to carry these out.  The new subsections proposed to be introduced by this amendment are designed to make this quite clear.  They indicate that the board can give either general or particular directions and that, where an officer of the board carries out his duties in accordance with these directions, he will be deemed to act on behalf of the board.  It should be clear from this that a board will not be required to consider specific cases to any greater extent than they consider necessary and that, in fact, the section will not stop a board from operating very much as the Dublin Health Authority operates at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="918" /> The essential difference between the provisions in the Bill and the Management Acts is, however, that it would be easier for the members of a board to succumb to the temptation of interfering too much in relation to the performance of detailed executive functions.  I do not think that a board, many of whose members will have been used to the operation of the county management system, are likely to do this.  It does, however, seem to me to be democratic to leave to the members of the board the freedom, perhaps, to err in this respect and learn by experience what the proper balance should be between themselves and their chief executive officer.</P>
    <P>It is planned to establish the health boards next October and to arrange-for them to take over the administration of services the following April. This will give six months for them to settle down and during those six months I propose to have studies done with regard to the best managerial methods for the boards and I shall make the results of these studies available to the boards.  The best way of doing this is now being considered.</P>
    <P>I am absolutely convinced in the case of a very large board like the Eastern Health Board, that it would be impossible for the board to make all the decisions that they could make if they wanted to make use of their full powers under the Bill.  They would be working for hours and hours dealing with minor things.  They might, for example, vote an annual sum for the repainting and maintenance of certain dispensaries, and them find that a particular dispensary needed painting more than others.  They could well spend hours and hours arguing whether dispensary D needed painting more quickly than dispensary C&mdash;and they would get nowhere.  In the case of the present Dublin Health Authority this kind of thing is dealt with under a review of dispensaries when all matters regarding them would be discussed.</P>
    <P>I hope this amendment will allay the fears of the Dublin Deputies who spoke on the Committee Stage on this issue.  I think this is all I can do at the present time.  I do have an alternative under section 16 (3) (e) <Col N="919" /> where I could delegate certain functions to the board far and beyond those, but I think the section, with the amendment I have put in, clarifies the position that the whole operation should go smoothly.</P>
    <P>I recommend all health boards to get an idea of the work load they will have.  I am going to ask every county manager in the country to give me the number of orders he makes that are not orders in relation to what clearly are his reserve functions but are orders in relation to the general running of the health authority so that the regional health boards with the aid and advice of my Department's officers will be able to see what kind of work load they are going to have. This should enable them to do their work effectively without spending an inordinate amount of time at it which will, in turn, give them more time to design, provide and think of the services as a whole.  They will deal with matters of prime importance as well as being able to deal in an intelligent way with important complaints that have arisen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that if a board of this nature wants to do its job properly it should confine itself to general policy considerations and not get bogged down in detail.  Even in the present county councils one finds that the general work has to be done by executives.  It would be impossible for them to find time to go into all these matters even if they were trained to do so.  One finds that the trained official, with his objective approach, handles these matters in a very effective manner.  One does, however, like to feel that the public authority retains the necessary power.  The only effective legislation at local level which we have at the present time is the City and County Management Act, 1955, which was brought into this House by Deputy O'Donnell.  Section 4 of that Act enables the local authority to command a manager to do anything that is legal.  It is a very useful controlling section&mdash;although it is sometimes abused.  The Minister might try to incorporate <Col N="920" /> some measure analogous to it when he is finalising his ideas about these boards.  Obviously, he is feeling his way at the moment, trying to work out in his mind what could be the most effective operative measure and how he can operate it to the best advantage.  I do not think a section of that nature would be opposed by regional boards.  I believe there would be sufficiently reasonable people on the boards not to oppose it and yet something analogous to that would have to be retained so that they would ultimately have the power vested in them should they care to use it</P>

      <P>I want to thank the Minister for meeting us to some extent in regard to the amendments we tabled to this section on Committee Stage, but I do not think the Minister's amendment goes far enough. When we saw the Minister we stated we would prefer to have the managerial system in the eastern region.  One of our difficulties was that this would be a completely new board and almost 50 per cent of the representation on that board would also be completely new to local government, never having sat on a local authority before, and I believe that when such a board meets it will be very difficult for them to give the general directions set out in the Minister's amendment.  Even if they do that at their first meeting there is nothing to stop them revoking these directions at the next meeting.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider this and to amend the section further when the Bill goes before the other House.  I know the Minister has told us that he has been asked down the country not to amend in this way but for the eastern region, at any rate, he could give us this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy need worry about this.  I have noticed a very, very strong feeling about this in the eastern region and I imagine the people in the Cork health authority and the Limerick health authority will feel the same.  We could compromise.  When the eastern regional health board meets in October, if they do not take what I think would be a good comprehensive attitude <Col N="921" /> towards this, they should at least operate for a year on the same system and see what their work load will be. I know the work load is a very heavy one.  If, at the end of that period, the members of the eastern regional health board approach me I could, under section 16 (3) (e) say: &ldquo;I will not take the risk of there being almost administrative chaos in the operation of this very important board, which has worked so well&rdquo; and I would write in more functions for the chief executive officer.  I could do that for a year and if, at the end of that period, there were some members who said: &ldquo;We have had a very, very small work load&rdquo; then I need not renew the regulation. That would be a good compromise. In the case of the major city areas it would be quite reasonable I think for me to do that.  Nobody could say I was being undemocratic.  I am perfectly certain, having discussed this with Deputy Burke, Deputy Clinton and Deputy Dockrell, that the new members of the board will realise that, with a board of this complexity, it would be only right to preserve the management functions as they were hitherto in the chief executive officer. There is no other way of running the board.  I hope Deputy Dockrell will accept this suggestion.</P>

    <P>This is an amendment which relates to a request from all sides of the House that a local inquiry should be held before a Minister would direct the discontinuance of a hospital, sanatorium or home and restores the position in this sector of the Bill to what it was under the Health Acts 1947 and 1953. The same thing applies where a health board takes the initiative in the discontinuance of a hospital, sanatorium or home.  The consent of the Minister <Col N="924" /> will be necessary for the closure.  I do not think that these kind of inquiries are likely to arise very much.  If a building is not in a state of collapse or hopelessly outmoded and outdated, then within the next 20 years there will be some use for it, either as a geriatric institution or for some purpose or other.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some public misunderstanding about this amendment that the Minister now proposes to insert in the Bill and this arises as a result of the FitzGerald Report.  Some of the public had taken it that this public inquiry would be held in reference to hospitals such as the county hospital in Roscommon.  I should like if the Minister would further enlighten me on this problem.  In the case of the county hospital in Roscommon it is not proposed to close it but what is in this committee's report is that surgical facilities be withdrawn from it or, more correctly perhaps, acute surgical facilities.  If I am correct in assuming that under those circumstances it is not necessary to hold a local inquiry according to this amendment, I would urge upon the Minister that such an inquiry be held before any change would be made in such hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do so for two reasons.  The primary reason which was offered on Committee Stage is that this idea must be sold to the people, that the people must be convinced that it is absolutely right and all the figures and information available should be made available to the people and the best machinery for doing that is an inquiry. Secondly, I ask the Minister further to amend this, if that is necessary to deal with the case I refer to&mdash; and I know that this applies to other county hospitals.  Rightly or wrongly the public assume&mdash;I am taking my own constituency in relation to the Roscommon county hospital&mdash;that before surgical facilities are withdrawn from that hospital, if, unfortunately, that is so decided a local inquiry will be held.  It would cause great disappointment if that is not the position. I would ask the Minister to make a more specific statement on it.  If my <Col N="925" /> information is correct, the Minister should go further and provide an amendment whereby no facilities would be withdrawn from any county hospital, either surgical, maternity or medical, without a local inquiry being held.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Gibbons has some slight misunderstanding about this.  This amendment is in relation to the discontinuance of a hospital, sanatorium or home.  I do not think there is any mention in the FitzGerald Report of closing any major hospital whatever.  It was a question of changing the function.  I said on Committee Stage&mdash;column 2027, volume 242 of the Official Report&mdash;that when we come to discuss the regulations for the setting up of Comhairle na nOspidéal, the central hospital council, a statutory provision will be inserted therein that a local health committee will be consulted before any action is taken by Comhairle na nOspidéal.  In other words, there is ample opportunity for full public expression of opinion because Comhairle na nOspidéal would not be able to take a decision not to re-appoint a single surgeon in a hospital without having a committee of this kind.  So, that would come before the Dáil for discussion at a later date because the regulations in regard to the setting-up and actual constitution of the regional hospital boards and Comhairle na nOspidéal have to come before this House next year for discussion, when all this matter can be considered.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the point. I take it that the Minister is drawing a distinction between the discontinuance of an institution as such and the discontinuance of acute medical services of an institution.  The first is dealt with under this section and the discontinuance of acute services in an institution will be dealt with under regulations to be made later on, when, he says, he will consult the local health committee on that point but as regards the discontinuance of an institution which is mentioned here&mdash;a premises&mdash;he mentions holding a local inquiry.  Does that mean just a private inquiry or is it a local public inquiry?</P>

    <P>Deputy Desmond of the Labour Party would have liked to have the professional members of the regional hospital boards nominated by the interests concerned and I said that I was quite determined, at least at the beginning, to appoint them myself as the <Col N="927" /> regional hospital boards are going to do the work of quite a number of sections of my Department in planning and examining the future organisation of the hospital services over a large area.  I did agree to make it optional so that the Minister of the day could either, after consultation, appoint his professional members to these boards or he could accept nominations by representative bodies.  I presume he could also do a mixture of the two. That was a compromise made in an undertaking to Deputy Desmond who felt keenly about this and, I think, some other Members.</P>

      <P>In page 23, line 1, to delete &ldquo;17&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;18&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments are the result of considerable discussion in the House. Health boards will elect their own chairmen and vice-chairmen.  This arrangement will not extend to the chairmen of Comhairle na nOspidéal which is the head consultative council for the whole country, or the regional hospital boards.  I intend to appoint the chairmen in these cases.  They are controlling, organisational and advisory bodies taking over work which was very largely being done on central level and it is quite appropriate that the chairmen should be appointed by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 24 and 25 arise from an undertaking given on Committee Stage to change the procedure so that the health board will elect its own chairmen and vice-chairmen, any member who is an officer or servant of the board, being excluded from appointment.  In other words, anybody who is an officer or servant of the board should not be appointed chairman. <Col N="928" /> Amendment No. 24 makes the customary provision that the person in the chair for the election of the chairman or vice-chairman of the board does not have a casting vote.  There are many precedents for that.  All these amendments are a result of the debate in the House.</P>

      <P>The only observation I wish to make on amendment No. 21 is that the Minister decides here to appoint the chairman of the regional health boards, whereas he has been more democratic, shall we say, in his views in regard to the health boards.  I am not quite satisfied with the reasons he has given, that these are high executive functions and that he feels it appropriate that he should nominate the chairmen and vice-chairmen of regional health boards.  I know the Minister has probably made up his mind very definitely about this but I have reservations about the Minister appointing the chairmen.  Some other method of selection might have been more properly utilised.</P>

      <P>I considered this very carefully.  These regional hospital boards will be partly doing in a sort of decentralised way the work of the Department of Health.  They will have extremely important functions of a most complex character.  They will have on them representatives of each of the regional boards so that regional boards will be able to exercise their influence. They will have very important functions trying to integrate the voluntary hospital services and local authority hospital services in so far as they affect those who come under the Health Bill, either in middle income or lower income groups.  They will try to avoid proliferation of appointments of a competitive kind.  They will see how a <Col N="929" /> better out-patient diagnostic service with expert consultants can be afforded and promoted to try to keep people out of hospitals.  They will see how best the whole hospital system can be integrated and, particularly, they will try to draw the consultant hospitals more closely into the field of integration with local authority hospitals.</P>
      <P>They will have the power actually to employ consultants and the expenses will be recouped by the voluntary hospitals in so far as a consultant works for a voluntary hospital and by the local authority so far as he is employed by the local authority.  In view of that and of the great complexity involved I thought it quite reasonable that I should appoint the chairman of the hospital boards and of Comhairle na nOspidéal which will start to regulate the appointment of consultants all over the country.  It is only reasonable that the Minister should appoint chairmen of boards of this kind.  There are a great many examples but I shall not bore the House by giving them.  I did agree that the Chairmen of the county committees, the advisory committees and of the health boards should be appointed by the boards themselves.</P>

Quite a number of Deputies made the point that the home-help service provided might include the case of a widow who would be unable to work unless her children could be looked after during the day.  The amendment makes two definite changes.  It makes clear that a woman receiving maternity services or dependants of such a woman will be clearly within the categories covered by the section and also by the new paragraph.  The section states more clearly that home help service can be given for the purpose of keeping a person out of an institution. That covers the point made by Deputy Ryan and by Deputies on this side at the same time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to thank Deputies on all sides of the House for the very constructive debate we had on Committee Stage.  It was conducted at the very highest level.  Opposition Deputies are perfectly entitled to criticise the ambit of the Bill but when it came down to detail we made very good progress on what is a very complicated piece of legislation.  I want to go into some matters which were raised during Committee Stage and about which I cannot take any action specifically in the form of amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Clinton made a suggestion whereby local authorities appointing members to a health board could be allowed to agree on the allocation of local contributions between them, on the understanding that if they failed to agree this would be decided by an arbitrator appointed by the Minister. I consulted the Minister for Local Government who said, that if the constituent local authorities were able to agree on a reasonable basis for allocating local contributions, there would be much to be said for letting them do so.  However, I would draw <Col N="933" /> the attention of the House to paragraph 117 of the White Paper on the Health Services which envisaged that a formula would be worked out to provide for a more equitable distribution of the burden of health rates between local authorities.  This principle would have to be sacrificed, at least in part, if the suggestion made by Deputies Dockrell and Clinton were adopted in full.  I am going to think about this before the Seanad meets to see whether I could not devise some kind of formula which could be revoked in part or in whole if the Minister for Local Government decided to carry out an equalisation plan.  Deputies will realise that, if we reached finality in this, by then the obviously agreed sharing of contributions between the different constituents could hardly be carried out in a simple way and there might have to be some special formula.  I will consider this before the Seanad meets because the idea is a good one.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised questions about whether I could possibly dictate the kind of treatment of any patient and the legal adviser tells me that I could not possibly do this.  I now have something good to tell the House.  Many Deputies asked that the administration of home assistance should be administered by the health boards and not by the local authorities and a number of excellent observations were made by Deputies Burke, Clinton, Dockrell and Ryan and others that under modern conditions the paying of home assistance is ultimately linked with the operation of the health services; people come out of hospital and they have to be given assistance when they return home and there must be an absolutely clear co-ordinating link, particularly in the case of a great institution such as the Eastern Regional Health Board will be.  I am glad to say that I have the agreement of the Minister for Social Welfare that it is highly desirable that the operation of this service should be co-ordinated with the services of the health boards.  I want to make it clear, however, that we could not have the position that the health board would have a free hand in deciding the amount of money to <Col N="934" /> be expended on home assistance, seeing that the local authority will have to foot the entire bill for home assistance as distinct from health expenditure until, and if, there is any other change made as a result of the Minister for Social Welfare conducting a general inquiry into the operation of all the assistance services.  As a result it is intended to propose to the local authorities throughout the country that they and the health boards should make arrangements under section 24 so that the boards would deal with the administration of home assistance on behalf of the local authorities.  In this way the authorities would retain budgetary control on the amounts spent.  This is the most satisfactory approach to the problem in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I do not want to bring in a provision compelling local authorities to transfer their functions relating to this local service to health boards but if later it appeared that there was a reluctance by local authorities to co-operate with the health boards, and this was causing considerable difficulty, I would have no hesitation in bringing in a short Bill to rectify the matter. In other words, if the local authority and the home assistance officers simply refused to co-ordinate with very great care with all the health services operated by the regional health board I would certainly bring in a short Bill to rectify the matter.</P>
    <P>I hope all the health authorities will take advantage of section 24 which quite clearly states that they are entitled to delegate authority.  I am glad to say that the Minister for Local Government will give his consent to this. That solves the problem of Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation and so on, whose representatives spoke to me about this.</P>

      <P>Another suggestion made by some speakers was that I <Col N="935" /> should enforce the provision for a great number of information officers. Section 99 of the Health Act, 1947, will remain in force and will apply to health boards.  I do not think it is necessary to impose an obligation on the boards to provide information officers because I believe that by the time the health boards get going, and as we go on in this modern age, the matter of communications is going to be considered so important that I do not believe there will be any difficulty in arranging for the provision of information officers, perhaps first of all in one town and later on an expanded basis.  I want to make it clear that the first appointments of chief executive officers will no doubt take place through the Local Appointments Commission. There is a lot of talk about this and I want to give an absolute assurance that this will be the case.</P>

Surely, in that time, they would have the opportunity either of agreeing or disagreeing with my amendment?  I think it is true to say that the Standing Orders of this House are defective in relation to the tabling of amendments having regard to the fact that the Chair has to rely on precedent rather than on Standing Orders.

      <P>I should like to bring to the attention of the House that the Fine Gael motion is superfluous in many ways in the light of what has already been done.  Sections 59 and 60 of the Health Bill, which is now almost through this House, deal with home nursing and home-help services.  If Fine Gael had done their homework they would have realised that this motion was unnecessary. I would remind the Fine Gael movers of the motion that legislation will have to be introduced to bring about this situation.  In the city and county of Dublin a first-rate home-help and home nursing service has been in train for a considerable length of time.</P>
      <P>It is important to pay tribute to all those organisations who involve themselves in this type of social activity. Now it has been enshrined in legislation and, if the Fine Gael Party had their wits about them, they would know that the Fianna Fáil Party are providing for the very things called for in their motion.  There is no Standing Order which deals with superfluities. However, that is another day's work.</P>
      <P>In relation to the contributions that have been made over the years for the non-contributory old age and blind pensions, there has been a lot of criticism of the lack of finance made available for those people by the proposer and seconder of this motion.  In fact, since 1957 there has been an increase of almost 150 per cent in the amounts given to this social security class.  For the information of the House, and for the record, I should like to back up this point by giving the actual figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Non-contributory old age and blind pensions: as from May, 1957, 25/-; as from August, 1959, 27/6; as from August, 1960, 28/6; as from August, 1961, 30/-; as from August, 1962, 32/6; <Col N="939" /> as from November, 1963, 35/-; as from November, 1964, 37/6; as from August, 1965, 47/6; as from November, 1966, 52/6; as from August, 1967, 57/6; as from August, 1968, 65/-; as from August, 1969, 75/-.  This, in fact, represents an increase of just under 150 per cent from 1957 to 1969 in terms of increases given to this particular social welfare class.</P>
    <P>This includes dependants also.  If I may read again for the benefit of the Fine Gael Party who made the suggestion that we on this side of the House are not concerned with this type of individual, or these types of individuals, as from November, 1964, a pensioner with one or two children received 10/-, and so on, up to the present when they now receive 12/6.  Also the situation in relation to the increase for each child in excess of two is 5/- up to 7/6.  These are all areas where we are very well aware of our obligations in relation to the accusations made against us by the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that we are satisfied with the moneys given to these people.  I should like to be able to go to an old age pensioner in the morning and say: &ldquo;Right.  You will get £10 or £20 a week as from now.&rdquo; I am sure this is what we all wish, but the problem is the availability of cash.  The considerable increases that have been given certainly show this awareness of which I speak.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the Labour Party should be absent from a debate with such a high social content as the debate on motion and our proposed amendment.  When they were putting down this motion, the Fine Gael Party neglected to take note of the substantial improvements in recent years, which I have outlined, in the rates of the non-contributory old age pensions and the granting of additional benefits such as free travel, free radio and television licences and free electricity. Indeed, we urge the Government to continue giving increases to social welfare recipients of all kinds and of all classes.</P>
    <P>That is the reason we put down our amendment which was not accepted by the House on the grounds outlined <Col N="940" /> by the Chair.  The Chair was within the rules of the House and we must accept that.  Maybe we will change the rules with the help of the Committee which deals with the rules of this House.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of free television I often feel that the manufacturers of television sets&mdash;the big companies and so on&mdash;have an obligation when they get old sets back to consider repairing them, instead of breaking them up, making them workable and handing them over to the organisations who look after old people who are possibly living on their own.  These repaired television sets could be given to them.  Company is a great problem for old people, and particularly for people living on their own.  Boredom and lack of friendship are problems which relate to the question of the undesirability of having people living on their own.</P>
    <P>There is definitely a move by various local authorities to have as many old people as possible grouped together in housing schemes on the one hand and, on the other hand, to have old people living with young people in different accommodation.  These are important developments of which the Fine Gael Party do not seem to be aware.  I am sure they are, but apparently they are not.  These are all very important developments which are taking place in relation to this whole question of pensions and of old people living on their own and so forth.</P>
    <P>As one who has some experience of organisations which deal with this question of a home-help and home nursing, I should like to pay particular tribute to them and, in my own constituency, to the Dún Laoghaire Borough Old Folks Association, the Sallynoggin Old Folks Association, the St. Vincent de Paul Society, and other communities which exist in this city of ours.  An organisation which receives very little publicity for the work it does is the Simon Community. I mentioned it in a previous discussion on this motion but I did not have an opportunity to elaborate on the work done by the Simon Community.</P>
    <P>This is a community, Sir, as I am sure you are aware, which is made up <Col N="941" /> of strenuous young people&mdash;and this will disabuse the minds of those who criticise our young people.  There are students, who again come in for a lot of unnecessary and unworthy criticism, civil servants and others.  These people deal with men, and possibly women, who have rejected society due to some problem.  Perhaps there may have been a family split-up or they may not be able to face up to their responsibilities. There are people of that nature.  I may have an opportunity of proposing a motion relating to this very problem in the future.</P>
    <P>This is the problem of those people who are not being catered for in any of the worthy institutions which cater for people who cannot afford to pay regular board.  Members of the Simon Community work between the hours of 11.30 p.m. and 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning, going around this city of ours to try to comfort those people who cannot afford the available accommodation.  It is a sorry tale to have to tell this House that that actually exists in our city.  That is the type of work done by this community. They give these people some sort of succour.  All they can really give them is food and the hope that maybe they will come around the following night to assist them in their hour of need. These are the types of organisations that do a great deal of good in our community in relation to this motion by the Fine Gael Party.  I do not want to continue much further, because I believe the context of the motion is very important; as for the reason it was put down, that is another day's work.  I am sure all Members of this House must agree with it.  Before I sit down I should like to apologise to you, Sir, if in any way I embarrassed you by bringing up this amendment of ours, because you would be the last person I should like to embarrass.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking on the motion of Deputies Richie Ryan, Tom O'Donnell and Mrs. Brigid Hogan O'Higgins regarding the plight of the old age pensioners in the city of Dublin, one must immediately show horror at how naive some of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party can be as regards improvement in recent allowances paid to old age pensioners, as regards the recent allocation of free CIE travel, which had already gone beyond their financial grasp and the provision of free radio and television licences which were also outside their financial grasp.  The provision of free turf would need further analysis.  In order to avail of the free turf, an old age pensioner must make her way to the local post office and part with sixpence for a voucher.  In order to get that turf into her house she must pay a carter in the region of 2/6d, that is if she is lucky enough to find a carter. So the free turf only costs her 3/- a bag.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy aware the health authority provide free transport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is well aware that in exceptional circumstances the health authority will provide this. However, the four main problems besetting old people is in the following order: the facts that they are subjected to the elements of the weather, that they are hungry, that they are suffering from medical diseases of one kind or another, and that they suffer from loneliness.  First of all, the cold, how are we to overcome that?  As Deputy Dowling said, the Dublin Health Authority provide free delivery of turf, but this system does not cover every old age pensioner.  In Chapelizod where there are close on 100 applicants for dispensary delivery, only four people qualified.  This leaves a lot to be desired.  Why should the local authority have to come in, at the expense of the <Col N="943" /> ratepayer, and subsidise an inefficient Government service?  In fact, it is the exorbitant rates in this city of Dublin that has many of these people on the borderline of poverty.</P>
      <P>Therefore we can take it as generally agreed that the free fuel system is not working in this city, that the people for whom the free fuel was intended are not getting it, and those that do get it get it at an exorbitant price.  The net value of the free turf is 8/- out of which they have to pay roughly 3/-.  That is not free.  Many of the people for whom we are providing free radio and television licences, of which the Fianna Fáil Government are so proud, are suffering from diminution of vision and hearing and cannot avail of these instruments anyway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting the Government are giving them a whole lot of things that are not of much use to them, giving them free turf, but they cannot get it, and even if they do get it they have to pay for it, or the Dublin ratepayer has to pay for it, and this is not free.  They are getting free travel because the poor people were not able to pay the CIE fares, which is a further increase due to Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Geoghegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned something which came as quite a shock to me and I should like to have proof of it.  He said that the people who are entitled to the free fuel are not getting it.  Is the Deputy making a charge against the local authorities or the people who deliver it, that it is being given to somebody else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary would want to check what I said.  I am not going to spend time repeating it.  I said they have extreme difficulty in obtaining free fuel and, even if they obtain it, as Deputy Dowling pointed out, only a minority of them are entitled to have it delivered free at the expense of the Dublin Health Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="944" /> There are approximately 60,000 people in the city of Dublin who are living on their own and who are unable to exist without assistance.  These people are in the old age pensioner bracket.  Meals are provided entirely by local ladies committees.  There is no official set-up whereby these people can get daily nourishment.  As a result of this, we have in this country the highest mental hospitalisation rate in Europe; over 7.6 per cent of our population are in mental hospitals and a large section of these are elderly people who are suffering from malnutrition because the allowances paid by the Government are inadequate to provide them with sufficient food and sufficient protein and vitamins for normal brain function.  They become prematurely senile and are sent by their relatives or the people in the area into mental hospitals or county homes.  Even the health authority assistance is more than the Fianna Fáil pension allowance.  Nobody in the backbenches of Fianna Fáil can deny a word of this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference has also been made to the fact that there is very little money available for these people.  One only has to understand elementary cost accountancy to realise that it would cost less to keep these people at home and provide the home-help service, the public health officer and the meals-on-wheels service than it does to keep them in the hospital institutions to which they are forced to go due to the circumstances in which they are <Col N="945" /> forced to live by the Fianna Fáil Government. Section 59 of the Health Act provides some means of nursing of elderly people at home.</P>
      <P>One very active Dublin doctor who works with elderly people has noticed that the shunting around of old people from one area to another results in an increased incidence in the death of these people.  I would suggest that chalets for these old people be built in the areas with which they are familiar.</P>

      <P>The doctor concerned is Dr. Dan O'Brien of the Summerhill dispensary.  His observations were reported in the <i>Evening Herald</i> some time ago.  His practice consists to a large extent of old age pensioners.</P>
      <P>Allegations have been made that when this motion was being moved there were no Deputies on the Labour benches.  There were Deputies in the Labour benches when this motion began.  Deputy Andrews, who moved the amendment, could not even quote properly from it: he mentioned free electricity but I can see no mention of free electricity in the amendment. He spent nine minutes discussing something which the Chair ruled out of order after a couple of minutes.  Is it any wonder the Labour Party got up and left the House in disgust?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am trying to point out that many of the things which have been made available to these people are of no use to them.  It has been said that they were given free travel, but I should like to know how many of them are even able to leave their own homes, let alone avail of this free travel.  The Government cannot claim credit for bringing a Utopia to old age pensioners.  They claim that they have alleviated the suffering of old <Col N="946" /> age pensioners by giving them free travel, which many of them cannot use; by giving them free radio licences, but many of them cannot hear; by giving them free television, but many of them cannot see.  They can all eat and I should like to know why they are not given enough money to buy sufficient food.  We have enough money to put into the foreign industries which are mushrooming up and collapsing but we are unable to give our old age pensioners a realistic amount of money on which to live in order to keep them out of the mental hospitals to which they are being driven.  The Fine Gael Party recommended, and the Minister for Health has rightly accepted, provisions for home help, public nursing and meals-on-wheels.</P>

At that stage, there had been one Opposition speaker from the Fine Gael Party following the previous Fianna Fáil speaker.

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for further capital advances to CIE and for payment to the Board of non-repayable grants in respect of the amount by which the board's subvention was inadequate during the five year period ended 31st March, 1969. I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take with the Bill the motion on the Order Paper in relation to the Transport Act 1964 (Section 6) Order, 1969, the purpose of which is to increase the amount of the annual grant paid to CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Transport Act, 1964, provided for payment to CIE from 1st April, 1964 of an annual grant of £2 million, with the aid of which the board was required to break even taking one year with another.  The Act provided that the amount of the subvention might be varied in the financial year commencing on 1st April, 1969, and in every fifth subsequent financial year, by order made by me with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance and subject to prior approval of each House of the Oireachtas.  The Act also made provision for payment to the board by the Exchequer of capital advances not exceeding in the aggregate £6 million. It was estimated that this sum would, in addition to the moneys available <Col N="972" /> from the board's depreciation provisions and other internal resources, be sufficient to meet CIE's capital requirements for the five year period ended 31st March, 1969.</P>
    <P>The 1964 Act was based on the Government decision, announced by my predecessor during the course of his Second Stage speech on the Transport Bill, 1964, to continue to preserve the railway system subject to such further concentration and reorganisation as might be found practicable and desirable. The Government recognised that CIE could never become a viable organisation so long as the board was required to provide a widespread rail system.  It was, however, accepted that while a complete changeover to road transport could possibly yield a public transport system which would carry on without operating losses, the enormous capital required and the very heavy staff redundancy would be such as to outweigh the advantages.  The Government also took into account the fact that the railway represents a vast national investment and offers advantages, not alone for tourist and peak traffics, but particularly for certain bulk freight traffics.</P>
    <P>The annual subvention of £2 million was intended to be a realistic estimate of the minimum subsidy with which CIE could get by on the basis of effective management and increased efficiency and productivity.  The object was to set a difficult but not discouraging target and to provide an incentive to efficiency and economy.  In the event CIE's total losses during the five year period exceeded the board's total subvention of £10 million in that period by only £542,460.  In the context of the board's scale of operations&mdash;its turnover in 1968-69 exceeded £31 million &mdash;and of the growing difficulties which beset public transport everywhere, this is a very slight divergence from the target set five years ago.  Over the five year period there has been a sharp growth in productivity in CIE and improvement in management throughout the enterprise.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the Bill itself and with the order, I propose to review briefly the results of the various sectors of CIE over the past five years.  Except <Col N="973" /> for 1968-69, CIE's net losses have been steadily growing, having increased from £1.475 million in 1964-65 to £2.48 million in 1967-68, before dropping to £1.961 million in 1968-69. An increase in revenue, due to increased fares and rates and additional business, partly offset by an increase in expenditure, was responsible for the reduction of £519,000 in the board's net deficit for 1968-69 compared with the previous year.</P>
    <P>The excess of £542,460 over the five year period can be attributed mainly to increases in labour and other costs.  CIE is a labour intensive industry and labour costs account for about 65 per cent of the board's total operating expenditure.  Over the past five years, CIE's total operating costs increased by 44 per cent.  During the same period the additional annual cost of wage and salary increases, reductions in working hours and other improvements in conditions of service for CIE employees represented an increase of approximately 54 per cent on the level of the board's labour costs in 1963.  Some of the additional costs incurred over the five year period were offset by additional business secured by the board totalling over £6½ million and by an increase of about 13 per cent in productivity; the balance had to be met as far as possible by increases in fares and rates.</P>
    <P>Excluding financial charges which, by arrangement with CIE, were allocated for the first time to the various working accounts in the board's accounts for 1968-69, losses on railway working rose from £1.229 million in 1964-65 to £2.143 million in 1968-69. Rising costs absorbed not only increases in fares and rates but also economies and increased productivity achieved by the board.  Over the five year period rail passenger traffic was well maintained.  In an effort to increase this traffic, CIE have introduced a wide range of concessionary fares, faster trains and an intensive campaign to attract more commuters to the suburban rail services.  Rail freight tonnage increased by 34 per cent; the increase was due largely to the growth in bulk traffic, such as cement, oil and <Col N="974" /> minerals, which more than trebled over the period.</P>
    <P>Special container terminal installations have been provided at Cork. Limerick and Dublin for use in connection with new fast liner train services for container loads introduced this year between Dublin and Cork, Dublin and Limerick and Dublin and Waterford.</P>
    <P>Since 1964, 126 miles of railway line have been closed by CIE, reducing the railway at 31st March, 1969, to 1,333 miles of first track.  In addition, 69 stations and halts were closed.  New railway extensions or sidings have been provided at Silvermines and Foynes to handle new minerals traffic, at Arklow for fertilisers and at Oranmore for oil products.  Another extension railway is at present being provided at Ballinacourty, County Waterford, to serve the new factory which is being established there for the processing of dolomite into magnesite.  The average length of haul of rail freight traffic increased from 86.6 miles in 1964-65 to 101.3 miles in 1968-69, thus reflecting the value of the railway for long distance haulage, particularly of bulk traffics It is also of interest that the average length of passenger journey by rail increased from 35.8 miles in 1964-65 to 37.1 miles in 1968-69.</P>
    <P>There has been a significant improvement in the operating surpluses on the board's road passenger services taken as a whole, although the Dublin city services are now less remunerative than in former years, the operating surplus on these services having fallen from £389,000 in 1964-65 to £264,000 in 1967-68 before improving to £354,000 in 1968-69.  This is due not only to the impact of increased costs but also to a steady decline in the number of passengers using the Dublin city services. An adverse factor is the ever increasing problem of traffic congestion, now estimated to cost CIE £250,000 per annum.  On the other hand, the operating surplus on the board's provincial road passenger services, including tours and private hire, increased from £271,000 in 1964-65 to £941,000 in 1968-69.  During the same period the total number of passengers carried on these services increased from 60.5 million to 78.4 million; a large part of <Col N="975" /> this increase is attributable to the operation by CIE of the free schools transport scheme and to the increase in the board's coach tour operations. Revenue from coach tour business increased from £218,000 in 1963-64 to £730,000 in 1968-69 and CIE's target is to achieve a 20 per cent annual increase in this business.</P>
    <P>Despite a decrease in the total tonnage carried by the board's road freight services over the five year period, the operating surplus on road freight working increased from £45,000 in 1964-65 to £227,000 in 1968-69, the impact of rising costs having been offset by increases in rates and by economies in operation.  I understand from CIE that the increased profitability on road freight working can be largely attributed to a reorganisation carried out by the board in 1965 of its road freight organisation.</P>
    <P>The CIE hotels and catering services continue to be profitable, the operating surplus having increased from £145,000 in 1964-65 to £234,000 in 1968-69.  There has been an increase in the operating losses on canals and vessels&mdash;from £58,000 in 1964-65 to £100,000 in 1968-69.  At the request of my predecessor, CIE chartered a second vessel, the &ldquo;Galway Bay&rdquo;, to help in coping with peak tourist traffic between Galway and the Aran Islands during the summer months of this year and I am delighted to be able to tell you that this traffic increased from 14,795 passengers in 1968 to 18,511 in 1969.</P>
    <P>Total capital expenditure by CIE during the five year period amounted to £17.785 million, of which £10.94 million was met from the board's depreciation provisions and other internal resources and £6 million by way of capital advances under section 4(1) of the Transport Act, 1964.  There was a balance of £844,664 which was met by temporary borrowing.  The £6 million provision in the 1964 Act would have been adequate for the five year period were it not for the necessity for CIE to provide additional buses for the free school transport scheme in the two years 1967-68 and 1968-69; in consequence, the £6 million provision was inadequate to the extent of £844,664.  In addition to the board's <Col N="976" /> normal capital programme, CIE, at the request of my predecessor, incurred capital expenditure amounting to £237,596 up to 31st March, 1969 on the provision of car ferry facilities at Rosslare Harbour.</P>
    <P>Nothing has happened since 1964 which would suggest that any change is necessary in the Government decision taken at that time to preserve the railway subject to such further concentration and reorganisation as might prove practicable and desirable.  CIE are satisfied that, for the present at any rate, the railway has been pruned to the optimum size and that further concentration would not reduce losses.  The problem of the viability of the railway is common to all European countries and has been faced more realistically here than in most other countries. There is no ready solution but it is quite clear that the railway can never be operated without State assistance. The problem is to contain losses to the minimum consistent with securing the most economic and efficient overall transport system within the national economy.</P>
    <P>The railway plays an important role in the social and economic life of the country and will continue to do so. Railway operations will be aimed at providing high standards of passenger travel and, by exploiting its advantages for speed, safety and comfort, CIE will aim at expanding rail passenger traffic.  More express passenger services will be introduced between major provincial centres and Dublin CIE will continue their campaign to attract more commuters to the suburban rail services with a view to ensuring that those services will be utilised as effectively as possible and to provide the maximum contribution to the relief of traffic congestion in Dublin city.  The board will continue to improve the layout and decor of stations and will provide car parks at stations where necessary and feasible.</P>
    <P>On the rail freight side, the board will equip itself to take full advantage of the recent development of container traffic.  Railheads will be developed to take advantage of the economies of unit loads and groupage facilities.  In this connection, the board in conjunction with some of its major customers, <Col N="977" /> the fertiliser manufacturers, has tackled the problem arising from the need to equate all the year round production to seasonal consumption.  Large, mechanically equipped storage areas are being provided at railway stations adjacent to major areas of seasonal fertiliser demand.  The fertilisers will be moved in bulk into these storage areas and will then be delivered to local consumers as required.  To keep pace with the growth in container traffic, more liner trains will be provided; the board's ultimate plan is to provide a national network of liner trains.</P>
    <P>The board proposes to expand road freight traffic in specialised operational fields and standards of equipment and of service will be improved.  CIE's principal aims with the road passenger services will be to improve standards of comfort and service.  Every effort will be made by the board to improve the Dublin city bus services which are at present operating under very difficult conditions, which have affected not only the cost but also the quality of the services.  Many new buses of the most modern type will replace buses which are at present over age.  The board will continue to use modern devices such as closed circuit television and short wave radio to try to keep the buses moving in difficult traffic conditions. More express and limited stop bus services will be provided throughout the country.  Special efforts will be made to expand coach tour operations; about 75 per cent of CIE's coach tour business comes from North America and with a view to increasing this busines, the board has established sales offices in New York and Los Angeles and proposes to open another office in Chicago.</P>
    <P>The Bill further provides for Exchequer capital advances of £11 million to CIE of which £1.08 million is already due to the board in respect of the amount by which the £6 million provision in the 1964 Act was inadequate during the five year period ended 31st March, 1969.  This sum comprises £844,664 in respect of the excess of capital expenditure&mdash;caused by the school bus programme&mdash;over funds available plus £237,596 in respect of the provision of car ferry facilities at <Col N="978" /> Rosslare Harbour.  The balance of the £11 million, that is £9.92 million, together with the board's depreciation provisions, will be available to meet future capital expenditure by the board. CIE's capital expenditure will be related mainly to the replacement of road and rail vehicles, the provision of school buses, the modernisation and improvement of equipment and premises and the improvement of staff amenities.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for payment to CIE of non-repayable grants not exceeding in the aggregate £642,460 in respect of the amount by which the board's subvention was inadequate during the five year period ended 31st March, 1969.  This sum is made up of £542,460 in respect of the amount by which the board's total deficits during the period exceeded the total subvention paid by the Exchequer and £100,000 in respect of provision made by the board in 1964-65 and 1965-66 for redemption of its 2½ per cent and 3 per cent transport stocks, which was shown separately in the board's accounts but was not taken into account in arriving at the net deficits for those years.</P>
    <P>The draft order provides for an annual grant of £2,650,000 for CIE which will be the level of subsidy for the five year period 1969-70 to 1973-74 and which, in accordance with the terms of section 6 (2) of the Transport Act, 1964, may be varied, if necessary, in the financial year commencing 1st April, 1974.  This represents an increase of £650,000 on the board's existing annual grant.  The new grant has been determined in the light of estimates of the board's revenue deficits for the five year period 1969-70 to 1973-74.  I should mention that these estimates exclude the profits of Ostlanna Iompair Éireann, the CIE hotels subsidiary, as these profits are retained by the company to help to finance its capital expenditure.  As in 1964, the annual grant has been fixed at a level which should provide the board, management and staff of CIE with a difficult but realistic target, the achievement of which will call for continued effort and initiative.  I have every confidence that these will be provided.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="979" /> I am satisfied that the formula adopted in the 1964 Act has worked well and has provided the board with a useful incentive to efficiency and economy.  A further step in this direction during the past five years has been to ensure that the non-commercial cost of services provided by CIE are quantified as accurately as possible and charged to appropriate sources; thus the cost of the free transport scheme for school children is settled directly between CIE and the Department of Education and is defrayed from that Department's Vote.  Similarly, the cost of free travel for old age pensioners is borne by the Department of Social Welfare and for old IRA men by the Department of Defence.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill and the draft order to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my regret at the indisposition of the Minister for Transport and Power and my wishes that he will be fully recovered very shortly.  He has a very good deputy in the person of Deputy Childers, Minister for Health, who has presented many transport Bills to this House on previous occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Transport Bill of 1969 is another chapter in the history of public transport in this country.  The Minister's speech&mdash;and I am sure he will agree with me&mdash;indicated the remarkable change which has taken place in the Government's attitude in relation to our national transport system.  From the 1930s until comparatively recently the basic philosophy in relation to public transport was dominated by the break-even concept.  We were obsessed with the idea that CIE had to pay for itself, but in 1964 we had the first change of heart on the part of the Government.  I think this change of heart was due to the publication of the Pacemaker Report in October 1963.  I believe that report had a profound effect on Government thinking.  During the last few days when reading the Pacemaker Report and past debates on the Transport Bill I noticed that many of the suggestions made by Deputies over the years were borne out by the Pacemaker Report.  Many of the views <Col N="980" /> expressed by Patrick McGilligan are to be found in the Pacemaker Report. It would be remiss of me not to pay tribute to the people responsible for compiling the Pacemaker Report.  I have said that I have studied it, but I think the Minister will agree with me that it would take a very long time to digest it.</P>
    <P>In the 1964 report we had the first admission from the Government, of something which had been accepted by many people outside this House, that our public transport system, the railway sector in particular, could never be expected to pay its way.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see in the Minister's speech that the change of attitude which took place in 1964 is borne out in the 1969 Act.  If we want to maintain our public transport system, we will have to be prepared to subsidise. The most significant paragraph in the Minister's speech is that which states:</P>
    <P>Nothing has happened since 1964 which would suggest that any change is necessary in the Government decision taken at that time to preserve the railway system subject to such further concentration and reorganisation as might prove practicable and desirable.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy M.P. Murphy will be commenting on this.  I was reading the previous debates on this matter and he was at that time very vocal on the subject of railway closures.  We have now this remarkable statement in the Minister's speech.  It is a statement which will be welcomed by many Deputies on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>CIE are satisfied that, for the present at any rate, the railway has been pruned to the optimum size and that further concentration would not reduce losses.</P>
    <P>We have come apparently to the end of the policy of wholesale closure of branch lines.  The figures over the last five years certainly do not indicate any need for any further closures and, if there were any attempt to close the few remaining branch lines, we would have no railway system at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes the point that the railway &ldquo;plays an important role <Col N="981" /> in the social and economic life of the country and will continue to do so.&rdquo; Now that our discussion on transport has been, as it were, lifted out of the realm of controversy, I would hope that we might in the course of this debate look at the particular problems in relation to public transport and try to assess the prospects of the development of our transport system in the future.  I regret that the Minister's brief was not somewhat more discursive.  I thought the Minister would have availed of this opportunity to examine the problem in some depth in order to formulate a realistic transport policy for the future. He did make mention, somewhat casually, of certain very important factors.</P>
    <P>Transport is vital in the future economic development and social progress of our country.  One of the things I discovered as a result of my recent studies was that it is virtually impossible to form a balanced judgment about the future of public transport here.  The reason why it is impossible is because there is very little statistical information available.  In 1963 the Central Statistics Office undertook a survey and very valuable figures were produced. <i>Pacemaker</i> is the most valuable report on public transport.  It is the only real study in depth of many of the problems confronting our transport system.  <i>Pacemaker</i> was the first real breakthrough in getting to grips with many of the problems of our transport system, problems discussed here and elsewhere for many years.  Many of the opinions expressed were based on fallacies rather than on facts.</P>
    <P>Because of the lack of factual information in the past CIE had a very bad image in the public eye.  The lack of good public relations was commented on by many people.  So was the cost to the taxpayer of maintaining CIE.  I am glad to note that in recent times there has been a changing attitude in this regard.  This may be due to the fact that CIE seem to have improved their public relations department. There are signs now of an end to the double-thinking that went on for so long, double-thinking in the sense that we expected our transport system <Col N="982" /> to be economic while it was, at the same time, serving as a public utility and, from that point of view, could not possibly be profitable.  I welcome the changed public opinion.  Anyone who reads the little booklet containing the résumé of the progress CIE have made since 1964 cannot but be impressed by the progress made in practically all sectors.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to re-emphasise certain basic facts.  The Minister referred to some of these in a rather general way. The Minister admitted in 1964 that the prospects of making CIE pay their way were nil.  He repeated that tonight. Having studied the returns over the last five years in even greater detail than they appear in this little booklet, it seems to me that the real problem of public transport is the problem of the railways.  I think it is now realised that the railways can never operate economically and, if we are to maintain the railways, we must be prepared to subsidise them.  This is not just a characteristic of our railway system. It is a problem common to every western European country.</P>
    <P>I have examined the financial returns from most European countries. I am pleased to say that the performance of CIE compares favourably with that of most and more than favourably with that of some.  This is a tribute to the board, management and workers of the national transport system.  Some of the returns from countries which we would regard as the more advanced, more progressive and highly industrialised in western Europe show that the operating losses on many of the railway systems are far greater than is the case with CIE.  By European standards, therefore, CIE is performing quite well in relation to the operation of the railway system.</P>
    <P>There is an important point here that is worth mentioning.  While we admit that the railway section of CIE can never pay its way, this must not mean that we in the House would encourage a complacent attitude on the part of the board, management, staff and workers of CIE.  We recognise the difficulties in regard to the railway system and are prepared to subsidise that system but there is a continuing obligation on all concerned <Col N="983" /> with the operations of CIE to maintain in the future the high level of efficiency which has characterised their work in recent years.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note from my study of the working of CIE that in recent years greater emphasis has been laid on productivity and that many modern techniques and methods have been introduced, such as, for example, work study, cost analysis, and so on.  In this age of technology and high-powered business it is vitally essential that the national transport system in all its sectors should utilise to the fullest possible extent modern business methods.  CIE are doing a good job, particularly in the problem sector, the railways, and that fact should be recognised.</P>
    <P>While we recognise the need for subvention in the future, and are prepared to vote the necessary funds, there is an obligation on the Minister and the Government and on all sides of this House to be clear as to the reasons for continued subvention of CIE.  As I have said, the problem is the railways.  From the economic and social aspects, are we right in trying to maintain the railway system?  As one who is interested in economic development, who has had some experience in promoting industrial development, I am convinced that a railway system is an essential part of the infrastructure in any modern State.  In a recent debate on the Industrial Development Authority Bill the question of infrastructure was referred to as being of importance. Since then I have taken the trouble to study the Buchanan Report in relation to industrial development. Buchanan emphasises the importance of transport in relation to industrial development.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect also of a railway system which it is well to bear in mind.  I am very conscious of this aspect because of development taking place in the constituency which I have the honour to represent.  I refer to developments in mining at Silvermines. I have been very impressed by the manner in which the newly constructed railway line linking Silvermines with Foynes has been utilised in hauling <Col N="984" /> iron ore.  With the further development of mining and with the possible establishment of a smelter plant in this country there will be increasing demand for this type of haulage for which railways are ideally suited.</P>
    <P>A railway system is necessary for a number of other reasons.  It is a very useful means of long distance passenger travel.  The figures produced over the past five years indicate that people are utilising the railways for long distance travel to an increasing extent.  I have travelled by rail in Europe and in Great Britain.  I believe that our main line passenger train service compares very favourably with those in other countries and in many ways are more comfortable.</P>
    <P>On previous occasions when we were debating transport I advocated the introduction of special weekend fares for the reason that with the introduction of the five-day week people from rural areas who were working in Dublin would be anxious to return home for the weekend.  I understand that cheap weekend fares, return fare at the cost of single fare, have been in operation once a fortnight for some time.  I was at Heuston Station recently on a Friday evening when that weekend fare was in operation and the volume of traffic was colossal.</P>
    <P>There are other ways in which greater traffic has been generated on the passenger train system.  Educational tours to Dublin, one-day excursions and special weekend excursions and other means can be found to increase the number of passengers travelling by train.  The railway system carries a considerable number of tourists although with the advent of the car ferry and increased mobility of tourists and particularly with the increase in popularity of motoring holidays, I do not think we can expect very much increase in tourist passenger traffic on the railways.</P>
    <P>Certain studies have been carried out in recent times in regard to freight transport, rail and road, and these have shown that 80 per cent of all freight haulage in this country is operated by own-account vehicles by commercial firms and others who own their own fleets.  Only a small proportion <Col N="985" /> of the total freight haulage business utilises the national transport system.  You also have the system of licensed hauliers and, while on that point, I may mention that changes are now pending in the new Transport Bill which will have the effect of liberalising road haulage particularly in relation to livestock, etc.  Undoubtedly, this will affect CIE road freight and workers in the CIE road freight section have already begun to express concern about the advent of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I have here a copy of a resolution passed by the Waterford Council of Trade Unions recently in which the council called on Dáil representatives to oppose vigorously the proposed legislation regarding liberalisation of road haulage which the Minister intends to introduce before the end of the year, because such legislation would result in redundancy in the CIE road freight depot at Waterford where 100 workers are employed and would also affect depot maintenance and rail workers.  I was handed that letter just before the debate began and had not time to examine it carefully or consider the implications of the resolution in relation to impending transport legislation or to this Bill we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>In previous transport legislation, particularly in the case of the 1964 Act, because of the closure of railway lines and reorganisation and so on, redundancy was anticipated and provision was made to cover redundancy payments.  There is no mention of redundancy in the present Bill or in the Minister's speech.  I understand that the Estimate for Transport and Power will be introduced in the near future and, perhaps, I shall have an opportunity of discussing this aspect of the matter which I think the Minister should bear in mind.</P>
    <P>The liberalisation proposed in the new Road Transport Bill, even though it may affect CIE, is being introduced by the Minister after long and consistent demand for such liberalisation particularly in regard to livestock haulage. My first reaction is that I do not think this liberalisation of road transport, as intended by the Minister, will have the disastrous results that are forecast for <Col N="986" /> the road freight section of CIE.  It is only natural that workers worry about their employment.  Perhaps, the matter of redundancy compensation might be more appropriate to the Transport Estimate when we come to consider it. In view of the fact that we are now voting additional funds to CIE to subsidise the national transport system in the future, I am surprised that no reference has been made to any likely development, particularly in the road freight section, which might entail redundancy. Perhaps, the Minister in replying will be good enough to throw some light on this matter if only to quell the fears of workers in the road freight section.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister states that he is satisfied that the formula adopted in the 1964 Act has worked well and provided the board with a useful incentive to efficiency and economy.  I have already commented on that and I think CIE have performed very well but it is in the following sentence that I am really interested. He said that &ldquo;A further step in this direction during the past five years has been to ensure that the non-commercial costs of services&rdquo;&mdash;that is an expression I have never before heard or seen in any work on transport&mdash;&ldquo;provided by CIE are quantified as accurately as possible and charged to appropriate sources.&rdquo; If this is the first step in what has come to be known as the normalisation of accounts I would welcome it very much because one of the points made in the Pacemaker Report, which is relevant to the present discussion, is that in considering CIE's financial position one must take into account the extent to which social service activities influence its performance.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, under the present system by which CIE present their annual accounts the public get no clear indication of the extent to which the company's services are social instead of economic.  If the Minister's statement is an indication that CIE are taking a first step towards normalising accounts it is a step in the right direction. Because of the way CIE accounts have been presented hitherto the impression has been, and can be conveyed, that CIE should be making money but <Col N="987" /> through some shortcomings of its own it has not been doing so.</P>
    <P>I am convinced by the Pacemaker Report and other studies of public transport that a change in the system of presenting annual accounts is absolutely necessary and I urge on the Minister the desirability of doing something towards that end.  I should be grateful if, when replying, he would comment on this problem and elaborate further on his statement in relation to the non-commercial costs of services provided by CIE which he mentioned. The annual reports and returns furnished by CIE up to now are the usual type of commercial returns we get from manufacturing or trading concerns. Because of the manner in which the accounts are presented it is very difficult for Members of the House and for the public to pinpoint those features of the national transport service system which are in fact social services.  We have recognised the fact that CIE will have to be subsidised in the future because some of the services are not economically justifiable but are socially desirable because they serve a community need.</P>
    <P>It is most unfair to the board, the management and workers of CIE that accounts are not furnished in a manner which would enable us clearly to see the parts of the system which are commercially viable and those which are not but which are being maintained because they are serving community needs.  The presentation of the annual accounts of the transport system so that they will clearly show the need sector, as it is known, has been adopted by many western European countries, which have, to a certain degree, normalised their accounts.  Actually <i>Pacemaker</i> goes into this question of the presentation of CIE's accounts in great detail and it states that the present form of presenting the annual report of the working of the company is to be compared with a conventional departmental profit and loss account of a manufacturing or trading organisation. If that is the case, of course, we cannot obtain a true picture of CIE's performance.</P>
    <P>I have here a very detailed study of <Col N="988" /> the financial background of CIE which was published in the 1968 winter issue of <i>Administration</i> and which was devoted to an analysis of the affairs of Córas Iompair Éireann.  In an article entitled &ldquo;The Financial Background&rdquo; by Mr. B.M. O'Farrell, who I understand is the financial controller of CIE, it is stated that:</P>
    <P>Whatever form of calculating the amount of State assistance of CIE is eventually adopted it would be fairer to the company and to those who serve it that it should be based on some concept more scientific than the one implemented in legislation up to and including 1964 Transport Act....</P>
    <P>Commenting on the effects of this he said that:</P>
    <P>it seeks to determine the deficits for a five-year period and to allot a fixed annual sum which, taking one year with another, should result in a break-even position.  Under this system the public is given no clear indication of the extent to which the company's services are social instead of economic and the impression likely to be conveyed is that CIE should be making money and is ....failing to do so ...</P>
    <P>What I am saying is not intended to be taken as being said in a critical manner.  I understand that to carry out a complete normalisation of CIE's accounts would be very difficult, if not impossible.  The number of staff and the number of experts in the various fields who would be necessary makes the introduction of complete normalisation absolutely impossible.  However, there is a strong case for partial normalisation. Perhaps the Minister would indicate what is Government thinking in relation to this matter.  It is vitally important and would go a long way towards clearing up the confusion in the minds of many people regarding the subsidising of the national transport system.</P>
    <P>Another important point is that the European Economic Community submitted a proposal to the Council under which the system of normalisation of railway accounts would have to be in operation at the beginning of 1969. <Col N="989" /> Therefore, if we entered the EEC we would have to follow suit and this would rule out the subsidising of CIE by means of a general subsidy.</P>
    <P>Again in <i>Pacemaker</i> on page 39 it states that:</P>
    <P>The normalisation of accounts envisages the payment of public transport operators by the State for providing inherently loss making services in the public interest; even a simplified and modified form of normalised accounts would go a long way towards resolving the incompatibilities of commercial and public service policies in the operation of public transport.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Pacemaker,</i> therefore, seems to recommend a modified form of normalised accounts.  As I said, this is a highly technical matter and I am not an expert on it.  I have to study the views of various people and take European developments into account.  We will have to evolve a transport policy which will be in accordance with the social character of the services which we provide. In the past there has been far too much emphasis, particularly by the Government, and by various Ministers, on the economic aspect of transport but there has been a change of attitude and people now appreciate the social character of the railway system in particular.  We have to convey to the public that the funds we vote to CIE are justifiable and that the social services which CIE are called upon to provide are necessary.</P>
    <P>The social services aspect of CIE has improved greatly.  I have in mind now the free school transport scheme and free transport for old age and blind pensioners.  CIE deserves to be complimented on the tremendous success of these schemes&mdash;schemes, I may say, which had been advocated in this House for many years.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the role of the national transport company in the development of our tourist industry.  In the past four or five years CIE have made an important contribution to the overall development of our tourism.  Their coach tours are very popular with visitors.  The one-day &ldquo;mediaeval&rdquo; tour in the Shannon region has been tremendously successful. <Col N="990" /> There is a growing demand for these tours which supply a much needed service in our tourist industry. Last year, CIE introduced the 21-day tour of Great Britain and Ireland which I understand has been highly successful.</P>
    <P>Over the summer season I have met large numbers of visitors to this country, particularly at Shannon Airport and in Limerick city.  Those who travelled on CIE tours had the highest praise for them and particularly for the driver and the courier.  I asked many visitors what it was that attracted them most in the coach tours They gave the obvious answers about the beautiful scenery and the friendliness of the people but, without exception, the courier and the driver got the greatest part of the praise.  The greatest credit is due to those men for their dedication to their work and for their contribution to the development of our tourist industry.  It is very easy to overlook the human factor when dealing with the operations of a national transport system of the magnitude of CIE and when confronted with a mass of statistics in relation to transport.  However, the services of these men are one aspect which deserve mention.</P>
    <P>In Great Britain, I met some CIE representatives whose job it is to pro mote CIE coach tours among travel agencies and others.  These men are doing a tremendous job.  Some years ago, CIE pioneered what were known as &ldquo;Golden Holidays&rdquo;.  Charter flights were operated between Great Britain and Shannon with a choice of a coach tour or a holiday at Kilkee and so on.  Unfortunately, I understand that that scheme has not been as successful of late as it originally promised Perhaps the Minister would look into the matter and give me particulars about it when he is dealing with the annual Estimate for the Department.</P>
    <P>Since I became a Member of this House in 1961 I have been responsible for two Private Members' Motions on the subject of CIE pensions. Every time a debate on transport arises here, CIE pensions are mentioned. Time and time again Deputies from all sides of the House have <Col N="991" /> pleaded for fair play for our transport pensioners.  When I first became a Member of this House I discovered that 1,049 pensioners were receiving only 12/- a week; that others were receiving pensions of £1 a week and other various sums.  In time, the 12/-a week pension was increased to £1 and the £1 a week pension was increased to 22/6d and, two or three years ago, there was a further improvement but, again, it consisted only of a few shillings.  I appeal to the Minister for Transport and Power to give these old transport pensioners a fair deal.</P>
    <P>A big bone of contention in relation to these miserable pensions has been the fact that, on reaching the age of 70, thus becoming entitled to the old age pension, the CIE pension was slashed.  I remember an argument in this House in that connection.  Time and time again I have outlined the plight of these pensioners.  Recently, at Question Time, the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, indicated that he had received a deputation of CIE pensioners and undertook to study the situation.</P>
    <P>I want to say again, and to say as sincerely as possible, that I believe the older pensioners in CIE are entitled to a fair deal.  I further state that there is no reason in the wide earthly world why these men should not be treated properly.  I remember General Seán MacEoin, one of the most distinguished former Members of this House, during a debate on a Private Members' motion which I moved on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, speaking of some of those transport veterans as men who, in the fight for freedom, rendered Trojan service.  They were very badly treated.  If I remember correctly he also brought out clearly that 40 years before the pensions applicable to some of those grades were higher than they then were.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the absence of any reference to redundancy payments or to the possible need for further redundancy compensation in CIE.  I am also disappointed that no provision seems to have been made in this Bill to meet the absolutely defensible case that has been made in <Col N="992" /> this House by Deputies from all sides time and time again on behalf of the older pensioners of CIE.</P>
    <P>Over the past five years CIE have done quite a good job.  There are no grounds for complacency and the board and all sections of the staff must ensure that the highest degree of efficiency is maintained.  In a national transport system no modern business techniques, no application of modern technological developments, will be a success unless you have a contented and fairly remunerated staff.  I want to pay tribute to the ordinary workers in CIE in all grades and in all sectors, who are remarkable for their dedication to their job, and for their efficiency, their courtesy and their kindliness.</P>
    <P>The greatest asset CIE have is their manpower.  I understand that the present employment content in CIE is in the region of 19,500.  This is a high labour-intensive organisation.  Therefore, it is vitally important that the board of CIE and the top echelons of the organisation should be conscious of the need for the application of good modern industrial relations, and particularly conscious of human relations in all aspects of the operation of our national transport system.</P>
    <P>I recall the Minister for Health when he was Minister for Transport and Power many times bemoaning the incidence of strikes and various disputes in CIE.  I have a very high personal regard for the Minister for Health but I am sorry to say that, when he was Minister for Transport and Power, he did not contribute very much to the achievement of harmonious relations in CIE.  I sincerely hope the new Minister will ensure that the board and the management of CIE realise that the greatest asset of our national transport system is its human beings, the people who work the system right down to the grassroots.</P>
    <P>I wish CIE well in the future.  The Minister can be assured of my co-operation in any steps he takes to make our national transport system the type of system we would all like it to be.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy O'Donnell I wish to express my regret <Col N="993" /> that the Minister for Transport and Power is not back with us, but I am glad to say I understand he will be back very shortly.  It is good of the former Minister to be here because, of course, he is not unaware of the possibilities of people twitting him about the conversion which this Bill shows.  However, in view of the hard work he has put in on the Health Bill I do not propose to delay on that.  If I may say just one word about Deputy O'Donnell's speech, he made many references to Pacemaker, but he was certainly no pacesetter, if I may so so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to make a few remarks about the Minister's statement and then I have two pieces of what I think are concrete criticisms of CIE which I will put before the House as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The Minister started off&mdash;and this is the point on which Deputy O'Donnell wanted some explanation &mdash;with a reference to &ldquo;an annual grant of £2 million, with the aid of which the board was required to break even taking one year with another&rdquo;. He went back to that idea in the final paragraph of his speech in the rather involved language which mesmerised Deputy O'Donnell a little.</P>
      <P>Let me give the history of this. I must admit that Deputy O'Donnell is much better read on the transport history of recent times than I am, but I know this, and it is a good deal older.  This business of saying that the board shall so conduct the undertaking that taking one year with another it shall pay its way, first came into section 15 of the Transport Act, 1949, but it was in fact a &ldquo;cog&rdquo; from the British Nationalisation Act, the Act which created British Railways, passed in England in 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us come back to the peculiar wording which is always creeping into <Col N="994" /> Government briefs nowadays.  I suppose civil servants have to prove they are with it, and I suppose Ministers have to prove they are with it.  Let me explain.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the formula adopted in the 1964 Act has worked well and has provided the Board with a useful incentive to efficiency and economy.</P>
    <P>That really does not mean anything because, in fact, what was provided was £2 million a year.  On the whole the Minister had a good tale to unfold. We on these benches are not critical in the way in which the Minister was critical on one occasion&mdash;indeed, extremely critical.  The next sentence is the one Deputy O'Donnell got stuck in:</P>
    <P>A further step in this direction during the past five years has been to ensure that the non-commercial cost of services provided by CIE are qualified as accurately as possible and charged to appropriate sources;</P>
    <P>In simple language that really means that a further step in this direction during the past five years has been to ensure that the cost of non-commercial services provided by CIE was calculated correctly and charged to the right place.  It is as simple as that.  &ldquo;The non-commercial costs of the services&rdquo; upsets it.  It is the cost of the non-commercial services; this is just a slip in the way the sentence was put together, but it does make it very difficult to follow.  Then there is the word &ldquo;quantify&rdquo;.  People are always quantifying things in economics, and there are all kinds of things in economics that cannot be quantified.  I promised I would not delay the House too long, so I shall leave it at that.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks&mdash;and this is a relic from the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;about the significance of the railways for bulk freight traffic. The real significance of the railways in this context is in the transport of live cattle long distances, and I should like to have seen an awareness of that fact in the Department of Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>CIE has done well and it does not <Col N="995" /> surprise me that the loss on the railways has gone up a bit.  The Minister talks about the mileage of lines having been reduced by 126 miles since 1964 to 1,333 miles of first track.  I do not exactly understand that.  Does he mean that where you have double lines from Dublin to Cork it counts twice?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It shows that the Minister, when he was Minister for Transport and Power, was not as fierce as he used to talk.  It used to be said that there was, roughly speaking, 2,000 miles of line and there is still two-thirds of it there, so the bulk of it is still there.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Dublin city services, CIE is not making as much profit out of the citizens of Dublin as it used to some years ago, when it was difficult to find out from the Government the actual figure.  It was generally agreed that it was about £500,000.  The fares in Dublin are, in the minds of many people, very severe.  I have a particular reason for adverting to this; it is not parochialism.  People in Dublin willynilly tend to have to live further away from their work than people, say, in Limerick, Cork, Waterford or any of the smaller towns.  A mile or two is a long way to go, in spite of Deputy Flor Crowley shaking his head.  A few miles is a long way to go to work in Cork city.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware people come from vast distances everywhere. For example, Deputy Tully lives in Bettystown which had a population of 200 people ten years ago and is now a town of 1,500 people, and they go to work in both directions; they go up to Drogheda and Dundalk and down to Dublin.  An interesting point is that he told me the first train leaves at 6.20 in the morning.  However, I am talking about a major problem when I talk about large numbers of people in Dublin having to go long distances to their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was particularly impressed by the figures the Minister gave us of the <Col N="996" /> profits on the board's provincial road passenger services.  They increased from £271,000 to £941,000, in the past year, almost £1 million.  This is a terrific achievement, and I think it vindicates what I said here last week, when I see that the profit on the board's hotels, one of the few parts of the board's services that were making a profit eight or nine years ago, has gone up from £40,000 to £240,000.  It vindicates my view, because the board's hotels are not unreasonable in their charges and are exceptionally good hotels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am comparing them with comparable hotels.  I certainly do not go to that kind of hotel any longer.</P>
      <P>The total expenditure by CIE for capital purposes is being increased from £6 million to £17 million, only a very small part of which is explained by the Minister.  However, that is neither here nor there, because it is obvious that if you have no transport there is continual renewal of the rolling stock and there is no reason why, therefore, there should not be continual capital expenditure on the railway.</P>
      <P>The Minister makes this point on page 6 of the brief.</P>
      <P>Nothing has happened since 1964 which would suggest any changes necessary in the Government decision taken at that time to preserve the railway system subject to such further concentration and reorganisation as might prove practical and desirable.</P>
      <P>Again there is this word &ldquo;concentration&rdquo;. What is really meant is &ldquo;subject to such further reduction in the number of miles of railway line&rdquo;.  I am all for plain words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister then goes on to speak about the campaign for more commuters. I would not be human if I did not refer to what happened the Harcourt Street-Bray railway line when the Minister was Minister for Transport and Power.  I believe the reason why that line was closed was simply to <Col N="997" /> show that they treat Dublin in the same way as they treat the rest of the country.  However, that is not what worries me.  What really worries me is the planning opportunity that was missed at the time.  Many people have said this and I thought it myself at the time, and it has been done, I understand, in certain cities on the continent, particularly in Germany. There was an opportunity to create a toll road from Harcourt Street to Bray. It can be said it could only take oneway traffic, but it could have been traffic into Dublin and out of Dublin from 2 o'clock on, and it certainly would have made the situation on the Bray road and the coast road very different from what it is, judging by the complaints I hear from my colleagues coming from Bray.</P>
    <P>Many people have told me that if they want to arrive into the office at 9.30 from Killiney or Bray, they have to leave home long before 8.30, that if they left home only at 8.30 they would not be in Dublin until 9.45, that the congestion is something shocking.  It may have eased off in recent times, but a few years ago you had to leave Bray an hour and a quarter in advance.  Of course, if you did leave at 8.15, you got into Dublin at 8.50 or 9 o'clock, but if you delayed even five minutes you were caught in the jam.  CIE do not have control of this, it is a matter of overall planning which is the prerogative of the Government.  It has been pointed out that the Ballymun housing scheme is remote from any railway, and I think this is a just criticism. There can be no question but that travelling to work by train is much better than travelling to work by bus when one lives a fair distance out.</P>
    <P>I understand that CIE has recently spent £¼ million on ten steam heating vans for passenger trains.  These vans were manufactured in Holland and assembled in Dundalk.  I understand that CIE intend to buy an additional 40 steam heating vans.  Tenders have already been advertised and inquiries have come in from all over the world including Japan.  I want to protest very strongly that these vans are not being manufactured in this country. In 1956 over 50 heating vans were <Col N="998" /> built at CIE's enormous works at Inchicore.  Every part of these heating vans was constructed there except the boilers and I see no reason at all why these 40 heating vans should not be built in this country.  CIE's existing railway stock was manufactured in England and if we start buying stock from all parts of the world we will be in the same position as we are over our electrical plugs where we have two-pin, three-pin, 5 amp and 10 amp plugs.  CIE may well find itself with three or four different kinds of rolling stock.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell asked for information about the normalising of accounts&mdash;as he put it&mdash;but this is not an easy matter.  He was in fact requesting that some kind of cost benefit analysis be carried out but this is not an exact method of thought.  The cost end of it is easy but the benefit is the trouble, because the benefit is very often in the mind of the beholder and it depends how he approaches it.</P>
    <P>CIE's Dublin city garages are very badly located, but as land has got so dear I think it is probably too late to do anything about it.  The main garages are in Clontarf, Summerhill, Donnybrook, Ringsend and Conyngham Road and, with the exception of Conyngham Road, they are all badly located.  I was told by a former employee of CIE that the bad locations of these garages costs a good deal of money because these buses have to be brought all the way in from these garages in the morning and taken out again at night.  Obviously we should have a big garage on the north west side of the city and on the south west side of the city.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that the Minister now openly admits that £2? million a year are required for the next five years in order that CIE might balance its accounts.  We see nothing wrong with this.  In 1959 the Minister claimed he had &ldquo;done it&rdquo;, but he had not really done it, because he had written off the real property of the railways. As the railways were dismantled this real property was sold.  It was current income and, as it was current income, it enabled CIE to balance its accounts for a few years.  Railway tracks were of immense value because of the <Col N="999" /> Korean war, and this all helped.  The chairman of CIE and the Minister were both patting themselves on the back at that time, but as Deputy O'Donnell has said the problem was insoluble. It was not realistic for the Minister to talk as he did at that time.  I do not say the Minister's rigid attitude did not help to make people more efficient and in that way the Minister may have achieved something but he did not make CIE balance in the longrun. I should like to congratulate the Minister on the realism of the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is a pleasure to come into this House and listen to the constructive speeches of Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Dr. O'Donovan. We all know Deputy O'Donnell does his homework on transport and power and his speech was very constructive. Deputy Dr. O'Donovan was right in questioning the meaning of words because there can be many interpretations on the meanings of certain words.  I do not think the Civil Service were trying to be &ldquo;with it&rdquo;, I do not think they were trying to give us some gobbledegook. What they were trying to express was quite difficult to express in some cases without using officialese to put across what they wanted to put across.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As one who travels fairly regularly on both buses and trains I am very satisfied with the services provided. That is the main reason why I am speaking now on this measure.  When things go wrong, when things are not going the way we would like them to go, many people will criticise but, when things improve, silence becomes eloquent.  I come in some mornings from Glengarriff to Cork by bus. Everybody is intimate and friendly. This is due mainly to the driver and conductor being so interested in the passengers.  They will tell passengers where to alight, if the passengers are not familiar with the area, and they will talk about places of interest through which the bus passes.  It is only when one has experience of this that one appreciates the wonderful service these CIE employees are giving the people.  I suppose the cynics would prefer them not to do this but I <Col N="1000" /> should be remiss, indeed, were I not to mention the trojan work done by the ordinary driver and conductor on our buses to make the journey interesting for their passengers.</P>
    <P>I have always felt the buses were the poor relation of the trains.  Deputy O'Donnell said our train service was as good as, if not better than, the best train services in Europe.  I honestly believe we have got the best train service in Europe.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell also referred to the heating vans.  If anyone could criticise the trains, then the only criticism is that sometimes the heating is not what it should be.  That may be because they have not got adequate heating vans.  If that is the explanation, then the sooner these purchases are made the better.</P>
    <P>When music was introduced on the trains there was a good deal of criticism. The music is both elevating and relaxing.  It is an added comfort for passengers because it makes the journey more enjoyable.  The beautiful and charming hostesses are a tremendous asset, particularly to mothers travelling with young children.  They look after the children while the mother takes a meal.  They will heat bottles for babies. The service is very much appreciated.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to the tourist buses and the couriers and drivers.  They are doing an excellent job from the point of view of the tourist industry.  They are dedicated to making the tourist happy.  They are knowledgeable about the history and geography of the country; they can identify ancient castles and important historical monuments.  They provide an excellent service, one that is greatly appreciated.  The success of tourist buses is due in large measure to the crews of these buses.</P>
    <P>I have one request to make.  As Deputy Murphy will verify, we have in west Cork probably the most beautiful scenery in Ireland at Glengarriff.  It would be an excellent idea if CIE were to build a hotel there.  There are many small and medium-sized hotels.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>We may do that.  He has done a very good job in providing <Col N="1001" /> hotels and, if he comes down to Glengarriff, he will be very welcome indeed. We could do with a large luxury hotel. There may be complaints about prices in the case of CIE hotels but, on the whole, they give good value.  If they did not, then they would not have made a profit in the region of a quarter of a million last year.  Visitors would not patronise these hotels if they did not get good value.</P>
      <P>There may be some justification for some of the criticism of the prices charged, but the success of the hotels should answer this.  There has been criticism of the prices charged on trains for food and drink.  There is, I am told, an increase of ten to 15 per cent in drink prices.  Being a total abstainer, I cannot speak from personal experience on this, but I am reliably informed that a half one costs 7d more on the train; that is outrageous.</P>

      <P>It is a bit Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a bit Irish right enough.  I should like that that part of the price structure of CIE would be reconsidered.</P>
      <P>There is a criticism in regard to the train service that on excursion weekends, if there is a match in Dublin and the poor Cork people want to partake of refreshments in the bar, the prices charged are even greater.  I wonder is this the policy of CIE or is it accidental or is there any harmonisation of monetary policy in CIE? As Deputy O'Donnell said, it is very important that before our entry into the EEC there should be harmonisation of policy and of accounts.  CIE should start harmonising their own prices.  It is time that that matter was considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to refer to the workers in the road freight section.  When the west Cork railway was closed down there were certain men who became redundant, some of whom were then employed on the road freight section. And as a result they had to come from Skibbereen, Clonakilty and Bandon to Cork every morning to work in the road freight section.  It is the normal practice that CIE employees are entitled to free transport on buses but these poor people were doubly unfortunate <Col N="1002" /> in that they became redundant and had to pay for their travel to Cork.  I made representations at two stages to the Minister and to CIE, that free transport might be given to these employees and was informed that this could not be done.  This matter should be reconsidered and these workers should be given every consideration and, if possible, be granted facilities on buses going to Cork.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to see that CIE employ psychologists in the selection of candidates for positions.  In this age, in a company with 20,000 employees it is vital that the management should be not only of the highest calibre but be suited to the job of management. Up to recently the selection of candidates for managerial positions was a matter of instinct.  It was a haphazard type of selection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a ridiculous statement.  Is the Deputy implying that there is discrimination in CIE in the employment of people?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I should like the Deputy to substantiate that by giving the names and addresses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to interrupt the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that when he is not giving the names and addresses, he is withdrawing the remark.  I hope Deputy Collins was only joking when he said there was discrimination because there is no discrimination, as he very well knows. The utilisation of psychologists to analyse and select suitable persons for management positions is well worth while.  I hope that CIE will benefit as a result of this scientific approach to the recruitment of personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though CIE may be criticised frequently, we hope that it will continue to act in a humane manner with employees.  In a big concern like CIE work can become dehumanised.  The major reasons for strikes have been the dehumanisation of work for <Col N="1003" /> employees.  I know that CIE is very vigilant and is aware of the danger of this type of situation occurring.</P>
    <P>Occasionally market surveys are carried out on CIE trains and passengers are asked to state the time they should like trains to arrive and depart and whether or not they would avail of car-hire services in Dublin or Cork.  I should like to know the results of these surveys and if they have influenced in any way recent decisions by CIE.  We in Cork are very satisfied with the train services.  The trains always arrive on time; there is a dining-car service; there is a speedy service from Dublin to Cork.  I wonder if we will ever see the day when it will be possible to go from Dublin to Cork in two hours.  I should like to know if the surveys were in any way allied to that type of attainment. Probably the whole of the tracks from Dublin to Cork would have to be relaid if trains were to travel at the speed that would make that possible.</P>
    <P>I should like to reiterate that CIE should be complimented on the job it has done.  It is giving a good service to the public and its employees are presenting the best possible image of the country to tourists.  We hope they will continue to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>As I come from the west of Ireland I have a few criticisms to level at CIE but first of all I should like to wish the new Minister for Transport and Power every success in his term of office. There are many loyal ex-employees of CIE who have given very many years of divided service to the company who are finding it difficult to live on the meagre allowances given to them. These are the people who built up CIE when it needed loyal servants. I have met men who have given 30 years service in all types of weather and in all road conditions.  They find themselves with just enough to pay the landlady and go out day after day with barely £1 to spend.  That is enough to make any person feel disappointed after giving long service. I ask the Minister to consider the large number of ex-employees who find themselves in that position.  The <Col N="1004" /> Minister will be rather surprised at the number.  When you consider what it takes to run a home or pay for board and put the income of the ex-employee against that, there will not be much to spare.</P>
      <P>I put down a Parliamentary Question recently which was disallowed&mdash; rightly&mdash;but I can take the opportunity of speaking on it now.  It concerned the heating on trains to Sligo and particularly the late train from Dublin to Sligo.  I do not know what happened on the 6.20 train to Sligo but I had the experience on three occasions of travelling twice from Sligo to Dublin and once from Dublin to Sligo without heat and I made up my mind that I would try to avoid it in future.  A long journey of 140 miles on a cold train is an experience you will not forget. I want the Minister to note this.  A heating system is installed but it had broken down.  This is something that should be looked into immediately. Some speaker mentioned that £250,000 had been spent on heating and that more is about to be spent on it but I am giving the Minister facts.  This is not a complaint that was made to me: this was my own experience.  I spoke to other people and they agreed that they suffered keenly on these trains on long journeys.  I am sure the Minister will be glad to check on this situation.</P>
      <P>In the large centres like Galway and Limerick we have trains leaving each Sunday in the morning or at midday but from Sligo, which is a key position, we have no trains.  Many people have asked me to bring this to the Minister's notice and I am now asking him to consider it so that he may arrange transport from that area.</P>
      <P>A rather peculiar problem was brought to my notice recently.  A train goes from Dublin every Sunday and the fare is £1 8s.  If any passenger brings a friend back from Sligo to Dublin or if anybody boards that train at Sligo that day he must pay £2 11s. It seems strange that a train can come from Dublin for £1 8s. return and that for a single ticket from Sligo to Dublin you must pay £2 11s.  That is not fair. When the cheap rate applies on Sunday it should apply to everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having travelled for the last few <Col N="1005" /> months by CIE I think the Minister would be well advised to introduce more cheap rate tickets.  It is very noticeable that when such tickets are issued for Thursdays and Fridays the number of passengers can increase so much.  Hallowe'en broke all records for CIE due to the fact that there was a cheap weekend fare of which people availed.  The return ticket to the west is about £3 10s. but if people got the cheap fare they would avail to a much greater extent of CIE than they do when they must pay the full fare.  It would be more profitable for CIE to have a greater number of passengers at lower fares.  It is very encouraging to see on Christmas Eve 700 or 800 or perhaps 1,000 passengers leaving Westland Row for the west instead of running a train for 70 or 80 people. CIE would be well advised to have more cheap fares.  It would encourage people to avail more of the service. Hundreds of them would leave their cars at home and travel by rail.  Driving is a nightmare with the present state of traffic and the number of accidents and many people would be glad to avail of the railway if these reduced fares were obtainable.  In this connection also I would particularly emphasise the necessity for a good heating system. Many people might travel on the 8.20 train from Dublin at night if it was a comfortable service.</P>
    <P>We hear much about the tourist industry and I think that in order to attract industry to the West of Ireland CIE should provide cheaper transport. This should apply to the whole of the west from April to October when we are giving all the encouragement we can to people to holiday in this country. I want to compliment any semi-State body that can boast of having on its payroll about 19,500 people.  That is a very creditable figure especially when wages are high and conditions of employment must be good.  We cannot wonder if the Minister has to subsidise the running of the enterprise.  One might expect it to pay for itself but we have strikes, shorter hours and so on and CIE have often gone through tough times and kept going.  Having that number on the payroll speaks for itself. Knowing CIE and their methods of recruitment and promotion I am certain <Col N="1006" /> that promotion is fairly dealt with. Every young driver is judged on his merits and promoted when his time comes.  That happens in my area.</P>
    <P>The biggest loss suffered in the West of Ireland was the closing of railway lines.  We were told at the time that it was in the interests of economy that lines were closed.  We often wondered since if it was economic and I am sure that the Department frequently discovered that it was far from economic.  Worse still, it deprived many parts of the country of a lifeline enjoyed for many years.  Local towns had a number of employees and bigger centres had a service coming in; shopkeepers, business people and cattle traders all availed of the small type of line that branched throughout the west.  When that branch line went, much hardship was caused because the man with the private lorry also went and it was then a question of having to wait for a CIE lorry wherever it could give a service.</P>
    <P>That was the greatest tragedy which befell this country in our time.  The Government are now paying for it because in the west, where there are boggy roads and a rough type of country, it is almost impossible to keep roads up to standard in order to carry the traffic.  We have become very mechanised and roads which were never meant to carry this traffic now have to carry it.  The entire bill for this now falls on the local authorities. We were led to believe that the Department of Transport and Power would bear a substantial amount of the cost but after a few years the whole responsibility was left to the local authorities.  The value of the railway lines can be seen several times a week in the wagon loads of livestock heading for Dublin.  One can imagine how much road transport would be required to bring that quantity of livestock to Dublin and what the cost would be to the people involved.  For many years to come we will rue the closing of many of those lines which were shut down in the interests of economy.</P>
    <P>Today we have the Great Southern Hotels being run by CIE and they give a considerable amount of employment. Recently plans were drawn up for the erection of a show-piece hotel in Sligo <Col N="1007" /> town.  It was to be a 14-storey hotel having all modern amenities.  However, with taxation at its present high level, people are beginning to question the advisability of such an undertaking. There is a great demand for housing and many other necessities and the taxpayer is asking should such a show-piece be erected until more deserving matters have been dealt with.  We have in Sligo a hotel which is a credit to CIE, and its staff is also a credit to them, and while I would not be against the erection of a fine hotel CIE have made no mistake in postponing the erection of this new hotel.  We have plenty of hotels and new hotels are going up elsewhere and there is no great need for a large new hotel in Sligo.</P>
    <P>When the school transport system was introduced CIE co-operated and took on many young men who are now in part-time employment which is something envisaged for many small farmers in the west.  As it is outside the scope of this Bill I will not dwell on the fact that I consider that CIE should always pick up children in their school buses. Sometimes you see buses passing a group of children on the road although the buses may be half empty.</P>
    <P>CIE are providing a very good service generally and their train and bus staffs are excellent and they are always very courteous.  During the tourist season tourists appreciate the efforts of conductors to keep them informed about the places through which they are travelling.  The drivers are conscientious men and their managers will testify to their fine records.  They have a very responsible job.  Even though it is costing the taxpayer £2½ million CIE are giving good employment and security to a considerable number of people.  Finally, I would like to repeat the need for action in regard to the price of the single ticket from here to Sligo, as against the price of the return ticket.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot follow the trend of this debate at all.  I understood that the issue was to ask the taxpayer to ensure that £2,650,000 will be paid annually as a subvention to CIE over the next five years.  That has <Col N="1008" /> been lost sight of because so far the debate has consisted of a few platitudes in regard to minor matters which scarcely come within the ambit of the Bill.  The Minister is a lucky man that Mr. Patrick McGilligan is not a Deputy now because if he were I am sure his contribution to this debate would last not less than four hours. Why should his contribution last four hours?  My reasoning is quite simple. I assume that, if he were here, he would go to the Library and dig up the various volumes of debates dealing with CIE subsidisation and dig up the paragraphs of Ministerial pronouncements on CIE subsidisation.  Seldom if ever do I proceed to the Library. The former Deputy McGilligan used to do it all very effectively.  He was able to come into this House well briefed and to give quotations of statements made in previous years.  In so doing, he was not just speaking of the past or inviting the comment: &ldquo;Why talk of the past?  Think of the future.&rdquo; We must remember who is in charge of CIE.  We must remember the party in Government in this country.  We must remember to whom CIE is responsible.  Therefore, it is quite in order to go back over a number of years.</P>
      <P>I have a fair idea of the general trend of discussions in this House over the years on CIE problems.  I am a Member of this House now for 19 years.  The present Minister for Health was Minister for Transport and Power for some years and, while he held that portfolio, we heard much from him about CIE, about how it should be run, about what the future held for it and about subsidies to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My research was of the most limited nature.  I picked just one volume&mdash; no more&mdash;at random.  The same thread of thinking runs through the Ministerial pronouncements in the 1950s and up to 1962.  Had the then Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Childers, some central point?  When a minister of religion is starting off on a sermon he usually takes a text.  What was the Minister's text at that time?  I just found it in this volume.  When he was referring to people who, at the time, were supporting the subsidisation of CIE, what did the Minister say?  His <Col N="1009" /> text was, in effect: &ldquo;It does not matter. The Government will pay&rdquo;.  That is a quotation from the Minister.  That was his line, replying to representations by Members of this House, on the advisability of subsidising CIE, if CIE were to continue services.  The Minister had some very interesting points to make at that particular time and even when he closed the railway lines in the late 1950s.  When he was advocating the closure of the West Cork railway, the Waterford-Tramore line and the West Clare line, when he was advocating the disappearance of the 126 miles of rails, he told us that CIE would pay its own way and that there would be no need to ask the Irish taxpayer for any help.</P>
    <P>I remember stating at that time that the recommendations he got from the board and the assessment of the future of CIE so far as subsidisation was concerned would remind one of some type of assessment one might get from Portrane or Grangegorman.  I am quite sure that one would get as accurate an assessment on the future of CIE from a group from either of these institutions as was made by the Minister and his advisers in the Department at that time. Again and again I have said here that there is an obligation on State-sponsored bodies to give an account of their stewardship; to tell the taxpayers, through this House, how they have expended their money, what plans they have for economies and what they propose to do for the future.  Unfortunately, it is impossible for the taxpayers to get information as to the actual administration of such State-sponsored bodies. Questions in this House bring forth little news, little information.  We are told that CIE is an autonomous body; that its day-to-day affairs and its general policy are more or less matters for itself.  We are told, sometimes not too politely, in effect: &ldquo;It does not matter to you.  Mind your own business&rdquo;. I say to Members of this House that that is what the Government are saying, through us, to the taxpayers of the country.</P>
    <P>It may be said that it is a very soft, easy job so far as the head is concerned, so far as the brain and the mind are concerned, to be in charge <Col N="1010" /> of the board of CIE or of the board of a State-sponsored body as compared with a private concern.  As the Minister mentioned, if CIE lose money, it does not matter: the Government will pay. That is the saying of the day.  That is what the Minister said, with derision, on 14th November, 1962&mdash;seven years ago: that is quite factual, quite truthful.</P>
    <P>Today, if CIE wants an increase of £650,000 per annum over and above what was allocated in the past five years and if, by virtue of incompetence or any other type of mismanagement, further losses are incurred, then, what about it?  The salary of the director is assured.  He will get his £X per annum: he will get all the &ldquo;perks&rdquo; attached to his office.  I am not reflecting on him in saying so.  I am making a comparison to show how easy it is for him as against the private enterprise man who has to ensure that his company or business will survive and make a profit, whether it is transport, grocery, drapery or any other type of business. Unless it pays, the private enterprise man will find himself out of business and in the bankruptcy court and his employees will find themselves out of work.</P>
    <P>That is the type of picture we must conjure up here, the picture of the man assured of his money irrespective of whether or not he mismanages his business because our taxpayers must pay and he is assured of a sympathetic Government in this House to put further proposals to the Irish people to increase the subvention.  Furthermore, from what I have learned of the debate, he is assured of support also from the Opposition to help him to get that subsidisation.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the kind of empty platitude about this, that and the other thing to which I have listened here for the past few hours, that, just because a body is State-sponsored, just because it is nationalised, that, in itself, must make it efficient.  I have never accepted that because a body is nationalised or because a group is State-sponsored it is necessarily efficient.  There is nothing to indicate that it could not be efficient.  First, we must examine CIE from the point of <Col N="1011" /> view of efficiency.  If this debate were on the ESB or on any other State-sponsored body I should be making the same remarks because what I have in mind and what I have asserted here over and over again, year after year, is that we must get more information on the expenditures of public and State-sponsored bodies.  We must get to know more about their business; whether there is waste; whether there is waste in the different sectors of their business or whether there is no waste whatever; whether everything is working well or whether the opposite is the case.</P>
    <P>Why can we not have a Committee of this House to look into the affairs of CIE, the ESB, or any of our State-sponsored bodies to see if they are working smoothly and efficiently and giving good value for their money? Surely such bodies would welcome a committee of this House to inquire into all aspects of their business?  I maintain that, in providing this big amount of money to subsidise CIE, the Minister is under an obligation to give more information about the working of CIE and other State-sponsored bodies to the elected representatives of the people than we got in past years.</P>
    <P>What about subsidisation?  We can read in the Library what the Minister for Health had to say about it.  What had he to say on 14th November, 1962, about subsidisation?  Much the same as he had to say in 1958 and in 1959. At that time I accepted that he was genuine in what he said.  I believe that the Minister is a man of integrity but, assuming that he is a man of integrity, then, in my opinion, he is not fitted for his job because his past statements prove him to be a man with little business capacity and devoid of foresight. He must be one or the other. When the Minister spoke in this House in the 50s and 60s, if he was speaking honestly and sincerely, as I believe he was, then it is quite clear that he lacked knowledge of the work of his Department of Transport and Power.  At that time his assessments were completely out of plumb and completely out of place.</P>
    <P>I will take nothing out of context. <Col N="1012" /> I will read a chapter from volume 197, column 1229 of the Official Report.  I will read the entire chapter.  I will not do the clever thing and pick out a sentence because I do not believe in that.  As I said before, I seldom give quotations.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>We have had to subsidise CIE very substantially over a period in the hope of getting the undertaking properly on its feet.</P>
    <P>That is quite all right, is it not?  He went on:</P>
    <P>At no stage, however, has the Government or the Dáil ever contemplated a situation in which the undertaking will be permanently in receipt of subsidies.  I know of no reason why, in principle, transport should be subsidised.  It is no more essential to the public than many other commodities or services which no one would dream of subsidising. It remains firmly the Government's policy, therefore, that CIE, like other State bodies whose task it is to provide productive services, should pay their way.  Deficit financing of the kind envisaged by the authors of this Bill&mdash;</P>
    <P>That was a Private Bill which was introduced in 1962</P>
    <P>&mdash;would be as bad for CIE as for the public.</P>
    <P>What does subsidy breed?  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Subsidy inevitably breeds inefficiency and encourages excessive staffing and feather-bedding and the whispering voice of &ldquo;It doesn't matter; the Government will pay&rdquo; is destructive of the morale of the staff, high and low.</P>
    <P>That is the Minister's considered view on subsidies.  He went on:</P>
    <P>Subsidies deprive the taxpayer of capital, of purchasing power and of savings which he could otherwise put to better use.  It is &ldquo;robbing Peter to pay Paul&rdquo; and while operating subsidies might maintain staff in uneconomic and non-productive services in CIE, they would deprive people of employment elsewhere with the new or expanded industries that the purchasing power <Col N="1013" /> or capital diverted to subsidies might have financed.  May I point out that for every man employed in CIE as a result of an operating subsidy another man will be disemployed, or a young man or girl will fail to get employment somewhere else. Deficit payments leave their trail with irrevocable and implacable regularity.</P>
    <P>I could continue but that is sufficient to show the Minister's trend of thought on 14th November, 1962.  In making that statement he was resisting efforts to ensure that CIE would be guaranteed a subsidy to continue their work. It is just seven years since 1962, and what is the position now so far as the Minister's statement is concerned? Two years after making that statement he had to come to this House and to some extent eat his own words and say: &ldquo;We must give CIE a subsidy of £2 million per year.  Otherwise their work will be discontinued.  There is no hope that these people can be made self-sufficient even though they have a monopoly of the greater part of the services.  There is no probability in the foreseeable future that CIE will break even&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As I said before all the Minister had to do to make CIE economic and self-sufficient was to wipe out the rotten lines on which they were losing so much money.  Once they were torn away from the system everything in the garden would be rosy and CIE would be able to pay their workers a decent rate of remuneration.  They would be able to provide decent services and, into the bargain, they would be able to do that without any help from the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I am making these statements to show as clearly as I can that there has been a great deal of incompetence in the Department of Transport and Power down through the years and, in my opinion, a great deal of incompetence in the board of CIE.  Surely people who made those statements seven years ago cannot be said to have much foresight, and surely we can say that they were not competent to hold the high offices they held in our transport system.  That is part of the reason why the Irish taxpayer is being asked to pay £2,650,000 for the next <Col N="1014" /> five years, having already paid £2 million for the past five years and, for years before that, having paid several million pounds to keep this nationalised body going.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise again&mdash;and I may be charged with repetition&mdash; that we must have more accountability from State sponsored bodies. We must be able to pry into their business to a far greater extent than we are allowed to at present.  If the Irish taxpayers, through this Parliament, establish a State-sponsored body to deal with any sector of our activities or our public affairs, there is an obligation on that body to be accountable to the taxpayers and, the only way they can be accountable to the taxpayers, is through a committee of this House.</P>
    <P>There is none of us here, despite all the bouquets cast around the House, who can say whether or not everything is efficient so far as CIE are concerned. We can only give a general assessment.  Possibly some sectors are working smoothly and efficiently and possibly some others are not.  We do not know.  We are not allowed into their secrets.  Any assessment of the position given here is not a true or factual one.  Let us make the comparison again.  What has the managing director of a private company to do? He has to render an account to his shareholders.  If it is a family business he has to render an account to his family.  They have to access between them whether the business is being managed properly, whether their rate of profit is sufficient to maintain their business at an economic level.  Otherwise they would find themselves in the bankruptcy court.</P>
    <P>In 1958 or 1962 there was no question of CIE being a social service. The then Minister for Transport and Power, the present Minister for Health, would not hear of such a suggestion. He always maintained that CIE was a transport service that should pay its way without any help.  I remember agitating in this Chamber for the continuance of a bus service to Goleen, a village ten miles from where I live in Schull.  The request was refused repeatedly by the Minister because he said a bus from Schull to Goleen, <Col N="1015" /> making a round trip of 20 miles, would not be economic.  Statistics were submitted to him showing that sufficient people would not avail of the service to make it economic.  That is what the Minister had to say about that service ten years ago.  Now what has he to say?  The wheel has turned full circle.  I quote from the Minister's speech:</P>
    <P>The problem of viability of the railway is common to all European countries and has been faced more realistically here than in most other countries.  There is no ready solution but it is clear that the railway can never be operated without State assistance.</P>
    <P>That is a direct contradiction of what the Minister, Deputy Childers, stated nine or ten years ago or any number of years since he first took office.</P>

      <P>I shall give my view, and then the Parliamentary Secretary can give his.  &ldquo;The railway plays an important role in the social and economic life of the country and will continue to do so.&rdquo; That is what I was saying 14 or 15 years ago.  Such a statement was made from the Opposition Benches then but it was not heeded.  It has taken the Minister that number of years to find out that selfevident fact, that the railway as a public transport service plays an important role in the social and economic life of the country.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Geoghegan, has said times have changed.  Let us examine the changes that have taken place since 1962.  I do not see any major changes.  We have had no war, no civil disturbance.  So far as general affairs are concerned, it could be said they are moving along smoothly.  The Parliamentary Secretary has very little case for saying that things have changed.  No upheaval of any kind has occurred that would put us off the rails, so to speak.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister anticipate headlong or any type of inflation <Col N="1016" /> in 1962?  Organisations covering every aspect of our activity were demanding and demanding.  Did the Minister take any notice of that or did he anticipate the attitude the Government would adopt?  Surely the Minister could see that happening in 1962 or in 1958, that we would have demands from all sections of the people?  We have had these demands and there was very little resistance on the part of the Government, because probably they were afraid that if they resisted they would find themselves here instead of there.  It is as simple as that.  Was there not the fear: &ldquo;If I say something out of place this will cost me votes&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is perfectly right in what he says about what I said, and there I am in good company with practically every Minister for Transport in Europe who miscalculated the rate at which motor car traffic would grow.  There is hardly one who did not believe in the early 50s that somehow the railway might be able to pay.  Deputy Morrissey believed it and so did Deputy Norton, so I can quote them, too.  My predecessor, Mr. Lemass, was also optimistic.  I am sorry I was as optimistic as all the others.  The Deputy is perfectly at liberty to criticise the Minister for Transport at that time for having wrongly predicted the situation. I admit it; I cannot deny it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall have to wait until the morning to analyse the Minister's statement.  If what he says is the case, then when we appear before the higher tribunal later on we can say: &ldquo;I only made the same mistake as so-and-so.  Why blame me?&rdquo; No, that is not good enough.  The circumstances are different in every country.  We are speaking about Ireland, a comparatively small country with a population of fewer than three million.  It should be easier to see into the future here than in many other countries where possibly they have more upsets than we have here.</P>

      <P>As regards the first part of <Col N="888" /> the question.  I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 28 of the 2nd December.  The 1961 census of population indicated that 33 per cent of all dwellings had the use of a fixed bath.  Practically all of the 85,000 dwellings built and a substantial proportion of the 41,000 dwellings improved since then by the installation of piped water have a fixed bath or shower installed.</P>
      <P>Table I of the White Paper, &ldquo;Housing in the Seventies&rdquo;, which I issued last June shows the number of dwellings completed in each year from 1960-61 to 1968-69; the number built per 1,000 of the population in 1967 is set out in Appendix V of the paper.  State grants or subsidies are paid for approximately 98 per cent of all dwellings completed in recent years.</P>

      <P>I can only deal with the points raised in the Deputy's question in respect of (a) the period since AnCO&mdash;the industrial Training Authority&mdash;was established in May, 1967, and (b) the period since the resettlement allowances scheme came into effect in January, 1968.  The State grants made available to AnCO since is was established were £250,000 in 1967-68, £450,000 in 1968-69 and £975,000 in 1969-70.  It is not feasible to specify precisely the amounts expended out of these grants on retraining but the total expenditure &mdash;capital and non-capital&mdash;up to the 30th September, 1969, on the provision of training at the three centres established by AnCO at Shannon, Waterford and Galway is in the region of £410,000.  The total number of trainees who completed courses at these three centres is 204: the number at present receiving training in them is 544 and the present estimated annual throughput of the three centres is about 820.</P>
      <P>Information is not available to me on the expenditure by other bodies or by individual firms on training over the period mentioned in the question, or on the number of workers involved. The total expenditure under the resettlement allowances scheme between January, 1968 and 8th December, 1969 was £945 7s 6d and the number of workers aided was 49.</P>

      <P>The information already compiled in my Department is not in a form which would enable the information sought in the Deputy's question to be furnished.  In order to answer the question it would be necessary to engage a large staff in making out a further detailed analyis of the results of the intermediate and the leaving certificate examinations during the past four years.</P>
      <P>If this were to be done it would interfere with the carrying out of the ordinary work in the secondary branch of my Department to an extent which would be unwarranted.</P>
