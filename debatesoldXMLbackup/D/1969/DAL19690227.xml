      <P>It is proposed to take Business in the following order: Nos. 14 and 13 (Votes 42 and 48).  By agreement it is proposed to take No. 14 with Vote 42.  Questions will be taken at 2.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>May I repeat my request for permission to raise the subject matter of Questions Nos. 49 to 51 on yesterday's Order Paper?  It would facilitate matters if, during the day, the Minister for Social Welfare would ask that this appeal, the subject of these questions, be heard?  Perhaps, it could be decided before 5 p.m. this evening which would save the Minister and myself.</P>

      <P>I realise that, but I am sure that the Chair realises my position.  In my constituency there are hundreds of people who are cold and hungry at this moment.  This is a matter of the gravest possible urgency. If the Minister cannot have a decision on this, he might make useful representations to the trade unions to make payments to these people.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that neither the Taoiseach nor the <Col N="1850" /> Minister for Social Welfare realises the seriousness of the situation.  There are hundreds of hungry people with neither fire nor money for the past month.  I would ask the Minister to have some information on this.  I am living among these people and know their circumstances, and it is a very serious matter.</P>

    <Title>Supplementary Estimate, 1968-69.</Title>
    <P>The Dáil, according to order, went into Committee on Finance to consider a Supplementary Estimate for the year ending 31st March, 1969.</P>
  </MainHeading>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Vote 42: Posts and Telegraphs.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1969, for the Salaries and Expenses of the office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and of certain other Services administered by that Office, and for payment of a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>This token Supplementary Estimate of £10 is being taken to give Deputies an opportunity to discuss the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for the financial year 1968-69. This Estimate was, as Deputies are aware, one of a number which were agreed to without discussion on 12th December, 1968.  On the same date the House agreed to a Supplementary Estimate of £8.8 million in respect of pay increases for the public service.  Included in that figure was a provision of £1.8 million for Post Office staff. For convenience of reference, I propose to relate my comments on the details of the Estimate to the figures shown in the published book of Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net Estimate of £22,747,000 shown in the Estimates volume is £1,328,000 greater than the corresponding figure for 1967-68.  Of that increase, £350,000 is in Subhead K, the Grant-in-Aid to Radio Telefís Éireann, in respect of increased broadcasting <Col N="1851" /> licence revenue.  Accordingly, the net increase for the services directly provided by my Department would appear to be £978,000.  The published figures for last year do not, however, include an additional sum of £408,000 provided at the end of March in the general Supplementary Estimate for increases in remuneration in respect of various staff pay awards and improvements in conditions of service.  The actual increase is, therefore, £570,000 plus the £1.8 million for extra remuneration to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>Devaluation, a new cost element in the Estimates this year, is expected to increase gross expenditure by about £350,000, of which £200,000 will be recovered from Telephone Capital funds.  Devaluation will also involve a reduction in Post Office revenue by about £50,000 in settlement of accounts with other administrations for the handling of postal and telecommunications traffic.</P>
    <P>The following comments are offered on the other subheads which show substantial variations from the corresponding amounts for last year:</P>
    <P>The increase of £572,000 in Subhead A, Salaries, Wages and Allowances, is mainly required to meet the cost of the pay revisions approved last year, which I have already mentioned, and to provide additional staff, particularly for the telephone service.  The extra costs arising out of the current round of pay increases were, as I have already said, included in the Supplementary Estimate for public service pay increases agreed to on 12th December, 1968.</P>
    <P>There is a reduction of £74,000 in Subhead C, Accommodation and Building Charges, due mainly to the completion of some major building works.</P>
    <P>The increase of £91,000 in Subhead D, Conveyance of Mails, is almost entirely due to the effect of devaluation on the cost of our expanding airmail services.</P>
    <P>Devaluation accounts for £250,000 of the total increase of £450,000 in Subhead F, Engineering Stores and Equipment. The balance is due to greater <Col N="1852" /> purchases of stores and greater expenditure on contract works under this year's Telephone Capital Programme.</P>
    <P>The increase of £533,000 in Subhead G, Telephone Capital Repayments, is the result of growth in the capital investment in the telephone service.</P>
    <P>The increase of £737,000 in Subhead T, Appropriations-in-Aid, arises mainly from the expected recovery of an additional £500,000 from Telephone Capital funds under this year's programme.  A new provision this year is an amount of £50,000 for agency services in connection with the Department of Labour's Redundancy Scheme.</P>
    <P>Letter traffic in 1967, comprising about 440 million items, was over two per cent higher than in the previous year.  First-class air-mail showed an increase of four per cent and second-class air-mail of over 27 per cent.  It is provisionally estimated that total letter traffic in 1968 was also about 2 per cent higher than the 1967 level.</P>
    <P>There was a reduction estimated at 3 per cent in the number of parcels handled in 1967 as compared with 1966.  This was to some extent due to the restrictions on parcel traffic introduced following the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in England but there had been a downward trend in previous years.  Provisional figures for 1968 indicate that total parcel traffic will be much the same as in 1967, that is, somewhat more than eight million.</P>
    <P>There was an increase of seven per cent in the volume of meter-franked postings in 1967 and this trend was repeated in 1968.  These postings now make up thirty per cent of total postings. The conditions governing this type of mail have been relaxed to encourage the greater use by firms of meter-franking machines.</P>
    <P>The percentage of first-class letter postings delivered throughout the country by the following working day is about 94 per cent of the total postings. For parcels and second-class mail the standard is only marginally lower.  The bulk of mail for places abroad is sent by air on the day of posting and with few exceptions mail received from abroad is delivered on <Col N="1853" /> the day of receipt or on the following working day.</P>
    <P>During 1967, 65 motorised delivery services were introduced.  In 1968 a further 70 routes were motorised. There are now over 300 motor delivery rural services in operation.</P>
    <P>Thirty-eight new postman posts were created in 1967 to deal with increased mail work arising from housing developments in urban areas.  A further 31 posts were created in 1968.</P>
    <P>Sixteen Sub-Post Offices were closed in 1967 on the occurrence of vacancies and 11 further offices were closed in 1968.  In all cases the services provided were not being used sufficiently to justify keeping the offices open.  There are now more than 2,100 Sub-Offices and 98 Departmentally staffed post offices in the country.  We still have more post offices in relation to population than most other countries.</P>
    <P>The new Central Sorting Office in Sheriff Street, Dublin was opened in August, 1967.  The office is linked directly with Connolly Station by means of an overhead bridge which permits the transfer of bags of mail in both directions by a chain conveyor.</P>
    <P>For many years articles and literature for the blind have been accepted for transmission by post at nominal rates.  In response to representations from associations devoted to the welfare of the blind, I propose to introduce amending Post Office legislation which will, <i>inter alia,</i> enable this class of postal matter to be transmitted free of postage.</P>
    <P>In 1967 special issues of postage stamps were made to mark the Centenary of the Fenian Rising, the Tercentenary of the birth of Jonathan Swift, the Centenary of the Canadian Confederation and International Tourist Year.  We also joined with other members of the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations in producing a Europa stamp in 1967.</P>
    <P>Special issues during 1968 comprised the annual Europa stamp and stamps commemorating the 800th Anniversary of the founding of St. Mary's Cathedral, Limerick, the Centenary of the <Col N="1854" /> birth of Countess Markievicz, the Centenary of the birth of James Connolly and the International Year for Human Rights.  A special stamp was issued on 21st January last to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first assembly of Dáil Éireann.  The other special issues during 1969 will be on the Europa theme, the 50th anniversary of the International Labour Office, the centenary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi, and a stamp featuring a contemporary work of Irish art.  The first group of the new series of definitive stamps was issued on 14th October, 1968.  The remaining denominations in this series will be issued during the first half of this year.</P>
    <P>A total of 1,296,000 telegrams was handled during 1967.  This was 3.7 per cent lower than in 1966.  The decline was greatest in telegrams exchanged with Britain and Northern Ireland which were down by 8 per cent.  The number of foreign telegrams increased by 2.5 per cent in keeping with the trend in recent years.  Foreign telegrams (both incoming and outgoing) now account for about one-quarter of total traffic.  Complete figures for 1968 are not yet available but for a considerable part of the year, total traffic showed a small increase over the 1967 level.</P>
    <P>We now exchange telegrams directly, using the Gentex system of automatic switching, with seven continental countries, namely, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, France, Norway and Italy.  It is hoped to extend the service to other European countries later.</P>
    <P>Telegrams for countries not available on the Gentex system are worked to automatic message relay units in London and New York.  This arrangement, introduced in 1966, has greatly speeded the re-transmission of telegrams between Ireland and those countries which are also connected to the units.</P>
    <P>The telex service is expanding at a remarkable rate.  The number of subscribers increased from 400 on 1st January, 1967, to 503 on 31st December, 1967, and to 662 on 31st December last.  We have had therefore a growth of 66 per cent in two years.</P>
    <P>It is evident that the advantages of <Col N="1855" /> this extremely useful form of communication are being realised by a rapidly growing number of firms.  I have directed that all necessary steps be taken to ensure that requests for connection be met without avoidable delay and that the quality of service be held at a high level.</P>
    <P>In anticipation of future expansion, contracts have been placed to increase substantially the capacity of the existing exchanges at Dublin, Cork and Shannon.  An order has also been placed for an exchange at Waterford. Overhaul centres have been opened at Cork, Shannon and Waterford.  To cater for the increasing traffic, 16 extra circuits were put into service in September last on the London route.  It is hoped to get direct circuits to Germany later this year and also to double the number of circuits to the USA.</P>
    <P>Telex service is now available to 106 countries.  In addition to Britain, 12 European countries are reached by direct dialling.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that it was found possible to reduce the rental charges for long-distance subscribers as from 1st October, 1967.  The reduction benefited all subscribers whose installations are located more than 50 miles from Dublin; for example, the annual rental for a subscriber at Galway was cut by £48 and at Cork by £70.</P>
    <P>The telephone service is also expanding rapidly.  In 1967 the traffic handled amounted to 254 million calls, which was 7.9 per cent more than in the previous year.  Of the total, 226.5 million were local and 27.5 million were trunk calls.  82 per cent of calls were dialled directly by the caller.  Figures of traffic for 1968 are not yet available but it is clear that there was a further substantial increase.</P>
    <P>In 1967 some 1,450 additional trunk circuits comprising about 30,000 circuit miles were provided on 270 routes, mainly in underground cable; many open wire trunk routes were replaced by trunk cables thus improving the quality and reliability of the service; and ninety additional Cross-Channel circuits and two extra circuits to the USA were provided.  Among the more important routes that were improved <Col N="1856" /> were many in the Counties Cork, Louth, Monaghan and Waterford as well as routes radiating from Cork, Dublin and Limerick.  Since January, 1966, a further 627 trunk circuits comprising about 39,000 circuit miles have been provided; and 37 more Cross-Channel circuits and 3 extra transatlantic circuits&mdash;two to Canada and one to the USA&mdash;have been brought into service.</P>
    <P>Progress with the extension of the automatic system continues.  During 1967, 47 manual exchanges were converted to automatic working, a further 28 were converted by the end of December last and 10 more exchanges, including Tralee, are due to become automatic by the end of March next. There are now about 320 automatic exchanges to which 83 per cent of subscriber's lines are connected.  Most of the lines connected to manual exchanges have continuous service and, overall, 98 per cent of our subscribers now have continuous service.</P>
    <P>In 1967 additional equipment to provide for future subscriber and traffic growth was installed in 31 automatic and 61 manual exchanges.  In 1968, 47 automatic exchanges and 100 manual exchanges were similarly extended. In addition, a modern manual exchange was put into service in Skibbereen in July last.  Within the next six months similar exchanges will be provided at Castleblayney, Castlerea, Donegal and Listowel.  Many other exchanges will be extended.</P>
    <P>The number of telephones installed has been increased steeply by a record figure.  In the year to 31st March, 1968, 19,393 subscribers' lines were connected as compared with 15,528 for the previous year.  The increase was 25 per cent approximately on what had been, as I said last year, the highest number of installations ever reached in any 12 month period.  As a result, despite a sharp rise in demand, the waiting list had by the 31st March last been reduced by 3,000 to 7,585 of which 2,762 were in course of installation. The target for the current financial year is 22,000 connections; 17,000 were provided in the nine months April-December, 1968, so that we are well on the way to reaching it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1857" /> I have had particular attention given to the older outstanding applications which had been held over because they required extensive construction work.  It is expected that the great majority of the remaining pre-1968 applicants will be offered service before the 31st March next.</P>
    <P>The summer of 1968 saw outstanding growth of traffic, attributable largely in some areas at least, to the successful tourist season and growth of motoring holidays.  These factors and the exceptionally fine summer led to a remarkable increase in the number of cross-channel calls booked at provincial exchanges in the evening hours, in July and August particularly. At Dublin trunk exchange too, traffic was sharply up as compared with 1967.</P>
    <P>I should explain to the House that the quality of subscriber service can be analysed in the following way.  Service can be sub-standard where there is an insufficiency of plant-switches or cable, wire or radio circuits&mdash;to cope with existing traffic.  As indicated above, a very substantial programme of extension in this field has been completed and further extensions are continuing to be made to meet constantly growing needs.  Service can also be sub-standard when the percentage of faulty connections not due to faulty dialling or engaged numbers is excessive in comparison with the excellent standards in this respect to be found in some other countries.  The efficiency of the system is measured by special equipment and also by frequent trial calls made by the inspectorate.</P>
    <P>Last year I mentioned that priority attention would be given to the quality of the trunk and local service.  I am glad to say that there has been a marked improvement in the system since I last reported to the House and our aim is to reach the highest level of service to be found in any country with which valid comparisons can be made.  There is, of course, no question of being satisfied with what has been done.  In some areas the standard is still not satisfactory and improvement schemes to raise this standard are in progress in many instances&mdash;some are referred to later&mdash;and in preparation in the remainder.  All these schemes <Col N="1858" /> will be pushed ahead as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The maintenance organisation has already been modified and further steps are being taken to improve efficiency.</P>
    <P>At this point I shall refer briefly to some of the development works in progress or proposed.</P>
    <P>A new manual exchange comprising 67 operating positions is in course of installation at Dame Court, Dublin, and will be brought into service for next summer's traffic.  A new Directory Enquiries suite was brought into service last May.</P>
    <P>Underground or aerial co-axial cable schemes between Cork, Bandon and Skibbereen, Dundalk, Castleblayney and Monaghan and Castle-blayney-Ballybay-Cootehill have been completed since the 1st April and the following are due to be completed before next summer: Arklow-Gorey-Enniscorthy; Cahirciveen-Killorglin; Ennis - Ennistymon; Ennis - Kilrush; Letterkenny-Dungloe.  In addition, the capacity of the existing trunk cable serving Carrickmacross was expanded by fitting carrier equipment.  The cables serving Ennis, Killarney, Listowel and a number of other places will be increased by similar means.</P>
    <P>Work on a Waterford-Dungarvan cable scheme and on the Athlone-Castlerea - Claremorris - Castlebar-Ballina co-axial cable scheme is in progress.  Some circuits from the latter cable are expected this summer.</P>
    <P>Work on the installation of radio links connecting Dublin and Portlaoise, Dublin and Cork, and Portlaoise and Athlone is in hands.  Work on the radio link which will provide additional circuits to Belfast and to Great Britain is also well advanced and will, it is expected, be in service towards the end of the year.  Each of these links has a capacity of 960 telephone circuits.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from what I have said that a considerable expansion of the basic telephone network has been and is taking place.  To those who are impatient at the rate of progress, I can only say that nobody is more impatient <Col N="1859" /> than I am that we are not moving faster.  As I have explained before, however, major installations take several years to complete from the initial stages.  Long term planning is essential; and this applies not only to plant and equipment but to sites, buildings, staff and all those elements which go to make up a highly integrated service. I refer to some of these under other headings.  Here I shall only add that we are looking at all facets of the service to see how improvements in organisation, co-ordination, co-opera-tion and everything else that contributes to higher productivity, more rapid progress and better service can be best achieved.  To supplement our own efforts towards this end we have engaged consultants on certain aspects of the work.  I shall return to these in more detail later.</P>
    <P>At the end of March, 1967 a Weather Service for the Dublin area was brought into operation.  I am pleased to report that the service has been a great success&mdash;over a half million calls were made in 1968.</P>
    <P>An automatic time service is also proposed.  A contract has already been placed for the &ldquo;speaking clock&rdquo; equipment. It is expected that the service will commence later this year.</P>
    <P>For some time past the question of having a separate Classified Directory similar to those issued by many other administrations had been under consideration and I decided that one should be issued annually in future. This directory will contain the entries of all business subscribers classified by trade or profession and will have a high advertising content.  It will be a useful service to our subscribers and will also be of considerable value to the business community.  The contract for the production of the directory has been placed and the first edition should be in the hands of subscribers in May next.</P>
    <P>So much for the Estimate, so far as it relates to telephones, for the current financial year.  The Telephone Capital Bill, 1968, has already received a First Reading.  With the permission of the House I propose that the discussion on the Second Stage take place in conjunction with the debate on this <Col N="1860" /> Estimate.  If that is agreed, I think this is the most appropriate time&mdash; before I pass on to other services&mdash;to explain the purpose and provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the eleventh Telephone Capital Bill to come before Dáil Éireann since the transfer of services in 1922 and the sixth since the War. Its purpose is, briefly, to authorise the Minister for Finance to advance moneys, up to a limit of £50 million, for continued development of the telephone service.  The advances will be made as required over the next five years approximately.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the telephone service falls under two main heads.  Ordinary day-to-day operation and maintenance are paid for out of moneys voted annually by the Oireachtas under the Vote for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Extension and development, on the other hand, are covered by funds provided under Telephone Capital Acts.</P>
    <P>These Acts empower the Minister for Finance to issue out of the Central Fund sums for development of the telephone service.  The issues are made on foot of annual Capital Works Estimates approved by the Minister for Finance.  The Acts also authorise the Minister for Finance to borrow in order to meet or repay the issues from the Central Fund.  The moneys required for repayment of the sums borrowed are provided annually under subhead G of the Post Office Vote.</P>
    <P>The Telephone Capital Act, 1963, passed in December, 1963, authorised the Minister for Finance to issue a total of £30 million which it was estimated would be spent on telephone development in the following five years.  There had been on hands at 1st April, 1963, a balance of £2,555,000 from previous legislation.  Expenditure during the five years ended 31st March last amounted to £28,897,000 leaving a balance of £3,658,000.  This balance is insufficient to cover the estimated requirements for the current financial year.</P>
    <P>The amount of £28.9 million approximately was spent in the last five financial years as to £13.9 million for <Col N="1861" /> subscribers' lines and installations, £7.1 million for exchanges, £6 million for trunk routes and the balance on buildings, stockholdings and investment in communication satellites.  During this period 76,000 new subscribers' lines were connected to the system, 209,000 miles of new trunk circuits were added and 479 kiosks were erected.  Over 190 important trunk schemes&mdash;underground or overhead cables or radio links&mdash;were completed.  These included Waterford - Clonmel, Carlow - Athy-Portlaoise, Dublin - Wicklow - Arklow, Waterford-Wexford-Enniscorthy, Lim-erick-Athlone-Galway and Limerick-Tralee-Killarney. Two hundred and twenty manual telephone exchanges were converted to automatic working and the capacity of existing automatic exchanges was increased by 54,000 terminations.</P>
    <P>When my predecessor was introducing the last Telephone Capital Bill in 1963 he emphasised that the main effort would be concentrated on improving the quality of the service to existing users at the expense of delaying connections of new telephones and running up the waiting list.  This policy was followed, but from 1965-66 on when the trunk capacity of the system had been greatly enlarged it was possible to devote more engineering effort to providing service for new applicants and the waiting list was substantially reduced.</P>
    <P>Before going on to describe in some detail how the £50 million capital will be expended in the next five years, I should like to make some general observations.</P>
    <P>At present we are entering on a period which I am convinced will be one of great opportunity as well as of challenge for development of the telephone service, to the immense benefit of the whole community.  A first-class telephone service is today essential to industrial and commercial progress because efficiency and competitiveness depend more and more on reliable and rapid communications.  The telephone is at the nerve-centre of the nation's economic life.  Socially also, its value is high contributing so much as it does to the improvement of the general <Col N="1862" /> standard of living.  In this country we are at a comparatively early stage of telephone development and I am convinced that with rising living standards and the growth of industry and business there are boundless opportunities for rapid expansion.  But this expansion can be brought about only by a succession of planned development programmes adequately financed.</P>
    <P>As has often been said before, but is still perhaps not fully appreciated, major telephone development plans take five years to mature in working equipment.  Sometimes where new sites and buildings are needed the time interval is even longer.  It is clearly impossible to develop the service adequately unless there is a firm assurance that capital moneys to meet forward commitments will be available.  &ldquo;Stop-go&rdquo; conditions of which there has been some unfortunate experience on occasions in the past are an impossible handicap to development.  I am fully confident that they will not be permitted to recur and that the sum of £50 million which I am asking for in this Bill will be made available year by year as required.</P>
    <P>The amount provided for in the Bill now before you represents our estimate of the cost of the works programme which it is hoped to carry out in the next five years or so.  This programme can be considered under the following main heads:</P>
    <P>Connection of new subscribers' lines,</P>
    <P>New exchanges and extensions,</P>
    <P>Trunk system,</P>
    <P>Exchange buildings,</P>
    <P>Miscellaneous developments.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made for a net increase of about 115,000 subscribers' lines representing a growth rate of 9.4 per cent per annum as compared with 7 per cent in the 1963-1968 period. This connection programme will entail extensive cabling in all built-up areas sufficient to cater for these demands and to cater for more rapid growth after 1973.</P>
    <P>Four new automatic exchanges will be opened in the Dublin area and one in Limerick.  A new trunk exchange will be brought into full service in Dublin and another in Cork.  A new <Col N="1863" /> international exchange will also be provided in Dublin to cater for our foreign traffic which, except for that with the United States, has hitherto been handled by the London International Exchange.  At present some 83 per cent of subscribers have connection to automatic exchanges; it is essential under modern conditions that this percentage be raised as rapidly as possible. Plans are far advanced in some instances and in preparation in others with this object in view.  It is hoped to convert exchanges with over 100 subscribers (and a very great number with fewer) to automatic working in the next five year period.  In all it is hoped to convert some 300 exchanges in the next five year period including the larger exchanges at Wexford, Killarney, Clonmel, Castlebar, Ballina and Monaghan. Along with this it is planned to increase the capacity of all existing automatic exchanges and to raise the spare capacity to a level adequate to provide for further expansion and prevent delays in connecting new subscribers' lines where demand grows suddenly.</P>
    <P>I have already referred in discussing the Estimate for the current year to some major trunk cabling and radio links on which work is in progress at present.  Further extensive trunk circuiting schemes will be needed throughout the country to keep ahead of the growth of traffic estimated to rise at 15 per cent per annum and to provide the extra circuits needed under automatic conditions.  Some of the principal schemes planned for the next few years in addition to those I have mentioned are: Athlone-Ballinasloe-Loughrea-Galway, Kilkenny-Castle-comer-Freshford, Cork-Cobh, Water-ford-Clonmel-Limerick, Bantry-Glen-garriff, Limerick-Shannon-Ennis.  Substantial amounts of additional equipment will also be provided at various centres to switch dialled calls throughout the network.  The cost of the buildings required for exchanges and other equipment is estimated at £2.5 million.</P>
    <P>It is planned to introduce subscriber trunk dialling to London and Belfast in about 12 months time when additional <Col N="1864" /> circuits will have become available from the new cross-channel radio link.  The way will also be paved for extension of subscriber trunk dialling to other places in Britain and in Continental Europe.</P>
    <P>The provision of the trunk dialling facility for coin-box telephones is desirable both for its usefulness to the public and to reduce operating costs.  It is planned to introduce this new type of coin-box early in 1971 when the changeover to decimal currency occurs.</P>
    <P>A further improvement development under study is the transmission of computer data over telephone lines.  Such facilities are already provided on a limited scale but with increasing use of computers this service is expected to grow.  Although the capital/revenue effects will be small the contribution to business efficiency and cost cutting will be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Some mobile exchanges will be purchased to give short-term relief in some instances and to be available as reserves in the event of emergencies, such as destruction of an exchange by fire.  It is expected to provide some 500 kiosks in the next five years.</P>
    <P>Over the past five years the work force of skilled and semi-skilled technicians required for large scale expansion has been built up and more are in training.  Moreover, industrial consultants have been employed for a period of 18 months from whose recommendations it is hoped to secure a substantial increase in productivity by use of more mechanical aids and better organisation.  Professional engineers have not become available in as large numbers as would be desired but there are grounds for hoping that this difficulty may be surmounted.</P>
    <P>I should like now to say a word about the financial position of the telephone service.  Apart from the direct contribution the service makes to economic progress it is a sound commercial proposition.  The return on capital in recent years has been: 1963-64, 6.6 per cent; 1964-65, 7.1 per cent; 1965-66, 7.5 per cent; 1966-67, 6.3 per cent; 1967-68, 7.3 per cent.</P>
    <P>If the service were allowed to reinvest <Col N="1865" /> its surplus and depreciation provision it would be able to finance about 40 per cent of its capital requirements from its own resources.  Allowing for a modest profit averaging, say, £1/2 million per annum, depreciation plus profit would supply about £22 million of the £50 million capital required for the next five year programme.  In effect, therefore, the Exchequer will be called upon to provide only about £5.5 million net, per annum, and interest will, of course, be paid on all sums invested by the Exchequer in the service.</P>
    <P>Not merely, then, is an adequate communications system an essential requirement of the community but it is one that can be provided with the expenditure of comparatively small capital sums which will be fully remunerated. The moneys to be provided under this Bill will enable the service to be continuously improved, to make a modest profit for the taxpayer and to give employment to some hundreds of extra skilled and semi-skilled men as well as to many engineering graduates. I recommend the Bill to the House for approval.</P>
    <P>Deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank in 1967 amounted to £25.5 million and withdrawals to £23.6 million. The net increase in deposits was £1.9 million as compared with a net reduction of £2 million in 1966.  The improvement was no doubt due to the increase in the rate of interest from 2½ per cent to 3½ per cent payable from 1st January, 1967.  In 1968, deposits amounted to £23.9 million and withdrawals to £25.8 million.  The disimprovement in the position indicated by these figures occurred during the first nine months.  This could have been due to some extent, to the fact that during that period the commercial banks were paying 4½ per cent interest on deposits as against the Savings Bank rate of 3½ per cent.  When the commercial banks rate was reduced to 3½ per cent on 2nd October, 1968, Savings Bank business improved.  At 31st December, 1968, the total balance due to depositors, including some £4 million interest, was £118.3 million as compared with £116.3 million at the end of the previous year, an increase of £2 million.</P>
    <P>The increase in the Post Office <Col N="1866" /> Savings Bank rate of interest to 4 per cent as from 1st January, 1969, coupled with the improved withdrawal facilities &mdash;the amount withdrawable on demand was raised from £10 to £30 and that by telegraph from £25 to £100 &mdash; are expected to improve further the performance of the Savings Bank.</P>
    <P>In 1967, deposits in the Trustee Savings Banks exceeded withdrawals by £0.5 million.  In 1968 withdrawals from their ordinary accounts exceeded deposits by £1.3 million but this was no doubt due to the transfer of funds to their new 6½ per cent investment accounts.  Net deposits in these accounts, which are in existence only since 21st November, 1968, had reached £1.7 million by the end of the year. The total amount, including interest, to the credit of the Trustee Savings Banks at 31st December, 1968, was £22.5 million, an increase of £1.3 million over the previous year.</P>
    <P>Sales of Savings Certificates for 1967 amounted to £8.2 million, and repayments, including interest, amounted to £6.1 million.  The corresponding figures for 1968 were £6.7 million and £6.1 million respectively.  The principal invested at the end of 1968 was £47 million, as compared with £45.1 million at the end of 1967 and £41.6 million at the end of 1966.</P>
    <P>The decline in sales of Savings Certificates from the peak figure of £11.9 million in 1966, during which the present Seventh Issue was launched, follows the normal pattern.  In spite of the falling off, sales for 1968 were higher than in any year prior to 1966.</P>
    <P>The new 6½ per cent Investment Bonds were introduced on 1st January, 1969.  Purchases during the first month amounted to £1.8 million.  There has been an appreciable outflow of funds from the Post Office Savings Bank and Savings Certificates into Investment Bonds.  Moreover, this new savings medium has probably attracted money which would otherwise have gone into the older securities.  It is too soon to make any assessment of the amounts involved in this diversion of funds but it appears that the greater part of the intake of Investment Bonds is new savings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1867" /> A new 2s Saving Stamp was introduced on 1st August, 1968.  A new design for the older 6d Savings Stamp has been adopted and is expected to appear about Easter.  These stamps are largely used as the basis of savings schemes in National and Vocational Schools, managed voluntarily by teachers, under the auspices of the National Savings Committee.  I should like to take this opportunity to record my appreciation, and that of the Minister for Finance, of the excellent work being done by the National Savings Committee in promoting national savings.  I should like to acknowledge, too, the valuable contribution made by teachers and all other voluntary workers in the savings movement.</P>
    <P>In 1967 money orders valued at £34.4 million were issued as compared with £47.8 million in 1966 when money order business was abnormally high owing to the bank strike.  The value of orders issued last year was much the same as in 1967.</P>
    <P>The value of postal orders issued in 1966 was £8.8 million.  This dropped to £8.6 million in 1967 but increased again to £8.9 million in 1968.</P>
    <P>Agency service payments made by the post office, mainly on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare, increased from £47.6 million in 1966 to £50 million in 1967 and to £55 million in 1968.  Post offices again took part in the half-yearly sales of Prize Bonds, handling about 30 per cent of the total amount collected.</P>
    <P>In 1967 new automatic telephone exchange buildings were erected at Castleblayney, Swords (Co. Dublin), Gorey, Skibbereen and at 63 rural centres.  Extensions to the exchange buildings at Dennehy's Cross (Cork) and Walkinstown (Dublin) and to the Portlaoise co-axial Repeater Station were completed.  Additional office accommodation was provided at the Distillery Road (Dublin) Engineering Depot and at Cork.  Improvement works were carried out at Blackrock (Co. Dublin) and Westport Post Offices.  The new Central Sorting Office building at Sheriff Street, Dublin, was fully equipped and occupied.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1868" /> Works completed in 1968 included a new head post office and engineering centre at Carlow; new telephone exchange buildings at Lucan (Co. Dublin), Rochestown Avenue (Dún Laoghaire), Cahirciveen, Castlerea, Dungarvan, Fermoy, Gort, Killarney, Muinebheag and Skibbereen; 58 exchange buildings at rural centres; extensions to Wexford and Skerries (Co. Dublin) telephone exchanges and improvements at Enniscorthy, Kinsale, Tuam and Tullamore Post Offices.</P>
    <P>Works in progress include the construction of extensive new warehouses at St. John's Road Stores Depot; new post office premises, including telephone exchange and area engineering depot, at Claremorris and Macroom; new telephone exchange and area engineering depot at Newcastlewest; improvements at Tipperary Post Office and new telephone exchange buildings at Ballina, Tullow and at some 40 rural centres.</P>
    <P>Special attention has been given to the improvement of facilities for staff training.  Premises were acquired at Sligo for a further engineering training centre and additional accommodation for the training of engineering and other staffs is being provided in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The number of staff provided for in the Estimate is 19,108, an increase of 228 on the figure for 1967/68.  This increase is mainly attributable to the expansion of the telephone service.</P>
    <P>An adequate force of professionally qualified engineers is essential for the planning and supervision of the telephone development programme and for ensuring that the ever-growing system is properly maintained.  We have not, because of the general shortage of engineers, as yet got as many as we need, but we are making good progress. We are recruiting, both by way of Civil Service Commission competitions and directly, as many qualified engineers as we can get.  The various university faculties are co-operating with us in meeting our needs.  In addition, we are recruiting engineers-to-be by way of scholarship schemes.  We are already operating for some time past two scholarship schemes, one for non-professional grades in the Department and the second for Leaving Certificate <Col N="1869" /> holders.  This year a third scheme is being introduced for students who have successfully completed two years or more of an appropriate engineering or scientific course.  These scholarships will entitle the students to receive pay during their studies and their fees will be paid by the Department.  I am confident that these schemes will be of definite assistance in securing more engineers for the Department in the future.</P>
    <P>We also need an adequate force of skilled technicians for the practical work on both telephone development and maintenance.  This force, which is already quite large, is being built up by way of the Department's scheme for technician trainees.  There are some 350 young men in training at present, about a hundred of whom were recruited in 1967 and 85 in 1968.  In 1964, the intake under this scheme was expanded substantially, and the benefits are beginning to be felt.  Early in 1968 some 70 trainees recruited in 1964 became available for technician work.</P>
    <P>During 1967 a number of additional welfare officers were appointed, and three more were appointed during 1968.</P>
    <P>The Post Office is one of the biggest employers in the country, its staff representing about 1.7 per cent of the total working population.  Owing to the character of its services, it is largely a labour-intensive organisation and one of its main objectives is to make the best use of its manpower.  Over the years there has, in fact, been a determined and sustained drive by the Department to effect improvements and economies by more extensive use of mechanical aids and efficient methods. Typical of these efforts are the gradual motorisation of postal deliveries and collections and the automatisation of the telephone service by the conversion of manual exchanges to automatic working.</P>
    <P>To supplement the work of ten fulltime departmental organisation and methods staff, outside experts have been called in on various problems.  As I mentioned last year, a firm of consultants was commissioned to carry out an extensive review of the organisation, <Col N="1870" /> grading and methods of work in the Department's Engineering Branch, and they have now reported on their review. When their various recommendations have been examined and tentative proposals formulated, the staff organisations will be consulted and their co-operation sought.  I am hopeful that, in a joint effort, it will be possible to increase productivity substantially. Growth in productivity resulting from the better utilisation of manpower will result in greater rewards for the staff both financially and in terms of job satisfaction.  Since the telecommunications services are expanding rapidly, the staff need have no fears that any redundancy will follow the adoption of better methods and better organisation of work.  I feel confident, therefore, that the staff will welcome changes, the object of which is to raise productivity.</P>
    <P>Automatic data processing is another field in which consultants have been called upon to assist.  Automatic data processing has been used in telephone accounting and Savings Bank work for some years past.  Consultants were engaged some time ago to assist in an examination of the economics of extending its use, including computerisation, in various branches of the Department's activities.  Tenders for the supply of a computer system have been received and are being examined at present.  I should, perhaps, mention that, as the delivery of computers and the associated ancillary equipment takes time, and, as there will be a very large volume of preparatory systems analysis and programming work to be done, the change-over to computer working in any part of the Department's operations will not occur for some considerable time.</P>
    <P>The Department also benefits from its participation in the activities of the Universal Postal Union and the International Telecommunications Union. These organisations, in addition to their co-ordinating and regulatory functions, give the Department access to information on new techniques and equipment, to the advice of experts, and to the experience and experiments of other postal and telecommunications administrations.</P>
    <P>Finally, various aspects of the <Col N="1871" /> Department came under examination as part of the general examination of the higher organisation of the Civil Service that is being made by a group appointed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Relations between the staff and the Department have continued to be good and this is borne out by the fact that the Department's services have been operated efficiently and to the satisfaction of the public generally.  The number of complaints from the public in proportion to the volume, variety and complexities of the Department's work is and has been extremely small.  It is worth recalling that the greater part of the Department's work has to be performed under pressure and much of it at unsocial hours.</P>
    <P>While there is almost continuous consultation between the Departmental and staff representatives at various levels on a variety of matters, the main channel of negotiation on pay and conditions between the unions representing the staff and the Department is the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme, agreed between the Minister for Finance and the organisations representing the great majority of civil servants, including those in the Post Office.  Through it the staff have over the last couple of years secured higher pay and increased allowances, reductions in the length of the working week, longer annual holidays, and quite a number of other benefits.  Major pay agreements have been negotiated over the past few months with most of the Post Office grades arising out of the 11th wage round.  It is mainly because of the cumulative effect of the increased costs arising from these various settlements or awards that charges for various services have had to be increased.</P>
    <P>There were, however, regrettably some disturbances in the Department's normally good relations with the staff and in the devoted service the staff give to the public.</P>
    <P>A new breakaway organisation, calling itself the Post Office Officials' Association, and claiming to represent a number of grades, already catered for by existing staff organisations, called a strike in February, 1968, to <Col N="1872" /> compel the Department to negotiate with it on its own terms and in defiance of the wishes of the other staff organisations. The very limited support the strike received from the staff indicated very clearly the minority nature of the new organisation.  The strike caused unnecessary inconvenience to the public mainly as a result of the support given it by the Sub-Postmasters' Union, a body not affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The strike naturally left in its wake some rancour and bitterness among the staff, and the breakaway Association mounted a few local agitations designed to interfere with the service to the public and to embarrass the other staff organisations, but without much success.  There are two peaceful courses, at least, open to the Association, either to seek to join in the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme with the rest of the Civil Service or to avail itself of an offer of the services of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to help resolve any difficulties its members may have with their former unions.</P>
    <P>In August last a group of postal sorters in Dublin imposed an unofficial ban on overtime in connection with a pay claim being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme. The initial cause of the dissatisfaction was apparently a decision of their union's annual conference about the nature of the claim to be made.  The action was abandoned after a fortnight but not, regrettably, before it had caused delay to mails, with consequent inconvenience to the public.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, such interference with the service to the public is contrary to the great tradition of the Post Office staff.  Most Post Office workers are aware that in addition to their responsibilities as civil servants they are engaged in a vital communications industry in monopoly conditions and any interruption of its services can have far-reaching consequences, affecting industry, trade and the public generally.  They know that they are in permanent pensionable employment, enjoying good pay and other favourable conditions of employment, including promotion prospects, and that they are sheltered from the <Col N="1873" /> effects of industrial action elsewhere, unlike many other workers; protective notices have never been issued in the Post Office.  There are orderly means available to them through which they can process any claims and grievances they may have.  In matters of pay and conditions, an arbitration board is available if agreement cannot be reached in negotiation.  On my side, I recognise that it is essential to good staff relations that there should be effective negotiation machinery, sound grievance procedures and adequate communications.  There have been discussions between the various civil service staff associations and the Ministers for Finance and Labour on desirable changes in the existing negotiation machinery for the Civil Service generally.  Discussions were also opened during the year at the Post Office Departmental Council to examine whether changes are desirable in the existing communications systems and grievance procedures.</P>
    <P>The commercial accounts for 1967-68 have been laid on the table of the House.  A summary of the results for the five preceding years is given in Appendix C to the Estimate.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the commercial accounts present the position of the Department as a trading concern. They are compiled in accordance with commercial practice to show the expenditure incurred and the income earned during the year of account, such charges as interest and depreciation being included in the expenditure. A balance sheet and statement of assets give details of the Department's very large capital investments, mainly in telephone plant.  The accounts are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>It is on the basis of these accounts that we determine financial policy, including the fixing of charges.  The basic principle of that policy is that the Post Office should pay its way, taking one year with another.  That means that the Department must earn a surplus in good years to meet the losses in bad years and to provide a reserve against contingencies.  If the Post Office does not pay its way, the loss has to be made good by taxpayers generally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1874" /> There was an overall loss on the Department's services in 1967/68 of £467,000 following a loss of £430,000 in the previous year.  In each of these years there was a deficit on the postal and telegraph services and a surplus on the telephone side.</P>
    <P>About 60 per cent of the Department's expenditure is on wages, salaries and related payments for superannuation, etc.  Any general upward trend in staff costs therefore quickly affects the Department's financial position.  Staff claims cost the Department £1,000,000 in 1966/67, and £340,000 in 1967/68. The current round of pay increases will cost £1.8 million in 1968/69.  Increased prices, higher payments to foreign administrations and higher interest and depreciation charges are other important cost factors which have contributed to the losses mentioned.  Since higher staff costs are the biggest contributing factor, I should like to say at this point that the improvements in pay and conditions obtained by Post Office staffs have been secured under conciliation and arbitration machinery which operates largely on the basis of comparisons with pay and conditions outside the Post Office.  I consider it just and fair that settlements arrived at in this way should be implemented in full.  I do not think any Deputy will dissent from the view that Post Office employees should receive a reasonable return for their services.  In accepting this, we must also accept that, in so far as pay increases or other increases cannot be met from increased business or from higher productivity, they must inevitably&mdash;in the Post Office as elsewhere&mdash;result in higher prices.</P>
    <P>Taking into account the increased Post Office charges operative from 1st January, 1969, it is expected that the deficit&mdash;the third in a row&mdash;will be about £750,000 in the current financial year.  If the charges had not been increased, it is estimated that a further deficit&mdash;of the order of £3 million&mdash; would be incurred next year.</P>
    <P>The Post Office has always been a cost-conscious organisation; and it will be clear from what I have already said in reporting upon the various services that a considerable programme of modernisation and improvements, including <Col N="1875" /> measures to improve productivity generally, is being pushed ahead vigorously.  But it is quite certain that the amount in question could not be found by economies, greater efficiency or increased business.</P>
    <P>It has been settled policy that the Post Office should pay its way and there was no reason for any departure from that policy.  In short, therefore, there was no alternative to raising charges.</P>
    <P>The changes in rates have already been published, but there are some general observations I wish to make on them.</P>
    <P>On the postal side, staff and related costs constitute some 77 per cent of total expenditure.  Postal business grows very slowly&mdash;since 1964 it has grown by about 7 per cent to 8 per cent.  The nature of the mails, which consist of a huge volume of low-priced items requiring individual handling at various stages, limits the opportunities for mechanisation and for increasing the productivity of the large labour force employed.  Moreover, it is necessary to provide extra postmen, delivery offices, etc., in new housing estates in the cities and towns but the decline in population elsewhere does not enable proportionate reductions in staff or facilities to be made.  In many rural areas wage costs alone on rural delivery have been well over 1/- per item.</P>
    <P>The postal increases were designed to secure maximum revenue without raising the minimum letter rate above 6d.  Even without allowing for some reduction in postings, which is usual immediately following rate increases, the yield from the revised rates will not fully cover estimated expenditure.  To cover it and provide a margin for contingencies would require a 7d letter rate.  It is necessary therefore to consider further what changes and economies can be made to reduce expenditure. The difficulty here is that only major changes in the service, changes of a kind which would reduce the labour-content substantially, would be effective in reducing costs significantly. Whether changes of this kind, for instance, reduced frequencies of delivery, roadside and garden-gate <Col N="1876" /> letter-boxes (which are common in the USA, Sweden and other highly-developed countries) would be generally acceptable here is not at all certain but if we wish to retain the traditional standards we must be prepared to pay the costs involved.  While, overall, postal charges have not risen to the same extent as staff costs, it is clear that if postal pay rates continue to rise &mdash;as they have done&mdash;much faster than postal traffic, further adjustment of postage rates will be unavoidable.</P>
    <P>The telegraph service has never paid its way.  We face a continuing loss on this service and the increased rates are intended to keep the loss within reasonable limits.  There has, however, been no increase in Telex rentals or call charges.  I have already referred to the reduction in Telex rentals granted late in 1967.</P>
    <P>Although telephone business has been growing rapidly, telephone costs &mdash;particularly staff costs, interest on capital and provision for depreciation &mdash;have also been rising steeply.  In order to ensure the continued profitability of the services and an adequate return on capital, increases in telephone charges were unavoidable.</P>
    <P>The higher charges are intended to yield a return on net telephone assets of approximately 9 per cent before charging interest.  Having regard to the heavy investment in the service and current high interest rates, this is not an unreasonable target.</P>
    <P>The increases in rentals, in the connection fee for new lines and in local call fees are needed to cover higher costs in providing subscribers' lines and local plant.  The average cost of providing a subscriber's line is now estimated at over £150.  The interest charge on this alone is over £11 a year at current rates leaving a small margin for maintenance costs and depreciation.  The connection fee as revised is still substantially below what is charged in many other administrations.</P>
    <P>An increase in local call fees could be avoided only by increasing trunk fees.  It was considered undesirable to increase trunk charges because one of the best ways of encouraging the telephone habit is to keep charges for long distance calls down and because improvements <Col N="1877" /> in techniques have tended to reduce the costs of providing trunk circuits.  On the other hand, local calls are still good value at the revised rates. One can, for instance, make a call from Greystones to Balbriggan, a distance of about 35 miles, at the local rate and most of County Clare is within the local range.  Local calls are, moreover, untimed.  Ten years ago millions of such calls were charged for as trunk calls at 10d or more per three minutes. The increase from 4d to 6d for local calls from coinboxes is necessary for a number of reasons.  The present coinboxes would not take five pennies and new coinboxes capable of taking them would be difficult and costly to procure. On the practical level, the balance of advantage undoubtedly lies in having coinboxes capable of taking 6d pieces. People are much more likely to have a 6d piece rather than five pennies when they need to make a coinbox call.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that I decided not to increase trunk call charges.  In fact, some trunk charges have been reduced.  I also decided to reduce the effect of the rate increases on applicants for telephones in rural areas by relaxing the requirement in regard to payment of rental in advance for telephone lines serving premises outside one mile from the exchange. Given the situation which I have out-lined, the House will, I am sure, agree that the rate increases were unavoidable.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude my review of the recent past and outline of plans for the immediate future by saying that I am also giving sustained consideration to the long-term future of the Department and of its services.  I do not propose to go into detail about this aspect but I should like to assure the House that I and the officers of my Department are giving much thought as to how best the various services can be developed in the long-term, what new services should be introduced to meet the changing needs of the public, how the services can be most efficiently financed, and what staffing arrangements are likely to be required in the future.  As I mentioned last year, the status and basic organisation of the Department are under reconsideration. <Col N="1878" /> To those questions, and to the many others likely to arise, the answers most effective from the point of view of service to the public, no matter how radical the action required may be, will be sought.</P>
    <P>In accordance with practice in previous years I propose to confine my remarks to important developments in the broadcasting services and to matters in which, as Minister, I have a statutory function.</P>
    <P>The total amount to be paid to the Broadcasting Authority under Subhead K in respect of net revenue collected in the form of licence fees is estimated at £2,150,000.  This includes a carry-over of £110,000 in respect of receipts in excess of the subhead provision for 1967-68.  It also includes provision for further growth of receipts in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>On the basis that £1 5s of each £5 licence fee is intended for the sound broadcasting service, a sum of £716,500 is being provided for sound broadcasting and £1,433,500 for television. The amount thus allocated to sound broadcasting together with advertising revenue on the radio side, will fall short by some £400,000 of estimated expenditure on that service in 1968-69.  This deficit will be made good out of the Authority's general revenue.</P>
    <P>When introducing the Estimate for 1967-68 I mentioned that owing to progressively increasing costs the Authority thought it likely that its annual overall surplus would continue to decline and would be converted to a substantial deficit in 1968-69.  I am glad to say that the position has turned out to be better than was then anticipated. The Authority's Annual Report for 1968, which has been laid before the House, shows an overall surplus of £371,000 odd in 1967-68 as compared with £105,000 for the previous year.  The television service produced a profit of £666,000 which was offset by a deficit of £295,000 on sound broadcasting.  The improvement in the general financial position was due partly to the success of the campaign in October, 1967, against holders of unlicensed sets, and partly to an increase in advertising revenue. <Col N="1879" /> The Authority point out in their Annual Report that their income whether from licence fees or advertisement sales is directly related to the number of licensed receivers but that the number of receivers must now be expected to level off rapidly.  On the other hand, improvements in the quality of programmes and an extension of their scope will inevitably give rise to increasing costs.  Moreover, the large and continuing deficit on the sound broadcasting service reduces considerably the resources available to the Authority for financing the capital expenditure necessary for the development of the services.  The present licence fees have remained unchanged since 1963.</P>
    <P>Relevant figures are: licence fee combined £4 in 1962 as against £5 in 1969, an increase of 25 per cent.  In the same period industrial earnings have advanced by an average of 63 per cent and average social insurance payments by 105 per cent.  The television licence fee works out at less than a halfpenny per programme hour.  In the period during which the present fees have been in operation, despite increases in cost, the output and quality of programmes have been considerably improved and the radio programme has been greatly extended. The Authority state they will not be in a position to meet the commitments involved in their plans for further improvements and contribute to the necessary capital expenditure without a significant increase in the level of licence fees.  The Authority have put their case for an increase formally to me and it is at present being considered.</P>
    <P>The grant of free receiving licences to certain old age pensioners and others came into operation on 1st July last. The cost is being borne by the Exchequer. In the first six months of the scheme's operation about 19,000 free licences were issued by my Department to eligible persons, that is, 11,000 combined and 8,000 sound licences.  About 15,000 of the recipients held licences previously&mdash;9,000 combined and 6,000 sound.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1880" /> There are now approximately 185,000 sound and 395,000 combined licences &mdash;that is, 580,000 licences altogether. In fairness to the holders of these licences it is important that unlicensed holders should be detected and it is proposed to take more effective measures towards this end.  Within a few months it is hoped to have the most modern kind of detection van in service.  New legislation to help with the problem is being prepared.  The provisions proposed include heavier fines for licence defaulters and the keeping of records by radio/television dealers and rental companies.</P>
    <P>For the past three years the Authority has been financing its capital programme as well as its operating expenditure from its own resources.  Last year, 1967-68, RTE's capital expenditure amounted to £500,000 approximately which was incurred mainly on the provision of an additional television outside broadcasting unit, general broadcasting equipment, completion of the Donnybrook television building and the purchase of St. Andrew's School grounds to cater for further growth of the broadcasting services.  In the current year RTE will spend about the same amount &mdash; again from its own resources&mdash;on a number of projects, including the extension of filming and recording facilities, general radio and television equipment and initial expenditure on a new radio centre.</P>
    <P>In view of certain correspondence in the Press suggesting extravagance in RTE, I would like to point out that a comparison made in 1967 of costs per hour of programmes in various television services showed that RTE had the lowest cost per hour for television broadcasting.  The figures for all-in cost per hour were Britain (BBC) £5,249, Sweden £3,907, Denmark, £2,688, Netherlands £2,423, Norway £1,824 and RTE £1,290.  I have naturally urged the Board to maintain this excellent record in the face of rising costs as far as possible.</P>
    <P>During the past year I approved a proposal by the Authority to extend the hours of sound broadcasting from 96 to 118 per week so as to enable the Authority to operate the radio service <Col N="1881" /> continuously from early morning to midnight.  The extended service came into operation on 2nd November in conjunction with a comprehensive revision of sound broadcasting programmes. The changes are intended to cater more fully for the changed pattern of listening brought about by, among other things, the extensive spread of television viewing and the widespread use of transistor radios. Part of the additional cost will be met from extra fees for advertising, which will be mostly in the form of &ldquo;spots&rdquo; in programmes provided by the Authority rather than sponsored programmes provided by or on behalf of the advertiser.  The initiative taken by the Authority in this regard will, I am confident, be welcomed generally.</P>
    <P>Last year I referred to the completion during the previous year of the last two of the five main VHF transmitters. I mentioned that four subsidiary transmitters were to be provided, namely, at Moville, Fanad, Castletown-Berehaven and Cahirciveen. All four will, it is hoped, be brought into operation before the end of this financial year.  When the operation is completed VHF reception will be available over 99 per cent of the country.</P>
    <P>During the past year I received complaints of unsatisfactory television reception in certain areas.  Existing transmitters and transposers give coverage to about 98 per cent of the country.  The remaining 2 per cent is made up of small areas which have been the subject of a most detailed survey which has been completed by the Authority.  The survey covers the quality of reception in each of 900 communities comprising 20 or more households, the population affected and the capital investment per area or &ldquo;pocket&rdquo; which would be necessary to improve the quality of service there. For each &ldquo;pocket&rdquo; a <i>per capita</i> capital cost figure is being worked out.  As I have said before, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to give completely satisfactory coverage in all areas without incurring prohibitive expenditure. I understand that the selection of areas where extra transposers will be provided should be completed shortly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1882" /> That brings me to the matter of colour television about which I was asked a few questions in this House&mdash; the most recent one being in June last. I pointed to the more pressing needs of the broadcasting service which must be looked at before there can be any question of introducing colour television.  It is unlikely that the Authority will be in a position to start a colour television service for some years.  The engineering staff concerned are, however, keeping closely in touch with technical developments in this field.</P>
    <P>The Broadcasting (Offences) Act, 1968, which is intended to deal with the problem of &ldquo;pirate&rdquo; broadcasting stations on ships and structures outside national territories came into operation on 18th October, 1968, and the Council of Europe Agreement on this subject has since been ratified on behalf of the Government.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that every Deputy will have his own views on RTE programmes, particularly those on television. For my own part the Authority is to be congratulated on many excellent programmes, both sound and television, broadcast since the last Estimate was taken.  There were, of course, some in which I found cause for criticism. On occasion I have passed on my views&mdash;favourable or unfavourable&mdash;to the Authority for consideration.  I would recommend Deputies and others to do likewise.  I am sure that anything Deputies may have to say on programmes will carefully be considered by the Authority, every member of which recognises that criticism and controversy are not only inseparable from broadcasting but indeed essential to it.  It is evident from viewing foreign television and from a study of intelligent debate on the effects of TV on the public mind that the establishment is always on the defensive.  It is essential, therefore, that in all current affairs discussions there should be adequate background briefing and balanced discussion, otherwise such discussions become merely shock creating and in relation to what is practicable contribute little to the ultimate solution that must be found.</P>
    <P>One aspect on which I consider RTE to have earned special commendation <Col N="1883" /> is the very marked development that has been undertaken in the realm of programmes of the public service type.  This includes the Telefís Scoile series, for which I approved an extension of programme time to the present total of 5½ hours weekly.  The current series is planned to comprise 246 programmes aimed at secondary schools and covering a wide range of subjects selected in consultation with the Department of Education, which bears the costs involved.  Other public service programmes, with which Deputies are no doubt more familiar because they are shown during the evening hours, are the farming features such as &ldquo;On the Land&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mart and Market&rdquo;; &ldquo;Radharc&rdquo;; &ldquo;Work&rdquo; and the various documentaries on the Continent.</P>
    <P>In connection with programmes on current affairs and news bulletins, I have on a number of occasions indicated some objectives which I consider should be aimed at.  My observations in replying to the debate on the last Estimate and speeches made since then, the most recent of which was in Seanad Éireann on 15th January, constitute what seems to me to be a constructive policy in this regard.  News programmes should include a high proportion of constructive and praiseworthy developments and advancement in the national and international sphere and should inculcate love of our cultural heritage.  Achievements should not be glossed over or taken for granted because, if there are not newspaper or broadcast reports about progress, the tendency is to assume that no progress is in fact being made. How many people in a hundred thousand can recount any details of solid development made in Africa or Asia?  The world is living in a constant state of shock because of sensational reporting.</P>
    <P>If current affairs programmes are designed to make viewers think constructively on social, economic and moral problems, this helps to build bridges between groups in the community holding widely different viewpoints, and avoids the creation of <Col N="1884" /> abysses between different groups.  There is one essential difference between this country and many abroad.  The vast majority of the people subscribe to the Christian faith.  The most easy path to sensational shock-creating broadcasting is to cast doubt on every form of philosophy which embraces fundamental truths based on revealed religion.</P>
    <P>In this connection I feel bound to state that I have been receiving criticism of RTE Current Affairs programmes from many people of widely different political and social view-points. This criticism can be expressed in the following way.  A national broadcasting service should not follow the prevailing trend of stirring up protest in such a way as to emphasise all the weaknesses of human nature and defects in the social and economic structure leaving not an impression of constructive policies to be pursued but a cynical and destructive impact on the viewer and listener.  I wish to make it clear that whatever be the practice in other countries the standards of RTE in encouraging constructive thinking and positive solutions for problems must be of the highest order. If radical solutions are advocated for problems they must be examined both in regard to the current policies adopted by any institution and in regard to financial conditions where these apply.</P>
    <P>There are countries far wealthier than ours living under conditions of high taxation and of State and local authority intervention where there are unsolved problems.  There are countries where there is among young people a pervasive unrest whose principal cause is the absence of any philosophy to replace religious doctrine. Having regard to the majority view in this country on such matters, I will not have RTE used to create a murky cynical atmosphere in regard to what, ultimately, are problems due to inadequacies in character in people as a whole.</P>
    <P>I understand also that the Authority has taken steps to modify the recent trend in interviewing persons of all political and social opinions in a manner <Col N="1885" /> which has aroused the strongest criticism.</P>
    <P>The Authority, from my discussions with them, fully understand the responsibility of RTE in encouraging constructive discussion on controversial matters and I believe that they will continue to exercise control where this is required.  I am sure that RTE realises that the greatest care must be exercised in holding popular discussions on moral and religious questions to ensure that there are commentators present who can present the views of the great majority of our people.</P>
    <P>In striving to achieve these aims, I have the feeling that we in Ireland suffer from one great handicap.  Sometimes in discussion a lack of courage to speak out is evident among the more moderate section of the population, and their failure to express their views forcibly often creates difficulties for such bodies as RTE.  There is no problem in this country that cannot be tackled by discussions of a creative character and subsequent action taken in the private or public sector.  It is extremely important to give full weight to the financial aspect of changes in economic and social policies.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty which arises especially in a small country like ours where everyone knows everyone else, is in achieving balance within a very large category of programmes.  And, of course, as in common with all other countries we have problems to solve and priorities to determine, the existing establishments will always be on the defensive in some respect or another. There will always be differences of opinion and controversy, too, on what constitutes balance, and in this respect RTE faces the problem of all broadcasting organisations; they must choose between controversy and dullness.</P>
    <P>I would like, in conclusion, to pay tribute to the former Director-General of Radio Telefís Éireann, Mr. Kevin C. McCourt, who relinquished the post on 31st March last, and to welcome his successor, Mr. Thomas P. Hardiman, whose appointment I was most happy to approve.  I am sure I speak for every member of this House when I wish him well in his new assignment.</P>

      <P>The Minister has presented his Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and, at the same time, has spoken on the Telephone Capital Bill and it has been most interesting and informative. He has covered an immensely wide field and gave a vast amount of figures. Just before I get down to a detailed discussion of the Estimate for this very wide-embracing Department for which the Minister is responsible I should like to say&mdash;and I am sure the Minister would agree with me&mdash;it is a pity that the Estimate for the year under review is being taken so late.  We are now in the last day or two of February and the financial year which we are reviewing finishes within a month.  There is little or nothing this House can do by way of advice or discussion which can alter the Estimates as they are or alter the programme we are dealing with now with eleven twelfths of the year completed. If I enter a protest in that regard I hope it will have some effect on the Government.</P>
      <P>I know the programme of work in this House has been overloaded in the past 12 months but, nevertheless, a great deal of the overloading has arisen from the fact that we have had purely political matters pushed on to us.  We have had all about the referendum.  I do not propose to go into that but I do mention that we should have been dealing with this Estimate last May or June.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me on that.  The Government as a body should not have left the discussion of so important a matter as the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs so late in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It requires a good deal of discussion to deal thoroughly with Posts and Telegraphs which covers such a wide field.  The Minister mentioned that something like 19,000 people are employed by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and that this covers a substantial proportion of the total employment of the country.  In that connection&mdash;I may refer to this more fully later on&mdash;I am glad to see that there is constant co-operation and discussion with the employees in the Post Office <Col N="1887" /> and that very complicated machinery has been built up to deal with employment matters generally and with any breakdowns that may occur in communications between the postal authorities and the staff.  It is regrettable that we had strikes and threatened strikes but I am glad that the Post Office has, over the years, built up this very fine machinery and I trust that it will be availed of in the future to the extent to which it was always used in the past.  The Post Office has a very enviable record in staff and labour relations and I hope that those excellent relations will always continue.  I should like to raise one matter that was mentioned to me&mdash;the improvement in postal uniforms.  The public notices things like that and are proud of the uniforms which the postal men now wear.</P>
    <P>A big event in 1968 from the public's point of view was the increase in the Post Office charges.  A penny on a letter does not seem a whole lot for a private individual but it represents a 20 per cent increase.  For businesses which deal in many thousands of letters and postcards the increases range from 20 per cent on local letters to 33? per cent on postcards, parcels 25 per cent and foreign letters over 25 per cent. That represents a very heavy increase on the business community.  The Minister is aware of that and he dealt with it in his speech but, nevertheless, the increased charges will put up the general cost to the community.  I think the Minister mentioned a figure of something like 440 million letters handled in this country during 1967.  An increase of 20 per cent on all those letters puts the cost up to almost 100 million pennies which is a sizeable burden for the community to bear.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister mentioned that articles and literature for the blind have been accepted for transmission by post at nominal rates and that in response to representations he will introduce amending legislation to enable this type of postal matter to be transmitted free of postage.  That is a very good thing.  We on this side of the House welcome this innovation.  I do not know how far it <Col N="1888" /> follows custom in other countries but certainly it is something which all Irish people will approve of.</P>
    <P>It is good to see various events in Irish history commemorated, such as the birth of such famous people as Jonathan Swift and in more modern times that of Countess Markievicz. Those things help to keep Ireland on the international cultural map.  They also help to keep our people interested and in touch with the great persons and events of the past.  It is a very good thing to see.</P>
    <P>I see the telegraph service, as usual, loses money.  Perhaps, that is a regrettable thing.  I do not blame the Post Office for that.  It is apparently a worldwide tendency and I suppose people tend&mdash;a sign of rising standards of living&mdash;to use the telephone a great deal more.  The telex service also has increased, and the Minister mentioned something like gentex but I do not know exactly what that is.  The fact that the telex service is increasing is a sign of the increased use which our industries and trade generally are making of the postal service and the use we are making of modern communications.</P>
    <P>At this point&mdash;although I shall probably come back to it later&mdash;I should like to refer to what I see as the wind of change in the Post Office.  One can feel that changes for the good are taking place and that this service is coming forward to take its place in the modern world in which we live and is taking its place as a real assistant to industry, not just a service which, when one picks up the telephone, causes increasing frustration from the lack of contact.  That is changing, and it is good to see that the Post Office is very well aware of the necessity for that.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave details of the expansion of the telephone service.  I am glad to see that in the year ended 31st March, 1968, 19,000 subscribers were connected as compared with 15,000 the previous year.  The Minister stated in May last year that the Dublin waiting list stood at the figure of 2,638 and that 7,000 new phones had been installed.  The Post Office deserves praise for that.  As a Deputy of this House, I would be failing in my duty <Col N="1889" /> if I did not hand out some bouquets for this improvement.  In doing so, I think I am following a line of precedents on this side of the House.  We believe in making representations, in pushing forward as a vigilant Opposition and urging on the Minister concerned the necessity for improvements in his Department.  Over a number of years we have been urging the Minister to increase the telephone accommodation here in Ireland and have pointed out how necessary it was from a business point of view that modern commercial activity be carried on efficiently with first-class telephone and telegraph communication and all that goes with that.  I will not say that it was completely as a result of our representations that this has been done, but at any rate a vigilant Opposition pressing for improvements in service can bring about those very necessary improvements which it continuously seeks.  It is a good thing to know that the backlog of telephone subscribers waiting to be connected is being reduced.</P>
    <P>In connection with the Telephone Capital Bill I am glad to see that the Minister and the Department are asking for a large sum for the next five years.  Somewhere in one of the explanatory memoranda the Minister mentioned that the increased capital moneys for the telephone came from the Post Office Savings Bank.  On occasions it is a good thing to borrow money from the Savings Bank for this purpose.  Certainly depositors in the bank would find it hard to get a more suitable borrower than their own Government, but I would be afraid that if deposits fell, telephone improvements might suffer through a lack of money due to dependency on the Savings Bank.  In other words, if by any chance savings fell there would be an automatic fall in money available for telephone expansion.  Therefore, it is well that a big amount is being asked for. Taking a commercial view, I have always held that a forward policy in the Post Office would reap good rewards, rewards which would help industry, business and the social life of our community.  Being a rural community, it is important that people living on isolated farms should be able easily, quickly, and cheaply to communicate <Col N="1890" /> with one another.  It is something which would help to take away some of the alleged dullness of rural life.  It is, therefore, good to see a forward policy in connection with the borrowing of money for telephone expansion. In the long run it is something from which the community benefits greatly, and I do welcome the Telephone Capital Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also mentioned the quality of subscriber service and the analysis which this undergoes from time to time in the Department.  The public will welcome that statement, because there is nothing as frustrating as bad quality service.  This is tied up with the extension of exchanges and other technical details which I, or, in fact, anybody in this House, would be incapable of going into.  But I know that on occasion in the case of a telephone about which I know a great deal, my own telephone, it gave a very bad service for years and people were constantly complaining that when they dialled the number the telephone was always engaged.  We knew in fact it was not engaged at all. Engineers came out and looked at it and so on but nothing ever happened. One man said to me: &ldquo;Nothing will happen because you are routed through the Rathmines exchange and until they improve that exchange you will continue to get a bad service.&rdquo;  I do not know just how absolutely accurate that was.  I think it was accurate because the service did not improve for a long time.  It has now improved.  I do not now get any complaints that the telephone is engaged.  When we got those complaints previously we knew in fact there was nobody on the line at all.</P>
    <P>Another thing which used to happen was that people would say: &ldquo;We rang you up but nobody answered the phone.&rdquo;  We did make inquiries and found that on the particular day the house was occupied, no music was playing, there was no noise and the telephone bell had not sounded.  I mention that not to draw attention to what was a trivial matter in just one case but to show that there is need for behind the scenes extension, that something should be done here to give the <Col N="1891" /> public the service they need.  I am glad to see that that standard is improving.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy receives complaints and it is very hard for a Deputy to assess the actual value of a complaint. Sometimes people are impatient and they count the delays longer than they were in actual fact.  However, I have heard complaints about cross-channel services, bad lines and delays.  Again I would say that it is not my own personal experience.  Delays will inevitably occur in the best system so I am glad to hear, and the ordinary public will be glad to hear, that there is this continual self-examination going on inside the Post Office.  It is something that is always necessary and especially necessary in a Government Department.  I would like to say at this point that I think the Minister has a very open mind in that respect.  I believe if such urges are necessary that he urges on his Department the necessity for self-examination.</P>
    <P>The classified directory has been referred to and that is something which is welcomed by the commercial and business community.  In connection with the directory I would like again to revert to something I have referred to before.  I do not know whether I am a particularly stupid person but I always find the explanatory pages at the beginning of the directory difficult to follow.  I wonder do other people find it difficult?  It would be worth the Department's while getting that matter examined from the point of view of what is the first object of a person who turns to those pages. You assume that the person is not looking up the weather, that it is not just a case of knowing in regard to Murphy or Smith that you then look up under M and S and get it; if you want to dial the fire brigade or the police everybody probably knows the number is 999.  That is made out pretty clearly but I would like to see it analysed and then the layout followed as it would be in a commercial undertaking where somebody would say: &ldquo;An individual is picking up this booklet of ours which is showing our wares.  What are the problems confronting the individual when he opens this book?&rdquo; I find that rather <Col N="1892" /> confusing and I imagine other people also find it confusing.  I would like the Post Office to give that matter very close examination from the point of view of catering for the most backward boy or a girl in the class.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the fact that I welcomed the 11th Telephone Capital Bill to come before Dáil Éireann.  I know that there have been improvements in the co-axial cables and so on through rural areas as part of the policy which we have followed urging the Minister to extend all the facilities in order to make the use of the telephone as widespread as possible in Ireland.  We are naturally glad to see that is being brought about.  The Minister referred to how essential a first-class telephone service is today to industry and to the general commercial efficiency and progress of the country.  That is a fact and I trust that that attitude will always prevail in the Post Office.</P>
    <P>I would like to say, in that respect, at this point that we in Fine Gael have advocated that the Post Office generally should be separated and made a semi-State body.  Part of the reason which lies behind saying that is the lack in the past of any way of coping with the problems of the Post Office in a very modern way.  However, as I say, I note a wind of change in that respect.  There are people who think that new exchanges and extensions have something to do with trunk calls and so on and that they are matters that lie outside their knowledge for technical reasons. If we do not have new exchanges and extensions we cannot get the service we need.  The subscribers cannot get linked up in the way they want and at the speed they would wish.  I am very pleased to see the work going on in regard to those exchanges and extensions.</P>
    <P>I imagine that computer data on telephone lines is something which is coming in the future although the average person finds it a little beyond his comprehension.  However, this is something we are all going to know a lot about in the future and to need increasingly.  It is a good thing to see the Post Office are aligning themselves to the necessity for this in the future. Again, I reiterate the necessity for an adequate communication system such <Col N="1893" /> as the Minister has stressed.  We, on this side of the House, are certainly behind that.</P>
    <P>In this Estimate, the Minister refers to savings.  I note that the purchase of the new 6½ per cent Investment Bonds which were introduced on the 1st January of this year amounted to £1.8 million.  That is a good thing but, at the same time, I should like to mention to the Minister and to the House that one of the effects of having these Investment Bonds is that the Post Office has really gone into the highly competitive field of tapping the small borrower.  This is a field in which the banks and other bodies, including the building societies, have been for a long time.  One of the inevitable effects of the increase in the Post Office Investment Bonds is a diminution in the amount of money that will be available to building societies.  This, in turn, will have the inevitable effect of putting up the rates of interest on building society loans because the building societies will have to increase their rates to attract investments.  That is just coincidental but it must follow any attempt by the Post Office to attract money on a large scale.</P>
    <P>I have been asked, too, to refer to the Giro system which banks are introducing. Perhaps the Minister would like to say something about this and to let us know if the Post Office have considered this system.  The Minister gave details of buildings which have been erected.  The city of Dublin is now changing.  The centre of gravity of the business world has probably moved slightly.  It is moving from the centre of the city&mdash;the GPO is taken as being city centre&mdash;out to the Fitzwilliam and Baggot Street areas.  We have the big post office in Andrew Street and also one in South Anne Street but I have received complaints from the people in the Baggot Street and Fitzwilliam areas to the effect that the sub-post offices close at 5.30 p.m. and that it is very difficult for some businesses to get their letters to the small sub-post offices before 5.30 p.m. The pillar boxes do not always accommodate the very large envelopes which people like solicitors, accountants, advertisers and other professional types use for legal documents and so on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1894" /> There is a pillar box in South King Street and I have sometimes gone there with letters only to find that the box was already so full that to put any more letters in might be a risk.  Apart from the fact that some mischievous person might chance to come along and cause damage to the letters, the letters might arrive at their destination in very bad shape from having been put into an already over-laden pillar box.  I hope the Post Office are giving consideration to these matters.  Since there is a change in this city, there must also be changes in other parts of Ireland, in Cork and in some of the other cities.</P>
    <P>Regarding staff matters, it is good to see that the machinery for the exchanging of views within the Post Office is constantly in use and is being reviewed all the time; that the co-operation of the staff is sought and granted willingly. With such a large volume of staff as the Post Office has&mdash;2 per cent of our total employment&mdash;it is important that it should run as a model from the point of view of staff relations. Apparently, it functions very smoothly and relations have always appeared to be good.  The Minister refers to the continuing good results by Departmental and staff representatives on a variety of matters and that is something that is good to see in a Government Department. I trust that situation will always prevail.</P>
    <P>The Minister, too, referred to last year's strike.  However, that is over now and I need not refer to it but I trust that the people concerned will sink their differences and come in with the main Post Office body.  As the Minister has said, the arbitration board is always available if agreement cannot be reached.  We live in very difficult times from the point of view of labour relations and I trust that the Post Office will find that they will not have any trouble in the near future.  There have been very large increases in pay and I am aware that these increases have brought about the necessity for the increases in telephone and postal charges.</P>
    <P>Again, in that connection, I would say that it is very important for the Post Office as a body to be aware of <Col N="1895" /> costs and to run itself as efficiently and economically as possible because there is this feeling that it could be run more efficiently as a semi-State body.  That is something on which there is room for doubt.  The central Government has sometimes in the past taken its profits and not allowed it to expand in a way in which it could become a more profit-making organisation. I, as an Opposition Member, say to the Post Office that it must always guard against allowing itself to become a poor relation of Government Departments.  It is now one of the most important Government Departments. Certainly it is no less important than any other Government Department in the whole State because it controls communications of every sort.  The day has long gone when somebody like Hindenburg could make the remark he is alleged to have made concerning Hitler, &ldquo;I might make him a Minister of Posts but I would never think of making a man like him Chancellor of the German Reich&rdquo;.  We know the &ldquo;Minister of Posts&rdquo; and the status of the Post Office itself which are as high as any in the whole State, and more important than most.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the finances of the Post Office the Minister said that 60 per cent of the Department's expenditure is on wages and salaries.  I have already dealt with the fact that increased wages have unfortunately to be paid for somehow.  They have to be paid for by the public and the public cannot do much about it, but such payment puts this very great burden on the Post Office.  It also puts the necessary burden on the Post Office of being sure that any increases of any sort are only those necessary, because the cost of communications has such an effect on our daily lives and on our industry.</P>
    <P>I get complaints in regard to postal deliveries that the services are not as good as they used to be.  We know there are not as many deliveries.  The Minister has said that he is giving substantial consideration to the long-term features of the Department and its <Col N="1896" /> services.  That is good.  He says he does not propose to go into details.  Perhaps the Minister might issue a memorandum. The Minister issued two memoranda last year from his Department and they were greatly welcomed.  It is a very good thing to keep the House and the public generally in touch with the changes and improvements that are going to come about.  We and the public would then understand better the necessity for the increases in expenditure. When people do not understand they tend to get annoyed, but if the matter is explained to them they realise that if we expect people to pay higher wages and expect better services&mdash;postal, telegraph and telephone &mdash;then we have to pay for them.  The Minister says he mentioned last year that the status and the basic organisation of the Department are under consideration. I would like the Minister to go more fully into that.  The word &ldquo;status&rdquo; is not just a word picked at random from a dictionary.  &ldquo;Status and basic organisation&rdquo; is a phrase that makes me wonder what the Minister has in contemplation.  I feel that the Minister should give us, at the end of this Estimate, an explanation as to what exactly lies behind that phrase.</P>
    <P>I had many points to make in connection with the Post Office generally. I am not quite sure whether I covered them all.  It is difficult when a Department covers as much ground as this Department does to make sure that one refers to the matters which should be referred to.  However, I will now go on to broadcasting.  The Minister has given us an interesting breakdown on costs as between sound and television. I should say, first of all, that in connection with RTE generally sound broadcasting is now coming back.  There were people who thought that television would supersede it and that sound broadcasting might be done away with. I do not say that they said it ought to be, but they thought that TV would gradually take over from sound broadcasting. In fact, it is becoming obvious that sound will hold its own.  It is obvious that there are certain areas and fields in which sound is better than television itself.  Certain types of discussions probably come over better on sound.  It can be brought into schools <Col N="1897" /> more readily than television.  The actual data which comes over in sound is not complicated by the movements or faces of the man or woman talking.  There are certain fields which can more than hold their own.  In the main, sound broadcasting is good.  In this country, with the small amount of money available, the Authority are to be congratulated on what they do.  So are all others concerned with sound broadcasting, and it goes also for television.</P>
    <P>I want to make two points at this stage.  There is the perennial matter&mdash;I just mention this but do not necessarily stand over it&mdash;of the view that the proceedings of this House should be broadcast and televised.  I do not hold that view but it is held by certain people.  I do not think it would add to our deliberations. It might make us more conscious of personal appearance.  We are a deliberative assembly essentially and therefore I do not think it would add to our image or be good for us or for the country generally.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which concerns broadcasting generally.  It is the suggestion that we should produce programmes especially for beaming to our emigrants abroad.  It has been said it would enhance our image.  I do not entirely stand over that view but it is capable of being argued that it could, perhaps, and should be done.  As I have said, I do not agree with either of these views but I put them out for discussion among other speakers, and the Minister might wish to refer to them when he is replying.</P>
    <P>In dealing with RTE, all the time we have a mixture of praise and blame. The Minister has pointed out that one sees a programme and makes up his mind on it.  One man likes it and another does not.  One reads in the newspapers a great deal of criticism and of praise of some programme such as the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;, which I regard as first class entertainment.  We have all sorts of people appearing on it&mdash;visiting legislators, and visiting witches as well.  It is all good fun.</P>
    <P>However, we live in such a closed society that people sometimes take these things more seriously than they are intended to be taken.  In trying to understand and to deal with this new <Col N="1898" /> medium of television here, we must realise that.  I do not think the Authority or the men choosing these programmes should be tied up in knots. I would not agree with it for a moment. On the whole, considering the conditions in which they work, RTE do a good job.</P>
    <P>Though I shall make some remarks on Ministerial responsibility in this respect, I shall not deal with Ministerial interference.  If a member of the Government, a Minister, objects to a programme or to anything in connection with broadcasting, he should get in touch with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  That would be the courteous way to do it, and the easiest way because the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is the man who is responsible ultimately.  He may not have a lot of responsibility, as we know from day to day questions in the House&mdash; he must thank heavens he has not&mdash; but the RTE Authority have great responsibility and the Minister comes above them.</P>
    <P>We have got to work out our relationship with this new medium which has hit our world.  The effect of its impact is that people hear views right inside their homes&mdash;in their kitchens, their sittingrooms or their bedrooms, wherever they may be.  They may see suddenly a man or woman standing before the microphone saying things of which they do not approve.  The Minister touched on that aspect towards the end of his speech and, before I go into the question further, I should like to say at this point that I agree with the Minister entirely.</P>
    <P>However, I should like to emphasise my view that a great deal of allegations of Ministerial interference and of politics arise from undue sensitivity. There are occasions when people think they are interpreting the mind of the Government or maybe of a Minister in giving undue prominence to something from a political viewpoint.  Generally speaking, there is very little of that and I absolve the Minister completely from the suggestion that he is a person who would ask that that be done for him.  I do not think he would do it.</P>
    <P>At the moment I am not speaking politically&mdash;I am speaking as an ordinary <Col N="1899" /> Irish person.  At times we hear statements in direct broadcasts which shock us but as long as they are not really wrong we should not worry about them.  For instance, during the last few weeks we have seen an election campaign in another part of this island and some of the statements we heard would give one a shudder up and down one's spine.  That, however, does not mean that the radio or television authority stand over the views put forward.  I sometimes think that it would be a good idea if at the back of every television studio there was displayed a card to read like the announcements on letter pages of newspapers: &ldquo;The editor wishes to state that the views expressed in the correspondence columns of this newspaper are not necessarily his views or the views of this newspaper.&rdquo;  It might be a good idea to have some notice like this in television studios: &ldquo;The views being expressed here now are not necessarily the views of the Television Authority.  Still less are they the views of the Irish people in general.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, there must be a certain amount of freedom of speech. In fact, there is a good deal of it.  There should not, of course, be licence and many people who hold personal views on certain things are perhaps shocked when they hear some outrageous statement or other.  Of course, the answer is that 99 per cent of the people listening realise that the statement is outrageous and do not take it very seriously.  They realise that we live in this strange world where there is almost a breakdown of all sorts of things.  I do not mean for one moment that we should or do permit any breakdown in things affecting morals.  I am thinking now of professionals, the actual commentators and so on.  I think their opinions are usually very balanced.</P>
    <P>This is a difficult field to discuss in a comparatively short speech but I think the Minister was right when he said&mdash;it is important that we should realise what he said &mdash; that current affairs programmes are designed to make viewers think constructively on social, economic and moral problems. It is a good thing that these programmes <Col N="1900" /> should be broadcast.  That does not mean, of course, as the Minister pointed out, that we should permit or listen to this tearing down of values, this impudent interviewing of public figures&mdash;and I am not talking now of politicians.  I do not think we have done much of this in Ireland but on other broadcasting systems I have seen distinguished public figures in various walks of life derided and laughed at by interviewers.  That sort of thing does not do any good.  We on this side of the House would absolutely support the upholding of standards of interviewing and the standards which we in this country maintain.</P>
    <P>On one show I saw where an individual made an attack on a high churchman of this country.  The man who was running the programme intervened, I thought very rightly, but he was afterwards criticised for it.  I do not think the average person in this country likes to see any individual, be he high churchman or otherwise, criticised impudently without right of reply.</P>
    <P>These things will probably always happen.  This is a new medium to which we have not yet become accustomed. We are accustomed to reading news in the press and people write in and object when views are expressed in a newspaper with which they do not agree.  Many people&mdash;I am not one of them&mdash;write to the paper contradicting items that have appeared.  That is all right.  We do not like to see and, in fact, in responsible newspapers we do not see, institutions of State attacked, except where there is good reason for it.  Certainly, there are subversive elements in society today.  Just as newspapers will not permit their papers to be used by those elements to forward their views, the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority should not permit their media to be used for that purpose.  I imagine that the entire House would be in agreement on this matter.  We certainly are not going to see our radio and television service used to tear down standards that we hold dear.</P>
    <P>Most people are not accustomed to hearing somebody in their own homes saying something with which they profoundly disagree.  In the same way, we get annoyed when we hear views with <Col N="1901" /> which we profoundly disagree being expressed on radio or television.  We have to learn to live with that, provided it is fair comment.  A person can ring up RTE to inform them of his disagreement with the broadcast but that is not a reason for getting the programme stopped.  In the last year or two there were programmes which did anything but enhance the image of this House, but they have now ceased.</P>
    <P>The Minister can be quite certain that the Fine Gael Party stand absolutely for the view that, while as much freedom as possible should be given for discussion, there should not be a stirring up of elements in our society brought about through the national broadcasting service.  There are people who will advocate a different way of life.  We live in a very strange world, a world of great unrest.  In every part of the world, in our social life, great changes are taking place, some of which are good and some not so good. We do not want to see people being stirred up against the ordered and accepted way of life in our society and such stirring up should not be encouraged by any sound or television broadcast.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has said what he did.  It given me an opportunity of reiterating our point of view, which is, that while freedom of speech must be safeguarded and is a matter of great importance to us, there should not be unmitigated licence to tear down the institutions of State or individuals who are earnestly trying to maintain the decencies of life and to maintain society in an ordered way while at the same time giving freedom and justice to all.</P>
    <P>I am sure I have omitted many thing from my speech but other speakers can deal with matters I failed to mention.  I wish to congratulate the Minister on the presentation of these figures.  We are very glad to see that the forward policy of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is being maintained. I thank the Minister for the Estimates and other documents issued in December and for the information he has supplied.  that is a very good precedent and I hope it will continue.  It is to the advantage of all of us, and to the <Col N="1902" /> advantage of the country generally, that we should have as much information as possible about the multifarious activities of this enormous Department as regards what it is doing, where it is going and how far it is keeping pace with modern trends.  I trust that, when he is replying, the Minister will answer some of the points I raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me add to what Deputy Dockrell has said.  My Party are also grateful to the Minister for supplying us beforehand with details and particulars regarding his Department. We find that very interesting and useful.  It means that the discussion on this Estimate and on the Bill before us today can proceed in what I consider to be a more sensible way than just making political capital out of points raised in the Estimate.</P>
      <P>As regards the Telephone Capital Bill, we all agree that since we are continually demanding additional services we must make the money available to pay for them.  The programme mapped out by the Minister and the list of achievements carried out makes it easy for us to say we entirely agree with the proposals contained in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am glad to know that the technician training system which was begun in 1964 appears to be bearing fruit. It does appear a long time.  Does it take over four years to train those young men to become fully qualified? If it does, it cannot be avoided.  It is a good idea that they should be available now and, with the numbers being taken in, the numbers coming out will naturally be increasing and this should help with the proposed programme.</P>
      <P>In regard to telephones could the Minister, when replying, give a little more detail than he gave to Deputy Dr. O'Connell the other day when he asked if telephones were disinfected or if there was any system under which this was done?  This is something that should receive attention if it is not already being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs there are many things I should like to mention and I shall try to be as brief as possible because, no doubt, a number of other speakers will want to join in the discussion.  As <Col N="1903" /> the Minister knows, several official references have already been made in the past two years to the establishment of a corporation to run the Post Office. The Minister said the matter was under consideration.  If so, consideration should be fairly far advanced now. Could the Minister make even a preliminary statement at this stage on what is the exact position?  If it is proposed to turn over the postal services to a corporation may we take it that there will be full consultation with the trade unions involved before the matter is finalised?  If it is going to be done, the time to do it is in advance. The loose ends could be tied up.  As far as staffing interests are concerned there are very big issues involved and the Minister knows the time to deal with them is now and not later, if it is decided to make change.  Particularly in regard to superannuation the issue is very big and therefore perhaps the Minister, when replying, would bring us up to date as regards the exact position now.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister also say that is the position about civil right for postal workers?  He must agree that it is a little bit ridiculous that this Department still say that even the country postman cannot be a member of a political Party while any other person in a similar position, such as an ESB employee or a teachers, can become enrolled not alone a member of a political Party but can be elected to a local council and elected to this House. Is there any reason why the old rules which have been there for so long cannot now be altered?  Would the Minister consider looking at what is happening in Britain and would he not agree that there should be a change made now?  I do not think there is any opposition from any Member of this House.  At least a number of people who have been talking to me about this matter outside say that they discussed it with politicians of various colours and that these said that they were in favour of it.  The only trouble is that they do not express their opinion in favour of it in this House: they do not say they are against it.  They do not say anything.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1904" /> It would be a good idea if they, particularly those who are members of the Minister's Party, if they feel that way, would even whisper in the ear of the Minister, if they do not want to be overheard: &ldquo;We think this is a bit of a cod.  The matter should be cleared up now.&rdquo;  That would give the Minister the green light to clear up the matter completely.  I know of no valid reason why postmen or installers or men on the technical side should be prevented from being members of a county council or of this House.  They can be Independent Members.  This is a cod. We have a number of them throughout the country who are, in fact, members of political parties and who were elected as Independents.  Everybody knows the Party to which they belong but they must say they are Independents in order to keep within the law. I think this is a little bit foolish.  I suggest the matter could be, and should be, dealt with.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister give us some more information about the building programme?  He has given a certain amount but I was looking at what is missing rather than what is included. While he has given detailed information, I am personally aware of a number of post office building around the country which are no credit to the Department.  I suppose the post offices are the public offices most frequently used by tourists.  Everybody wants to know where the post office is and they go there to buy stamps, make telephone calls, and so on.  It is too bad if the building has not been painted for a long time, if it does not look very clean, particularly the windows, and if there are broken walls and broken furniture. This is so in very many of them, not alone in sub-post offices but in main post offices in some towns.</P>
    <P>While a number of building that have been built are quite presentable, or even look very well, is there any hope that in building future offices the Minister will decide to have a little variety?  Must these structures be all built to type?  Would it not be a good idea to have some of our artists, who claim they could do very much better if they got the opportunity, design something more in keeping with the <Col N="1905" /> area in which the post office is rather than provide buildings which are exactly the same from one end of the country to the other?  Is there a hope that something like this might be considered if the cost is not excessive?  I do not know why it should not be considered.  I know that there must be certain fittings and that modern offices must be built in a certain way.  There must be certain installation and certain accommodation must be provided but surely it would be possible to have design particularly of exteriors, which would for in better with local conditions? The Minister knows that some of the hotels been doing this in a big way and, in fact doing it very effectively.</P>
    <P>I should like now to know something about what has happened with regard to the provision of better facilities in Donegal town.  It was decided some time ago to erect a new office there.  That does not appear to be happening and there seems to be an inordinate delay in having anything dine.  Would the Minister say what the position is?</P>
    <P>The Minister would, perhaps, also let us know what has happened with regard to the office in Killarney.  Again this is something about which there seems to be a bit of a mystery.  It was supposed to be dealt with two years ago, but it appears to have been forgotten.</P>
    <P>There is one office in the city here causing a consideration amount of annoyance and that is the office in Ballsbridge.  I have raised this by way of question on a number if occasions. It would appear as if the office there was erected to deal with a certain number of people.  Now Ballsbridge and the surrounding area has been built up and the result is there are now 51 postmen using the office, an office which had facilities for about 25 and 26 people.  I know there has been a suggestions that a new office will be built there, but I understand that no effort has yet been made to acquire a site.  If that is true, does the Minister not appreciate that the longer he leaves it the less chance he will have of acquiring a suitable site in the area?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1906" /> After all, if private offices can be built on sites acquired in the area, surely the Post Office should be able to get a site there, if they go about it. Or is there something else wrong?  Is there some reason why the matter is not being attended to?  If there is, I should like the Minister to say so.  The present postman staff there is 51, but apparently no move has been made to do anything about the unsatisfactory position there and I would, therefore, like some up-to-date information about it.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know what has happened with regard to the Cavan office.  The Minister knows the joke about that office: a few years ago the shop beside the office went on fire and everybody in Cavan cursed the efficiency of the bridge in putting out the fire and saving the post office from being burned down because, had it been burned down, a new building would have had to be erected.  Because it was not burned down the old building was there is not much likelihood of is that there is not much likehood of the post office there being burned down because, every time it rains, the staff have to go around with vessels catching the water coming in form the roof. For a post office in a town the size of Cavan to be in that condition is too indicrous for words.  This matter has been raised by me on more than one occasion within the last 18 months, but it does not appear to have made any impact on the Minister or his Department. The Minister may be able to give me some information about it.</P>
    <P>He might also tell us whether or not any temporary can be taken to relieve the cramped conditions in the telephone exchange.  I am sure he is, or some of his officials are, aware of the position there and the fact that the people working in the exchange are working in such cramped conditions that it is nearly impossible to give an efficient service.  There is no reason why this situation should be allowed to continue.  If there is a lack of money to build a proper exchange, surely there could be some little alleviation by the provision of alternative accommodation for the time being.  I am quite sure that, if the Minister looks into this, he will realise that I am not <Col N="1907" /> exaggerating.  The position is exactly as I say it is.</P>
    <P>The sorting office counter at Brain Boru Street, Cork, Urgently requires some improvement.  Apparently the Department said some time ago that they had given some attention to this matter.  Neither the staff not the people who have inspected the place can discover what the attention was.  Maybe, someone looked in and said things were not so bad, or that they should be improved, or something like that, but they most certainly have not done very much that can be seen and the staff there are dissatisfied that the position should be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Dublin sorting office, this is one of the building in Dublin which show the need for forward planning.  When the office was being built we were told it would be the most modern building of its kind, if not in Europe, certainly in this country.  We also heard rumours that, because of the cost, the dust extracting device was being removed from the original plan. It was, appearently, decided that it was unnecessary.  While the new office is a big improvement on the previous one, the fact that there is more dust there, the nature of the work handling mailbags, parcels and letters, carrying dust and other things, depending where the mail comes from, has caused a lot of annoyance to the staff.  Around Christmas, as the Minister knows, there was a threat by the staff that, if things got any wrose, they would simply walk out.  I raised the matter here so that something might be done.  The Parliamentary Secretary very kindly agreed to take the question at short notice and said he would give his personal attention to the matter.  He is an intelligent and obliging man in many ways, but I do not think he has given this office his personal attention since because the dust is still there and nothing seems to have been done.  The mere fact that Christmas is over does not remedy the situation.  It has found been that, because there is so much glass in the building, at certain times of the year&mdash; we get a bit of sum something&mdash;work at speed becomes very difficult.  The Department will have to do something about this in case we get another hot <Col N="1908" /> summer; if they do not do something conditions will become intolerable.  The volume of traffic is very, very high and I can see no reason why little things like this should not have been adverted to and attended to, and the genius who suggested taking out the dust extractor should get a leather medal because he, apparently, is the cause of most of the trouble.</P>
    <P>There is another drawback.  When a business concern seeks planning permission one of the matters taken into consideration is the number of staff likely to be employed and how they are likely to travel to work.  Usually one of the conditions attaching to such planning permission is that there must be ample parking space.  I do not know whether or not somebody was trying to do CIE a good turn but no parking facilities were provided in this particular instance.  They appear to have been completely overlooked.  The menbers of the staff report that their cars, motor cycles and bicycles suffer a great deal of damage; they have to park these any old place at all and things have now reached the stage at which, unless police protection is given, it will be impossible for these people to leave their private transport anywhere close to the sorting office at all.  There was a mistake made there when granting planning permission.  The other thing about it is that the volume of work in the place is increasing, and I am told very little provision was made for an extension of the building if an extension is needed, and that before very long it will probably be too small.</P>
    <P>I understand that letter-sorting machines are being introduced in many countries.  I expect that they will be introduced down there, too.  If that is so, where will they be put?  Does it mean that the staff will all have to be cramped into some small space in order to make room for the rather sizeable machines which will be doing the work, and doing it more efficiently of course.  The Minister will have to take more care with buildings in general with reference to forward planning to meet an expansion in the postal traffic and telephone development.  The postal traffic space is being devoured for telephone purposes.  This means that the staff, even in some of the modern. <Col N="1909" /> offices, have to move into a small space and it is a question of robbing Peter to pay Paul.  It is bad planning.  It is a matter of giving it the necessary attention and it should be dealt with before it gets completely out of hand.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot of talk recently about industrial democracy.  It could be introduced here in a very small way. No one knows as well as the staff who work in these offices what the shortcomings are.  They say that no one knows how a kitchen should be designed but the woman who works in a kitchen.  She knows the right height for the sink.  She knows the amount of space she requires.  She knows where the cooker should go.  The same thing applies to the people working in these offices.  The ordinary staff should be consulted.  There should be some way of consulting them and saying: &ldquo;Look, have you any ideas?  Do you think this could be done better this way or that way?&rdquo; It would not take very much trouble to do that and it would be appreciated by the people involved.  No matter how highly qualified an architect might be, he could gain quite a lot by talking to the people who will be using the facilities which he proposes to provide.</P>
    <P>It would not be a bad idea if the Post Office had its own independent building department and architects.  The Office of Public Works come in for criticism from time to time.  Many proposals and complaints must be put before them.  I understand that the same set of people have to deal with the different matters.  Would it not be a good idea if the Post Office had their own set of building people&mdash;it need not be a very big department&mdash;who would know the ins and outs of planning and, instead of having to go to the Office of Public Works and be told: &ldquo;When we can get around to it, we will design something for you,&rdquo; they could produce something when they needed it, and go ahead with the plans.  I am sure that, if this were done, the people in the Office of Public Works would not complain if some of this type of work were taken from them.  It would be simply a matter of streamlining the procedure.</P>
    <P>I also believe that postmasters should <Col N="1910" /> be given a certain amount of authority with regard to decorations and repairs which have to be done in local offices. Why should it be necessary to get someone from the Office of Public Works to go down to look at a small office in the heart of the country and find out whether it needs an extra coat of paint, or whether a door needs to be repaired, or a window needs a new pane of glass?  Surely it should be possible to allow the postmaster to spend £X on his own certificate, so that the work could be done in a reasonable time, and at a reasonable cost.  There is no reason why this could not be done, particularly with regard to the question of paint.  Many of the offices throughout the country have not been painted for many years.</P>
    <P>We are told that certain sections of the Post Office are not paying their way. CIE are losing money hand over fist, but they paint the stations&mdash;they even painted the stations they were closing. If that is so, why cannot the Post Office paint the post offices?  Nothing looks as bad as to go into a post office and find the walls and doors looking drab and dreary.  I cannot say what the conditions under which the staffs have to work are like but, viewing the offices from the outside and the public counter, if the conditions where the staff work are as bad as they are outside, they must be pretty poor.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Dublin sorting office, when new buildings are being prepared and, in regard to the new buildings which are now in the planning stage, would the Minister make sure that full attention is given to the question of ventilation, transport accommodation, dust and heating?  That would be the sensible thing to do and it would be cheaper to do it before the job is done rather than wait until the buildings are erected and then wonder how you will remedy something which should have been dealt with first.</P>
    <P>Have the Department given any thought to getting away from some of the old trappings?  With the passing of the telegraph the word &ldquo;telegraphs&rdquo; in the name is an anachronism.  If I remember correctly, the Minister told me some time ago that it was proposed to change the name of the Department <Col N="1911" /> to the Department of Posts and Telecommunications. That has not yet been done.  I wonder if someone thought that name was too long, because the Department of Posts and Telecommunications and Transport and Power is certainly a mouthful.  &ldquo;Posts and Telegraphs&rdquo; is a bit of a cod.</P>
    <P>Would the Department consider it a good idea to employ a colour consultant and get away from green paint. I know we have certain people whose wounds begin to bleed as soon as we talk about something like this.</P>

      <P>Going through the country one often finds post boxes in hedges and one could pass them by because they are green and the hedge is green.  There are some people who when they go to Northern Ireland love to say: &ldquo;Look at the red pillar boxes. We are different.  We have green ones which show we are Irish.&rdquo;  CIE could get away from green despite all the caoining at the time.  Everyone now agrees that was a good idea.  Perhaps the Minister would tell me if he would consider something like that.  It is about time.  It would not do any harm, and would show a fresh outlook on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few moments ago I mentioned that there was a lot of talk about industrial democracy.  There is also a lot of talk about industrial relations. This is one of the most vital issues needing attention at the moment and, despite the fact that the Minister said in his opening speech&mdash;and I agree with him&mdash;that there is very close cooperation <Col N="1912" /> between his Department and the various trade unions dealing with the employees of the Department, nevertheless I think things are still not right.  I understand that a staff relations division has been set up in the Department.  If that had not been done, I am sure there would have been more trouble.</P>
    <P>It is not the big things which cause trouble.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of this&mdash;possibly he is&mdash;but I have been a trade union official for 22 years and one of the things I discovered over the years was that, when there was a question of wages at stake, only one thing was important and that was wages.  Where the wages were second and hours of work second, every other thing came up, one after the other, and people had time to consider certain items and to realise that the conditions were bad.  If they were ignored year after year after year, then the item that eventually caused the trouble was not the big item, which most of us would consider was worth a row, but a small item which had been niggling there a long time.  That has been my experience and it has been the experience of anybody engaged in industrial relations over the years.  I wonder if delay in dealing with these little matters has not been causing more trouble in staff relations than anything else.  I think the Minister will find that that is so.</P>
    <P>I believe that one of the factors giving rise to delay is the problem of staffing the managerial side of the project. Is the managerial side of the Post Office adequately staffed to meet speedily the problems that arise in the Department?  An accumulation of niggling grievances over the years can, in the end, cause an explosion out of all proportion to the problem which is being complained about.  Where longstanding grievances can be regarded by the administration as of no great consequence and, at the same time, they allow them to erode the good relations which otherwise exist, surely some effort should be made to have these grievances cleared up?</P>
    <P>A small claim&mdash;it need not be a genuine claim&mdash;can be made and allowed to be a considerable grievance <Col N="1913" /> ove a long time.  Until that is fully investigated, it is a cause of trouble. When it is investigated, it may be admitted by everybody that it is of no importance and it may be wiped off and nothing more is heard about it.  How-ever, leave it there and you are causing trouble which will not be cleared until, eventually, the necessary action is taken to have it fixed up.  I believe that a course in industrial relations could be set up in the Department.  Some effort should be made to train people to deal with these matters.</P>

      <P>My information is that, whatever you have, they are not exactly what is wanted.  There are courses in the Management Institute, in technical schools and in places like that.  The Minister should consider releasing staff in the day-time to attend courses, if he does not already do so.  It would be a good idea that civil servants should be spoken to on this subject by outside people, even though some of the lecturers might not help post office conditions.  At the same time, it would help a lot if they talked to people who are used to dealing with these problems. I believe the supervisory officers, no less than the rank and file staff, both in industry and in the Civil Service would benefit by such courses.</P>

      <P>If that is so, it appears to me as if it is not achieving the desired result.  The technique of handling staff is a highly-developed skill, as the Minister knows.  All his staff, from the top to the bottom, should appreciate this.  I am afraid we still have in the Post Office, as in every other type of employment, people who believe that staff are merely numbers and are there to do exactly what they are told to do; that they do not have their freedoms, the very same as the person giving orders.  I have no use for <Col N="1914" /> the person who throws a fit if he or she is told to do something and who goes off the deep end.  That may be all right for film stars but it is not all right for people who have to earn an ordinary living.</P>
      <P>In ordinary circumstances, 99 per cent of the people we deal with will react to a normal human approach, but many of them will react in the wrong way if somebody tries to boss them, if somebody tries to show them up in front of somebody else.  This occasionally happens in the Post Office. Little irritations like that will drag on for long after the thing which caused it has been forgotten.  Anything that can be done to try to prevent that kind of thing is well done.  I understand that the Minister's Department has created welfare officer posts: that is a good idea.  I shall be looking forward to developments in that line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also glad to know that the Post Office disciplinary code will be reviewed.  I imagine that very many of the old regulations, originally laid down when the British were here, are a little bit out of date.  I am sure there will be full consultation with the staff organisation and that some type of modern procedure will be devised before new schemes are drawn up. Some years ago, I was horrified to come across the case of a man who was driving for the Post Office and who bumped against somebody, or else somebody bumped against him. Obviously, the Garda were satisfied he was not at fault but the Post Office, because he got a little dent on the van, decided he was at fault and suspended him for a week.  If he had been taken to court for causing an accident he would have been fined perhaps £1 or 30s but the Department were fining him his week's wages.  His wage, I think, was £15 per week.  This happens also in some outside employment where employers, if they get away with it, will take strong action against somebody who has had an accident with one of their vehicles, whether or not the employee was responsible for the accident when driving.  The employers take strong action, if they are let away with it, as a warning to everybody else in their employment to be very careful.  However, the amount of penalty involved is <Col N="1915" /> so great as to make it ridiculous.  It is an old punishment code handed down from the British.  The sooner it is completely scrapped, the better.  Let us draw up our own code and get the matter discussed with the people representing the workers and we shall find that it will be far better in the long run.</P>
    <P>I come now to a hoary chestnut, that is, pensions for auxiliary postmen and unestablished officers.  Has any progress been made in this regard?  Again, this is a suggestion that not a Deputy in the House will oppose.  I am quite sure there are Deputies here today who will be very loud in their support that something be done about what they consider to be a national scandal, which, in fact, is what it is.  Yet, there does not appear to be any effort to try to have it remedied.  I know several old men who were auxiliary postmen all their lives.  They worked for as long as they were able to work.  When they retired, there was an item in the news-papers about the number of miles they had walked during their working life-time but that is all they got when they left the job &mdash; no gratuity, no pension.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that we have at present so many employers introducing pension schemes it is about time these people were included.  I noticed that last week a Bill was passed to ensure that 11 people employed by an agricultural group attached, very likely, to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries would get pensions and they have only been in existence for three years.  Here are people who have been in the employment of the Post Office since the State was founded and before it and because the State does not say they are entitled to a pension apparently the State is not going to do anything about them.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister's good sense because I am sure he appreciates the difficulty as well as I do and the hard-ships inflicted by this outdated rule to see that something is done about it.  I hope that when he is replying the Minister will tell me where he stands in relation to the grievances of these men, postmen and other unestablished officers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1916" /> People who know nothing about the problem ask: &ldquo;Why can this not be taken up by the unions?  Is this not a matter for arbitration?&rdquo; The union cannot process a claim through conciliation and arbitration machinery without a change in legislation and in the last analysis it remains for the House to decide on this.  I am sure if the Minister brings in the necessary legislation there will be no objection by anybody.  The funny thing is that there are thousands of people in the country enjoying pensions greater than what these men are getting as wages because they are not the best-paid people in the country.  They are people who are paid a very low rate.  How they exist I do not know and then at the end of it all they just clock out on the last day of work and that is it.  They can go anywhere they like as far as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are concerned.</P>
    <P>Every day you see new sections of workers negotiating increased pension rights and so on and I can see no earthly reason why similar treatment should not be given to these people as is given to their full-time colleagues and, indeed, the better paid servants and officers of the State and semi-State bodies.  If the problem is that they are part-time is there any reason why they could not be given at least a part-pension according to the same formula that applies to their full-time colleagues?  Is there any reason why that could not be done? At least it would be something.  It would not be leaving them on the road without a shilling in their pockets which is what is being done.  It cannot continue any longer.  Somebody must do something about it and I suggest that the Minister is the person who should do it.  These old folk do not talk about the Minister or anybody else.  To them it is just the Government, those fellows up in Dublin who run the country, and it does not matter much to them who they are, but they will tell you that the Government are waiting for them to get scarcer and with the change in the postal system, vans taking over and so on, they are getting scarcer.  One old fellow said to me last week: &ldquo;Sure they will do what they did with the old <Col N="1917" /> IRA.  They will wait until we die and they will probably do something for the last couple left.&rdquo;  You get that attitude and you cannot blame them for being cynical because that has been their experience and that is it.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister be prepared to tell us what is happening with regard to the five-day week for postmen?  I know that people will raise their hands in horror when they hear a five-day week for postmen mentioned.  They will ask: &ldquo;What, no post on Saturday?&rdquo; Many of us would welcome not receiving any letters on Saturday. Nearly everybody in the public service has had a five-day week for many years.  Industrial workers generally have it.  Postmen in the main rise very much earlier than any of the others and I think they deserve a five-day week as much if not more than some people who already have it.  Most firms, offices and factories do not open on Saturday anyway and the loss to the State or to industry would not be very great.</P>
    <P>There might be a bit of an outcry at the beginning but after a couple of weeks most people would come to accept that they did not get letters on Saturday.  They do not get letters on Sunday and when the Christmas Day delivery was taken off there was a lot of annoyance but the people accepted it before very long and I think they would readily agree to foregoing delivery on Saturday if the position were explained to them.  I understand that schemes have been suggested.  I should like to know is this something which is likely to be debated and debated because while the debate is going on postmen are still working six days.  This is one of the niggling things which causes unrest.  People feel that nothing has been done about it and, therefore, it does not matter a lot.  The Minister should give an explanation to the public of what exactly is at stake and the public would accept it from the Minister if he stated why the five-day week was being put into operation. I know that certain people who are on a five-day week themselves would possibly be the first to kick up about it. We found that in other spheres.</P>

      <P>It would be necessary to ensure that there would be no loss of earnings.  I do not mean that fellows should lose one-sixth of their week's earnings which I am sure is what would come into the minds of some people as being the ultimate end of the whole thing.  Like other employees a five-day week should be given to postmen at their present rate of pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have another corny one here which I asked the Minister about around Christmas.  He gave me a reply which I was not quite happy about and as the results come up I am less happy. This is the question of Christmas overtime for rural postmen.  Could the Minister explain the Department's policy in relation to payment for Christmas overtime where rural postmen are concerned?  I have received complaints from men that they are not being paid for overtime work on Christmas deliveries or that their overtime has been cut.  It seems to be an extraordinary state of affairs.  In view of an increased post at Christmas the Post Office must make a surplus on stamps.  It is surely blatantly unjust that the people who deliver this extra correspondence should not be paid for the hours they work.  As far as I can see the rural postmen are singled out for special mistreatment in this regard. I was told on one occasion that overtime is limited no matter how much correspondence a man has to deliver and then I was told that there is no limit.  Can the Minister say which is correct and if there is a limit how is the limit made out?  Who decides it? Have we reached a stage at which a rural postman delivering Christmas mail cannot be trusted to come back when he delivers his mail or does somebody say: &ldquo;If he goes out with the mail he will sit on the side of the road on a freezing winter's day in order to clock up a couple of hours' overtime?&rdquo; I think this is the thinking in the minds of the people who decided on this.  Let the Minister have any <Col N="1919" /> inspections, spot checks or anything he likes but for goodness sake let him ensure that when a man works overtime at Christmas delivering mail and has four hours extra as a result, somebody in Dublin does not decide that it only took him two hours, somebody who does not know how many letters he had or what distance had to be covered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noticed an increase in the use of modern bicycles, particularly in the city. Would the Post Office consider buying a couple of dozen of these bicycles? Parcels can be put on them.  They are low and handy and they are much better and easier to handle than the old-type bicycle, or has it been decided to wait until the firm making the old ones goes out of business before they go over to the new ones?  The Minister has not had the experience I had of using an old postman's bike, and I can tell him that you would certainly need to be, as they say down the country, &ldquo;all in your health&rdquo; to hold it on the road, particularly on a wild day.  It would not cost so much to switch over and the Minister should make the experiment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that in the country at the present time permission has been given for the use of autocycles, scooters and motor cycles for the purpose of delivering mail by a number of postmen for long runs that they could not otherwise do.  I had an <Col N="1920" /> interesting letter today from the Revenue Commissioners with reference to a man who was using a motor cycle to deliver mail on a pretty long route and who was looking for an allowance for his motor cycle.  He must have checked with the Post Office because this is the gen that came back:</P>
    <P>... there is no allowance for expenses incurred in the use of Mr. Toman's motor cycle on his rounds as Postman, as the expense is not necessarily incurred.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Dockrell said a few minutes ago, I do no know whether Mr. D.J. Keane, cigire, inspector of taxes, went around with the postman to find out whether he could manage without the bike; I do not think he did, but I do think he wrote to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and asked whether this man needed to use a motor cycle in the course of his work and he got back the reply &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  It is physically impossible to do the route which the man has to do in the hours laid down to him unless he uses a motor cycle.  If I send it to the Minister&mdash;because it is no use sending it back to Mr. Keane&mdash;would the Minister have some inquiries made because I can assure him this man could do with the extra allowance because he has been very well salted for a certain reason.</P>
    <P>As regards cycling postmen and postmen generally, I do not know whether anyone here is out as early as I am.  I go into town in the dark, particularly with the new time, and I notice postmen cycling along in dark clothes.  It is hard to see them.  Would it be an idea for the coming winter, whether the time is changed or not, to issue some type of coat or bands to postmen to ensure that they will be seen by motorists?  It is not their fault. Even the postmen walking along looking into a bag are inclined to move out on the road without being too careful.</P>
    <P>Another old question is that of uniform.  I mentioned here before the postman who thought that the uniforms issued to postmen were made to a design of one man who was measured and that the fellow himself must not <Col N="1921" /> have been too well made, because there was never a postman born that the uniform seemed to fit.  It certainly did not add anything to his appearance. On top of that, to have to wear a hairy old uniform, something like the bull's wool issued in the Army, buttoned up to his throat right through the hottest day in summer, which was the regulation, was a little bit out.</P>
    <P>I understand that there are proposals to have some new type of uniform issued, and I hope the proposals do not take too long in maturing.  If it is intended to supply new uniforms to postmen, would the Minister tell us what stage it has reached and is it proposed to issue, as was issued to the Garda, a lightweight jacket which may be used in the summer?  Will the new uniform have an open collar so that there could be a shirt collar and tie exposed in order to ensure that every postman in the country will not have a different type of uniform by having different types of shirts?  Would the Minister consider issuing, in addition, at least one shirt or what was used by fellows going to dress dances long ago, a shirt front, if they could not afford a shirt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a dickie.  It should be easy enough to issue even one shirt and the postman could supply another one himself.  Whatever is being supplied, let it be a uniform.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that all the income tax forms issued to postmen are issued in the Irish version?  I have no objection at all to this if the postmen want it.  If forms are asked for in Irish they should be issued, but to issue forms in Irish to people who have never used the Irish language all their lives and who will be put to the trouble of writing in and asking for one in English is a little bit ridiculous.  This makes a joke of the Irish language rather than improve the position in regard to it.  The Minister can take it that that is the situation, and it is an irritation that turns people against the language revival.  There is no sense in it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister refers in his opening <Col N="1922" /> speech to the new telephone directory. There should be a different coloured page in the middle so that one would know when one was leaving the Dublin area and going into the other area, without having to thumb through the whole book.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The second point is in connection with the business directory. Am I right in saying that the right to issue the business directory was given to a foreign firm on payment to the Department of a fairly substantial sum of money and that that firm was then in the position to prepare the directory and to try to get as much money as they could back?  It is an international firm that has been doing this.  Is the Minister aware that these people have been phoning individual firms and asking them if they wanted to be included in the new directory and that it would cost £7.  Of course, if they paid £7 they would be put in large print, but it was not mentioned at any stage that if they did not pay the £7 they would appear in the normal way.  This smacks a little bit of sharp practice, and I am not too happy about the idea of having the thing done the way it was.</P>
      <P>I think the Department should have prepared the directory themselves. After all, if someone can make money out of this, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, already having most of the firms in last year's directory under a different heading, could very likely have broken even or made a few pounds if they did it themselves.  It was a mistake not to do it themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad it has been decided to give the service to the blind, which was mentioned by the Minister.  This is something they do not use very much, but it is a small concession to them.  I cannot see, as mentioned by Deputy Dockrell, why the Department did not adopt the GIRO system.  This would have been a way in which they could have given a service which would have suited many people.  If the Minister <Col N="1923" /> has a comment to make on it I should like to have it when he is replying.</P>
    <P>With regard to the savings department I think those of us who advocate catering for the small saver feel that the changeover to the higher rate was too much delayed.  While the new rate is attracting a lot of money, I am not prepared to agree with Deputy Dockrell that this is money being taken from the building societies and so on.  The small saver with a small amount of money looks for someplace like the Post Office to put it in.  We are being unfair to those people in the matter of interest rates.  They should get the best possible treatment.  If one looks over the years at the amount of money they invest and takes into account the depreciation of money values, it is evident they will not get back the worth of what they initially put in.  This is a point which should be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal with the question of programmes on RTE.  In the main they have been producing excellent programmes.  For its size and the amount of money available to it the station is doing a very good job. While I do not see as much television as I should, I am in a position to comment on this because I can receive four different stations.  For threequarters of the time at least, I find Telefís Éireann give a better programme.</P>
    <P>I also agree with the Minister regarding the introduction into programmes of people who most certainly do not represent a general body of opinion anywhere in the country, who are allowed to hold forth and attack all that is respectable in the country and to give the impression that they are, in fact, speaking for a wide section of the public.  In that way they do a lot of harm to those who are impressionable and who, by listening and not knowing the full facts, may get the impression that these people are speaking with authority, when in fact they are merely the voice of their own distorted minds or represent the views of a few of their companions.</P>
    <P>The Minister is quite right in saying that this kind of thing should not be allowed.  I would be all in favour of <Col N="1924" /> saying that you can have this on, but you cannot have that on.  If we have censorship in the country, I think that sort of dangerous thing should be liable to be censored as anything else.  This modern idea of a few small-minded people seeking to pull down the established religions and the established practices in many fields, including politics, must be stopped.  The way to stop it is to prevent them getting an opportunity of trying to represent that they are talking for a lot of people.</P>
    <P>One of the things wrong with newspaper reporting and radio and television reporting, but particularly television reporting, is that a person may say a very intelligent thing 100 times but he will not get a line for it; but if somebody says something damn stupid he gets the headlines and the cameras are there to see if he will say it again.  If there is some type of exhibition or if somebody does something good in the country, nobody bothers; but if there is a row with a couple of those long-haired people in the city or in some street down the country and they do something stupid, the cameras are down there and half a newsreel is given over to portraying these events as the important happenings in the country.  This is what has brought about the present situation in our universities.  So much publicity was given to what was happening abroad, that this sort of thing was regarded as a good thing to do and somebody else copied it.  We are now reaping the reward of that.  That is wrong.</P>
    <P>Telefís Éireann are doing themselves a disservice when they do that.  I am not one of those who say there is a political bias in Telefís Éireann.  I do not know what happened to Deputy Blaney or anyone else.  As far as I am concerned, I go in and out there and I know that, if you are going on a programme, you have to wait until certain things are ready and nobody points a gun to you.  I have no complaint about them regarding that.  What I have a complaint about is the question of what is news.  Last night in this House the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Cosgrave, referred to something that was said by a man, who is not a Member of the House but who adopts <Col N="1925" /> the Labour policy.  Deputy Corish also spoke before Deputy Cosgrave and made an excellent speech.  Yet when &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; came on it was not mentioned, but when the television news came on it was presented in such a way as if Deputy Cosgrave spoke first.  Despite the fact that Deputy O'Leary said the comment was unfair and untrue, that was not mentioned; and Deputy Corish's statement was given as if he had spoken after Deputy Cosgrave and had not attempted to refute the statement made.</P>
    <P>That sort of reporting is wrong.  I do not know who is responsible for it, but it should not be done.  We are not in a position to refer to persons outside this House when we are making speeches here, and usually the Chair prevents us from doing that.  It was rather unfortunate that I was in the Chair last night when this was said. If I had attempted to prevent Deputy Cosgrave from proceeding, although I knew what he was stating was incorrect, I would have been accused of being biased.  Therefore, I had to allow it to go through.  I think the reporting of the matter was wrong and it was the type of reporting which does not do Radio Telefís Éireann any good.</P>
    <P>This is not the first occasion something like this has happened.  At our annual conference somebody made a speech.  The whole speech was televised but one sentence was picked out, and even though that was merely the man's personal opinion, that particular sentence was presented as though it was the general opinion.  At the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis the same thing happened. I am quite sure neither the Minister nor the Chair would agree that what was given represented the views of the Fianna Fáil Party, but that was what was put across.  This is the sort of thing which I consider wrong.  As I say, I am an admirer of Telefís Éireann.  I think they are doing a very good job but they slip up some-times by putting an accent on the wrong thing and in the wrong place. The sooner they realise that, the better for all concerned.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the <Col N="1926" /> question of televising the proceedings of the House.  I do not agree with what Deputy Dockrell says on this.  Perhaps if some of the proceedings were televised from time to time, as is done elsewhere, it might not be a bad thing. It would certainly increase the attendance and also, since some people seem to think that some sort of machine comes in after the Second Reading of a Bill and takes over from there, television would show that this is not so and we might be given more credit from the general public for what we do.  Deputy Dockrell would say, of course, that 99 per cent of the people do not hear or do not believe the statements made by some people but the fact is that those who do hear usually take the wrong meaning.  This is what happened last night with Deputy Cosgrave.</P>
    <P>In so far as sound radio is concerned, the Minister may be missing out on something.  I think that the reason why sound radio is losing money is because not enough of the £5 licence is allocated to sound radio.  Sound radio is doing a better job than most people are prepared to admit.  There are large numbers of people throughout the country who use sound radio to a large extent&mdash; people driving their cars or walking around with transistors and, of course, people in those areas where there is still no television.  It is most likely that all of those people will have paid their £1 fee and, therefore, the proper consideration should be given to them because they are paying their share.</P>
    <P>As far as increasing the licence fee is concerned, this is really too bad for those people who pay their fees.  One thing I discovered recently was that most poor people pay their licence fees because they are afraid their sets might be taken away, or some other action taken against them, but very often the people who do not pay are those who, because of their position, believe that nobody will ever ask them to produce a licence.  Some of them even brag they have not paid a television licence fee since getting their set eight or ten years ago.</P>

      <P>Spongers, yes. Call them what you like but they are the people who are not paying their fees.  I believe it would be unfair to increase the licence fee particularly in areas where there is only one channel and where there is bad reception from the one channel.  Talking of bad reception, I should like to refer briefly to another aspect of this problem.  There are certain areas where, deliberately or otherwise&mdash;local people will say that it is deliberate&mdash;Telefís Éireann cuts in on UTV and where, if the UTV channel is turned on during the Telefís Éireann broadcasting hours, there is a humming noise or a blur across the screen.</P>

At any rate, people whose reception is bad, will be very aggrieved if it is decided to increase the licence fee.  Again, I should like to thank the Minister for his courtesy in giving us so much documentation.  He is very good at figures and has given us plenty of them.  With this Telephone Capital Bill he is heading in the direction in which most of us would like to see him going.  We want more telephones installed and we want them installed as quickly as possible and that can only be done if the money is made available by this House for this purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy P.J. Burke has kindly agreed to give me an opportunity of speaking for five minutes or so.  Since the question of telephones has been stressed in this Estimate, I should like to stress the need for the provision of more phones in my constituency.  I am sure that my colleague, Deputy Geoghegan, will agree with me when I say that there is a great demand for more telephones in Galway.  Our city is, I am proud to say, an up and coming one touristwise but it is in great need of telephones. Along the west coast this need is very great, in order to enable us to cater for <Col N="1928" /> the ever-increasing number of tourists which we get each year.  By helping us to acquire the extra telephones needed, the Minister will, in fact, be helping the tourist industry.</P>
      <P>I notice that the Minister, this year, has provided a little extra money by increasing the phone charges from 4d to 6d.  It is said that &ldquo;Talk is cheap until one takes up a telephone&rdquo;.  I should like to stress, also, the need for privacy in post offices.  When people wish to transact business in their post office, they like to know that they can do so without everybody behind them knowing what is going on.  If, say, a woman wishes to put a few shillings into her post office savings account, she does not wish her neighbours to know how much she is putting in. Greater shielding is required if we are to have this privacy.  It is also important that the officials discuss matters in an undertone and not in a voice loud enough for everybody to hear.</P>
      <P>The television service, on the whole, is doing a very good job but just as in politics, they cannot expect to please all the people all the time, because that would be an impossibility. However, I should like to make a few comments on the service.  In my opinion, we are getting far too many fifth-rate, American-type films.  If this continues we shall have American accents before very long.  Could we not have something that would be of more interest to the people here?  I agree with the Deputy who referred to the long-haired groups.  We are also getting far too much of this type. They have no more music than one would find at a fair among cattle mooing and pigs squealing.  This is not only my belief, I am expressing opinions which are abroad.</P>
      <P>Now that the school strike is over &mdash;thank God for that&mdash;could we have Radio Telefís Éireann playing a greater part?  Could they help us to make up for the loss the children have sustained during this strike? They have done a good job and possibly could help in this.  Could we have civics through this medium?  It was never more needed than it is today, as one will see by looking around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People are not slow to condemn the <Col N="1929" />&ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;; nevertheless they are always trying to look at it.  That in itself is a tribute to the show.  I must comment on a recent letter.  This letter was so filthy it could not be read on TV.  It was a letter condemning the compere and it was held up before the cameras.  I do not know why a letter like that was shown on television.  I know for a fact that the signature to that letter was a false one.  There was a dual address on it.  There was a number of a house given at one end of the town, and an additional address was given at the other end of the town. This caused considerable embarrassment to a decent respectable citizen. The showing of this letter on RTE was not restricted.  If an ordinary person sent such a letter through the post the Garda would have dealt with it. Why was this letter not given to the Garda first for investigation?  The letter condemned the compere in filthy language and the compere should not have shown this on RTE.  I do not blame him because he does not prepare the programme.  He just goes in and does the job handed to him to do. That letter has caused great embarrassment at one address even though it is a kind of mixed-up address.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been here since 10.45 a.m.  There was a big field speaking about the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  The Minister gave a very detailed statement on everything that his Department is doing.  It was an encouraging statement.  I have had the pleasure over the years of dealing with one particular section of this Department while trying to get telephones for the people of County Dublin.  The officials of the Telephone Section were very courteous.  One could put any of them into the diplomatic <Col N="1930" /> service.  They were not always able to meet my wishes&mdash;it would be a miracle if that were so&mdash;but they tried to do whatever job was asked of them.</P>
      <P>Some of my friends in Swords, North County Dublin, applied for telephones over two years ago.  I have been told that the position will be rectified within the next few weeks.  This just shows that any money or staff that the Minister can spare should be directed towards extending the telephone service to meet the huge demand.  I feel that a wait of two years is too long.  I know the Minister has trained staff to do this job and I know the capital charges involved.  The trend in our affluent society is for people to have private telephones.  There are, of course, priority cases like doctors, clergymen and businessmen.  I fell businessmen should get priority as they have been. This whole question of providing telephones is a huge problem.</P>
      <P>I am often on the telephone to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, and even to the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary.  I feel that anything that the Minister can do to expedite the telephone service should be done.  He will have the backing of all the House.  Perhaps the Minister can tell us whether there is a shortage of staff but I feel that we should be able to meet the demands in less than two years.</P>
      <P>I welcome the advance made by the Minister where telephone kiosks are concerned.  A kiosk is a social amenity in a district.  It may be responsible for saving a person's life.  A kiosk is a very essential social service in a district. I would like the Minister to provide a public kiosk in every district even if his Department has to bear the financial cost of its erection.  Even if it does not pay its way, it is a worth-while social service.  We should have a special section in the Department to deal with kiosks, even if such a section would have to be subsidised from other sections of the Department.  We should not always be tied to economics where social services are concerned and I look on a kiosk as a social service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to deal with the question of vandalism in the strongest language possible.  Vandalism has <Col N="1931" /> caused much damage to a number of our telephone kiosks in the city and county of Dublin.  The people that are doing it are committing a grave crime.  People might be saved in road accidents or in other accidents, or even in cases of illness, by the availability of a telephone kiosk.  It is dreadful to think that people are destroying these kiosks.  These vandals are not children. They are men who go into these kiosks just to destroy them.  I am sure the Minister could tell the House how many public kiosks have been destroyed in the city and county of Dublin from time to time.  Even if we have to have plainclothes men to keep an eye on these people, we have reached the stage at which we should make an example of the men or boys who are responsible for doing this damage.  I believe they are in gangs and that they travel about in cars just to cause mischief and devilment where-ever they can.  I would like the Minister to give us his opinion on the whole position and to tell us the number of kiosks that have been destroyed.</P>
    <P>With reference to postal deliveries, there are areas in my constituency where the people complain that it is too late in the day when they receive their letters.  I have often told them it cannot be helped, but I wonder if in areas, particularly rural areas, where the post is always delivered first to business firms and later, perhaps at 1 p.m., to private addresses, whether there could not be some system of rotation worked out.  It is the only way in which this problem could be resolved because I appreciate that the Department cannot employ any more auxiliary postmen&mdash;a matter which I shall deal with after Question Time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The value of Ireland's exports to Italy in 1968 was <Col N="1936" /> £1,674,181.  Imports from Italy during the year amounted to £7,679,124.</P>
      <P>As regards agricultural products, while the possibilities of increasing exports to Italy are continually kept under review, the prospects do not appear to be very optimistic, at least in the short-term, as the importation into Italy of the principal products of export interest to us, especially cattle and beef, are subject to the restrictions of the European Economic Community.</P>
      <P>No opportunity is missed to give all possible assistance to the efforts of exporters.  So far as the Italian market is concerned, an officer of the Embassy to Italy is engaged full time on the promotion of trade and other foreign earnings activities.  Also, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, in the case of manufactured goods a wide range of grants, incentives and services has been made available to assist exporters. As was recently announced, a programme of new incentives and services aimed at stimulating and assisting a more rapid expansion of exports to markets other than Britain has been introduced by Córas Tráchtála. I might add that under this programme Córas Tráchtála propose to carry out market investigations in Italy, this coming autumn, for selected products.</P>
      <P>While it is primarily a matter for exporters to find and develop outlets for their products, I hope that the additional incentives which the Government are making available will encourage Irish manufacturers to increase their efforts to expand their exports to such countries as Italy.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that 100 per cent of the imports from Italy to this country could be produced here, especially boots and shoes? Is he further aware that imports of more that £7 million are depriving our people of jobs in our own factories, that due to the imports from Italy, especially of boots and shoes, factories here have to close down and over 700 have been thrown out of employment in this country; and, further, due to the fact that we are not bound to buy from Italy, can the Government not place some restrictions on the imports and protect our own factories and our own people who are employed in Ireland?</P>

      <P>There are restrictions placed against imports of footwear into this country.  It all ultimately depends on the practical patriotism of Irish people to buy Irish-produced goods, especially footwear in this context, because it helps not only to maintain Irish people in employment but also to maintain the economy of the country.  I would take advantage of the Deputy's supplementary to appeal to Irish people to adopt this modicum of practical patriotism in this respect.  Nothing can overcome that.</P>

      <P>It is a year ago that I asked a similar question and got a similar answer, which is in itself unsatisfactory. Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that, since the transfer of public road haulage to private firms and companies in Northern Ireland and the Minister's licensing for a period of 72 hours the entry of these companies into the Twenty-Six County area and the fact that by so doing he has enabled these to take the cream of the public transport, public companies here, including CIE, are losing money by having to depend on what is left and, in that situation, is it not advisable that the Minister should take steps to ensure that this unfair competition shall cease forthwith?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the growing demand for fuel oil in this country with the consequent decline in the popularity of solid fuels including turf. In so far as the domestic and private industrial market is concerned, this trend seems to be continuing.  As regards State and semi-State bodies, local authorities and related bodies, the established policy of the Government is to ensure that all such bodies give preference to the use of native fuels and that when they are contemplating the construction of new buildings or the reconstruction of old ones, they consult with Bord na Móna as to the practicability of using turf.</P>
      <P>The ESB in accordance with Government policy use the maximum possible amount of turf for electricity generation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if, in view of the fact that in a reply of 7th July, 1966, he stated that the text of legislation to deal with the situation that arose following a Supreme Court decision in December, 1961, in the matter of peaceful picketing was being withheld until the texts of the Trade Union Bill, 1966, and the Industrial Relations Bill, 1966, were available, he will now state when it is proposed to publish this outstanding and necessary amendment to the trade union law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Labour (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>When this draft Bill emerged from the deliberations of the working party set up after the Supreme Court decision in the Educational Company case it was envisaged that the question would arise of consideration of its constitutionality by the courts.  Further examination of the draft Bill has suggested that it might be open to constitutional challenge on several grounds.  For this reason and also because I am not convinced that, in present circumstances, legislation extending <Col N="1948" /> the protection of picketing in trade disputes would be justified, I have decided to defer further action on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that the reply the Minister gave on 7th July, 1966, is not true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that I gave a reply.  There was an undertaking given, after the Educational Company case, by the then Taoiseach to set up a committee to study whether a Bill could be drafted which would permit picketing to force an employer to force employees to join a union and the undertaking was honoured.  The committee was set up.  It produced a draft Bill which they thought would have to be tested by the courts for constitutionality.  I did answer a question on this saying that the time when it would come before the Government and the House would be the time of the other trade union Bill but, having examined it and taken advice on it, I am satisfied that it would be illogical to introduce a Bill now that is doubtful constitutionally on several grounds. Also, I do not think it is a good time to extend the protection of picketing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that, having given an undertaking on 7th July, 1966, that he proposed to introduce such a Bill and in view of the fact that he must be aware that the drafting section would be able to draft a Bill which would be constitutional to cover the necessary points and that a definite undertaking was given by the former Taoiseach and by himself, it is not good enough just to say now that the time is not ripe or something like that, in order to avoid issuing it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that the time is not ripe.  First, there is no way of drafting a Bill so as to be sure it will be constitutional.  The Bill requires that an employer be forced by picketing to force his employees to join any union or it could be used to make people leave one union and go to another.  I think it would be an undesirable power to have even if the Constitution would allow it but I do <Col N="1949" /> not think it would stand up to constitutional examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister is entirely fair there.  There was never any suggestion that there might be picketing to ensure that a worker would leave one union to join another.  That was not the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I brought in that idea. I am not being unfair.  The idea was that an employer could be picketed and his firm shut down to force him to make employees join a union.  The same power could be used for the purpose which I have just mentioned. Apart from that, the matter could be doubted on several grounds under the Constitution.  I do not think that at this time this extra protection for picketing is required in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that the only issue decided by the court was that while they were perfectly entitled to put pickets on to force those already members and who were in arrears to put their cards in order, they were not entitled to take action against people who were not up to then members?  The former Taoiseach gave a guarantee that he would introduce legislation to regularise that position.  I want to know now have the Government decided that they will not introduce legislation to amend the law in order to remedy the decision in the Fitzpatrick judgment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>To clear the former Taoiseach, the first undertaking he gave to the Congress of Trade Unions was to discuss with the Attorney General the setting up of a working party to consider how, without conflicting with the Supreme Court judgment, a trade union's right to take action, including picketing, to enforce union membership, could be made effective again and any legislation needed for this purpose. Now he set up that committee and the working party was set up.  He kept his end of it.  Another undertaking given was to submit the report of the working party to the Government and to ask for Government approval in <Col N="1950" /> principle to give effect to it and to inform Congress and he did that.</P>

When the companies confirmed, in response to inquiries, that these reports were correct, I made it clear to them that I regarded the proposal to increase the rates by more than 10 per cent as not being in accordance with the arrangement which I had already made with them.

      <P>Before Questions I was dealing with postal deliveries and complaints from people that their post does not reach them until 12 noon or one o'clock in the day.  Would it be possible, I wonder, to interchange the routes periodically so that those who get their mail early one week might get it late the following week and <i>vice versa</i>?  I do not know whether or not that would please everybody. Those who are used to getting their mail early in the morning might not like to surrender that amenity.  Another solution would be to employ more auxiliary postmen but, if one does that, it would scarcely be worth the auxiliary postman's while to go to work because he would have only an hour or two in the morning.  You will not get anyone to do that work.  However, I will leave it to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I may have a chat with him some time about this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Business people demand the right to get their post early in the morning.  I agree that business firms and others should not be deprived of their post.  I have often made representations in this House about business firms getting their post late in certain areas.  These firms should be able to co-operate a bit more.  I am sure the Post Office would facilitate them if they sent a man to collect the post, but then you would be doing a postman out of a job, and that is another point.</P>
      <P>I want to deal now with auxiliary postmen.  When an auxiliary postman is employed he should be given sufficient hours to give him a week's wages. I do not want to labour that point. Auxiliary postmen are full-time postmen within the meaning of the Act but they have not all been appointed and, in a society like ours, we should have a new look at that problem.  They may not have passed some particular examination but some of them have 40 years' service.  They have the same hours as permanent postmen and they do not get a pension when the time comes to lay them off.  That is the outlook of the 17th and 18th centuries. This is a social problem.  The Government could set an example here.  Red tape should not prevent those men from getting a pension.  If there is a fault in the system which has grown up over the years surely, in the light of our experience, it could be corrected. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would take this up with the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dealt in general with telephone kiosks which I consider to be a social necessity in every area, especially <Col N="1968" /> along the main roads, and especially where accidents have occurred.  They could be the means of saving a person's life.  I got many replies from the Department stating that it would not be economic to put a telephone kiosk in this area or that area.  I know it would not be economic, but there are a number of things we do which are not economic.  It is not economic to pay social welfare benefits.  I regard a telephone kiosk in each district as a social necessity.  I should like the Minister to tell the House how many telephone kiosks will be put up in County Dublin during the coming year.</P>
    <P>In the Garrettstown area the public telephone is in the post office.  The post office closes at 6 o'clock and, if the people want to make a call later for a doctor or a nurse or on urgent business, they cannot do so because the post office is closed.  I cannot understand why the Department cannot put a public telephone box outside the post office.  Surely it would not cost anything, and it would be an advantage because people would use the phone outside the door of the post office.  I have taken up this matter and I hope the Department will see their way to doing this.  I cannot understand why a simple request like this cannot be granted.  It is a social request.  It would help the people in the area considerably, and there are not many telephones in the area.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister would have another look at it. Sometimes people ask us what they are electing us for if we cannot do something for them.  Therefore, I am forced into the position of raising it publicly.</P>
    <P>The majority of the post offices are kept very clean and that is a good thing from the tourist point of view. I agree with other speakers that post offices should be bright places and should be well kept because of the impression that creates on the tourists. It looks well and they see that this is an up and coming country.  We depend so much on our tourist trade that we should make the most use of any show window we have.</P>
    <P>A number of facilities have been <Col N="1969" /> made available for the blind.  That is a step forward and I should like to thank the Minister on behalf of those people who are dependent on those facilities.  We are living in an affluent society.  Hundreds of people have been looking for telephones during the past few years.  I welcome the statement made by the Minister about RTE this morning and every decent citizen will welcome that statement too.  Today we have a number of people roaring and shouting about democracy.  There are certain sections who think it is a great pastime to insult the established order as we know it.  They think they are very smart in challenging authority in every way they can.  So far as public men are concerned, we expect that in public life but we want to protect others.  This House is in a position to protect decent people who were attacked on RTE by people who hold no authority.  Any old crackpot who forms an organisation can get on RTE to blackguard someone else.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister's statement today.  If there is democracy on one side there should also be democracy on the other side.  People who are being attacked should have the opportunity to defend themselves.  I am very happy that the Minister is taking a democratic stand on this.  I do not want to stifle the opinions of any person good, bad or indifferent.  Indeed, speaking on the Criminal Justice Bill I said I thought we should have a safety valve like Hyde Park Corner where these people could speak and would not be holding up the traffic. Let them go there and say what they have to say.  I am not saying anything against the officials on RTE.  I have had the honour of meeting them and I want to thank them for the courtesy I received on all occasions.  I am just pointing out that people of standing have been attacked and they were not in a position to defend themselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement today was most important.  It will bring a lot of credit to him and to Telefís Éireann. If he continues along that line, he will be defending a free democracy and will not allow it to be abused by any old crackpot who comes along.  One cannot always be right in every statement <Col N="1970" /> one makes, but there should be some little safeguard for decent people. I shall not mention names but there are people of standing in our society who are entitled to our protection if any effort is made to pull them down.  Furthermore, they are entitled to have somebody there to defend them.  I do not like our media of publicity to be misused by this small minority who have no regard for anybody. Indeed, I do not think they have any regard for themselves&mdash;but they have a cure for all ills.  I shall not say any more on that point.</P>
    <P>The television programmes are very good, as are also the radio programmes. They are doing a very good job.  I wish them well.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a big job to face. I welcome his programme for extending the telephone service and improving the service generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few points in the Minister's opening speech on which I should like to comment. The Minister stated, in relation to the reorganisation of the postal service, that 16 sub-post offices were closed in 1967.  He went on to point out that the policy now is to close sub-post offices which, to put it in his own words, are not being used sufficiently to justify keeping them open.  This whole question of closure of sub-post offices, dismissal of auxiliary postmen and the motorised delivery of letters requires examination.  I am not at all convinced that it is a good policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my locality, where a sub-post office was closed and two auxiliary postmen lost their jobs, the mail is now being delivered from the central post office by van.  All down the years, the post was delivered to my house at 8 a.m. but, since the introduction of the van delivery service, we get it at 11 a.m.  With van delivery, a much wider area is covered.  It stands to reason, then, that some people will get their post early and that others, at the end of the route, will get their post very late.  I have had complaints in this connection from other areas in Limerick, from people who were getting delivery of their mail in the forenoon in the old days from the local <Col N="1971" /> sub-post office and who are not getting their mail now until well into the afternoon.  That is one result of the changed methods of delivery but, in addition, we must face the fact that a number of auxiliary postmen have been thrown out of employment.  It is a scandalous state of affairs that these postmen have been treated in this manner by the Department.  I have asked questions in this House on a number of occasions about the matter. I have seen cases of men who were employed for a long number of years and who, with the closure of sub-post offices, lost their employment.  As far as I know, there is no provision for pensions for these men, although the situation may now have changed.  I should be glad if the Minister would elaborate more fully on the policy of his Department for the future in relation to the closure of sub-post offices and the reorganisation of the delivery system of mail.</P>
    <P>We all agree that an efficient telephone service is vitally important to any country.  It is tremendously important here because of the fact that we have a developing industrial arm and a developing tourist industry.  It is not always appreciated that one of the things an industrialist will look for, when proposing to establish an industry in an area, is an efficient telephone service.  There has been quite a considerable improvement in the efficiency of the telephone service in the Limerick region in recent times.  We are now part of a large complex embracing the Shannon Industrial Estate and the Shannon International Airport.  A topclass telephone service in that area is, therefore, vitally essential.  From time to time, there have been complaints from people, but, for the past year or so, there seems to be a considerable improvement in the efficiency of the telephone service there.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the programme for the installation of automatic telephone exchanges, which is a very important matter.  I am glad to note that considerable progress has been made in the installation of automatic telephone exchanges.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentions another <Col N="1972" /> problem in the Post Office Engineering Section, namely, the difficulty of recruiting engineers.  Would it be possible for the Post Office to devise some scheme whereby they could ensure sufficient engineers for the service? Could some type of studentship be operated whereby suitable recruits to the service could be taken on after leaving certificate and could be sent to university, while at the same time obtaining practical experience in the service.  I understand that this type of approach has been used fairly effectively in Britain.</P>

      <P>Good.  The Minister referred to the Telex service. This is something of which I have not very much experience but quite recently I saw this Telex system in operation.  The Minister referred to the fact that it has now been possible to reduce the costs of installing a Telex system.  In relation to industry and tourism and to all fields of activity which demand an efficient communication network a Telex service is of vital importance.  However, I understand that even though the Minister states it has been possible to effect a reduction in installation costs, the installation of a Telex service in a firm is still a pretty costly business and in many cases the cost is prohibitive.</P>
      <P>The most interesting part of the Minister's speech is in the final pages in which he enunciated some very important basic principles in relation to the broadcasting service.  While I have disagreed with the Minister on many occasions in relation to various things, I want to say that I fully agree with the principles enunciated by him here in relation to the national broadcasting service, particularly where he states:</P>
      <P>A national broadcasting service should not follow the prevailing trend of stirring up protest in such a way as to emphasise all the weaknesses of human nature and defects in social and economic structure leaving not an impression of constructive policies to be pursued but a cynical and destructive impact on the viewer and listener.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1973" /> He goes on to say that it is important that RTE should encourage constructive thinking.  This is very important. There is nowadays too much of a tendency towards sensationalism in reporting. We find this in the question of student rioting and protests by various sections.  The sensational aspect of it tends to be highlighted.  It is a fact that side by side with the people who protest there are hundreds of students in this country who quietly and without any exhibitionism or sensationalism are engaging in charitable and social works of a very high order.  I know examples of students who devote their spare time to looking after the aged and people in need and other students who spend their holidays doing constructive work.  I have in mind particularly the students who spend their holidays on projects such as the Cheshire Homes.  Unfortunately nowadays there is a tendency on the part of the communication media to play down this type of constructive action and Telefís Éireann is an offender in this respect.</P>
    <P>In the economic sphere, I call to mind incidents in my own constituency a year or two ago when the problem of unemployment was being highlighted and when Telefís Éireann did a special feature on it which presented a completely wrong picture of the whole problem.  A short time later when a news conference was held in Limerick to announce a major industrial project Telefís Éireann or Radio Éireann did not consider it even worthy of mention.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that RTE should not be used to create a murky cynical atmosphere in regard to what are ultimately problems due to inadequacies of character in people as a whole.  I feel that Telefís Éireann could play a better role in creating a climate of opinion conducive to constructive action.  It could play a much more constructive role in national development and I feel very strongly&mdash; I mentioned the case of the students and the Limerick incident&mdash;that Telefís Éireann is not doing enough to highlight community projects.</P>
    <P>There are numerous examples all <Col N="1974" /> over the country of local communities, through the application of the principles of community development and local co-operation, overcoming many problems of an economic and social nature.  These are rarely mentioned on Telefís Éireann but if some buffoon gets up and makes an outlandish statement his views will be highlighted and he will most likely be interviewed.  I want to say that people who are engaged in social and economic activity and people who have a proper sense of community effort and citizenship are not satisfied with the philosophy&mdash;if one might call it that&mdash;of RTE in the presentation of news or news features.</P>
    <P>We might as well be honest about it, politicians are very sensitive to news presentation.  I want to say that in so far as parliamentary reporting or political programmes go there is only one programme&mdash;and I am including sound and vision&mdash;which is beyond criticism.  That is the programme &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo;.  This has been mentioned before.  Whoever is responsible for compiling that programme has undoubtedly the ability to a high degree to pinpoint the main points made by Deputies in their contributions in this House.  It is completely objective, unbiased and beyond criticism. Many people have said to me and I have discussed it with other Deputies: &ldquo;Why can Telefís Éireann not broadcast `Today in the Dáil'?&rdquo; I understand the tape is there from the sound programme and I do not think, from inquiries I have made, that there is any financial or technical problem about beaming this programme on television.  It would be well worth while for some of the political commentators to study the techniques and the methods of presentation used in the &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; programme. The great thing about this programme is that it reports what Deputies have said, not what political commentators think they said or meant to say.  I would urge the Minister&mdash;whom I know to be sincerely interested in having a good television service&mdash;to use his influence to persuade the authorities of Telefís Éireann to have the 15 minute programme called &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; transmitted on television as well as radio.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1975" /> The Minister in his speech said that some programmes on television are good and others are trash.  The Minister did not say it quite as strongly as that but I am saying it.  I am sorry to say there has been a certain deterioration in the overall programme content on Telefís Éireann in the last twelve months.  Two or three years ago Telefís Éireann broke new ground when they introduced their winter programme. Unfortunately, the standard set at that time has not been maintained.  There seems to be a tendency now to revert to what, as far as I know, are called &ldquo;canned programmes&rdquo;.  It is also true to say that Telefís Éireann has done a tremendous job in certain types of broadcasting to which the Minister refers as public service type programmes. Telefís Scoile, for example, is an excellent programme.</P>
    <P>I have always been, and I still am, keenly interested in adult education and I hold the belief very strongly that Telefís Éireann could do more in the field of adult education.  A good start has been made with the introduction of such programmes as Telefís Scoile and the other programmes which the Minister mentioned: &ldquo;On the Land&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mart and Market&rdquo;, &ldquo;Radharc&rdquo;, and the various documentaries on continental countries.  This is the type of programme which people in this country want.  I would welcome any development which includes increasing the number of programmes of this type. I also note that the Minister commented on the fact that:</P>
    <P>... The Authority has taken steps to modify the recent trend in interviewing persons of all political and social opinions in a manner which has aroused the strongest criticism.</P>
    <P>This is a change for the better.  The Minister has also invited Deputies to make their views known to Telefís Éireann.  I am glad the Minister has stated that he himself has made his views known to Telefís Éireann.  In the final analysis, we shall get in this country the broadcasting service we demand, but unfortunately the people of moderate views to whom the Minister <Col N="1976" /> has referred are often not very vocal.  It is important that the people should make it known clearly if they are dissatisfied with the contents of certain programmes and with the attitudes and philosophies transmitted in them.  I would urge on the Minister the importance of maintaining close contact with the RTE Authority.  The only opportunity we ordinary Deputies get to express our views is once a year or so when the debate on the Estimate comes up.  I have had occasion to express my views to Telefís Éireann and, as often as not, I got very little hearing.</P>
    <P>To be parochial for a moment, I frequently get complaints from people in the Limerick region about the inadequacy of the news coverage there both by radio and television.  In fact, I was extremely embarrassed myself last September when 150 people from France came, in a chartered plane, to the Limerick region to spend a holiday. The group had been sponsored by a well-known French company, and I was at Shannon Airport with other people to meet this group.  There were television crews from the BBC and from French television but not even a reporter from RTE.  We get complaints, too, that Telefís Éireann gives little or no coverage to the St. Patrick's Day Parade in Limerick City.  I am voicing all these complaints in the hope that we might get our fair share of coverage in the news on radio and on television.</P>

      <P>The House will be grateful for some further elaboration by the Minister on sentiments expressed in his Estimate speech which must give every person in this House cause for grave disquiet.  I should not like it to go out from this House that the Members here were united behind the Minister in some of the statements he made in relation to Telefís Éireann and especially to public affairs programmes. The Minister says in his speech:</P>
      <P>It is evident from viewing foreign television and from a study of intelligent debate on the effects of TV on the public mind that the Establishment is always on the defensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1977" /> I do not know what he means by the &ldquo;Establishment&rdquo;, but I am talking about the political Establishment, and as a member of a Party which has suffered from the Minister's own smear campaign which he has run for the last few weeks in different parts of the country, I have little confidence in the Minister's sentiments in relation to fair play or the standard of public debate.  Repeatedly, for the last two months, this Minister has gone up and down the country smearing my Party for their policy and repeatedly in the last few weeks he has continued to make allegations against this Party and to throw red paint on it.  He has continuously during the last few weeks said that the democratic socialism, to which this Party subscribes, is in some way totalitarian and alien.  Therefore, I am not too happy and I would like some information about what the Minister means when he expresses disquiet about certain trends in Telefís Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am now speaking and I require some elaboration on some of the sentiments the Minister expressed here.  The basis I am making this on is the Minister's conception of political fair play.  It would be very dangerous to allow the Minister to go unchallenged in this House on the speech he made here on the Estimate. There is an impression abroad that we must have cotton wool treatment of TDs when they appear on Telefís Éireann to be interviewed.  If the Minister is saying here that somehow Government spokesmen are getting a raw deal on Telefís Éireann I want to say that this is a view with which I do not agree.  Within all their limitations Telefís Éireann are doing their utmost to give a fair and just proportion of views in this country at the present time.  Mark you, I have suffered from awkward questions on Telefís <Col N="1978" /> Éireann but if one goes for interview on Telefís Éireann and this is marked on occasions by awkward questions it is no excuse for making rash statements about a necessity for changing the trend in public discussion in Telefís Éireann.</P>
      <P>In general, it is a very good thing that the public have a chance of looking at and hearing from their public representatives on Telefís Éireann, whatever difficulties and embarrassments may be involved.  It is a good thing that the public have a chance to decide on the immediate reactions of their public representatives when they see and hear them in a discussion.  It can only strengthen the public's ideas of the limitations and the talents of the people which they have elected in election after election.</P>
      <P>I do not think any Member of this House should wish to hide behind statements issued to the press.  If we enter public life we take on the risk of answering awkward questions when they come.  I do not believe that we should attempt to put a barricade between ourselves and awkward questions. There has been in the last year or two an impression created outside that somehow Members of this House wish to wrap themselves in a cocoon against the community.  There has been an impression created abroad that all of us here subscribe to a club atmosphere and that that is what we wish to preserve.  I say if we are interested in the future of this House as a Parliament the more we open the affairs of it to public scrutiny the better for all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister intends in those rather ambiguous statements about his discomfiture with regard to present trends in Telefís Éireann.  I must say I find this rather strange coming from the Minister.  I must say I see more shots of Ministers on Telefís Éireann when they are opening this thing, or that thing, or speaking in this place or that place, than anyone else.  Over the Christmas period we saw the face of the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Boland, as he warned the public, at least three times every night, about hazards on the roads.  His face was to be seen on <Col N="1979" /> the screen almost every time we turned it on.  We all had to witness the paternal solicitude of Deputy Boland over the Christmas period.  I must say we are all greatful, particularly the pedestrians and motorists, that this probably had some effect but the Minister for Local Government, over the Christmas period, certainly did not lack his personal snapshots in his warning with regard to the hazards of the roads when he was on Telefís Éireann.  Likewise, I have never seen any lack of viewing time to show the solicitude of this Minister or any other Minister.  I have always considered that they got a very fair showing from Telefís Éireann.  My impression has always been that the Government got more than their proportion of coverage of news programmes.</P>
    <P>I would say that there is a very delicate balance between a television service which is reasonably free of Government control and one which must answer to every Ministerial whim.  I am very apprehensive about the statements made by the Minister today about the situation in Telefís Éireann.  Here they are attempting to run a reasonably free service and also a reasonably responsible service.  I cannot see that the Minister can blame our television service for the disagreements which are a fact in the community. Does the Minister imagine, or believe, it beneficial that Telefís Éireann should ignore matters in which the public are interested?  After all, if the Minister wishes to protect the people from adult political discussion on Telefís Éireann they can quite easily turn the switch and hear it from Britain.</P>
    <P>The Minister says this is a Christian community.  So it is.  I have not seen any programme on Telefís Éireann to suggest that this community is otherwise. In fact, most of the public discussion and inquiry programmes seem to me to be inspired by Christian standards. I would say all of them are in fact so inspired.  I must commend the religious programme &ldquo;Outlook&rdquo; which shows us that such a programme can take up social issues.  I know there are many people who would not feel <Col N="1980" /> that this is a very good thing.  I know there are many people in the Fianna Fáil Party who take this view.  I must say, although some people say you should not bring social issues into religious programmes, that many of those who attended the proceedings of the Second Vatican Council, and who have spoken on it since, would also agree with me.</P>
    <P>Sometimes it can be said that to be a socialist in this country is to be anti-Christian.  We would suggest that in the Catholic Faith there is no contradiction whatever between being a Democratic Socialist and a Catholic and that it is utterly wrong for the Minister to imply that Telefís Éireann were anti-Christian with regard to some of their programmes.  I am extremely uneasy about what the Minister says with regard to some of the programmes on Telefís Éireann as it seems to me he is hinting at further action.  In his speech he says:</P>
    <P>In connection with programmes on current affairs and news bulletins, I have on a number of occasions indicated some objectives which I consider should be aimed at.  News programmes should include a high proportion of constructive and praiseworthy developments and advancement in the national and international sphere and should inculcate love of our cultural heritage.</P>
    <P>The programme &ldquo;Bring Down the Lamp&rdquo; was certainly one programme which attempted to do this and it would be a good thing to have more like it.  I do not think that Telefís Éireann should ignore programmes which deal with positive developments in the country.  I am not aware of programmes on Telefís Éireann which apparently laud anarchy, as the Minister seems to suggest.</P>
    <P>The Minister says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A national broadcasting service should not follow the prevailing trend of stirring up protests in such a way as to emphasise all the weaknesses of human nature and defects in the social and economic structure, leaving not an impression of constructive policies to be pursued but a cynical and destructive impact on the viewer and listener.  I wish to make it clear that whatever be the <Col N="1981" /> practice in other countries, the standard of RTE in encouraging constructive thinking and positive solutions to problems must be of the highest order.</P>
    <P>We make no bones about the fact that our Party is protesting against the situation at the moment.  Does that mean that policies which apparently express dissatisfaction with the present sort of economic policies being pursued by this Government are to be described as stirring things up?  We make no bones of the fact that we wish to stir things up&mdash;to stir things up, in fact, to the point where we stir the government out.</P>
    <P>These are very alarming sentiments coming from a Minister who has a great deal of responsibility in relation to the national television service and, as I say, the Minister's own contributions to democratic debate prove that he is as good a mudslinger as any of his colleagues.  It does not alter matters that he throws the mud with an Oxford accent; it is still mud.</P>
    <P>If criticism is to be made of Telefís Éireann, I think that there are others in the State besides Deputies who must be heard.  As well as welcoming the views of Deputies, the Minister should also welcome the views of other sections of the community. Where we have only one television station and where that station was founded by the State, there is a very delicate balance to prevent that service being run on authoritarian lines. I may read things into what the Minister has not said, but certainly I get an impression, both from the Minister's make-up and from statements made here and elsewhere during the last few weeks, that he is teetering on the brink&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to public discussion programmes. I am most certainly entitled to be somewhat uneasy at the sentiments expressed by him in this Estimate.  We should require further elaboration of what exactly is meant by these rather ambiguous statements about worry that the Establishment might be annoyed by programmes.  I am referring to the political establishment here, which is the Minister's Party and Government, and I am saying that his Party get a very fair share indeed of public discussion programmes.</P>
      <P>I am also making the point that, in common with other Deputies, we must expect awkward questions on television programmes.  I myself have often been the butt of very awkward questions on Telefís Éireann, but I believe that is the nature of the medium and it is one that either we are ready to meet or we are not.  What kind of democracy would it be if we were to do a little brainwashing, as it were, on television interviewers so that they might ask us the questions we like to be asked?</P>
      <P>I am also suggesting&mdash;frankly I am a little biased on this but I just mention it as a tribute to the way things are being run&mdash;that every week has its quota of Ministerial pictures on television programmes.  Fair enough, they are the Government of the day and you can equally say justly that some achievement has been made or has not been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we begin to make a total change in the set-up because we feel irked at one programme or another and if we reach for our phone and say that such a thing should or should not be repeated, the people, especially those on <Col N="1983" /> the east coast who can do so, will very soon turn the switch on their set and get a programme from Britain which suits them better.  We cannot get away from the fact that we must give the Irish public adult programmes. They have been getting adult programmes, particularly in the religious programme &ldquo;Outlook&rdquo; and in the political programmes.  I am not so sure that the political programmes have the highest TAM rating; probably the politicians, in the view of the public at any rate, have not got the most interesting things to say.  But the programmes that have gone on have been a worthy attempt to uncover real political issues.  It may be disquieting to some to realise that ranting and raving on a television programme is not the type of thing the viewers are interested in.</P>
    <P>If our political and current affairs programmes succeed in breaking through apathy or inertia on any particular question then, surely, this is praiseworthy.  Short of having a second television station in this country, I do not see how one could ensure that there would be fairness in presentation if we interfere and intervene in the present situation.  For myself, I would say that it would be wrong for us to intervene or interfere because of the handling of a representative of a Party, whichever Party it may be, on a television programme.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is thinking along the lines of changing the present status of the Authority or changing the present drift of programmes, the House should be fully informed about what steps he intends taking.  I should not like the Minister to go away with the feeling of being given <i>carte blanche</i> from this House to proceed to Telefís Éireann and tell them that a new order is on the way and that he does not want what he calls the establishment to be criticised and that this is the unanimous feeling of the House.</P>
    <P>We want constructive programmes. Surely responsible and free discussion of political questions, in which the representatives of political Parties or interests discuss particular social questions <Col N="1984" /> and attempt to engage the interest of the public in these questions in an effort to break through apathy or inertia, is the best way in which we can ensure that we have a mature and adult democracy?</P>
    <P>That is what this Party would like to see and God knows our democracy is in need of adult political discussion after 40 years of irrelevant chatting about the Civil War politics.  Surely this is the thing we need most at the present time on a national television service?  One of the most alarming things which I see at present is the contempt among the young for the whole idea of this Parliament.  This is something about which every Member of this House must be alarmed.  Affairs of this Parliament since 1922 and topics discussed here do not really enable this Parliament to claim that real political issues have been discussed here.  Let us understand that.</P>

      <P>All of us of whatever political beliefs must see to it that this Parliament regains a high place in the interest and respect of the Irish people and that it be really seen to be a forum in which we discuss relevant issues and that our television service reinforces the idea that this Parliament is the place where real issues are to be discussed.  Such a Parliament has nothing to be afraid of from a free television service.</P>
      <P>I am suggesting the discussion of real political issues in this House.  In a free television service such discussion would receive ample coverage.  I am saying, as a member of a Party which cherishes the idea of a Parliament and of practising democracy and of gaining control of that Parliament, that I would be very loath indeed to suggest that Telefís Éireann should be interferred with.</P>
      <P>After all, we all talk about the freedom of the press.  There is in this country several large newspaper chains which persist in attacking and smearing Labour politics.  On communications media, I may say that, on balance, whatever discussions or questions we may have been faced with in Telefís Éireann, we cannot complain about the kind of programmes which have opened up public debate.  On the other hand, several of our newspapers, by the policy measures of their editorial board or otherwise, insist on giving little cover to Labour's political ambitions in this country or to the real policy we have put forward, apart from publishing the smears of our enemies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to elaborate further on what exactly he means by these statements mentioned in this Estimate, which appear to me to give grave grounds for disquiet and to suggest that there must be a definite change in the kind of discussions on public affairs programmes of Telefís Éireann and that there is cause for alarm in the trend there.  I should like to know by what means he hopes to correct these trends.  Taking the rough with the smooth and taking in general the achievements of Telefís Éireann, I feel they have done a good job under difficult circumstances because&mdash;and let us admit it&mdash;politicians are pretty <Col N="1986" /> thin-skinned, whether the public know it or not.  We are sensitive to criticism, especially criticism that appears to be misdirected or based on wrong information. For myself, I am sensitive when criticism which is incorrect is made. This is part of being a politician of a persecuted minority Party.  We must get over these personal drawbacks in that sense.</P>
    <P>I would certainly say that, taking the rough with the smooth and in the general course of events, Telefís Éireann have attempted to give a pretty fair approach to political matters in this country.  They have attempted to give all members of all parties in this House a pretty fair innings on programmes. Awkward questions have been put and will, I hope, continue to be put to representatives of all Parties in this House.  These programmes on public affairs discussions must hold the attention of an adult public.  If we decide to interfere with them, as we have seen done in Communist countries, where there is no free discussion as we see in France, where the Government intervene in every television programme and even suppress programmes, it would be a very bad thing.  It would be bad if we followed such precedents just because we felt that something, mysteriously referred to as &ldquo;The Establishment,&rdquo; was being knocked.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the concept in other countries of &ldquo;knocking the Establishment&rdquo;. The conclusion may be drawn from that that the Minister is critical of the approach of the service in relation to the present Government or to people with whose political views I would agree.  This is a fair interpretation of what the Minister said.  I would be glad of further elaboration from the Minister to ascertain exactly what he did mean.  The Minister cannot expect to come to the House with statements like these and feel he would not be asked for further elaboration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The television service is a most important connection with the public.  The <Col N="1987" /> Minister could not expect to make these statements without question. The TV service must hold an adult public in these public affairs discussion programmes.  If we intervene and ensure that only questions or programmes to the liking of our political viewpoint&mdash;it will be the responsibility of a future Government also to see to it that we have a free television service&mdash;and if we try to tailor make programmes to specifications according to our political approach, the public will give their verdict by turning the programmes off.  Would this be to the benefit of any political achievements which the Minister wants the Irish public to understand and acknowledge?  The practitioners in Telefís Éireann are aware that they are given under an Act of the Oireachtas this job of making the station as economically viable as possible and producing as much as possible of public interest. None of us can interfere with the freedom of the viewer to turn off the programme.  I suggest it would be to the detriment of politics in this country, and of public discussion, if such a feeling went out among the Irish public.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that next month or the month thereafter, when the Third Programme for Economic Expansion is issued, we will have at least one week devoted to the themes of that programme.  We will not complain: we appreciate that there is an election coming off and we say: &ldquo;If this is your policy for 1969 you must get a fair innings in the national television network&rdquo;.  I have no doubt we shall have discussions night after night, all on this programme, all lauding this achievement of the Government which the Government, as is their wont in policy matters, say will be realised in the years ahead.  The Minister would give me a sharp answer if I came in the following week to complain about this new economic programme put out by the Government.  He could say, justly I suppose, that it is a serious programme and that it is the public's duty to be interested in it.  I do not, for instance, think that Telefís Éireann gave an unfair coverage to the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis.</P>

      <P>Speaking as one who is never likely to be at a Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, I must say it gave me an insight into the make-up of the Ard-Fheis.  I was able to make an assessment of its democratic composition. It was an educational experience to see on Telefís Éireann an account of that Ard-Fheis.  As I had said, fortunately or unfortunately I have never been as close to a Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis and as one who is not likely to be at one of those gatherings, it was an educational experience.  Similarly, there must have been other viewers who were grateful for the opportunity. Surely, in the same way, in May next when Fine Gael have their Ard-Fheis&mdash;I am not likely, either, to be at one of theirs&mdash;I shall be very interested to view the make-up of that assembly.  I am doing my best to be impartial.</P>

      <P>It would be wrong for this House, as I have said earlier, to give the impression to the outside public that somehow we are afraid of television as a medium.  I believe television is here to stay and that in the future it will be an essential element in any democracy&mdash;and, therefore, that we have got to come to terms with it as a communications medium.  Let us hope that our newspapers, and our newspaper political commentators come to terms with it because there has been a certain amount of evidence recently that they have not.  Politicians of all Parties must come to terms with it and not attempt to give the public the idea that they view it as a vicious animal which must be reined in as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The more this House gets rid of the idea of exclusiveness, the more we open up our affairs to the public scrutiny, <Col N="1989" /> the more we shall be able to drive home the lesson that this Chamber is a place where democratic discussion occurs, where legislation is begun and where the country may observe its affairs being discussed.  We would not be doing a service to the whole ideal of democracy if we allowed our annoyance at one television programme or another to suggest that we must alter the whole basis of television.  Finally, it may be that the Government of the day&mdash;any Government, composed of any Party, in the future&mdash;may suffer the overwhelming temptation to interfere in a television service set up by the State.  We have had unsavoury examples in the past of warnings being made and ministerial suggestions about how one programme or another should be run.  Though it may be difficult to do so, we should resist the temptation to interfere.</P>
    <P>It may be that the only satisfactory solution which would ensure there would be a certain amount of freedom in a State-run television service would be the establishment of another television service in the country, run by newspapers&mdash;by a consortium, shall I say, of provincial and national news-papers. There are examples in other countries which show it is nearly impossible for one station in a country to ensure that it can defend itself against pressures from outside, especially Government sources.  This is one area in which, possibly, the best guarantee of freedom in communication would be competition between a State-run station and another.  One could arrange, perhaps, that as a result of one being a commercial station some of its proceeds could be utilised to subsidise the State station.</P>
    <P>All of this is on the lines of thinking how do we ensure that this important element in a democracy is kept reasonably free from interference.  Let us never put out the idea that the only custodian of responsibility in a country must be a Minister or a TD.  I am sure that the RTE Authority are as conscious of their responsibilities to the country.  I am sure there is no group in the country which could give us such a tale of woe in their attempt to give the Irish public a service which <Col N="1990" /> attempts to record the happenings of the country than the programme directors in TE.</P>
    <P>There are many organisations in the country which from time to time feel extremely annoyed at a programme. I feel sure there are many organisations which from time to time have felt that Telefís Éireann are not doing a proper job overall, in the period during which they have been operating, because of the kind of oversensitive reaction from Government sources to certain programmes&mdash;a reaction which I do not believe Telefís Éireann can be held responsible for because if Government policies were being put over insufficiently well, then that is a Government responsibility. The Authority may justly say: &ldquo;Send us the representatives.  Send us David Andrews to defend Government policy&rdquo;.  I am merely giving an example of a Fianna Fáil Deputy who puts over Fianna Fáil policy very satisfactorily in the circumstances.  I am attempting to be fair.  It is not the fault of the Authority if certain Ministers are unable to defend Government policy.  Possibly you should change your Ministers if you think it important enough.  The fault must lie with all the Parties concerned if we cannot put across our policies on Telefís Éireann without prior screening, prior rehearsal and a tailormade programme.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that one great gain we have had from the television service is that the public have had an opportunity to get behind the propaganda, behind the election promises, of seeing their politicians face to face and of drawing their own conclusions.  There is a challenge, undoubtedly, in television for any parliament.  There is a challenge in recognising increasingly that it reaches a very vast audience, that it presents the possibility that more people may become interested in politics, that more discussion may be engendered in the community on political issues.  I should imagine that it could be said that an increase in interest in political issues on the part of the public at any time certainly puts pressure on the Government of the day, whichever Government that may be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1991" /> Undoubtedly, the best climate for Government majorities in any country approaching an election is &ldquo;all quiet&rdquo;, a low key and low temperature.  If the temperature is heightened, if there is a great deal of discussion, it has happened, and political scientists have noted this trend, that it does not work too well for the Government of the day.  Again, Telefís Éireann cannot be blamed for this.</P>
    <P>I would agree with the Minister that possibly more could be done in terms of traditional Irish music.  Possibly there is not enough being done.  I read a criticism recently that suggested that the traditional Irish music programmes always apparently take place in stoneflagged kitchens, that such kitchens no longer exist and that traditional Irish music programmes should be given a more modern setting.  That is just by way of suggestion.  Possibly, we could do more in this area.  While little progress may have been made in making the Irish language more widely used, while policies may not have succeeded in bringing about this desired end, there is a wide public for traditional music and possibly a little more time could be given to this cultural heritage for which no compulsion has been needed at any time.</P>
    <P>Those people who go in for modern pop music might feel that they are not getting sufficient time on Telefís Éireann programmes.  There is a programme on Saturday night.  Possibly they have an organisational gripe about the little time that is being given to their interests.  I am sure there are other organisations who have their own axe to grind about omissions by the Authority.  Having regard to the hours of viewing I think the Authority do their best within the limits prescribed.</P>
    <P>My opinion is that there are too many very ancient films screened on Sundays and that we could do better with some more home produced programmes. In the advertisements which unhappily are necessary for the economic upkeep of the station, possibly too many British produced advertisements are used.  If we must rely on advertisements, possibly we could use home produced advertisements and thus give <Col N="1992" /> employment to Irish actors and actresses.  Too often one hears advertisements for this toothpaste or that toothpaste in a Cockney accent or some other accent not indigenous to this country and one wonders what is wrong with using an Irish voice to proclaim the virtues of one toothpaste over another toothpaste.</P>
    <P>These may be small points but they are points that occur to me.  Possibly we could have more educational programmes from this station.  Possibly we could do more to involve the schools.  There was a suggestion here today that we should try to produce programmes that would be suitable for a university audience.  I do not know whether there would be much basis for doing that at present although one of the areas that should be very carefully considered is adult education.  If there has been more attention given in recent years to education and its problems, it would appear that adult education is a matter that could do with more attention and perhaps more could be done by Telefís Éireann to produce programmes that would be of value to adults interested in particular cultural matters or disciplines.</P>
    <P>There are limitations on what Telefís Éireann can do at present.  There is only a limited amount of viewing time.  There are several things that must be done.  The Authority must cater for the agricultural population. There have been excellent programmes on matters of interest to the agricultural population.  Telefís Éireann must compete in interest with cross-Channel stations.  Let us not forget that.  The majority of the public can switch off the home television programme and switch to Wales, Northern Ireland or the BBC.  If our public affairs programmes do not appeal to them they can switch to these other stations and hear what Mr. Wilson thinks about the world and about Britain's problems. They might prefer to listen to Mr. Wilson talking about world problems than to a discussion on purely Irish domestic problems, or to the Taoiseach making excuses about the Third Programme for Economic Expansion.  Personally, I would much prefer to hear of the ill-directed speeches of the Minister <Col N="1993" /> for Posts and Telegraphs than to listen to British politicians because if I have to listen to a speech of Deputy Childers attacking us for some imaginary policy, a policy which exists only in Deputy Childers's imagination, it is of interest to know the limits of Deputy Childers's imagination and that is at least something gained.</P>
    <P>All in all, this House has cause to be grateful to its station working under difficulty, making many mistakes but on the whole with a pretty good record, under the circumstances of its working. I would not fault them on the matter which apparently is a matter of gravest concern here today, their handling of politicians and public affairs programmes. We could possibly express far more serious criticism in regard to other areas in which the station has not done all it should.  Certainly since its inception, in its political, adult and public discussion programmes the station, it appears to me, has attempted to blaze a very courageous trail in between all the vested interests, accepting all the criticism, subject to all the thin skinned reaction which I believe is a politician's reaction to criticism in any form and one which I share myself. I suppose if we enter into public life we do not do so on the basis that we should be welcome throughout our careers but on the basis that we must receive criticism, some of it unjust.  I suppose it is most hurtful when such criticism comes from those who know, in fact, what we said and have no cause for throwing mud or imaginary accusations and yet insist on doing so.  Still, that must be borne also.</P>
    <P>The public discussion programmes on television have attempted to get ordinary people interested in political and social questions.  Especially in this regard the &ldquo;Outlook&rdquo; religious programmes have attempted to break through this kind of inertia, this idea that a religious attitude could have no approach to, no voice in particular social questions; that kind of sentiment about religion expressed so arrogantly by the Minister for Local Government here a year ago when certain statements about the housing situation in Dublin were made by a particular priest and he expressed himself <Col N="1994" /> in very strong terms about that priest.</P>
    <P>I believe that Christians of all denominations have a right to speak on social issues and that the &ldquo;Outlook&rdquo; programme should surely have reminded official Christians&mdash;the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs reminds us that this is a Christian community; we all subscribe to that&mdash;that there are responsibilities involved in the Christian faith which cannot be confined purely to attendance at religious duties but which involve also concern with social and political action for the solution of the problems of under privileged people.  The &ldquo;Outlook&rdquo; religious programmes appear to me, in several of the burning issues they have taken up, to show Catholics that there is a dimension of action in belief; that it simply does not lie in belief, that there is also a call to action.  These programmes seem to me to fulfil that particular demand.  The &ldquo;Radharc&rdquo; programme and the people involved in it are to be specially commended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the statement he made this morning about his attitude and the attitude of the people to the present conduct of affairs in Telefís Éireann. I did not take it that the Minister meant what the previous speaker has mentioned, or that the Establishment he spoke about was a political Party or a Government.  I took it that the Establishment was this House and all the people and Parties in it.  I do not quite follow his reasoning.  I hope I shall not be led into following him point by point because it was not my intention to do so.  I do not follow his reasoning when he said that his effort is to make people have more respect for the House, and himself and his Party, when in the same breath he says that this House has done nothing worth while in politics for 40 years, since it came into existence.  I think a statement like that from a Front Bench Member of one of the Opposition Parties will not do anything to raise the prestige of this House in the minds of the public and especially of the young people who are so impressionable these days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We follow a democratic system of <Col N="1995" /> Government.  Surely we know democracy is a very weak system, a system that must be guarded against its weaknesses, and it is because we want to continue to enjoy the freedom we have under democracy that we must be careful to ensure that freedom is not eroded by a new medium which carries rather sensational views into every home.  I am very much a television fan myself when I am able to see it and I enjoy television but I am certainly perturbed by the influence it has and will have on our people. It has tremendous influence.  Surely, whether it is a churchman or politician, an employer or worker who is concerned he is entitled to be treated with respect when he comes on the television screen as a guest?  He is entitled to respect for himself as an individual and also for the position he holds.  I hope I am not speaking on behalf of any political party, because it does not matter to me in this sense what party is in Government: there are some who must govern and some who must be governed.  It is the duty of all of us to see that law and order is respected so long as it is the wish and will of the people that that kind of order is maintained.</P>
    <P>While the younger people may not know as much of their recent history as they should, it took a great deal of sacrifice by the previous generation to enable us to live as we are living today and to ensure that we can enjoy the freedom we have.  It is no service to the community now to intimate that everything here is worse than it is everywhere else and that it would take street protests and violent demonstrations to rectify the position.  The fact is that, by and large&mdash;I am not taking credit for it or saying that the Government have anything to do with it; I say that the Government, the Opposition and Parliament and everybody have an equal right to say they are responsible &mdash;the country was never as well off materially as it is today.  That is evolution.  It is the way things have worked.  It is not as well off as many of us would like it to be but it is better off than it ever has been and that is due to sacrifices made by a previous generation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1996" /> To my mind, it is quite untrue to say that nothing worthwhile was done here in the last 40 years.  I intended to open by saying: &ldquo;We could spend a complete day here usefully discussing Telefís Éireann.&rdquo;  But having listened to the previous speaker spending one and a half hours saying nothing, I think we could usefully spend a week talking about Telefís Éireann, its influence and what it needs.  It is all very well to pay lip service to democracy, our form of Government and the way we live here, but if this medium is not properly used it will do untold harm to our people.  That is why I welcome what the Minister said this morning.  It should be, and I think will be welcomed by everybody in the country except those few irresponsibles who cannot become known outside their own street or village unless they do something that is completely contrary to law and order.  If they do, nine times out of ten they will appear that night on television as national personalities.  Their one chance of becoming famous is to do something stupid.  That is certainly something that should not be encouraged. I know the television people are doing their best but I do not welcome this recently-developed habit of interviewing people and insulting them&mdash; I do not mind what kind of person is concerned.  I have heard Opposition leaders, Labour members and Government members being interviewed.  I have seen the Taoiseach being insulted. To my mind, all these people have been insulted on television.  It is not that they are thin-skinned themselves; if they were, they would not have put up with it.  Think of the effect it has on the viewer.  How can our young people have any respect for Church or State, or for public figures of any kind, if they see these institutions and these people treated in that fashion on television?  There are good features on Telefís Éireann. Some of the programmes are second to none.  There have been excellent Shakespearian productions.  There are excellent discussion groups, religious and lay, to which it is most interesting to listen.  Nevertheless, Telefís Éireann has offended in the recent past and it <Col N="1997" /> is only right the Minister should have the backing of this House when he suggests that something should be done to put a stop to any kind of offensive programme by Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>I think Telefís Éireann do not do enough to publicise the good that is being done.  They publicise the person who does something illegal, who sails too close to the law, or who does something that is regarded as novel, but they give very little publicity to voluntary associations and to the hundreds of workers who voluntarily help the handicapped, the blind, the sick, the old and the infirm.  It is very seldom they get any publicity.  On the other hand, the fellow who disrupts the traffic or throws himself off a bridge is quite certain to have the television screen at his disposal.  I would welcome a change in that attitude.</P>
    <P>We have a long tradition of being a courteous people.  We have freedom. I want to see that freedom and that courtesy maintained.  Visitors should be treated on television with the courtesy they would receive if they were visitors in one's own home.  The way in which some visitors have been treated has done nothing to enhance our reputation as a courteous and mannerly people.  If we permit the present situation to continue we will be in danger of losing our freedom altogether.  If the right people are not recruited to Telefís Éireann&mdash;people of sensitivity, education and know-how &mdash;Telefís Éireann will finish up like the newspapers; it will slant news without telling a deliberate lie.  It will give more emphasis to one side rather than the other and, by doing so, give a false picture.  Not everybody is as aware of the undercurrents and the trends as we are in this House.  Television goes into the rural areas, the areas in which the people have the old tradition and the old faith.  It undermines their confidence in what the previous speaker called &ldquo;the Establishment&rdquo;, in the Church, in Parliament and in ordered institutions.  If that confidence is completely undermined, it will be a very sad day for this country because, no matter how weak the system may be, it is the system we know best and I <Col N="1998" /> hope that all will unite to ensure that nothing is done in any service in the name of freedom which will end up in taking away from us the freedom we all so dearly cherish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess to some confusion of thought in relation to Deputy M. O'Leary's speech.  I was not quite clear as to whether he was denigrating the Telefís Éireann authorities or this Parliament.  It seemed to me he had not much time for either. The weight of his remarks was directed to the concluding paragraphs of the Minister's speech.  I think Deputy O'Leary misconstrued what the Minister said.  What the Minister meant to convey was that he would far sooner see Telefís Éireann producing what was helpful to the national outlook rather than producing that which is not very much to our advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not alone in street demonstrations. We are not alone in student riots. We are not alone in protest meetings or protest marches.  Our standards in relation to these things would appear to be higher than those in other countries but, at the same time, it is perfectly true that if somebody makes a public idiot of himself, as the last speaker said, he is practically certain to get a flash of some sort on television that night.  Perhaps, these things are getting a bit overdone now but if I were to lie down in the Custom House or walk up and down with a placard outside the Department of External Affairs I could be quite certain of getting all the notice which I was seeking. Recently I saw some half dozen people being carried out of the Custom House. They were surrounded by cameras.  We cannot put all the blame on Telefís Éireann because it was not only television cameras that were concentrated on these publicity seekers.  There were press cameras there as well.  Now there has to be a certain coverage but that coverage need not be quite so extensive as it is.  As the previous speaker said, there are many things being done by voluntary bodies in order to help the community which could be highlighted much more on television than they are at the moment.  For instance, we see a great deal of students when they lock themselves in somewhere, or <Col N="1999" /> chase Ministers out through windows, and that sort of thing; we do not see quite so much of the students who do such good work to raise funds for charities.  They get some publicity.  In my opinion they do not get nearly enough.  Their work is something of which we should be very proud.</P>
    <P>To return to Deputy O'Leary for a moment: he said that French television and radio were under dictatorial control like television and radio behind the Iron Curtain.  He does not, of course, know what he is talking about.  French radio and television are completely free.  I happened to be in France during the last presidential election and all the candidates and those who supported them were allowed to go on French television and speak their minds to the fullest extent permissible in any democratic community.  Therefore, I think it is foolish for Deputies to come in here and try to substantiate their arguments when they have not got their facts right.</P>
    <P>Our television service, taking it by and large, is reasonably good.  We have always to remember that it is still pretty well in the embryonic stage. Deputies will agree that over the past few years this service has been improving. Not only is it improving in what it actually produces as live television, but it is also producing some better films.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I addressed a question to the Minister for Social Welfare, the reply to which I did not consider satisfactory and, for that reason I felt bound to raise the matter on the Adjournment.  I asked the Minister:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Social Welfare if on the 20th February, 1969 a small deputation of the committee of the Clara branch of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union called to his Department for the purpose of leaving an important letter from the management <Col N="2000" /> of a firm (name supplied) of Clara, County Offaly, which had an important bearing on the claim of some hundreds of workers for unemployment benefit; if he is aware that they were left in the hall of his Department for three quarters of an hour and were later surrounded by at least 30 members of the Garda Síochána for no apparent reason; and if he will make a statement on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister linked up his reply with the reply to a question which I also addressed to him yesterday and which, I understand, cannot be debated on the Adjournment because of the hearing of the appeal.  This morning I made a plea to the Minister to have this appeal dealt with today if possible.</P>
    <P>I am raising this matter because of the circumstances that exist in Clara, and in Banagher where the circumstances are similar, where we have the extraordinary spectacle of, at least in Clara, 300 workers&mdash;that is the figure which the Minister has given in his reply; approximately 300 workers made a claim for unemployment benefit; those 300 employees each have at least three dependants so that is a total of approximately 1,000 people&mdash;who have not received a penny piece to maintain and support them in this small country town since the 4th or 6th of February.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the question of unemployment benefit does not arise on the question before the House. The only matter before the House is Question No. 51 which deals with a deputation to the Minister or his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree. Question No. 51 refers to an important letter from the management of the firm.  In this important letter the management, Messrs. J. &amp; L. F. Goodbody Ltd., clearly explained that these 300 workers were paid off by the firm because of a breakdown in machinery and, due to the unfortunate existence of the strike, the maintenance people cannot put the machinery into working order.  Here we find, as a result of this nationwide strike which is paralysing the <Col N="2001" /> country, and which neither the Minister for Social Welfare, the Taoiseach, nor the Minister for Labour seem to be taking seriously, that in the town of Clara great numbers of the population are this very day on the verge of hunger.</P>
      <P>I was informed last night that the last penny piece has been paid out by the local conference of the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  Workers have not got money for rent, rates, taxation, light or food.  The communication which they brought to the Minister's office on 20th February had a bearing on this matter.  The local branch of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union thought it necessary to come to Dublin, because of their economic circumstances, and because of the plight of their families, so that the Minister's Department might have this communication without any delay that might be involved in the post.</P>
      <P>When they arrived I understand that they presented a letter of introduction which I had given them.  This letter was taken to a senior official of the Department.  This group of lawabiding workers who had no intention of displaying any degree of discourtesy &mdash;my information is that they were met with discourtesy&mdash;were left standing in the hall of the Minister's Department for about three-quarters of an hour.  At the end of three-quarters of an hour, this deputation of people who were waiting for news, were surrounded by at least 30 members of the Garda Síochána.  That leads me to believe that the Minister's Department did not courteously receive the deputation from the trade union of these workers who had travelled especially because they had not one penny piece in their pockets to buy bread, fuel or light for their families.  Their wives usually shopped in a supermarket in an adjoining town, but in a supermarket it is cash down.  They had not a penny piece to provide food for their children.  For that reason they lost no time in coming to the Minister's Department with whatever information they had to strengthen their claim.  The response they got was to be surrounded by at least 30 members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2002" /> The Minister's reply leads me to believe that it was a smaller force of the Garda Síochána than 30, but may I ask the Minister why was it necessary to phone for the Garda to surround these decent, hard-working, honest, workers who were seriously perturbed because of the economic plight in which they found themselves?  They were interested only in getting a week's money.  They had been refused home assistance by the local authority because, in accordance with the regulations, the local authority could not pay them home assistance.  They said it was a matter of a trade dispute.  The question of home assistance was out, and the trade union of which the workers are members have not paid one penny piece to these workers because they claim it is the responsibility of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>This deputation called on the Minister's Department to find out if they were entitled to this money, where they were going to get money, how they were to keep body and soul together. They had already approached the local authority and been told: &ldquo;No, there is nothing here for you.&rdquo; They had already approached the trade union and been told they were not entitled to any trade union benefit. Their only hope of getting money was from the Department and, when they came to make their case to the Department, a force of 30 Garda was called to have them removed.  I think that is very great discourtesy and, in the interests of these workers, I think it should be raised here.</P>
    <P>This is the place to protest.  There are too many people protesting outside Parliament and on the streets.  Parliament is the place to make a case.  Parliament is the place to make a protest. On behalf of those people I want to protest in the strongest possible manner at the unreasonable attitude of the Department in not paying out those benefits to those people, without their being put to the trouble of coming up to the Minister's Department.  The responsibility rests with the Minister for Social Welfare so far as this matter is concerned.  He should make a very serious effort to alleviate the appalling distress that prevails in the town of Clara.  He is not taking a very serious <Col N="2003" /> view of this matter and neither is the Taoiseach nor any Member of the Government.</P>
    <P>People in an Irish town are hungry in the midst of prosperity.  There is nobody to give them anything.  We are all aware of what these people are entitled to, on their own contributions, as a result of very hard work but the only sympathy the Minister for Social Welfare has for them is to get the Gardaí to remove them from an office in which they were making a fair and just inquiry.</P>
    <P>We had a television interview today but I cannot understand why both television and the Press have been so silent about this matter in view of all we have been hearing of late about Captain O'Neill and the Reverend Ian Paisley in the North of Ireland, whose activities do not concern us.  It is appalling and certainly distressing to find little children going to school without food, and wives without a penny in their purse to buy it.  Then we hear from the Minister for Social Welfare that an appeal must be heard.  That was the purpose of the deputation which visited his Department.  If the appeal had been heard today there might not have been any necessity for us to comment on it.  Even if it has to be heard on Sunday, the Minister should ensure that the appeal will be heard as quickly as possible so that the workers and their families will at last be able to return to their normal pattern of life.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not make a decision this week-end, where will these people get money for food?  If the strikes last for another two or three weeks then God knows what will happen to those unfortunate people not to talk of the fact that, even when a strike ends, it takes a long time to repay debts which have had to be incurred in time of want and misery.</P>
    <P>To call in the Gardaí in order to have these people removed did indeed put the Gardaí in an extraordinary position.  It was an act designed to intimidate those people.  That is quite wrong.  They have enough problems without having had to meet a reception of that kind.  The Garda Síochána are <Col N="2004" /> there to safeguard life and property.  I cannot understand the attitude of the Minister's Department in getting the Garda Síochána to surround a body of most respectable, decent and hard-working citizens.  The Minister should apologise to the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union if there has been any misunderstanding.  The men may have appeared agitated, but so would the Minister in similar circumstances, with no money coming in since the first week of February; with the trade unions disclaiming responsibility and with the home assistance authorities disclaiming responsibility. These people are in a desperate plight.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister, in the name of Christian charity, to give the people what they are entitled to.  The reception they received in the Minister's Department has left a very bad impression on them and one cannot blame them for that.  The Minister should apologise for sending in the Gardaí in this case.  All that the people concerned wanted was an assurance that they would get what they were entitled to.</P>
    <P>In the early hours of this morning, I was informed through the public representatives in Clara, that widespread sympathy is going out to those people. The Government should see to it that justice is done.  Neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister for Labour is doing anything in this matter and all that the Minister for Social Welfare did was to send in the Gardaí to remove those decent people.  This is a very bad way of stamping out protests. This is the most desperate situation that has ever obtained in Clara.  It is a matter of life and death for the people concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not raise this matter with a view to obtaining political kudos of any kind; I do so because I am in close touch with those people and know their families and am painfully aware of their present unhappy plight which, I hope and trust, will be brought to a conclusion without delay.  Industrial relations in this country are desperate; that matter has already been referred to.  The Government have a bounden duty to look after the lives of the citizens.  This shocking state of affairs, <Col N="2005" /> which has our country in complete chaos and anarchy, and which, indeed, is driving it to disaster, must be brought to an end immediately.  It is wrong, it is immoral and it is dishonest that our workers should have to suffer as they are suffering and that their families should be on the verge of starvation. Somebody must come to their assistance.</P>
    <P>Down through the years, funds have been started and appeals have been made here for Biafra and other farflung parts of the globe.  We must now turn to those among us who are hungry and try to succour them.  Who will lead an appeal for those workers and their innocent families who are in this desperate plight, who are out of work through no fault of their own and who are getting not a penny piece from anybody?  The Government must take action before it is too late.  There is very little time left.  Those people do not know where to turn to.  I beg the Minister to give ear to my serious and very genuine plea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not go into the merits of the case because, as the Deputy is aware, the Minister cannot interfere with the deciding officer in the matter of an appeal.  He is a statutory officer in whom is vested full power to make a decision.  It would not be desirable or physically possible for the Minister to take on the responsibility of dealing with appeals.  One can strive to ensure that the minimum delay will take place on a decision on an appeal.  Deputy Flanagan, I would say, very much dramatised the appeal.  It is no different from thousands of other appeals throughout the entire country by people with an insurance record&mdash;appeals in relation to sickness and unemployment&mdash;which our deciding officers have to hear in the ordinary way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case, a number of workers were employed at Clara.  The appeal in question is in respect of workers who were out of work before a picket was placed.  I shall not attempt to say anything that would influence a decision one way or the other but it is significant that, when the picket was placed, the remaining workers refused <Col N="2006" /> to pass the picket.  God knows it is very easy to criticise industrial relations. Men sit up late at night trying to find solutions for people who find themselves out of work.  I have a lot of sympathy with men who find themselves out of work.  I have even more sympathy with those people who cannot find work and who would be glad to do it if they had it.  Unfortunately, there is quite a number of that category in this country.  Maybe some time sanity will return to the people concerned and such cases as these will not occupy the time of the House and people will find for themselves the nice livelihood it is possible to earn where they are fortunate enough to have factories.  There are so many towns throughout Ireland, particularly along the Western seaboard, where they have not these factories and the people have to go out to work in Birmingham, Liverpool and London.</P>
    <P>That does not mean to say that the Department of Social Welfare is callous or does not take a sympathetic view of every case and come to a decision impartially without being influenced one way or another in regard to the merits of the case.  Up to 1967 anybody out of work in any way associated with a strike or industrial dispute was automatically deprived of unemployment benefit.  Following some request from the Trade Union Council to the Minister at the time some suggestions were made and in my time I saw fit to make some amendments that would meet particular cases where people could show that they were not in any way associated with the dispute but were rendered unemployed as a result of it, that they could in some way be regarded as a special category.  In fact, I was looking at the particular extract of the Act in question and it is a very slender line between the two categories. Let me quote from the Social Welfare Act, 1952, which made certain exceptions:</P>
    <P>A person who has lost employment by reason of a stoppage of work which was due to a trade dispute at the factory, workshop, farm or other premises or place at which he was employed shall be disqualified for receiving unemployment <Col N="2007" /> benefit so long as the stoppage of work continues, except in a case where he has, during the stoppage of work, become <i>bona fide</i> employed elsewhere in the occupation which he usually follows or has become regularly engaged in some other occupation.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1967, states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Provided that the foregoing provisions of this subsection shall not apply to a person who&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  is not participating in or financing or directly interested in the trade dispute which caused the stoppage of work, and</P>
    <P>(b)  does not belong to a grade or class of workers of which, immediately before the commencement of the stoppage, there were members employed at his place of employment any of whom are participating in or financing or directly interested in the dispute.</P>
    <P>These are the exceptions which were made at the time and it is a very slender line making some provision in certain cases.  Up to then all persons in any way associated with a trade dispute or strike were automatically deprived of unemployment benefit.  This line is a fairly slender one.  It is a pity that when the picket did go on the workers at Clara, the remainder of the people refused to pass the picket.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 600 workers employed.  Only 300 have put forward a claim.  The last thing I would like to think is that my Department would treat any workers, union representatives or others who call to negotiate, in a discourteous manner.  I deny that this happened in this case. I submit that the Deputy is completely wrongly informed.  I was here in the House when these people arrived. I had no intimation of it.  In fact, it was the next day before I knew what it was all about.  I was on my way back after the Dáil adjourned this day week when I saw a group in <Col N="2008" /> the hall, quite a sizeable group, and an official discussing matters with them.  I did not see any gardaí at that time.  There was no commotion but it was obvious that they were discussing something in relation to matters pertaining to the Department. We have regular callers, sometimes groups.  Indeed, it is on record that on one occasion one of our doormen had his arm seriously injured by a caller who was disgruntled with the decision he got but I would not say that that has aroused any animosity towards the people in question.  The pity is that the letter they had with them was not sent up before they came so that it would be known they were coming. They brought a letter and it was given to somebody at the door who in turn brought it to the proper section. Eventually, the man dealing directly with it was found.  He explained the entire procedure to them in just the same manner as if they had come announced and arranged for a deputation. He did not show any discourtesy towards them though they did appear to be a bit excited and expressed the opinion that they came to force a decision favourable to themselves.  This is understandable.  This is nothing unusual nowadays.</P>
      <P>I should like to deny the information the Deputy has got&mdash;that they were surrounded by gardaí&mdash;which would seem to be a fairly unnecessary thing to do and absolutely pointless.  This did not happen.  Because of our proximity to Store Street Garda Station it is usual that one or two gardaí might be around there at any time.  It is correct that on this occasion some notification went to the barracks in relation to an unannounced deputation that arrived.  I would not say it went from any particularly high-up source but that is usual enough.  In fact, at times it might not be unusual for 100 workers or some type of pressure group to arrive at the premises.  It can happen at any time and queer things happen nowadays but there was no discourtesy, no unusual display of violence, no approach other than one of courtesy and I would not like it to have been otherwise. I can say that the Deputy is wrongly informed if he says the men were received in a discourteous manner.</P>
