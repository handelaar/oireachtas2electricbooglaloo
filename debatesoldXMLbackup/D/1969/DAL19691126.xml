      <P>The expenditure pattern which is used as the basis for the weights in the consumer price index is that for the average urban household and is derived from the household budget inquiry, 1965-66. These figures represent the actual expenditure incurred by the households and cannot be considered as equivalent to their minimum needs.  Moreover, household expenditure has not been allocated between adults and children within the household.  It is not possible, therefore, to give the information requested by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurke" hpid="Mrs. Burke Mrs. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is aware that nurses employed in the service of health authorities before marriage must in most cases, if they again enter the service of the authorities after marriage, enter the salary scale at a point which does not give full credit for previous service; and if he will take steps to ensure that full credit is given in such cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Standard practice in the local service is that a temporary officer is paid at the minimum of the appropriate salary scale.  In deference to local recruitment difficulties, a departure from this practice has been authorised whereby a married nurse who takes up a temporary appointment in a health authority hospital enters at the minimum of the salary scale on appointment but is granted an increment in respect of each completed year of satisfactory service thereafter. Present indications are that an extension of this concession is not warranted, but I will keep the situation under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries how much honey produced in County Wexford was rejected as inferior this year; whether this was due to its sugar content not being precisely at 80 per cent; how much foreign honey was imported into this country during 1969; what its sugar content was; at how much per pound it was imported; how many people import this honey; if it is imported under licence; and how many of the people who import honey are also in a position to buy or refuse to put on the market home produced Irish honey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department do not control the purchase of home produced honey by wholesalers or others but my information is that not more than 3 per cent of all the honey offered for sale by County Wexford producers to the major outlets in 1969 was rejected; and that such rejection could have been due to (1) low sugar content (2) off-flavours or taints (c) impurities or (d) additives.</P>
      <P>Imports of honey in the first nine months of 1969 amounted to 410 tons valued at £101,000 or 2/2d per lb., while exports and re-exports totalled 230 tons valued at £72,000 or 2/10d per lb.  I have no information regarding the sugar content of the imported honey.</P>
      <P>Imports of honey are not subject to licence but they are subject to customs duty at the rate of 1/- per lb.  Duty-free licences are given for such imports of run honey as are required (much of which is for re-export) but only to firms who have been active in the purchase of the home crop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>May I recall to the House that what I was asked by Deputy Corish on Wednesday last was whether I was aware of the disturbing evidence disclosed by this television programme of unfettered unlicensed moneylending and of the strong-arm methods used by some of them?</P>
      <P>My reply, in essence, was that I was not so aware because, according to the information supplied to me, the so-called evidence was worthless.  I gave to the House the information I had to support that conclusion.  I think the House was entitled to that information and nothing that has happened in the meantime has altered in the slightest degree the position as I then stated it.</P>
      <P>It is being suggested that I made an attack on RTE while ignoring what is said to be the real issue, namely, that even if the programme exaggerated&mdash; even, indeed, if its evidence was fabricated for the occasion&mdash;it was a substantially accurate account of what goes on and was therefore a defensible and valuable exposure of a social evil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly would not question RTE's right to present a work of fiction in order to expose some social evil.  But this programme was not presented as fiction&mdash;it was presented as fact.  The viewers were led to believe, and the great majority undoubtedly accepted, that what they saw on the screen was authentic, factual evidence of a widespread moneylending racket, backed by strong-arm methods.  The presentation of such a programme is of direct interest to me as Minister for Justice, because if the evidence was genuine, and if this criminal activity was in fact going on on the scale suggested, and going on openly at that, there could be no avoiding the conclusion that the Garda Síochána would stand indicted as hopelessly incompetent even after all allowances had been made for the difficulties of detection. I have direct and positive evidence that the programme was seen in <Col N="1860" /> that light by members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, wish to make it clear that I do not for a moment accept the suggestion that this programme would have been justified as a so-called exposure even if its evidence was fabricated. To say that fabricated evidence is worthless is only to state the obvious and to speak of exposing something by the use of worthless evidence is an absurdity.  In fairness to RTE, let me say specifically that they themselves have not sought refuge in that kind of argument and I feel sure that they would be the first to repudiate it.</P>
    <P>Reference is also made in these questions to the possibility that my previous reply might be construed as a reflection on the professional integrity of RTE members concerned.  I, therefore, want to point out that my previous reply concerned itself only with the complete unreliability of the evidence presented.  It was solely in that context that I referred to the fact that the people who appeared on the programme were paid to say what they said.  It was no part of my business, as Minister for Justice, either to criticise or to defend any of the staff of RTE and I did not do so.  I dealt only with the programme and its validity.</P>
    <P>If it is of any assistance to Deputies, may I say that I believe it to be the case that most of the people who appeared on the programme were contacted through an intermediary and some of them not even directly by him, but whether this is a point in favour of or against RTE I cannot say, because while it would be an answer to any charge that the people presenting the programme deliberately presented what they knew to be false&mdash;a charge which of course was neither made nor implied by me&mdash;it does leave them open to the criticism that, by farming out the job of recruiting prospects, they lost control over the manner in which such prospects might be approached and the inducements that might be held out to them?  May I repeat that I have never suggested, nor do I suggest now, that anybody on the RTE staff deliberately propagated what he knew to be false? What I do suggest is, first of all, that <Col N="1861" /> the people responsible for the programme failed&mdash;and failed by a very wide margin&mdash;to observe the standard of care in seeking and evaluating evidence which anybody undertaking to put on a programme of this kind should observe and, secondly, I suggest that, whatever one's views may be as to how far the people responsible were blameworthy in this way it is unquestionable that, objectively speaking, the evidence was worthless.  And when I say worthless I do not mean just that the witnesses exaggrated&mdash;I mean that nobody could rely on a word they said on that programme.  This is so irrespective of what form of words was used by those who contacted them and irrespective of whether the contacts were made directly by RTE staff or through intermediaries.  I shall later state why this is so, since there seems to be a good deal of misunderstanding about it.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday last I stated that two Garda superintendents had, at the outset, interviewed a senior official of RTE and that, as far as they were concerned, his attitude about the disclosure of evidence was negative.  The RTE statement subsequently issued did not challenge that as a fair interpretation of what happened and its accuracy is not at issue.  That negative attitude contrasted very sharply indeed with the claim made in the programme that, though the gardaí said detection was impossible, RTE had the proofs that unlicensed moneylenders were operating openly.  Nevertheless, the record will show that, when referring to RTE's attitude to the disclosure of the evidence, I spoke in a factual way and I made no criticism of the RTE attitude at that point.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, those who have sought to convey that I criticised RTE for abiding by the journalists' code of protecting their sources both misrepresented me and missed the point of what I was saying.  I was merely explaining that the Garda were labouring under the handicap that they had to carry out their inquiries without assistance from RTE.  Later in my reply, however, I called on RTE to disclose what they knew.  But at that stage there could be no possible question of protecting <Col N="1862" /> their sources because by then their sources were already known&mdash; the people concerned had been identified, had been interviewed and had made statements.</P>
    <P>Through a misunderstanding of the terminology used by RTE, I stated here the last day that the producer could not be contacted because, RTE said, he was on holidays.  I was in fact referring at that point to the person who conducted the interviews <i>et cetera</i> on the programme.  A meeting arranged for Wednesday last with another representative of RTE had to be postponed because of the official's illness.  A meeting subsequently took place and RTE were asked if they would supply certain information.  They later sent word that, on certain points, they could not agree to supply the information sought but on other points a further meeting has been arranged.  The points on which information was refused were not important with one exception which I shall mention in a few moments.</P>
    <P>I have already told the House that all or practically all of the people who appeared on the programme had been identified and had repudiated what they had said on the programme and the explanation they offered for their appearance on the programme amounted in all cases to the same thing, namely they were paid for doing it. This of course related primarily to those who claimed to be moneylenders and especially those who said they were involved in a strong-arm racket but, for accuracy, I want to qualify what I said in respect of one person who was shown as a victim of a money-lending racket.  That woman has been identified and has told the gardaí that her reason for appearing was that she had been told that a statement from her would provide a warning to others and she stated for that reason she would have appeared without payment. On the other hand, she also told the gardaí&mdash;what I understand did not appear on the screen&mdash;that her only encounter with a moneylender took place some couple of years back and that the moneylender is now dead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The point has been <Col N="1863" /> made both in this House and by RTE &mdash;and indeed by some commentators outside&mdash;that no significance attaches to the fact that they were paid&mdash;that it is normal practice to pay a programme fee.  The House will observe that RTE, in their public statement, did not say whether the fees paid were in fact the normal amounts, though this was a point I put some stress on here the last day.  Furthermore, RTE have since then rejected as irrelevant a question concerning payments over and above the level of normal programme fees though it was put to them by the gardaí that at least some participants claim to have been paid the sums they asked for before taking part in the programme&mdash;indeed, as it happens, the sums they say they were paid for appearing were double what other participants say they were paid.  The refusal to disclose the actual sums paid may be understandable.  However, the failure to comment on whether exceptional payments were in fact made seems to me&mdash;in view of the statements available that such payments were made&mdash;to be a matter to which I should invite the special attention of the House.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, I did not say that drink was supplied by RTE at Montrose.  It would have been quite understandable if a drink had been supplied to participants at that stage.  What I was referring to was the supply of drink in a public house at an earlier stage when the participants were being recruited. The supply of drink at that earlier stage is certainly worth bearing in mind, especially when it happens that a participant states that, coupled with what he had already drunk, he was &ldquo;well-jarred&rdquo; when he was making his statement to RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us, however, ignore the question of drink and&mdash;despite RTE's refusal to comment on whether payments over and above the normal fees were made &mdash;let us also assume that only standard programme fees were paid.  As far as I am concerned, that makes no difference to the reliability&mdash;or rather the unreliability&mdash;of the evidence though it may be relevant to the apparent readiness of the people in charge <Col N="1864" /> to accept the kind of evidence the programme needed.  I do not expect that the Deputies opposite to advanced the point about programme fees being paid to everybody have had occasion to ponder the implications of accepting evidence in the nature of confessions when payment has been made for them but I must express my surprise that, even at this stage, RTE, according to their public statement, seem not to see what the implications are.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a vital and obvious difference between the appearance on a televised programme of a member of the public who, for instance, is asked to comment on some current problem, and, on the other hand, the appearance of people purporting to be confessing to criminal offences such as we are here referring to.  The vital and obvious difference is that the people on this programme were there solely because they were prepared to make certain statements in the nature of confessions&mdash;statements of a kind that were necessary for the programme. If, when they had been approached, their response had been that they knew nothing about money-lending, it goes without saying that they would not have been on the programme and would not have been able to earn the fee.  Therefore, as far as they were concerned, they were faced with the choice of saying what they said and getting a fee or not saying it and not getting a fee.  A statement made in such circumstances is clearly unreliable.</P>
    <P>I do not, of course, say that payment of a fee is a proof that the statements were false though, as it happens, it is virtually certain that most of the statements were, in fact, false.  What I am saying at this point is that the unreliability of the evidence should have been obvious from the outset and especially since the fee being paid was a substantial one for people who were, in the main, people who could be seen not to be well-off.  The validity of the distinction I am making between fees for services rendered in the ordinary way and fees for a statement that is in the nature of a confession is, of course, well-accepted to the point of being commonplace amongst people who, in any capacity, have the job of sifting <Col N="1865" /> and evaluating evidence.  That statements made in such circumstances would be completely inadmissible in a court of law hardly needs saying and the reason for this is not just the formal rules of evidence but the more fundamental reason, which led to the relevant rule, that the evidence could not be relied on.</P>
    <P>Those who suggest that my object has been to conceal the social problems that lie behind some incidents of borrowing might, I think, do well to ask themselves about the possible social problems that could explain the strange willingness of people who were supposed to be involved in moneylending to appear on this show.  For instance, one witness has stated that he was approached by a named person&mdash;not a member of the staff of RTE&mdash;and asked if he would take part in a programme on moneylending and there would be &ldquo;a few quid&rdquo; in it for him. He agreed.  The gardaí can say, of their own knowledge, that this man is at present unemployed and has a wife and nine children to support.  Irrespective of what in fact was said to him when he was approached, it is clear that he knew he would be paid if he produced a &ldquo;confession&rdquo;.  Can Deputies feel happy about having a man in that position faced with the temptation of knowing that by saying certain things he can collect a much-needed windfall?  Another witness&mdash;a woman &mdash;tells how she was asked, again at two removes from RTE, if she would like to earn £10 and she replied that she certainly would as she was on the point of being evicted for non-payment of rent.  Perhaps, it is not only moneylenders who take advantage of human need.</P>
    <P>There may well have been other tragedies not obvious to the eye of RTE cameras.  For instance, a particular woman was named in the programme as a moneylender.  A young man was shown going to her door, paying 25s of what he owed her and asking if it would be all right to pay the balance later, to which she answered &ldquo;yes, of course&rdquo;.  This is what was picked up by the concealed microphone.  Convincing evidence it might seem&mdash;but, perhaps, not so convincing <Col N="1866" /> when it is pointed out that the woman concerned is known to be a club-holder for a large firm in the city centre, that the man concerned and the woman herself both have stated, independently, that the money was owed on a perfectly legitimate transaction concerning a club-voucher, and that the man states that he had misinformed the RTE representative as to the nature of the debt because he knew he would get money if he represented it as a moneylending transaction.</P>
    <P>At first glance it might appear that this woman has her remedy if she was misrepresented.  I wonder if we in this House can feel happy with that when we learn that she is a widow in her middle seventies with a serious heart condition, with the result that it was at times extremely difficult for her even to continue speaking when the gardaí were interviewing her.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have given, it is clear, beyond question, that the evidence presented in the programme was, as I have said, valueless.  Its utter lack of value is underlined by its repudiation later and by the fact that the Garda Síochána know a fair amount about some of the people involved and they are satisfied, of their own knowledge, that their so-called revelations on the programme were fabrications put forward for the money to be got from it.</P>
    <P>This, as far as I am concerned, is the central issue and because on this, the central issue, there is no doubt as to the facts, I see no sufficient reason at this stage for a sworn inquiry which would serve only to clarify what seems to me to be a marginal issue relating to the extent to which those concerned with the presentation of the programme were at all interested in checking whether the stories that were being given to them were likely to be reliable. As I said at the outset, I have no reason to think, nor do I believe for a moment, that the people concerned would present as fact what they knew to be untrue.</P>
    <P>At the other end of the scale, I am equally certain that they did present as fact what they could not possibly stand over and I feel very strongly that they should have realised that <Col N="1867" /> accepting such stories was, at best, an extremely doubtful exercise and one that called for much more checking than they gave it.  But how far they were culpable in falling short of what the nature of the programme required &mdash;whether, for instance, they did not pause to check because basically they did not want to know&mdash;is not for me to say nor will I speculate about it.  At the same time, I want to make it quite clear that I do not by any means exclude the possibility of a sworn inquiry if the public are being confused by people continuing to try to defend the indefensible.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the question asked about the extent of the illegal money-lending problem in Dublin.  The views of experienced Garda officers in all city areas have been sought and they in turn have made special inquiries that would help them to form an estimate. Their answer is that they neither know of nor suspect the existence of anything in the nature of a moneylending racket backed up by strong-arm tactics of any shape or form.  And they are confident that, if such a thing existed in fact, they would certainly have heard of it even if they could not prove it.</P>
    <P>They, therefore, dismiss as being wholly unfounded, and not just as being unprovable, the suggestion that strong-arm methods are being used to support a moneylending racket.  As regards unlicensed moneylending itself, we are, of course, speaking only of moneylending by people who go in for lending money in order to collect interest on it.  It will be recalled that the TV programme said there were 500 such people in the city and I said the last day that the gardaí were satisfied that this was grossly exaggerated. The Garda estimate&mdash;and I emphasise that this relates to the number of people suspected of probably being in the business and not just people who could be proved to be in it&mdash;is something of the order of 12 or 15.  Giving themselves adequate margin for error they say the figure is undoubtedly below 25.</P>
    <P>To sum up what I have said,</P>
    <P>(1)  The allegation that strong-arm <Col N="1868" /> methods are being used by unlicensed moneylenders is, in the opinion of the Garda Síochána, without any foundation in fact.</P>
    <P>(2)  While the gardaí know that some unlicensed moneylenders operate, their number or scale of operations is nothing like that suggested by the programme.</P>
    <P>(3)  The statements purporting to be confessions by moneylenders about moneylending and strong-arm methods can be dismissed as wholly valueless.</P>

Many people believed that the people who took part in it were genuine people and that the scenes <Col N="1873" /> portrayed in it were factual presentations of this illegal money-lending business.  All this controversy could have been avoided if RTE had said at the outset of this programme that the characters and scenes to be portrayed in it were fictitious; otherwise there is the danger that, in future programmes, no matter how laudable or commendable, no matter how much they are put forward in the public interest, they would cause a cry of &ldquo;wolf, wolf&rdquo;, in other words, that the credibility of any future RTE programme would be brought into question.  We are entitled to be concerned about that, and, when people talk about integrity and reputation, we in this House are entitled to be concerned about the integrity and reputation of the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach and the Minister whether they are aware that in making these allegations that the programme was fictitious and, in the case of the Taoiseach, in saying that it should have been stated that it was fictitious, thereby implying not alone that there was an element of fiction but that RTE were aware of it&mdash;because he could not have suggested that they should have stated it was fictitious if they were not aware of it&mdash;they are contradicting the statement issued by the RTE authority?  Furthermore, in view of the fact that the Minister has accused RTE of the greatest possible dereliction of professional duty when he said they failed by a wide margin to preserve standards of care that they should have preserved in a programme of this kind, is it not clear there must be a sworn inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could I also ask the Minister what <Col N="1874" /> he means by saying that the statements he made are largely not disputed, when the entire statement that the programme was fictional and was put on carelessly and without checking the facts, has been disputed?  It seems to me there is a complete conflict on this issue between a responsible State corporation and the Minister and the Taoiseach, and we must now have a sworn inquiry to establish the truth of the accusations being made by the Minister and the other side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

      <P>The facts are not largely in dispute.  It is beyond dispute from the statements that the Garda have got from these people that there is no such thing as a strong-arm racket as represented by the gentleman who appeared on this programme.  There is certain information we have not got and which no doubt RTE are keeping to themselves for their own good reasons, but my statement that in a programme of this kind they did not exercise the care they should have was made in the context of this programme being presented as a factual programme, which, unfortunately, many people took to be the case.  I stand over that statement, and when they now know the kind of people shown to the public as being genuine have been found to be what they are, they will probably be much more careful in future before they present some fictional work as fact.  I do not know whether this programme was deliberaately designed to be a shock programme with theatrical content or whether it is still going to be held that it was a factual business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This Bill is the annual statutory measure by which the Votes for the various Supply Services are formally appropriated.  As Deputies are aware, it is normally passed through all Stages without Debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like, however, to direct the attention of Deputies to the fact that this year's Bill includes a section dealing with external borrowing.  Deputies will recall that in September last the issue of a loan for 100 million Deutschemarks was successfully negotiated. It seemed to me prudent not to convert this loan into Irish currency immediately, as all indications were that the Deutschemark would be revalued upwards within a short period and I was anxious that the Exchequer should not lose as a result of that revaluation. I arranged, therefore, that the proceeds of the loan would be placed on deposit abroad, until the immediate question of the revaluation was settled.  Events have justified this decision but at the time the Comptroller and Auditor General expressed the <Col N="1880" /> view that I was not entitled to take this action, and that conversion into Irish currency should be effected immediately. This amendment is intended to make it clear that the Minister for Finance may exercise his reasonable judgment as to when, in the interest of the Exchequer, it is appropriate that the proceeds of any external borrowing should be converted into Irish currency and paid into the Exchequer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not customary to enter into a protracted debate on the Appropriation Bill and I certainly do not intend to break that practice. At the same time, I must express agreement with the proposed amendment to section 4 of the Appropriation Act, 1965.  Having read the Act, it appears to me to be necessary in any event.  In other words, I agree with it.  What it did in the events that happened was that while it was not possible to make a gain, it avoided making a loss.  I think Deputies on all sides of the House will approve of this change.  At the same time, it is well to remind the House that the authority to enter into foreign borrowing was first given by this House in 1965.  At that time misgivings, with regard to the practice of entering into borrowing outside the State, were generally expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no harm, when this change in the law is being proposed, to express again the misgivings we must all feel at the necessity which clearly exists for the Minister for Finance to borrow outside the country.  Such borrowings obviously must be done with the greatest degree of care and caution because these borrowings are not like the National Loan which the Minister announced the other day.  National Loans in effect, represent inside the community a borrowing from ourselves and each person who earns an interest on his investment in the National Loan earns an income and is liable to income tax and whatever appropriate payments result from it.  In relation to this Deutschemark loan, the earnings on that loan are earned outside this country and the rate of interest we are paying, which is very high, is earned outside the country.  Obviously, it is not <Col N="1881" /> the kind of borrowing that should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I do not want to widen this debate, and suffice to say that I hope between now and the conclusion of this session of the Dáil an opportunity will present itself for a debate to take place on the economic situation in this country. There are many people at the moment who feel very concerned about where we are going, people who can recall the warnings in the spring of this year given by the Minister for Finance to look at what is obviously happening around us at the moment.  At this stage, when a national loan is on offer, it is perhaps not appropriate to have such a debate and for that reason I do not intend to turn the passage of this Bill into such a debate but I do express the hope that between this and the rising of Dáil Éireann for Christmas a full debate on the economic condition and state of the country will take place.</P>

Nevertheless, the procedure here has always been almost a formality.  Therefore, I do not intend to widen the debate today but let me repeat what Deputy O'Higgins has said: can we have a debate as soon as it can be said that we are not rocking the boat&mdash; because I know that is what we would be accused of now&mdash;can we have a debate on the economic situation here because, in view of the various statements made, it would appear that it would be a very good idea?</P>

      <P>Having mentioned that, may I say that the Minister, of course, was right in his decision about the Deutschemark?  While, maybe there was no danger of getting his fingers burned this time, it is not a very wise thing to do to take a chance with foreign currency and I wonder what would be the reception by this House if, in fact, something had gone wrong and devaluation had taken place instead of the other and the Minister had had to <Col N="1882" /> explain why we had borrowed money which we had lost.</P>
      <P>The other thing I should like to mention is this&mdash;again it will come up, I am quite sure before Christmas on the economic debate&mdash;the Minister must be seriously perturbed at the rates of interest, not so much being paid by the State, although that is an important matter, but, apart from that, the rate of interest which is being charged for money for capital purposes in this country.  Can he or can the Government see any way in which this matter can be dealt with because, if they cannot, we will soon reach the stage where everybody will be, not an unlicensed money-lender, but a licensed moneylender; we will reach the stage where it will be usury&mdash;there is no other word where somebody will borrow £100 on a payment of £100 interest.  It seems that we are heading in that direction.  I hope the Minister may have some answers later in the year when we will be asking him very pertinent questions about this.</P>

Ministers are constantly concerned about wages and this and that.  Look at their own expenditure.  Compare £119,300,000 with £363½ million for the supply services.  I make the point, and do not want to make any comment on it, that the Government are outdistancing by a vast distance any possible fall in the value of money in their own expenditure.  I would have no objection to it and no member of the Labour Party, certainly, would have any objection to it were it not for the fact that a great deal of it is so wasteful.</P>

      <P>On this Bill, I might make a short statement.  There was one amendment suggested both from the Fine Gael speaker and from the Labour Party speaker on the last occasion.  I pointed out then to the House that I introduced this Bill solely for the purpose of restoring the law to what it was before the Supreme Court decision that made it illegal to operate these machines at all.  Everybody thought that by the machines paying out at the back they <Col N="1884" /> were legal for the last 13 or 14 years and this decision upset all that.</P>
      <P>In introducing this Bill to amend the law I emphasised to the House that it was solely for the purpose of restoring the position to what it was before this High Court decision.  I also told the House that this device of having machines paying out at the back was put there by a previous Minister for Justice, for whose opinion I have great respect, because he was convinced that the fact of the machines not paying out directly in the front but paying out in the back slowed down the process of gaming and therefore was some form of protection to the compulsive gambler who might be addicted to this form of business.  I must say that in my own mind I am not too sure of the logic of that particular argument and the view has been expressed that amending the Bill in the manner suggested would have the effect of doing away with this rule that these machines would have to pay out at the back.  Other amendments have been suggested, one by a well-known solicitor who acts for a number of these amusement catering associations, but none appeals to me from a legal point of view because they would not do an effective legal job.  If the House decides that it is desirable to have these machines pay out in front and, at the same time, to cater for machines which cannot be adapted for that purpose, the cleanest legal job would be to repeal section 10.</P>
      <P>I did not have much time in which to consider this matter.  I should like to make further inquiries.  I should like to have the reaction of the Garda to this amendment.  There are many people who do not want to have these amusement arcades at all; they are against them in principle.  We are not dealing with them at the moment, but that will be another day's work when we come to discuss a major gaming measure.</P>
      <P>It has been represented to me that young people employed in these arcades are open to the temptation to &ldquo;fiddle&rdquo;.  Whatever we do in this particular Bill, the same limits will apply &mdash;a maximum of 6d and a maximum prize of 10/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1885" /> I put it to the House that we leave over the Report Stage until after Christmas.  I should like to have time in which to get Garda reaction throughout the country.  If I decide to leave the Bill unamended I will give the House an opportunity on the Report Stage of putting down amendments or of recommitting the Bill.  I need time to consider the effect of the suggested amendments.  As I say, the cleaner legal job would be to repeal section 10.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 31 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The wish to improve our health services is not the prerogative of any one party.  Neither should it be. The health of our people is a matter which transcends, or should transcend, partisan loyalties.  There is, or there should be, general agreement that health services must be drastically improved so that the sick, the disabled, the infirm and the aged may receive better health services.  This is the humanitarian and inescapable obligation of any society which dares to consider itself progressive or which dares to claim, or to believe, that it is <Col N="1886" /> Christian.  Indeed, the genuineness of any society must be measured by the readiness of that society to pay the cost of providing the very best medical skill and attention, drugs, medicines and equipment to all who need them, without regard to their ability to pay at the time of need.</P>
      <P>We, therefore, in Fine Gael, are unable to accept section 31 which gives no relief whatsoever to the large numbers in our community who are at present obliged to pay for health services, health services from which they can draw no benefit whatsoever because the test applied in assessing whether they should pay is the very same test which excludes them from benefit. The test applied is whether a person is a rated occupier and, if the person is a rated occupier, then the State lays it down that that person must pay towards the cost of health services.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Government are proposing to provide that the only statutory obligation on the State to pay for health charges will be to defray one half of that part of the expenditure of a health authority which the Minister considers he should pay and that half of the expenditure of the health authorities today is only 46 per cent of the total cost of health boards. By excluding eight per cent of the cost of health authorities the Government attempt to create the impression that they are paying as much as 56 per cent of the cost of health authorities but that is not so because what they are doing is selecting items they are deeming to be appropriate for State subsidy and if the services performed by the health authorities with their intimate knowledge of the needs of an area are outside the categories acceptable to the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance for the time being, they receive no assistance from the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, we reject entirely the suggestion, after a decade or more of general agreement in this country, with the exception of Fianna Fáil, that rates are not a proper system of financing the health services, that Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann should be asked to approve once again the iniquitous <Col N="1887" /> proposal that the law should remain as it stand.</P>
    <P>Under this Health Bill the State is not proposing to accept responsibility for one penny extra of the cost of the health services.  The only comment that we can make is that perhaps they are more honest now than they were in 1966.  The 1966 White Paper said that Fianna Fáil had accepted that rates were not a proper system of financing the health services.  Having accepted that in a White Paper published at the expense of the taxpayer, they now come in here, having been re-elected to power on the basis of a specific undertaking to relieve the ratepayer, and again put the cost of half of the health service on the rates.</P>
    <P>The nub of objections to the health service with its inadequacies and inefficiencies stems from the injustice of imposing half of the burden on a large number of people who are not in a position to derive any benefit from the service.  Only one income earner in every seven is paying rates which means that only one in seven contributes to half the cost of the health service.  While I am certain that of the number of people at present required to pay rates there are many who should be contributing as much and more towards the provision of health services for the less fortunate, so also I am sure, as the Government's White Paper accepts, and as the various committee inquiries into the rating system have suggested, there are many people at present paying rates on an average of £2 per £ of valuation per year for health services and because they are required to pay these rates, which we know they are required to do without any regard to their ability to pay, they fall into ill-health from undernourishment and inadequate heating and clothing.  The Government's inadequate measures to try to provide some relief at the expense of other ratepayers will not clear up many pools of hidden poverty which exist in our community because people are required to pay for health services in relation to the rateable valuation of the property which they occupy.</P>
    <P>We find it intolerable that this Health <Col N="1888" /> Bill should continue to operate the present system of limiting the State's statutory liability to only half the cost of the health services at a time when, in the Bill, the Government are seeking to get more and more power for the central authority.  If the Minister were coming before the House with a specific proposal to give a certain increase in reliefs in the cost of providing health services by providing help from central funds, the State might be justified in getting the additional control they are seeking so that the person who pays the piper could call the tune.  What is proposed is that the person who pays the piper will not be allowed to call the tune and such opportunity as people have at the moment is being taken away because under subsection (3) or section 31 we find that the future bill is to be determined not by the health board and not by the local health committees but by the Minister for Local Government who will determine what the expenditure should be. The position in the future will be that the rates will be struck not by any health authority, not by any health board and not by any local authority but by the Minister for Local Government who will determine the bill and notwithstanding that position the Government will strike the total cost of the health services and say that half of it must be paid for by somebody other than the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>The effect of this section is to continue an inhuman and inapplicable system under which people with an income of more than £1,200 a year are regarded as being persons in the middle income group who must, because of that, pay for at least portion of their hospitalisation and must pay for all the medical attention required for themselves and their families.  It is clear from figures that I received in reply to a Dáil Question within the past month that if the figure of £1,200 was applicable three years ago it should now be £1,600 for the insurable limit because one-third of the people who were within the limit of £1,200 three years ago are now known to be outside the limit and the State has done nothing to bring these people within the insurable category.</P>
    <P>Surely this is a time when this sort <Col N="1889" /> of thing should be put right, a time when we are determining the percentage responsibility of the ratepayer and the whole community to pay for the health services.  At a time of putting through legislation of this kind we should rectify what is known to be wrong.  At present we operate 14 different forms of public health service and in these 14 different forms we have 14 different means tests requiring, in most cases, that applicants for the individual services must submit themselves to a new assessment of means.  New norms must be applied and new inhuman investigations must be carried out.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the most comprehensive and I think the most objectionable section in the whole Bill.  It retains what we should be anxious to get rid of&mdash;means tests of all kinds, which are inappropriate at a time when people are seeking medical aid.  That is not the time to be applying tests as to whether they should be paying for it then.  Our community should be as capable as any other community in Europe&mdash;has proved itself capable&mdash; of having a health service without a means test.  That can only be organised if the State accepts the responsibility for payment of all health costs.  The expenditure of the State is expenditure of money collected by the State from all the people according to their means. Tax should always be paid according to means.  Services should not be with-held because of means or presumed means.  Any modern, progressive society will always tax people according to means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill proposes that half of the cost of the health services will be imposed on people without regard to their means.  Because they are required to pay that cost, they will in many cases automatically be excluded from benefit. That is wrong.  That is contrary to <Col N="1890" /> every tenet of what I thought Christians would regard as natural justice.  At the same time as the State is proposing to continue this injustice, the State is saying that not only will the people be unfairly taxed, without regard to their capacity to pay, but they will not in future have the close personal local representation they hitherto enjoyed in relation to the health services because the new tax on a local level on rates will be fixed not by the local authority, not by the local public representatives who are living in the community, but it will be imposed by the Minister for Local Government sitting in Dublin in the Custom House, far removed from the local problems to which he presumes to attend.</P>
    <P>If the Fianna Fáil Government had honoured the promise which was made in the White Paper in 1966, which was re-echoed in this House by successive Ministers for Health since then, and, which I heard re-echoed by several Fianna Fáil members of the Dublin Corporation and Dublin Health Authority, to keep the rates at the figure at which they were in the year 1965-66, rates in every county and city in Ireland would be from £1 to 26s less than they are at present or than they will be in the coming year.  The only redeeming feature of the proposal in this Bill is that apparently it is more honest than the long series of broken promises made by Fianna Fáil Ministers and various members of the Fianna Fáil Government and their supporters over the past three years.  However, it does make us very concerned that any Minister in an Irish Government or that any Irish Government should publish a White Paper with solemn promises, and that their agents should continue to repeat those solemn promises, and not honour them.  How can people have any respect for Government, how can people have any regard for the assurances of public men when Governments publish White Papers with promises which they do not honour?</P>
    <P>Government Ministers repeatedly make promises which they do not honour.  The finances of local authorities can become wellnigh impossible because local authorities, very properly, <Col N="1891" /> proceed on the basis that the promises will be honoured and then they find that they are broken.  I remember well the terrible embarrassment suffered by Deputy P.J. Burke in the Dublin Health Authority when he found that the clear promises which had been made to the Irish nation in the White Paper were not being honoured: nobody was more distressed than Deputy P.J. Burke.  Furthermore, when we went on a deputation to the Minister asking him to fulfil his promises, nobody was more anxious that the Minister should fulfil them than Deputy P.J. Burke.  But, despite all the efforts we made over the past few years to get the Government to honour the promise in the White Paper&mdash;and, in case there was any doubt about what was meant in the White Paper, it was repeated several times after that&mdash;it was never fulfilled.  We have now reached the utterly degrading and contemptible position in which a Government which issues a White Paper in which it promises to do one thing produces, three years later, a Bill to do something entirely different.  How can people have any faith in a Government, how can people have any faith in the administration of a country, which publishes White Papers promising one thing and then brings in a Bill and accepts responsibility for a great deal less?</P>
    <P>I am aware that, under subsection (2) (b), the Minister may make some supplementary grants&mdash;but it is purely permissive.  It is entirely at the discretion of the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  But that is simply not good enough.  When clear promises are made in White Papers, when they are made in this House, when they are made in Seanad Éireann, when they are made in local authority meeting places throughout the country, to undertake responsibility for a greater share of health costs, it is not good enough to bring in a Bill saying that the Minister may make an increased contribution.  If the Minister claims, as I suspect he may claim, that the State is paying 56 per cent of health costs, why does he not ensure that the <Col N="1892" /> State will never pay anything less by providing, in subsection (2) (a), that the State will make grants of not less than 56 per cent of the total cost of the health board?  The only reason we can assume he has not done it is because he wants to leave himself the scope to cut the contribution being made by the State to health expenditure, to reduce it by this six per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Lenihan will allow his indignation to subside for a moment and will turn on his receptive capacities, he will find that I am explaining to him that if the Minister wanted to hold the present contribution by the State at its present level, then he should accept in the Bill a statutory obligation to contribute what the State is now contributing but what he has done is to provide that his obligation is to contribute less than what the State is now contributing.  Therefore, it is fair to assume, in fact we must assume, that he wants to have scope to reduce the contribution made by the State to health services.  We consider that is a retrograde step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is prepared to give an assurance that there will be no reduction, then we believe that he should crystallise that assurance by writing it into the Bill.  If he is not prepared to write it into the Bill I am sure he will forgive me when I say that, much as I respect him as a gentleman and as a worthy parliamentarian, I am, in view of the conduct of his predecessors in committing such serious <Col N="1893" /> breaches of solemn undertakings, unable to accept any assurance which he or his party might give that they will not reduce the contributions made by the State to the health services.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the whole purpose of section 31 is to allow the axe to fall to cut the contribution by the State which at the moment is anything from 20s to 25s in the £ less than it ought to be on the basis of promises of three years ago.  That is not enough; they want to make it even worse and reduce it by a further six per cent so that the unfortunate ratepayers may well find themselves next year or the year after paying, in respect of health services from which they are to be excluded, as much as £3 in the £.</P>

We in the regional health authority in Dublin have been working very well over the past nine years and we have only built up that understanding regarding a person leaving hospital.  I wonder could the Minister bring that into this section here and not give it to another authority because I feel that would be doing the individual a great injustice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I used to embarrass one of the Minister's predecessors, Mr. <Col N="1894" /> MacEntee, by reminding him of the magnificent piece of health legislation introduced by him as Fianna Fáil Minister for Health in 1947.</P>
      <P>One of the grand provisions of that piece of legislation was the one in which we in the central authority paid the total cost of the expansion of the health services agreed upon by the local authority at the time.  Of course, it was an invaluable provision because it gave the local authorities during those three years the wonderful feeling that they could expand their health services and that we in the central authority would foot the bill.  Whether or not one is worried about a provision of that kind from the point of view of the Exchequer there is no doubt that from the functional point of view it was excellent because it meant that we got a very remarkable improvement in our health services during that period primarily because of the provision in the 1947 Health Act that we would pay all additional expenditure over a certain datum year.  They were the great old days of the Fianna Fáil Party when they were seriously concerned with the health services and with the health of the general community and did not worry, as some Deputies seem to worry today, about who would pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am trying to deal with Deputy Ryan's suggestion that the services should be paid from central taxation to a greater degree than they are at present.  Of course, the general community should pay for the services. They should pay in the form of taxation but in the form of direct taxation and not as at present in the many forms of indirect taxation of which rates is only one.  For that reason I believe that this is a very important section because it is the one which will determine the rate at which our health services will expand.  I believe that the retention of the rate content of financing the health services will be a very powerful inhibitory factor.  It does not matter whether it will be 20, 30 or 50 per cent.  Lest the Minister should raise it with me I know that one of the provisions of the 1947 Health Act was a later reversion to 50-50 in the expenditure but certainly when they <Col N="1895" /> wanted a serious expansion of the health services the Fianna Fáil Party did introduce that provision and got the results.  Even though I was the person who reaped the harvest they sowed the seed.  I did not reap the harvest, the community reaped the harvest, by improved health services. For that reason this is a retrograde provision and it will mean that the health services will not expand at the rate at which the Minister would probably like to see them expanding.</P>
    <P>There is a great difference between the taxation that we used to have under Fianna Fáil in its radical days in the early 30s and taxation now.  The party's general attitude was: &ldquo;Let the rich pay for the poor&rdquo; and they did not mind making the very wealthy pay for the poor, for the aged, for the sick. Now there has been a very perceptible, considered and conscious reversal of that policy towards a policy in which moneys for health or social services are now being taken from the less wealthy and from the poor in order to ease the burden on the very wealthy.  That, of course, has been the great departure from the radical outlook which the party had in their early days.  Of course, it suits the present Minister for Health who is an extremely doctrinaire conservative politician.</P>
    <P>Deputy P.J. Lenihan is probably right in saying that there is a section on which we can deal with the essentially humiliating provisions of this Bill involved in the eligibility clauses, the many means tests which are included under that section.  However, in regard to this section there is all the difference in the world between taxes on a very wealthy person&mdash;surtax, supertax, excess profits tax, corporation profits tax&mdash;and taxes like purchase tax, sales tax, ordinary pay-as-you-earn tax which bears very heavily on the ordinary earner.  I am not concerned particularly about him.  I am sure he is prepared to accept the need to pay something for his services in accordance with his income but the many indirect taxes, particularly purchase tax, are grossly unfair because they lead to the old age pensioner paying as much in indirect taxation as the <Col N="1896" /> wealthy person.  He eats the same amount of bread, butter, if he can afford it, tea, sugar, pays the same rents and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling but Deputy Ryan went into the general problem of fund raising for health services. I was simply following him, but I presume I can take the matter up on another occasion.  It seems to me in relation to the payment to health authorities the amount of money available to a health authority or to the Minister is dependent on how he raises that money.  He can raise it in one of many ways.  My case is that the Government are raising it in a grossly unfair way. Even if one takes the amount of money which would be needed by the different health authorities in the form of rates in order to subsidise whatever they would get from the Minister, it is quite clear that most local authorities have found that the need for funds raised from the rates has become completely out of proportion to that which most local health authorities can afford.  For that reason it seems to me that this is a very bad provision in the Health Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Ryan pointed out, we were given many undertakings by successive Ministers for Health that the whole question of the funding of the health authorities would be considered very carefully by the Government and that a much greater proportion would be given from the Central Fund.  In fact, most elections it seems to me have been fought on the assumption that the whole payment for health services would be taken away from the rates altogether and that the total sums needed for the funding of health services by local authorities would be met from the Central Fund by the Minister. I agree with many things which Deputy Ryan said and I would ask the Minister to reconsider this section and the implications of the unpredictable <Col N="1897" /> varying contributions which he says will be made available from the central authority to the various health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 31 is the main financing section of the health services and is a very important section. I want to refer to the previous Minister's Second Reading speech.  It is well worth reading because it shows the intention of the Government.  In 1947 there was as Deputy Dr. Browne said a very great improvement in the health services.  That was because so many had so much leeway to make up.  In 1966 in the late Deputy O'Malley's White Paper the freeze was promised for one year.  Again, the Government's story was they agreed in principle the rates were not the best method of financing the health services but they had not come up with any other solution so the amount was frozen for one year.  During the Second Reading of the Health Bill the previous Minister said:</P>
      <P>The effect of these provisions, of course, is that there will be no such thing as a statutory &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; on the amount of the local contributions, but I should point out that the section is framed so that, should the Government of the day decide in future that such a freeze was desirable, it could be provided for.  I would personally not think it appropriate that future Governments should be firmly committed by the Bill in any way in this respect.  The decision on this is something which has to be taken from time to time in the light of the general financial circumstances&mdash;central and local. Accordingly, section 31 in its present form seems to me to be more appropriate than one setting out a more rigid financial basis for the services.</P>

      <P>Thank you very <Col N="1898" /> much.  I will take note of your kindly intervention.  In any event, that puts section 31 in its proper light.  The Government have never committed themselves to a freeze.  They preferred that this should be less rigid.  They are committed to the fact that the rates are not the best method of financing the health services.  The supplementary grant is so framed that that could reach 75 per cent, which is what Deputy Ryan wants to write in.  It may come to that and I am sure the Minister in his reply on this section will indicate that the contributions the State make are much higher than 50 per cent.</P>

      <P>As the House knows it is desperately important that this Bill should be passed by the Dáil before Christmas even in respect of those sections which are agreed to by the whole of the House even if some people may object to certain sections of the Bill because we cannot split the accountancy as between regional boards and county health authorities within a financial year.  It would create chaos and would make it very difficult to apportion the cost of the health services. I do not want to perpetuate a debate of the kind which took place at very great length not so many months ago when there was a special resolution in which the Opposition admitted they very ably presented their case for a change in the method of providing finance for the health services.  My predecessor answered them even more ably so I do not want to perpetuate an argument which has already taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 31, as Deputy Lenihan said, is flexible.  It enables the Government to provide supplementary grants and, if necessary, to go beyond the present 55 per cent odd of the cost of health services paid for by Exchequer grants. There is nothing to prevent the Government doing that.  This Bill only comes into operation on April 1st, 1971.  This House will have the opportunity of discussing the Health Estimate for 1970-71 and repeating their views on this matter.  They will have the opportunity of discussing the Health Estimate when the regional boards are formed so there will be ample opportunity <Col N="1899" /> between now and then to discuss this question of whether or not the proportion of money raised by rates or taxation should be changed and how it should be changed.</P>
    <P>I have also indicated to the House that we are examining the possibility of providing some of the cost of the hospital services and the health services to the middle income group by way of contributions.  We have found great difficulty in the administration of such a scheme.  One of the difficulties relates to an obvious problem which was referred to even in connection with the Fine Gael policy for health in which they pointed out that certain classes of persons would not be asked for contributions and others would be asked for contributions.  The division of the community into those who are asked to pay contributions and those who would continue to get the services on the present basis is very difficult to determine.  The collection agencies are difficult to determine. It is an immensely complex matter.  I am perfectly certain that if there was any Government but my own in office they would find this was difficult under our circumstances.  Under our circumstances it is the attitude of people towards taxation and the conditions which have been created in relation to taxation.  We are still examining the possibility of a contributory scheme.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat again that the salaries, wages and costs of material have doubled since 1958 and up to 1968 the actual volume of the services has doubled after eliminating all inflationary influences.  The actual cost of the health services has roughly trebled.  In the interval of ten years the volume of production of the country has gone up by 50 per cent so we have gone away beyond the rule of trying to relate in a general way whatever we can do socially with the increase in the volume of production.  We have done so quite rightly.  All parties in the House have, in fact, agreed to that procedure.  Therefore, there is no doubt the health services have improved, but we want further improvement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1900" /> Next, Deputy Browne referred to the State bearing 100 per cent of the increase in the cost of health services after 1947.  From a purely sentimental point of view, I wish we were back in these halcyon days.  The basis was that the State would have borne the additional cost of the services until it was 50 per cent of the total, the State contribution in 1947 being only 16 per cent of the total cost of the health services.  Therefore, what Deputy Browne said was only part of the truth.  Since then we have made a very clear statement, in paragraph 116 of the White Paper which states:</P>
    <P>They proposed therefore that the cost of further extension of the health services should not be met in any proportion by the local rates.</P>
    <P>That is a pledge that has been honoured since the White Paper was published and one which will be honoured in the future.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, a number of proposals await the passing of this Bill for their implementation.  Among them is the choice of doctor which has been approved by everybody and it will cost us money.  There are the arrangements for the improvement of the drug services and services for the middle-income group in respect of inpatient facilities, child health services. There are other proposals of the same kind all of which will help to improve the health services.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill to prevent the Minister for Local Government, under an entirely separate measure, from altering the rate structure if he chooses to do so with the consent of the House.  A committee have been set up to consider the whole rating system and there is a Bill which makes it possible for local authorities to raise amounts over and above the total cost of their services in order to effect rate remissions for those who are hard pressed thereby, and also arrangements to pay rates by instalments.  This Bill does not have to be amended if the Minister for Local Government should amend the rating system in any way through equalisation of rate levies throughout the country, but he has not even decided that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1901" /> There is nothing in this Bill which prevents an alteration in the rating system or prevents the Minister for Health from adding further percentages to the total cost of the health services if he so chooses.  The Minister for Health is pledged to provide a full course of extensions to the services.  I do not think I should get into an argument with Deputy Browne about different forms of taxation.  It might however, be in order to say that there are countries with left-wing Governments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy referred to the difference between sales tax and income tax and I imagine the Ceann Comhairle will give me the right to reply to these matters.  Socialist administrations disagree about this, although indirect taxation plays a very large part in their tax structures, the indirect taxes being linked with social welfare payments so as to ensure that a tax based on spending will not affect adversely those with large families or those otherwise in necessitous circumstances. I have gone into it as much as I can at the present time.  There will be opportunities for discussing the relative courses of rates on at least two occasions before this Bill finally comes into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it were possible to establish a contributory scheme under this Bill it would be so complex, linked as it would be inevitably with a number of Departments, that there would have to be a separate Bill in any event.  I could not possibly have included a contributory scheme in this Bill.  If the Government ever adopt a conciliatory scheme for the middle income group, there will have to be a separate Bill <Col N="1902" /> because such a scheme would have so many complications.</P>

      <P>I think the section would be better with that amendment and I urge the Minister to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I began by mentioning the question of the Minister looking into the Fine Gael policy on health services and I want to say now that the Government have had before them the report of one of the inter-departmental committees on rates in which it is stated <Col N="1905" /> that rating was an outmoded method of taxation 100 years ago.  Yet, here we are with this modern go-ahead Government still retaining this outmoded method of taxation.  I am sure the Minister has been reminded of his predecessor who went before Seanad Éireann in 1965 and said he, as Minister for Health, would hold the health rate at the 1965-66 level.  That promise has never been fulfilled by the Government and at present the Government contribution to the Dublin Health Authority is only 46 per cent.  The Government should at least increase their contribution to the health estimate by up to 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>We have read in the newspapers that in the present estimate which would come into force in the coming financial year there is an increase of 4s 1d for health alone on the Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation.  I understand that figure is not quite correct and that it will be 3s 10.6d.  That represents another large increase to be met by the ratepayers of County Dublin for health alone.  Both authorities will also have to meet a considerable increase in employees' remuneration granted during the year.</P>
    <P>From time to time we have noted that the Minister for Health, as soon as he has seen the estimate of the Dublin Health Authority, proceeds to grant an increase to the private hospitals or does something of that kind where we have no control.  That completely nullifies the estimate of the health authority.  Therefore, I urge the Minister that any increase he proposes to give to voluntary hospitals, or in respect of other matters over which he has control, should be given beforehand so that they can be included in the health estimate so that the estimate, as considered and paid for by the local authority, would be a proper one and so that we would not, year after year, have to meet some such increase for two years at one time.  The Ministers should consider that very carefully.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1906" /> I wish to comment on one or two aspects of this section&mdash;one in particular. In this regard I share the concern which Deputy Ryan and other speakers have for our ratepayers.  I visualise a situation where a person in the middle income group is purchasing his house.  Up to this he has not been a liability on the local authority as regards housing.  He now finds himself in an area like Ballymun, Finglas or Churchtown, paying for his house on a valuation of, say, £25.  I visualise a man with a wife and four children.  On a valuation of £25 at the moment he pays approximately £37 to a health fund. The extraordinary thing is that in quite a number of cases neither he nor his wife may benefit from that fund. Having paid that money which would give full coverage to himself, his wife and children in voluntary health insurance, he is not entitled to an aspro from the health authority.  He sees people who are not making the contribution he is making benefiting from his sacrifice and his labours.  Obviously, in those circumstances one could not condone the financing of such a health fund.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Dr. Browne will help me to understand the nature of his concern for that man.  He suggests that the finances to finance existing services should now come from the central authority, the Central Fund.  He suggests that the system should not be of robbing Peter to pay Paul.  He is overlooking the fact that in suggesting that certain finances should not come from the rates he is automatically releasing the wealthy people about whom he would speak, the commercial concerns, the big farmers and the wealthy ratepayers from making a contribution from which other people might benefit.</P>
    <P>I was a member of a rates committee which sat in the Dublin Corporation. On that committee we had representatives from the Deputy's Party.  When we suggested that money should not come so much from the rates but from some other source, when we suggested that people who use the amenities of the city might be asked to pay for them, when we suggested that young people who seem to have a little extra money at the moment might be asked <Col N="1907" /> to pay, when we suggested an amenity tax, when we suggested that it would be better to ask people who are spending money to contribute something in taxation rather than asking people who by virtue of the fact of their having a piece of property were being asked to pay, the representatives of the Deputy's party objected.  They said they did not want any additional taxation.</P>
    <P>The vice-chairman of the Deputy's party is on the Dublin Corporation.  I know that the party are an entire bloc with complete unanimity of thought and I hope that the Deputy will indicate to me how he wants to maintain the present services.  He does not want the big ratepayer who is contributing at the moment to continue contributing and his party do not want any additional taxation.  The only conclusion we can come to is that they are not in earnest in what they say, or else they want a reduction in the service&mdash;a service which could be provided for less money.</P>
    <P>As regards these moneys being collected elsewhere, Deputy Ryan and his party joined with us in appreciating the situation where an injustice is being done to the middle income ratepayer. The Minister for Local Government has introduced a Bill which is a first step towards removing from the rate-paying group those who may not be capable of paying.  Already recipients of social welfare benefit and old age pensioners are being considered in this category.  I hope that the middle income man about whom I speak will be included in that category and that we will continue to have the service we have, paid for by those who can afford to pay, assisted by the contributions which we are getting at the moment from industry and from well-to-do ratepayers and that we will be able to exclude from it those people in the category for whom Deputy Ryan and I are concerned but who apparently are not included in the concern of the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to comment on the extraordinary and breathtaking arrogance of the Minister in coming in to us here and telling us in Parliamentary jargon to get on with this Bill and give it to him.  This is a Minister in a party which have been in office intermittently since 1951, and he comes in here now and tells us to get on with this piece of legislation and that he wants it as a Christmas present. He will have to wait for his Christmas present until we decide to give it to him.  He has had the opportunity of getting on with this legislation but, instead of doing so, his party went to the country and had their absurd referendum. There was this business of producing a White Paper in 1966, and then they could wait until 1969 to get on with this piece of legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Ryan's contributory scheme as a matter of principle because, as I said earlier, I believe the finance for the health service should come from direct taxation, from central funds.  I am not sufficiently doctrinaire not to accept that a totally contributory scheme would be a great improvement on the proposition put forward here.  I would accept it as an interim proposal towards the creation of a proper health <Col N="1909" /> service funded entirely from general taxation.</P>
      <P>The Minister is extremely well-read. In fact, that is one of his problems. He works so hard at examining both sides of a problem that he very rarely comes to the third side of any problem and that is the conclusion to do something about it.  He knows as well as I do that there is nothing original or greatly radical in the proposition put forward by Deputy Ryan that some form of a contributory scheme should be introduced covering all or any sectors of the community.  In fact, the Fine Gael Party did something of that kind in relation to their voluntary health insurance scheme.  There is that type of contributory principle involved in that scheme.  It is absurd for the Minister to say that a Government Department could not devise a scheme of that kind if he seriously wanted to help the people in the middle income group.</P>
      <P>On the question of taxation and rates, Deputy Tunney asks me to reconcile my suggestion that the ratepayer has found it very difficult to go on paying the rates which are attributed to the health services in any local authority with a suggestion for the improvement of these services.  This general catch-cry that has gone up. about the burden of rates due to the increase in our health services has been a pretty deliberate campaign by people who try to discredit the idea that we should try to improve our health services.  If anybody looks for such an improvement he is told it will mean more money on the rates, and there must be a limitation on the spending of the local health authority in order to calm the feelings of the general ratepayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the fact that there is a great feeling, created deliberately, accidentally or in any way you like, among ratepayers that a great proportion of their payments go out in health services.  That is one of the reasons why I believe that the rating system for the funding of health services is a bad one.  There is also the obvious factor that there are poor counties like Leitrim, Mayo and some parts of Donegal&mdash;some Deputies may <Col N="1910" /> have seen the BBC television programme last night on the present state of the west of Ireland; whether you believe it was prejudiced or not, there appeared to be a fair amount of fact in it in regard to the decay there&mdash; and to ask these counties to pay rates at the same level as the wealthier counties like Cork, Limerick or Dublin is unreasonable, and the only people who get hurt in that type of situation are the people in those counties, and they should not be penalised. It is bad enough to have to live in a poor county like Leitrim or to be a small farmer trying to earn a living in Connemara or wherever it may be, without having to suffer because the health authority cannot raise sufficient funds for health services.</P>
    <P>As to the question of general taxation, Deputy Tunny asked me whether I thought the wealthy ratepayers ought to be relieved.  I think funding through rates is a bad system.  I do not think there is any reason why the wealthy industrialist, the wealthy shopkeeper, the wealthy businessman, the wealthy individual, self-employed, or wealthy unemployed drawing dividends, should get such relief.  We are not blazing a new trail in taking money from the wealthy and giving it to the poor.  That was started a very long time ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a system at the moment which allows us to do that via the rates.  To get that money, and if we want to retain that money we must set up another system whereby we shall get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that point.  I am saying that we should set up another system and the system we have at the present time distributes the burden of rates unevenly.  The people mentioned by Deputy Tunney, after the first five years rates remission, will have to pay rates.  These people frequently have to pay rates at a level at which they cannot afford to pay.  I believe the really retrograde departure from the early redicalism of the Fianna Fáil Government has been the shifting across of fund raising from the wealthy through the direct tax device, that is, from each according to his means, to each according to <Col N="1911" /> his needs, by these different devices such as purchase tax, sales tax, national health insurance contributions, voluntary health contributions: all these social service contributions, indeed even the scheme suggested by Deputy Ryan is simply a device to save us getting at firms like Guinness, Jacobs, Rowntrees or other people like that who have a lot of money and who could easily pay a lot more money than they are paying in order to ease the burden on the old age pensioner, the man with the big family, the widow or the disabled person, who are paying relatively high taxes because they are taxed on the commodities they must buy if they are to live.</P>
      <P>There would be no problem at all if one were to change the taxation system so that there would be the type of taxation which is used in other countries, mostly socialist countries, but not necessarily socialist countries.  The Minister's generalisation about socialist administrations was, consciously or otherwise, a dishonest one because, as he knows, there are many variations in this type of administration, and to lump them all together and to say they are good, bad or indifferent is an attempt to score a cheap debating point.  For instance, Sweden in which there is a predominantly capitalist set up has been and is ruled by socialist governments.</P>

After the best part of 20 years of Fianna Fáil Government is it not a wonderful tribute to their socialist and economic policies that we want to go back to 1947 in order to be able to <Col N="1912" /> afford better health services?  Is it not a wonderful tribute to them that we have here a piece of legislation containing provisions which are those first introduced by Lloyd George in 1913, or something like that, in the British House of Commons?</P>
      <P>We are up against this very important question&mdash;and I do not know whether the Minister would care to enlighten us on it&mdash;of giving a choice of doctor and how the doctor is to be paid for the service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 31 is one of the most important sections in the Bill because it deals with the financing of it. We all know that everything has to be paid for and our concern here should be to find equitable means of paying for this service.  The Minister has recently visited county councillors and I wonder if he got their opinions on it. The whole problem of rates as a tax is being questioned; all sides agree that it is a wrong system of taxation.</P>
      <P>The problem of rates as a tax has arisen in the last few years because of the very large increases put on to the rates year by year.  Previous to that, when the rates went up by 4d, 5d and 6d, local councillors tried their best to cut a halfpenny or a penny off just for the sake of doing it, but now we have increases of 5s, 6s, 7s and 8s and these increases are so severe that people do not even bother to see if they can economise.  These large increases have been brought about because the health charges are paid out of local rates.  The proper expansion of the health service is going to be inhibited by this charge which is put on the rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1913" /> Deputy Ryan mentioned earlier that one-seventh of the people have to bear the rates charge.  We are not getting support from the people who have the real spending power today and because of this I think we should get 75 per cent of the health charge from the Exchequer.  The people with property and fixed incomes who had a large income ten, 15 or 20 years ago are now holding on to their property by a hair's breadth and yet they have to pay rates on their properties while six-sevenths of the population make no contribution to the rates at all.  We should get the payment for the health services by taxing the big companies and large business concerns instead of hitting the property owners.</P>
    <P>I agree that some financing of the health service should come from the rates because if local authorities get a free hand and get all their finance from the central authority there is no doubt that they will run riot with the health charges.  A 25 per cent charge on the local authority would be a very fair charge.  I would ask the Minister to adopt Deputy Ryan's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

      <P>Subsection (2) (b) states that:</P>
      <P>supplementary grants, as determined by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, towards the reduction of the amount of expenditure to be met by contributions under subsection (3).</P>
      <P>I fail to see what the bruhaha is over this particular section.  Deputy Browne said that the Health Act introduced here in 1947 was a radical approach to the health service.  He said he was very happy about the outcome of the application of a particular section of that Act.  It must be remembered that at that time only 16 per cent of the Central Exchequer was being made available for local health authority contributions.  The figure has been considerably increased, and if 16 per cent in 1947 could be termed radical what can the increased amount in this day and age be termed as?  I do not think there is an adequate term for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I totally agree with the views expressed by Deputy Tunney that rates as <Col N="1914" /> now constituted are a penal tax and are, in their application, penal.  I have said this before and I shall continue to say it until we get an equitable application of rates.  The people who are hurt most by the application of rates are the middle income group, particularly those living in city and suburban areas.  These people are being picked on year in year out as a result of the iniquitous rates system under which we operate at the present time.  What is the alternative to it?  If we were to go to the other extreme and abolish rates in a blanket form then the wealthy people would get away with not paying any rates.</P>
    <P>I believe a scheme of selective local taxation should be examined because there are many people apparently well off who cannot pay rates.  The Minister made observations in relation to a contributory health scheme for the middle and lower income groups, and I would strongly urge him to examine the proposition which would allow these people to enjoy a reasonable standard of living without having to worry about this type of taxation, namely rates.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been accused of arrogance because he asked for this measure to be let through with a certain amount of urgency.  I think this was a very fair request and if Deputy Browne did not want to take the Minister's advice there was no need for him to call the Minister arrogant.</P>

We then had to try to make good nearly a decade of decay, of reduction, of slowing down, and ten Ballymuns would not make good the loss of the housing output.  That is the reality of the situation.  Ballymun is an everlasting monument to the failure of Fianna Fáil to build as they should have built for ten years and there should be ten Ballymuns to meet the housing requirements of this city.</P>

      <P>When the Government decided as they did and as they acknowledged in their White Paper which they published in 1958 that the housing needs had been met, they decided to cut down but, when they decided that, there were still on the recognised waiting list in Dublin 5,000 families looking for housing at a time when they said the housing requirements had been met.  God will never forgive them, man might forget that that happened but that is the reality of the situation and at present there are requiring re-housing in Dublin as of now, 26th November, 1969, 30,000 families.  Officialdom says 4,500 but does not recognise that anybody has a right to a home in this country unless they happen to be a man and woman and two children.  It is not the lot of a man or woman always to be blessed with children.</P>
      <P>Why should such people be ever accursed to live in derelict, rat-infested dwellings which have serious consequences for their health?  Why must they for ever have to live in misery? Is our society such that they will not recognise the rights of people unless they marry young, have a contagious disease and breed like rabbits, because that is, apparently, the norm which entitles people to housing and not to have it unless they happen to be already living in overcrowded dwellings, in insanitary conditions, in impossible housing conditions.</P>
      <P>Our society will not have met the housing problem until people have available to them a home of their own when they want it and are prepared to pay for it, as most people are, until when they are in a position to want a home of their own, they are entitled to it, and that is every man and woman in our community without regard to their financial position.</P>

    <P>The European social charter recognises the right of the family to social, legal and economic protection and this says that with a view to ensuring the necessary conditions for the full development of the family, which is a fundamental unit of society, the contracting <Col N="1917" /> parties undertake to promote the economic, legal and social protection of family life by such means as social and family benefits, fiscal arrangements, provision of family housing, benefits for the newly married and other appropriate means.  Family housing is one of the rights recognised by the European social charter drawn up by the legal and social experts of 18 member nations of the Council of Europe, a charter to which Ireland has not yet subscribed because the Fianna Fáil Government do not recognise the fundamental right of our people to housing.  That is one of the reasons why they are not prepared to sign or are not in a position to sign the European social charter.</P>

      <P>The international convention on economic social and cultural rights under article 11 recognises the right of everyone&mdash;mark you, everyone and not just people who are on the approved waiting list&mdash;to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family, including adequate food, clothing and housing.  Here, again, it is considered that even that is not sufficient; <Col N="1918" /> people have a right to a continuous improvement of living conditions.  Ireland again is not a signatory to this convention because Ireland, under Fianna Fáil, is not prepared to acknowledge that man has these absolute rights, rights which are equal in all respects with the fundamental legal rights which might have satisfied our ancestors in the 19th century but which are not adequate to satisfy the social conscience of the 20th century.</P>
      <P>The international convention on civil and political rights recognises that the family is the natural and fundamental group-unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and by the State and it has added to it that the protection required for the family includes the provision of a home.  This we are not doing.  This we are failing to do here because we are not concentrating all available men, money and materials on the building of houses.  Acknowledging that people living in overcrowded and insanitary conditions have a prior claim, we must realise that it is unfair to commit 20 per cent of our families&mdash;when I talk of families I mean units of married men and women, with or without children&mdash;to a lifetime of misery unless they have sufficient private means to purchase a dwelling of their own.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that what we need is a dramatic increase in housing output in order that we can arrive at a situation in which people do not have to live in misery, do not have to live in insanitary conditions, do not have to live in overcrowded conditions, with all the domestic and social strains that involves, before they have an opportunity of having a house of their own. We certainly must amend our housing regulations so that recognition will be given to the length of time people have to await a house.  The present system under which a person must forgo a house unless he falls within certain categories is unfair because it means that parents and their children are forever confined to a waiting list and will never, certainly in this world, enjoy a home of their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned last week, this country has the worst housing output in Europe.  Countries which are even <Col N="1919" /> worse off economically than we are, poorer socially than we are, countries like Spain and Portugal, have a higher housing output than we have.  Our housing output is only one-quarter of that in the six northern counties and we are now in the horribly embarrassing position of complaining to Europe and to the world of discrimination in housing in the North of Ireland.  But there is active discrimination here, year in and year out.  Large numbers of our people will never get houses because the regulations are discriminatory and, because they are discriminatory, these people have no prospects of ever having houses of their own.</P>
    <P>Last week Deputy Moore said that we had no housing problem in 1957 because people were flying from the country.  He said there was ample housing available and he mentioned 1,500 vacancies in Dublin in one year.  That, of course, was not in 1957.  That happened in 1959.  But, even if there were 1,500 vacancies in 1957, there were always families anxious to get into the 1,500 houses when they became vacant.</P>
    <P>The appalling situation is that, although there are always people in the queue, it was decided by those responsible apparently that it was necessary to have a queue for evermore.  This is the notion Fianna Fáil continue to perpetuate.  This is their whole approach to the housing problem.  It reminds me of the outlook dyed-in-the-wool Conservatives always had towards the employment problem; you never have a proper standard of economic solvency in a community unless you have a certain percentage of people unemployed.  So it is as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned; you are never right in relation to housing unless you have a queue and the bigger the queue the better, according to the social thinking of Fianna Fáil.  Deputy Moore said that the Dublin tenements had gone.  That is one of the greatest fallacies of our time.  What is a tenement?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a Georgian building.  It is any dwelling in which <Col N="1920" /> there are too many people.  There are many modern housing estates in this city and elsewhere throughout the country where there are people living three and four per room, where there are two and three families under the one roof, a roof smaller in dimension than the one room in the much deplored Georgian houses.  There is far more breathing space and far more room in many of the much maligned Georgian tenements than there is in many of the modern housing estates. Unlike Deputy Browne, I spent many years in the tenements of Dublin, something that he and his ilk have never done; they would not cross the threshold.  I am proud to say that many of my best friends came from Dublin tenements.  I sat beside them in class.  Perhaps I was more fortunate than others.  I could have been sent to some of the fancy schools but I thank God and my parents for sending me to a school in which I sat in the same desk with the poorest of the poor.  I played and worked with them down through the years.  I knew their suffering.  I know their suffering today in the working-class suburbs; their sufferings are just as bad, or worse, than what they had to endure in the old slums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thanks be to God the old slums have gone but, in many cases, they have been replaced by honeycombs of concrete blocks in which there are new tenements, concealed behind freshly painted doors and windows and clean curtains.  These conceal the reality of appalling tenements in many of our suburban estates.  We are not going to brush these under the carpet, as Fianna Fáil are trying to do.  We want to bring this out into the open.  We are asking the Government to acknowledge the extent of the problem.  It is not just a mere 4,500 looking for houses; it is 25,000 to 30,000 who are entitled to housing.  I do not pretend this is an easy problem.  I do not pretend that the cash is readily available.  I do not pretend the problem can be solved overnight, but we are saying that there should be more concentration of effort, money and material and that no building of an unnecessary kind should take place under licence and that nobody should be permitted to erect unneces- <Col N="1921" /> sary buildings unless he is prepared to spend an equal amount of money, time, manpower and effort building homes for our people.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that to impose such a condition would push away facilities and capital from Ireland which otherwise might come but I find that difficult to believe.  There are many countries in Europe&mdash;it is mainly the European countries that are investing their money here&mdash;where office block accommodation and fancy buildings are not permitted unless the people who are embarking on the construction of such buildings are prepared to spend a similar amount of money on the building of houses.  There is no such restriction here and the result is the misery and suffering our people have to endure.  That situation will not be righted if we are to continue the set-up of pretending that the problem is less than it is, or of pretending that we have no obligation to people unless they fit into certain statutory regulations and categories that are inapplicable in a modern age.</P>
    <P>We should cherish all the children of the nation.  We should cherish equally all the parents of the nation and, indeed, all adults of the nation because even if God has not bestowed children upon them they are entitled to decent housing.  We appreciate that Fianna Fáil are not acknowledging this right and that they are not taking the necessary steps to give people a chance to exercise this right.  It is because of this that we believe this motion of the Labour Party is deserving of support. It asks for the declaration of a housing emergency not because that in itself is sufficient&mdash;the motion acknowledges that it is not&mdash;but because by so doing we will have public recognition of one of the greatest problems which, even if every available penny were to be spent on it, it would not be solved.  A comment from Deputy Moore inferred that this motion suggests confiscation and communism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion put down in the name of Labour Party Deputies asks first that the nation as a whole should recognise that a crisis exists in housing.  From official figures it is easy to document this but at the outset it is necessary to say that the question of the availability of a house for every family is much more than simply keeping the weather off them, it is a question of the whole quality of their lives. How does one rear decent children in an honourable, cultured atmosphere if the simple physical square footage is not there?  As I have said, there is more <Col N="1923" /> at stake than just keeping out the cold. We are entitled to compare the scale of effort in this country with the scale of effort in other countries in regard to providing homes and this is possible through international agencies.</P>
      <P>The most recent figures I possess are for 1967.  In that year houses built per 1,000 of the population were as follows: Austria 7, Denmark 9, Holland 10, Sweden 13 and Ireland 4.  The figure for Ireland is less than one-third of the rate at which the Swedes are building where a very high standard of living is already enjoyed.  That scandalous four after ten years of Fianna Fáil Government in 1967 makes us the worst in Europe.  The percentage of our gross national product contributed to the provision of homes for people is the third lowest in Europe.  If one compares the currencies of different countries in Europe, investment in housing per person is three, four or five times less in Ireland than it is in comparable Western European countries and no juggling with the systems of rent and no forming of queues on this or that set of criteria will get over the fact that there are simply not enough houses in which to house our people.  We must build more houses and at a faster rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have some inadequate figures as to the scale of the shortfall.  The Government have estimated it at 59,000 buildings but that is a conservative estimate and in reality the scale is of the order of 80,000 dwellings which means that at least 400,000 people and probably half a million people in this little Republic are inadequately housed. We are entitled to ask where we went wrong because if we are concerned with telling the truth about the history of buildings rather than making political scoring points off each other, the fact is that on the formation of the new State, the Free State Government with the £ million scheme made a good effort towards housing, and ten years later, when Fianna Fáil came into office, a profoundly serious and excellent effort was made in this direction under the comprehensive Act of 1932. We reached a high standard of rated buildings in 1939.  We would be politically <Col N="1924" /> dishonest if we did not acknowledge the efforts made by various Governments at various times.  We are not playing that sort of political pinpointing by distorting facts.</P>
    <P>The real shortfall, the going off the rails in terms of our national building effort, started at a time when, in my opinion, many other things went off the rails in Ireland&mdash;the great turning point of ten years ago which is not much referred to but when the Government of the day decided to abandon traditional protection of the economy and the traditional method of developing the economy by opening the economy to the inflow of foreign capital, setting out on an entirely new political course.  They did this without telling the people what was happening. At that time there was a major turning point in the whole development of our politics and the economy.  The decision at that time was that the major pressure was an industrial development and that we would do this by letting in foreign capital, but housing was put away down in the queue for available capital.</P>
    <P>Belatedly, the European move of the 1950s, which continued into the 1960s, penetrated here and pulled us along and we started to prosper.  Again, it is hypocrisy and falsification of economic history to suggest that this is the work of one party or another, just as it is hypocrisy to suggest that the only major economic downturn since the end of the war, in 1955-56&mdash;which was all over the western world&mdash;was the fault of an inter-Party Government. That is simply falsification of economic history and baby talk.  But, in that period, we had the beginning of a rise in demand and the beginnings of a diminution in emigration which had taken place under Fianna Fáil and under inter-Party Governments.  Would that we could say with honour that, in either period, it had not happened and the people would still be here but, in fact, it happened under both Governments.</P>
    <P>However, we had this tremendous diminution in building in the public sector in Dublin.  In 1958, corporation houses and flats&mdash;1,567; by 1961&mdash;279. The decision was that such houses as we were to have would have <Col N="1925" /> to come from what is euphemistically called &ldquo;private enterprise&rdquo; which, in Ireland, is neither particularly private nor particularly enterprising.  The swing to dependence on the private sector took place about ten years ago and in the immediately ensuing years. The reason was that, with growing prosperity in Ireland, there was some &ldquo;lolly&rdquo; to be squeezed out of people who needed homes.  They then had a little to expend on private accommodation. The mechanism for squeezing it out was to hand over building to the private sector.</P>
    <P>It has to be said at this stage, unequivocally, that private builders and developers have a vested interest in seeing that the housing gap is never closed and that the need for houses is never met.  The reason is perfectly simple.  If there is a shortfall in supply, if people are competing either to rent or to purchase, prices of houses and rents stay up.  If you build ten houses more than the total need, rents and prices go down.  The private developers are bright enough to know that if they ever close the gap their profits will drop.  They take damn good care to manipulate the gap in order to keep their profits up; in other words, never to meet the needs of the people because if they did that, private profit would be diminished.  That is inescapable.  It is a fact all over the world.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil decided to place their major dependence on the private sector, willy-nilly, perhaps unconsciously, they simultaneously decided that that gap would never be closed while they were in office.  We now have the ridiculous spectacle of a shortfall of the order of maybe 60,000 to 80,000 houses created by a Government which has been in office for 12 years.  We see the representatives of the party in Government at parliamentary and at local levels manipulating that shortage in terms of favours and special intercessions for their own party benefit when they created the shortage themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perfectly true and I know it.  The pretence of this enormous concern with closing the gap is <Col N="1926" /> hypocritical in the light of the performance I have just quoted.  If the Deputy can answer me with facts let him do so.  If he cannot, let him please respect my right to make my points in my own way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We can now pass on to the question of how many houses we now need.  Various estimates have been made by various bodies of people. I do not propose to add a personal estimate to them.  However, if we average out the various existing estimates, we need houses at a rate of something like 24,000 a year.  I have not the figure for 1969 but, in 1968, we built 13,000 houses&mdash;so that we shall never close the gap.  We can indulge only in manipulation of queues and different sorts of choosing of the specially-selected ones.  We can never meet everybody's needs until we enormously increase the rate of building. There is no escape from that conclusion. We can ask the question: &ldquo;How, then, can we solve this problem? How can we enormously increase the rate of building, which is the key to the matter?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We spend about £29 million a year at present on building.  That is the third lowest percentage of GNP spent on housing in Europe.  A two per cent shift of our GNP, which would still put us below many European countries, would provide the extra finances to increase our rate of building enormously. We hear, of course, the classical cry, when a mess has been made of something, that we cannot afford it and that, if we want to afford it, we must have extra taxation.  The answer is that it is not necessary to raise extra taxation by methods such as turnover tax and income tax on working people to meet that.  I can recommend to the Minister one tax which will not bear on any of the ordinary working sections of the community and which will provide all the money necessary to solve the housing problem&mdash;a capital gains tax.  I recommend it to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of borrowing now is at world historical high levels all over <Col N="1927" /> Western Europe and the United States. When people repaying loans, and so on, trying to buy out their houses, are saddled with these desperate loan charges it puts the hope of having a home outside the realm of possibilities for many.  We can say &ldquo;It is not our fault because in America, in Britain, in Germany, the cost of credit is high&rdquo;.  That is true.  It is a fact.  But we are a small country.  The reason the cost is high in America is because of boom inflation which does not exist here at this time to the same extent.  If we had a separate currency, which we controlled, we should have a lower interest rate.  It is because the Government, bleeding for the poor loan-repayer, have never chosen to assert economic independence that our interest rates are at the astronomical levels that prevail in the United States. Were we to choose to assert that independence, our interest rates would be lower.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we see the magnificently hypocritical spectacle of the hearts of the Deputies of the Government party bleeding and the manful efforts they are making to reduce interest rates&mdash;and the admirable publicity which they obtain for this from sympathetic sources of publicity&mdash;while the reason for the high interest rates is the policy of the Government party to which they belong.</P>

This system of buying land is embedded in the very evolution of this island.  There is no reason why it cannot be applied to building land all around the city and in every other city.</P>

      <P>Let me sum up on this because the crisis which our motion states to exist obviously exists.  That crisis is the product, if we are charitable about it, of stupidity and incompetence. That is the source of it.  But it is being maintained for other motives and the other motives are profit and greed.  It is maintained as a crisis because of the need to wring as much as possible out of the pockets of people who need homes, commercial advantage for private developers who have a great deal of influence with the Government party which is making the <Col N="1931" /> material decisions influencing their rate of profit.  This is the motive now.  The problem is very easy to solve.  We are one of the very few countries in the world with a sinking population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Just in the last year or so it has started to rise again very slowly but we have nothing like the population problems of almost every other country in the world.  Because of the enormous amount of emigration we do not have the population pressure of other countries.  Because our rate of industrialisation has been very slow we do not have the explosive urban growth that other countries have got. We possess the land in a physical sense. We possess the possibility of raising the money.  We possess the skilled labour force.  We possess all the conditions necessary in land, in materials, in money, to solve it, but we will not see a solution to it because it exists for a deliberate reason.  It exists because the friends and influencers and, might one say, the financial supporters of the Government party have the greatest material interest to maintain the shortfall in housing and to go on manipulating public need and public misery and public humiliation for their own personal pecuniary advantage.  This is a profoundly scandalous situation but it is the situation which exists and it is the situation I regretfully predict that will continue to exist as long as that party remain in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to Deputy O'Connell, Deputy Ryan and Deputy Keating speak on this motion.  Before I deal with some of the points raised, I want to give some of the facts of the situation.  Deputy O'Connell indicated that there were 20,000 families awaiting accommodation in Dublin city.  If he used the same logic when taking a man's pulse he would probably find that it was 700 or 800 beats to the minute. Deputy Ryan knows Dublin city well. I would say to him that any person who has not seen the immense amount of house building that has gone on in <Col N="1932" /> Dublin city should have the blind pension. The constituency he represents was completely built by Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>At the moment Dublin Corporation have 52,280 dwellings in their possession. In addition to that they advanced SDA loans to 15,000 people.  As well as that 8,765 repair grants were made available to ensure that houses were maintained.  This represents a total of approximately 76,000 dwellings which house approximately 380,000 people out of a population of 578,000.  That means that more than two-thirds of the population of this city have been housed or assisted in some way by the local authority.  The corporation debt on 31st March, 1969, was £80,067,006.  Of this 95.64 per cent, which is equal to 19s 6d in the £, relates to housing.  This gives some idea of the priority that has been given to housing by the corporation. In the last three years the Minister for Local Government has made available £1 million for land acquisition in order to ensure that the local authority would have in its possession a substantial number of sites.  On 31st October, in Dublin city the weekly tenancy dwellings in progress or ready to start for which full approval has been given numbered 2,138; schemes being prepared, 4,965; sites acquired or being acquired, 3,830&mdash;a total of 10,933.  In the programme of purchase houses on private sites: houses in progress or ready to start, 1,686; schemes being prepared, 3,830; sites acquired or being acquired, 4,968&mdash;a total of 10,484.  This gives a complete total of 21,417 dwellings or sites in the corporation's present housing programme. It is no wonder the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party take this opportunity at this time to make their allegations when they know that measures are well in hand in Dublin city to rectify the present housing shortage. Those figures are convincing and are factual.  They are not figures which have been thrown out by Deputy O'Connell or the nonsense we have listened to from Deputy Ryan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very substantial programme for which money has been made available and will be made available to complete this total of 21,417 <Col N="1933" /> dwellings.  I can also give figures of the substantial amount of land which has been acquired or is about to be acquired in the case of both private and public development.  I may come back to that at a later stage when I deal with more of the nonsense we have heard here tonight and last Wednesday night.</P>
    <P>We are aware that in a fast-growing economy, in a living city or a living nation, there will always be a housing problem.  It is only when people leave their houses that we have no housing problem, such as happened following the inter-Party Government taking office.  We know the great number of vacant houses there were in the city at that time.  They represented broken families who had to leave this country. The building workers of this city had to find employment in Birmingham. There were no building workers in this city at that time.  Members of the Labour Party and members of the city council are well aware of that.  The building workers were employed in Coventry, Birmingham and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>At present we have less than 5,000 people on the waiting list and we have plans for 21,417 dwellings.  This figure of 5,000 has been questioned.  We have been asked why there has not been a reduction in this figure over a period of years.  First of all, there is now a more liberal definition of need than there was in the past.  There is a higher priority given to the elderly than there was formerly.  A husband, wife and child, where the family is not likely to increase, are now put on the waiting list. It is a deliberate lie to say that such people are not housed.  They have been housed in their hundreds in Ballymun.</P>
    <P>The increase in population is a factor in the bigger demand for housing in the city and this follows the industrial development in the area.  There is a demand for higher standards now than there was in the past and this is an additional reason why the figure remains at 5,000.  Many demolitions have taken place.  The corporation demolished Keogh Square and other areas of unfit housing.  I can take credit for the demolition of Keogh Square because at the first and second meeting of the last city council I insisted that <Col N="1934" /> action should be taken in Keogh Square; and in a previous council I was responsible, with another Deputy, for having the first block demolished. I am glad to see good accommodation being provided there now.</P>
    <P>In connection with the agitation there has been with regard to housing in this city, I might mention that some of the people who went to jail were offered houses but refused them.  I just want to mention that Mr. Dennehy was offered accommodation by Dublin Corporation but he refused it and continues to live in a caravan.  He is one of the chief agitators we have heard so much about.  Deputy Keating referred to &ldquo;lolly&rdquo;, profit and greed and spoke of the friends and financial supporters of Fianna Fáil.  Deputy Keating is one of the men who has held up the housing of people in the Tallaght area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts speak for themselves.  The figures I have given are an indication of the progressive development which has taken place. When the committees were completely controlled by the Opposition no Fianna Fáil member was a chairman or a vice-chairman. The Fianna Fáil members were outvoted.  The Opposition had it all to themselves.  What was the result of that?  It appears now that after a Labour chairman and a Fine Gael chairman and vice-chairman, all they can say now is that a housing emergency should be declared and then the problem will be solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We felt in this Party that it was desirable that people should be able to own their own homes.  There was opposition to this line of thought.  We had opposition from the Labour Party, who <Col N="1936" /> deliberately impeded this scheme because they believe when people have a responsibility, have a stake in the community, they no longer vote Labour. How right they are.  Nevertheless, we pushed forward and we now have a situation where 8,300 corporation tenants are interested in purchasing their houses.  Of these, 5,615 have been notified of the gross purchase price and the purchase money has been available to tenants within the prescribed time.  A figure of 3,243 applications are being received daily.</P>
    <P>The point about it is that people are owning their own homes, despite the efforts of Labour and of some members of Fine Gael.  This scheme was instituted in order to ensure that people with low incomes, who would not normally qualify, would have an opportunity of purchasing their own homes at reasonable prices.  A further 8,300 people are seeking their own homes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures given total 21,417.  There are 10,933 sites on which preparation work is going ahead, on which schemes are being prepared or on which work has been started.  This is all being done, as I have said, in order that people may own their own homes.  Of course, in addition, there are tenant purchase schemes.  As well, a substantial number of free sites have been made available on which people can build their own homes.  More than 1,500 free sites have been allocated by the Dublin Corporation during the years in addition to the 54,000 dwellings which are in the possession of the corporation.  In addition, 15,000 loans have been given under the SDA and there have been grants for reconstruction of houses.</P>
      <P>Under the tenant purchase scheme, 1,590 houses have been made available or are in the course of being made available and this gives the grand total of 58,000 dwellings.  Nobody can deny this represents a substantial effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot build houses without <Col N="1937" /> workers and some years ago the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Blaney, felt that the Dublin Corporation effort was not good enough&mdash;that they were not meeting the standards in house building that the Government required.  He sent members of the city council to the Continent to examine system building in order to ensure that the vacuum created in the house building programme in Dublin through lack of skilled workers would be met.  It is a fact that there are not building workers available to enable us to increase to any great degree our house building programme.</P>
    <P>At any rate, the Minister for Local Government at that time insisted that something would have to be done because the Fine Gael and the Labour chairman and vice-chairman of the local authority were not doing enough. At that time, the vice-chairman of the council, Mr. O'Rourke, was looking for credit.  If they want credit they can give it to Deputy Blaney because it was through his efforts that the Ballymun scheme became a reality.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell severely criticised a member of his own party.  He severely criticised land speculators and I was surprised he should attack his own colleague in the way he did.  I was also surprised that he attacked the ITGWU for building an office block.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Some years ago we had a scheme for the laying of a sewer to facilitate house building in south west Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not smear anybody&mdash;I was admiring the colour scheme over there.  The sewer project was opposed by Fine Gael and Labour and it means, in effect, that much building land is lying idle throughout the south west side of the city.  That land could have been opened for housing at a very low cost but I am sure that when the eventual bill is totted up it will be a substantial one due entirely to the action of Labour and Fine Gael in opposing the development of the south city sewerage scheme.  It will mean also that the cost of housing the homeless in Dublin will be much higher and consequently that the rates in Dublin will be much higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are the people who opposed a higher rate and eventually they will have to impose a still higher one because of their action in that matter.  It will be of little use for them to cry, as we heard Deputy Keating crying, about the manipulation of rents.  I understand Deputy Keating was referring to differential rents.  I want this on <Col N="1939" /> record: differential rents were introduced in 1950 when Labour and Fine Gael were in power.</P>

      <P>All the defects the system carries and has carried are the result of the implementation of that scheme.  These defects have not been rectified.  The people who now suffer under the scheme which Deputy Keating says is unjust are suffering under a scheme which was introduced on a motion by a member of the Labour Party in Dublin City Council. If differential rents are wrong now they were wrong then and the people who are alleged to be suffering in Ballymun, Ballyfermot, Coolock and elsewhere are suffering as a result of a Labour motion and as a result of a rents scheme being imposed during the reign of terror of the first Coalition Government.</P>

Valuable aides were given for site development and loans and grants, both Government and supplementary, were made available or increased and these are a further indication of progressive thought.  Any additional grants or assistance that will be forthcoming to make the purchase of homes easier represent improvements that must be commended.  These results are frequently clouded over in the same way as it was attempted to cloud over the situation here today and on the previous occasion by other speakers.

      <P>A very substantial contribution has been made by the Gallagher Group in the development at Donaghmede towards the housing of families in this city.  This was an offer received by the corporation and accepted, at a very excellent figure. The Labour Party members opposed this in the initial stages.  They did not want houses built because they were being built by a particular contractor. It now appears that unless houses are built by certain contractors, certain members of the Labour Party will consider them unsuitable.  Here we have a group that have made available over 700 houses at Donaghmede and have done an excellent job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that I will deal with housing. I can say without any fear of contradiction that the accent was taken off housing when the Government changed in 1957.  The purpose of that was to cure a credit squeeze.  It is all political history now.  We know there was a credit squeeze situation and a scarcity of money in 1956 and 1957.  The method utilised by the Fianna Fáil Party then in Government in 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960 and part of 1961, was to take the accent off housing.  That meant that the capital sums required could be dispensed with.  That is where the Fianna Fáil Government fell down. The backlog of houses, no matter how many houses Deputy Dowling says are now in the pipeline, has not been caught up with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The accent was taken off housing in 1958, 1959, 1960 and 1961 and that is the reason for the present housing shortage.  It is quite futile for anyone to say that there is not a serious housing shortage in Dublin.  It is only a year or so since the houses of several people fell down upon them because there were no new houses to send them to.  It is only a few years since we had people lodged in Griffith Barracks, with husbands getting in to see their wives and families for about an hour every day.  There were no houses for them to go to because the houses in which they had lived and from which they were sent to Griffith Barracks were not only unfit for human habitation but physically dangerous to live in.  Let us face that fact.  Let the Fianna Fáil Party be as critical as they like politically but, one of the things they must accept is that that situation did exist, and for many people exists at this moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with the question of priorities.  Housing was moved up on the priority list by the Fianna Fáil Government in or around 1962 but, just as the Minister for Local Government and I have to live with our sins, the Fianna Fáil Government have to live with the sins of 1958, 1959, 1960, and 1961, that is, the 40,000 houses they did not build.  That is the irrefutable <Col N="1947" /> figure the Minister has to live with.</P>

Of course, housing workers will not stay on the unemployed list if they can get work in any other industry.  Of course they will try to get a decent wage in order to rear their families in decency.  They now have to be moved back into the housing industry.  The Minister is very fond of telling me, as chairman of Louth County Council, that he will see to it that I will do my job.

I am trying extremely hard to build 487 houses in three years and, if the Minister's Department will wake up, I will build them because I have got the sites.  I went out with my county councillors and bought them from people who were prepared to give me land for houses.  That is where the accent has been switched from one thing to another.  The Minister's accent was switched away from housing and the Minister has to live with that.</P>
      <P>I want to deal now with the question of priority for capital.  In this regard I am an utter realist and I am certainly no conservative.  It is the policy of the party of which I am proud to be a member to give priority to capital for housing.  It is our policy also, if that capital is too expensive, to subsidise it from taxes and to see to it that there is fair housing rent available to the working man and his wife and family. It is quite clear that if you get a variation in costs of anything between £1 and 30s per square foot for modern office space in this city, naturally enough that attracts capital because that capital can get a better return and more profit.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Health Bill, 1969: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 31 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say again that under section 31 it is possible in future time for the Government in office to make any further contribution they want to make towards the expenses of the health services.  There is nothing in the Bill that inhibits any change of policy that is considered desirable.  There is nothing in the Bill which prevents the Government of the day from changing the method of assessing taxation on the people in ways suggested by Deputy Browne. There is nothing in the Bill that prevents the Government from altering the <Col N="1949" /> rating structure.  There is nothing in the Bill that limits the Government to the present system.</P>
      <P>Therefore, section 31 could be adopted by the House on the understanding that people in the different parties disagree as to how much should be raised from the rates and how much should be raised from taxation; disagree as to the manner of the imposition of taxation on the people. I could go into further arguments about it; I should point out in reply to Deputy Browne that if nobody was allowed to have more than £5,000 a year to spend in this country the total accretion to the Budget would be something of the order of £5 million a year and that would not solve the health service payment problem for more than a year as the health services advanced and as more services are provided.  As I say, it does not mean that those who vote for section 31 are committing themselves to the principle and forever that the contribution of central taxation to health services will remain at the figure it is this year of 55 per cent, and I should like the House to look at the section in that spirit, because that is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said in previous contributions to this that it was a very open section and that we could have another Second Reading debate on it and still be relevant almost, and that is very true.  We said that we have had several discussions not only recently but over the years on the various methods that could be adopted to finance the health services. Our method of financing the health services has been put on the records of this House on numerous occasions. The Minister told us that it might be possible to introduce a contributory scheme to finance the health services, but that this is still under consideration. This must be at least the third Minister for Health that has told this House on various occasions that a contributory scheme was under consideration. One wonders when does consideration of any particular item cease in a Department or how long it takes to make a decision.  Any firm would go out of business if they were <Col N="1950" /> to take several years to make a decision as to whether or not something was possible or advisable.  I do not want to cover this ground again except to say I believe the Minister is being unreasonable when he says this is under consideration but that he cannot give a date.  This is a major piece of legislation on the health services, and surely this is the time when we should have written into this Bill what everybody is satisfied is the best possible means of financing the health services.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to a case made by Deputy P. Dockrell earlier on for a change in subsection (3) of this section. Deputy Dockrell put this in legal jargon, but stripping it of the legal jargon, what he is looking for and what I believe is right, is the division of the expenses of the health services between the five local authorities, say, in the eastern region, on a service rendered basis.  Originally, when we had the unification of the health services in Dublin city, Dublin county and the borough of Dún Laoghaire, I happened to be chairman of the county council at the time.  I represented the county council in the long negotiations that took place with the corporation and the borough of Dún Laoghaire in relation to the basis on which the contributions would be made from various authorities.  We eventually agreed to this services rendered basis simply and solely because I was able to demonstrate at that time that we were paying £50 per patient in St. Kevin's Hospital to the Dublin Corporation, and nobody could deny that.  All we wanted to do was to prove that the services we were getting from this joint authority were fair to all the parties concerned. We worked out this system and it was operated extremely satisfactorily since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely it is reasonable to ask that, in the case of the eastern region, the five local authorities that compose this board should get together and decide on a fair and equitable basis of charge for the services they get from this overall authority because of the contribution that is being made from the rates. I say this apart entirely from the fact that we feel that the rates is the wrong way to pay for the health service. <Col N="1951" /> Seeing that the Minister insists that the rates make a contribution to financing the health services, I hope he will very seriously consider the satisfactory basis for the expenses of the combined authority that has been in existence now since 1960.  I should just like to remind the Minister that this has been done under subsections (3) and (4) of section 11 of the Health Authorities Act, 1960, and this should be looked at again to see if this would not be a fair and equitable charge.</P>
    <P>We are told in this section the Minister will decide the contribution that is to be paid by the various contributing authorities.  The Minister will first have to get an estimate from the board.  How then will the board decide what local authority will get what and how the contribution is to be assessed?  This will be an extremely difficult job unless it is done sensibly in agreement with the five local authorities. This is the sort of improvement Deputy Dockrell was proposing in legal language.  I am not putting it in legal language: I am describing it in layman's language, and I think it is right.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies, even on the Government side, have said they believe we should have another look at this method of paying for the health services through the rates.  Deputy Andrews seemed to be confused about what Deputy Tunney said.  He seemed to think that Deputy Tunney suggested that the rates system was unfair.  In fact, that was not what he said at all. Anybody listening to Deputy Tunney would get the impression that all the people who pay rates are rich people, people with tons of money, and that this was a fair and equitable way to get it.  I would tell Deputy Tunney who has done little or no local authority work in his time that more than three-quarters of the people in cottages in County Dublin are in vested cottages and are ratepayers.</P>
    <P>Every local authority house in reality is paying rates because there is provision for them in the rent.  What he does not seem to understand is that the head of the house, who is bearing the <Col N="1952" /> burden of rearing the family, is being called upon&mdash;and it is continued in this legislation&mdash;to pay an exceptional contribution over and above that which is being made by people in good jobs who do not have the burden of keeping and running a house.  Deputy Andrews said that rates are inequitable and that because they are inequitable it is not a good way of financing a scheme and I agree with him.  However, Deputy Andrews seems to have misunderstood the contribution made by Deputy Tunney.</P>
    <P>We, on this side of the House, want to put on record that we think this is wrong.  We are not trying to delay the passage of the Bill in this House.  Certain improvements are indicated in this legislation and we want to see that these improvements are made as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>This is a very important section because it concerns so many people who are finding it extremely difficult to pay rates at the present amount.  I know many people who have built their own houses, nearly at the risk of their health, and have these enormous repayments to make over a period of 35 years before they own their house.  That is a fairly heavy millstone around their necks without having the rates increased by at least one-third because of the health charge.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that there is nothing to prevent him increasing his contribution.  Before this legislation came in there was nothing to prevent him increasing his contribution.  The Minister does not need to put it into legislation because there is already power there to do it.  The Minister knows that on occasion an extra contribution was made by the Exchequer.  I would now ask if that contribution was made illegally, because I should like to know how it was made.  I do not see any necessity for subsection (2) (b) because the power of authority has already been used.</P>
    <P>The question of regulations is dealt with in subsection (7) where it says: &ldquo;Regulations under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  I hate legislation on the basis of regulations because that means <Col N="1953" /> legislation by ministerial decree and no one knows what is going to be contained in those regulations.  If regulations are mentioned in any part of the Bill, I think the Minister should have an obligation to tell the House more or less the type of regulations he has in mind so that Deputies would know the type of legislation they were passing and the type of power they were giving to the Minister.  It is all right for the Minister to say that these regulations can be annulled by the House later on, but I think it is loose legislation.</P>

      <P>I believe a contributory scheme could work out well but so far the schemes put forward have not been comprehensive.  Until the Government come forward with their views on these schemes I shall withhold my judgment on the merits of them.</P>
      <P>With regard to the financing of health services through rates I think Deputy Clinton may have misunderstood Deputy Tunney.  I did not hear Deputy Tunney&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I know what our policy is on this.  If we were to take the health Vote off the local rates it would mean putting a huge imposition on otherwise.  The other day I was looking at the valuation of a big industrial company in the city and I found that they paid £25,000 in rates on one section.  If we were to take the health Vote out of the rates we would have to find all the money through taxation.</P>
      <P>The Minister might consider giving a capitation fee to local health authorities for each medical card holder.  We would still maintain the health rate at the present valuation, as regards the industrial and commercial undertakings, but we would be relieving the local rate for householders.  In this way we would be helping the local authority and at the same time we would not be putting a further impost on domestic ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Clinton mentioned that some other Deputy said the present rating <Col N="1954" /> system was inequitable.  The first sentence of the report of the inter-departmental committee said that the present scheme was inequitable and should be replaced.</P>
    <P>The Minister has power under section 31 to vary the amount and I would ask him to consider the question of a higher capitation grant to the health authority or the local authority in respect of holders of medical cards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the fact that the Minister is anxious to get this Bill through as quickly as possible, but I do not think we should leave this section without fully discussing it.  It seems to me that it is the bogus of the entire Bill.  All the trouble in relation to health legislation has arisen recently over the drastic increase in local charges by every single local authority throughout the length and breadth of the country.</P>
      <P>It is all very fine for the Minister to say that there is nothing to prevent him giving more money under this section. That is his way of getting around it.  It may be that we can accept the word of the present Minister for Health, but we are legislating here for the future and there is no getting away from the fact that this is the vital problem which faces the health services here.  To extend and increase health services and to reduce overhead charges it is necessary to have a sound financial arrangement at the root.  I think the Minister would be the first to admit that the existing system is not satisfactory and is not likely to get any more satisfactory. He may feel against that on account of the introduction of this Bill, taking it as a whole, that the charges may tend to reduce overall in every section.</P>
      <P>I cannot see that.  There is nothing that has been said so far that suggests that costs will be reduced.  The idea is to have greater efficiency as a result of this Bill.  This is an enabling Bill to enable the Minister to do certain things and this is an enabling section, and nothing else, which enables the Minister to reduce the charge on the local authorities.  It does not specify that it is mandatory on him to do so and he is in no way committed under the existing legislation to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1955" /> The Minister must know from the number of Deputies of all parties in the House who have spoken that everybody is dissatisfied with the rate charges and with this section in which they see no avenue for the future. There is nothing in the section which will contain the local rate charge.  There is nothing in it that will contain any charge.</P>
    <P>We have been given to understand, possibly not so much by this Minister as by his predecessor, in the original White Paper, that there will be considerable easement of rates.  Therefore, it is necessary that we should discuss the section as fully as possible because it is the whole key to the future in regard to health legislation.  There is no use in having health legislation which continues the same financial arrangements as operated heretofore, the sky being the limit.  Many ratepayers have reached the stage where they are simply unable to meet their commitments.  It is not economic to have high rate charges.  The rates system in operation here is peculiar to this country.  Across the border, there are no rates on land.  In the United Kingdom there are no rates on land.  Inevitably, the charges under this Bill will fall on people who are not able to bear them.  There is a resistance and there always will be a resistance to legislation when there is a system in operation that is not functioning properly.</P>
    <P>The Minister should make it clear to the House that not only is he in a position to reduce the charge and to accept a higher percentage of the charge as a central Government charge but that he intends to do that.  This is a very important matter.  The Minister should not be vague about it.  He should make clear to the House what his intentions are.  He can do that by giving us percentages.  He must have at his command officials who have worked out the figures to the nth degree.  We have often found, disastrously, that one can prove anything with figures.  At least, figures are a basis for some sort of understanding.</P>
    <P>We should like to see our own policy accepted here of having voluntary <Col N="1956" /> contributions.  In that way there would be a considerable easement of the rates.  For some reason best known to themselves&mdash;perhaps, it is that the idea originated from these benches&mdash; the Fianna Fáil Party are not prepared to accept that.  There is nothing peculiar about that policy.  In other places, the health services are financed by that means.  It is peculiar to Ireland that the ratepayer bears the greater burden and he is being asked to pay more.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by my colleagues on the right, who possibly should be on the left, that there should be a specific charge on specific people. Of course, that is nonsense.  One cannot legislate for individuals.  The burden will be laid on the whole community and the community has reacted to that. The people are no longer able to pay.</P>
    <P>I would earnestly exhort the Minister, if he wishes to proceed with this Bill and to meet the views expressed by every party in the House, to make a gesture and to give us some idea of what he intends to do and what percentage the Government have in mind as the contribution from central funds towards the financing of the health services.</P>

      <P>Section 31 is a very important section.  The Tánaiste has been Minister for Health for only a very short period but he has been most courteous and helpful to us in relation to this Bill in trying to meet the suggestions we have made and the amendments that have been put down.</P>
      <P>Those of us who are members of local authorities hate having to attend the estimates meeting and the meetings that follow because of the glaring problems that are presented.  While it would be an easy matter for the Minister as a politician to say that he will give 70 per cent, he has to go back to the Government and find out what he can do.</P>

      <P>If I thought that the money was there I, like the Deputy, <Col N="1957" /> would try to reduce the burden on the rates.  That is one of the things we are obliged to do.  It can be done under subparagraph (b).  I shall deal only with the section.  The section is so drafted that the Minister can do it provided he gets the money from the Minister for Finance.  I have accompanied Deputies who are members of the health authority on deputations to various Ministers for Health to present the problems with which we were faced.  There is a huge problem facing the Dublin Health Authority because the charges in respect of voluntary hospitals are going up.  The capitation grants seem to be increasing all the time.  There are more and more people receiving hospital treatment than there were 25 years ago.  There are more elderly people going into hospital.  With all the hospitals that there are under the health authority there is still not enough accommodation.  There is no public man associated with the city or county of Dublin or Dún Laoghaire who is not continually making representations in an effort to get somebody into hospital.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given himself power under section 31.  If he can get more money he can make any order he likes under the section for the benefit of the ratepayers.  I have implicit confidence in the integrity and honesty of the Minister.  If he can do it, he will do it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde spoke of voluntary subscriptions.  Other Deputies spoke of a free-for-all service.  A free-for-all service would require another £50 million which the Government would have to get through taxation.  A Bill would have to be brought in and I am quite sure that there would be a great deal of opposition.  We would be told, as Shylock in the <i>Merchant of Venice</i> was told, that we could have our pound of flesh but must not take a drop of blood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a huge problem.  There are many things to be done.  All of us who are public men, including the Minister, would welcome a reduction in the demands made on the individual ratepayer. But what can we do?  If the people have to pay by way of taxation then their butter and their bread, their sugar and everything else will be increased <Col N="1958" /> in price.  I do not know whether direct or indirect taxation is the more acceptable to the majority.</P>

      <P>Why I should be met with this outburst from Deputy Burke I do not know.  I am surprised he cannot conduct himself.  All I am aware of here is hypocrisy.  People say they are aware of the burden on the ratepayers and the demands being made upon them, but nothing is ever done to ease the burden.  There is no plan.  Deputy <Col N="1959" /> Burke says that, if the cost is not met by the rates, then there will be extra taxation.  We are talking about entering the Common Market and adjusting our economy to meet that situation.  We are talking about bringing up our standards so as to put us on a par with Common Market countries.  But there are no plans.</P>
      <P>It is obvious grants will not solve the problem.  There is no proper plan for health or anything else.  It has been said that comprehensive health services would cost too much.  The late Minister for Education, Deputy O'Malley, came in here with a formula for providing free education at a time when it was said it was impossible to make any such provision.  Unfortunately, we have had reactionaries since in the field of education.  We have reactionaries also in the field of health.  It should be possible to provide a proper health service. Only by providing for everyone can we have a proper health service.  The alleged grants will in the long run lead to the ratepayers shouldering the entire burden.  This is not an equitable system. Health services should be financed from the Exchequer.  The Government are tinkering with our health services. The present system is degrading and nothing is being done to improve it. The system has been watered down as compared with what was contained in the original White Paper.  This is not the answer.  There is nothing in this Bill to provide proper health services. The burden will still fall on the ratepayers. That is not an equitable system and I strongly object to it.</P>

      <P>The main trouble in this section is that there is a good deal of ambiguity.  It is open to many different interpretations.  The present situation is invidious.  In Roscommon, for example, 55 per cent of the people have cards; in Mayo only 43 per cent have cards.  I should like to know exactly what this section means.  I will have to go back to my own county and explain to my people what it means.  I was at a meeting in Athlone with the Minister some weeks ago and I was more than amazed to find so much agreement with the Minister on <Col N="1960" /> the propositions he put to us.  The Minister will have to admit, however, that this is open to many interpretations. I think that is what is worrying the Oppositions.  There should be some fixed decision so that we will know exactly where we stand.  Ambiguity is a serious matter.  If the ratepayers have to meet the increased charges, then may God help them.  I do not believe they will have to meet the burden.  I believe the Government through the Exchequer will shoulder the main burden of the cost of our health services.</P>
      <P>We must take into consideration that the changes to be made are not likely to take place within the next four or five years and we all know that as far as highly specialised treatment is concerned, this is carried out in Dublin and the county councils have to pay for it.  If the cost of that type of treatment continues to increase will it be the county councils or the Government who will pay for it in the future?</P>
      <P>Of course, the attacks made on the Minister were made by people who never brought in a Health Bill in their lives and who never will.  On the other hand, I must be realistic and looking at these sections and subsections I am afraid that it is possible to read them in several different ways.  For instance, it is quite possible that instead of getting this one-half, we would get 75 or 85 per cent of the cost of these services but there is no clear indication in the Bill as to whether anything more than 50 per cent will be given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped that the Minister might spell out the procedure to be followed under subsection (3), on what will the decisions in regard to contributions be based by the Minister and the Minister for Local Government. Who will draw up the estimate in the first instance?  I assume it will be the board.  Who will draw up the estimate of the overall requirement and by what procedure will the cost be apportioned as between the various authorities composed in each of the boards?  We are entitled to know this but it is not spelled out in the subsection. I also asked the Minister why it was necessary to have (b) of subsection (2).  As far as I know there is not a clause of this kind in the existing legislation and on four or five occasions we have had the type of grant specified here paid already.  If this was not necessary in previous legislation why is it necessary now?</P>
      <P>I should also like to draw the Minister's attention to section (a) of subsection (6) which reads:</P>
      <P>Where a sum is due and payable under this section to a health board by a local authority, the amount of the sum may be deducted from any money payable to that local authority by any Minister for any purpose whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is this being introduced into the section?  It was not in previous legislation but the Minister for Local Government had the power, some way or other, to make a demand according to the estimates of the various health authorities and he got his money without <Col N="1963" /> this type of procedure.  To me, this does not seem necessary.  In fact, we have a precedent and it now appears that it is an illegal precedent but at the time of the farmers' rates campaign, the Minister for Local Government stopped certain grants because the farmers refused to pay rates.  He was challenged in this House that that was illegal but he said quite definitely that it was not and that he had power and authority to do so.  I should like the Minister to comment on those matters before we leave the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the Minister but I find myself in the unusual but rather pleasant situation of largely agreeing with Deputy Lenehan on this subject.  I do not intend to dwell on the Bill in general because this is not the point at which to do so but we must congratulate the Minister on bringing a very high degree of order into a very considerable degree of chaos.  While we in the Labour Party share the views expressed by Deputy O'Connell about the shortcomings of the measure as a whole, in the light of the golden promises held out by the White Paper, nevertheless, the Minister has achieved a remarkable degree of co-ordination in certain aspects of this Bill but he does so largely within the confines of&mdash;he might well be the first to admit this himself&mdash;a less than ideal and ramshackle system of financing and one which, if we were in a position to start again from scratch, we should be very happy to repair and to bring up-to-date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions in section 31 bring home this precise point about the ramshackle nature of financing extremely clearly.  Deputy P.J. Lenihan has brought this out with his customary pungency and tenacity in debate in this House.  The method of financing by rates is a highly complex and old fashioned one.  Before I became a Member of this House, which is of recent date&mdash;indeed, I have been described as an arrival from another sphere&mdash;I did some work on 19th-century rateable valuations.  There are aspects of 19th-century rateable valuations which remain essentially unchanged <Col N="1964" /> down to the present day.  It is surely an anomaly that a small house built around 1850, 1860, 1870, 1880 or 1890, with a rateable valuation of, say, £20, £25 or £30, should now be mulcted to sustain an attempt to modernise in general the health services.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, recent figures have brought out that the national average price of a house has increased to the region of, £4,750.  These are houses subjected to rateable valuations in the region of, say, £40.  Is it really valid that a young couple getting married today and purchasing at great difficulty some such house should find, either immediately or at the end of a period of rates remission, that they are liable for section 31 (2) of the Health Bill which they do not understand any more than Deputy P.J. Lenihan understands it and which mulcts them extensively in their annual income?</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister has not broken through the network of rateability which is a form of regressive taxation, no matter on whom it falls, and grasped the nettle of one really substantive change in the whole structure of health financing in this country.</P>
    <P>Given the hardworking and diligent Minister that he is, I honestly believe Deputy Childers, the Minister for Health, would have looked to it if it was in his power to do it.  At least it would have abolished very wide geographical disparties in the financing of the health services in this country of which all of us are, I think, very conscious.</P>
    <P>I think that this Bill has provided a marvellous opportunity for the reduction of complexity in the entire structure of health services financing and in the social welfare financing in this country.  This is something of a hobby horse of mine.  I shall not dwell on it at great length.  It is my very deep and fervent belief that the very complexity by which our social services of all kinds are financed and organised in this country plays into the hands of a situation by which the people are unconscious of their rights and attempt at every level to invoke the work of some intermediary&mdash;usually a Dáil Deputy&mdash;to try to get for them what <Col N="1965" /> are, in fact, their rights under constitutional law with the result that all of us are engaged in what is to some extent a disedifying competition in explaining to people their own entitlements under the law.  If the Minister is incapable of explaining these rights to Deputy Lenihan, it is correspondingly all the more difficult for us to explain the same rights to the ordinary citizen in the street.</P>
    <P>The Minister may here have missed an opportunity which, pending a change of Government, will not recur in really radically changing the structure of our health services here.</P>
    <P>My final point is that the burden of rates charges and the burden, in terms of health expenses, fall with wide disparity on different areas in Ireland.  It is hardly necessary for me to dwell upon this point as it has so often been made in this House before.  There are constant questions about the provision of blue cards, the financing of the health services.  The burden of health payments upon the rates, particularly in cities such as Dublin, bring home this point again and again.  I would stress that this is a problem which does not fall merely upon those sections of the population which the Labour Party traditionally represents or like to regard themselves as traditionally representing, but that it falls more and more upon a wide middle-class section of people, young people, many of them with families, who have to sustain this disparity in payment in order to maintain a ramshackle service.  Therefore, while this Bill and the section have their merits, I think the Minister might have gone a lot further to earn for himself an even more significant niche in the history of Irish legislation which unquestionably he will hold if he had grasped this nettle more firmly and recognised the inequity of rates as a means for sustaining health services in this country, if he had gone the whole hog to a more direct form of taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Clinton suggested there might be some method by which the separate county councils and Dublin Corporation might agree on the allocation of the health rate between them as in the 1960 Act.  I can see <Col N="1966" /> reason in that.  I am prepared to go to the Minister for Local Government, between now and Report Stage, to see if he would be agreeable.  It might militate against his examination of the principle of rate equalisation.  There will obviously have to be some point very definitely specified by which somebody will have to decide&mdash;an arbitrator or the Minister himself.  I think that is a reasonable suggestion.  It has been proposed indirectly on this side of the House as well.  Deputy Clinton put it forward first.  I see no reason why I should not attempt, between now and Report Stage, to have this examined. It might give a chance for an equitable settlement between the various county ratepaying authorities and the Dublin Corporation of arriving at an agreement in regard to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the rest of the debate is concerned, I want to say that I, like my predecessor, will do my utmost to ensure the largest possible supplementary grant.  It now works out at 55 per cent which we paid for the health services for local authorities.  The supplementary amount paid in the passing year is £2,640,000 which will considerably be added to owing to the increases in salaries, wages and costs of materials to hospitals.  That is all I can say.  I can also state that we did have an inquiry into a possible method of paying contributions.  I am not delaying the examination of that.  It is coming before the Government almost immediately. I have said it is full of difficulties. It presents many difficulties but at least we have got to the point where we are now examining proposals for some contribution for the middle income groups through the payment of contributions on a semi-insurance basis. The difficulty is, as the House knows, that taxation has to be politically and psychologically acceptable.  Already the rates bear very heavily on people. If you put forward a concept of a contribution, you say to yourself: &ldquo;Can the middle income group afford one per cent, two per cent or three per cent of their incomes?&rdquo; The resultant rate of contribution, on a flat rate or on an earnings basis, could be just as serious in its impact on people as the present rates.  It is a matter that can be argued <Col N="1967" /> in the House as to whether a contributory system would be more acceptable to the middle income group than the present method.  That again relates to the amount the Government can provide by way of grant to mitigate the effects of the rates.</P>
    <P>In so far as the whole country is concerned, I want to state again that the Government, including the agricultural grant&mdash;I think it is permissible to include the agricultural grant in the proportion it bears to total local authority costs&mdash;pay 75 per cent of the cost of the health services.  The cost bears more severely on the rates in large cities.  That is admitted.  In the case of Mayo, for example&mdash;we heard Deputy Lenehan speak about that&mdash;the ratepayers are paying only 15 per cent of the total cost of the health services, if one takes into account the proportion that the agricultural grant bears to the cost of health services as a percentage of the total services provided in County Mayo.  In Roscommon it is 11 per cent and in Galway it is 20 per cent.  Therefore, the position varies from county to county.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton asked me why we introduced subsection (2) (b).  We did that simply to put into legislation a grant that was formerly provided from the Department's Vote.  We have now put it in the Bill.  It has no significance other than that.  It is stated in the Bill that there will be supplementary grants as determined by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Subsection 6 (a) of section 31 is the usual disciplinary clause which provides that, if a local authority fails to pay to the health board its particular contribution from the rates, the amount of the sum may be deducted from any money payable to that local authority by any Minister for any purpose whatsoever. It is just an inevitable disciplinary clause.  I hope we will never have to make use of that clause.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1968" /> Deputy O'Connell said that there was no plan for the health services. Perhaps we have not devised a plan that is satisfactory to him but at this stage of the Bill it would be wrong for me to read out the list of additional services which will be provided under this Bill, and which have very definitely been planned, and the list of other services which will gradually come into operation as the State grows in prosperity.  In reply to Deputy Desmond, we have managed to maintain a rate of health expenditure which is fairly constant in relation to the growth of GNP.  As the country grows more prosperous more and more is being spent on health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say quite frankly&mdash;I have always been frank with the House&mdash;that I think there is a tremendous problem in relation to what can be done about the rating system, whether the rating system provided only 25 per cent of the cost of the health service or 45 per cent, as at present.  As the House knows, there has been a constant examination of this by a special committee set up by the Minister for Local Government.  If one reads their reports one will find that they had great difficulty in suggesting positive, constructive methods for replacing the rating system by any other, or in devising a system of re-rating.  They made some vague proposals for a local sales tax to replace rates.  They did make certain proposals that have been adopted&mdash;for instance, the proposal in the last rating Bill enabling county councils to strike an extra rate in order to relieve necessitous persons of rates. However, I do not think that goes far enough.  The position will have to be examined again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, it is also true that, if one takes the industrial earnings in the city of Dublin for the last ten years, they have about doubled and in that period the rates have about doubled in line with the doubling of industrial earnings.  In the same period many of those people&mdash;we always hope there will be more&mdash;have gone into new houses that have a temporary element of derating, which gradually <Col N="1969" /> diminishes over a period of ten years. Equally, there are other people in Dublin whose incomes have not doubled in the last ten years.  There is an inequity in that which everybody is striving to remove, including the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>I shall do my utmost to see that when this Bill comes into operation&mdash; and indeed next year under the present system even before the Bill comes into operation&mdash;that the largest possible supplementary grant will be voted. However, all these services compete with one another.  For example, if we were to arrange to pay 75 per cent of the health rate, after allowing for the reduction of the agricultural grant, that would mean an extra £8 million on the Budget.  It is easy to say we could find the £8 million.  How would one find it?  We would have to increase income tax by a good number of pence. Then we would have to be careful about income tax because it would affect the income of workers.  Alternatively, turnover tax could be increased by 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from that, every other Minister seeking to improve the life of the people by increases in social welfare services, by increases in the sphere of education, by payments for subsidies for housing loans, would be equally competing for whatever available receipts there are from existing rates of taxation and from increased taxation, if we have to undertake it.  It is no good making idle promises and simply saying that it would be easy to find £8 million.  Everybody knows that the Minister for Finance of the day, no <Col N="1970" /> matter from what part of the House he came, would find sums of that kind extremely difficult to raise.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with section 31 adequately.  I want to make it clear that I will try to provide a supplementary grant as large as possible with the permission of the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>Before the question is put may I ask the Minister a question in relation to the payment of grants by his Department?  The present position is that his Department pays grants quarterly.  I wonder would it be possible for the Department to make the payment to the authorities more often&mdash;monthly, for example?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is one which enables a health board to borrow money subject to conditions specified by the Minister.  I now take up the point which Deputy Dockrell raised on the conclusion of the last section. Much of the money which health authorities are obliged to borrow arises because of the fact that they must pay their hospital accounts, the accounts of extern institutions, in the month in which they receive the bills. Although this obligation lies on health authorities, in practice the Department of Health do not pay their share of the bill for a period of three months, and sometimes for a much longer period, afterwards.  The result is that health boards invariably find themselves in debt, to the tune of one-quarter of their annual expenditure, on hospitalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We received on numerous occasions when we went to the Minister for Health assurances that he would take up this matter with the Department of Finance because it was considered unfair that the rates should be asked to carry the entire cost of the interest on money borrowed to pay for health services.  Unfortunately, we find that under section 31 and 32 health boards <Col N="1973" /> apparently still will be obliged to borrow money to pay bills which are presented to them, but they will have to wait, if the present practice continues, for several months before they receive payment.  Therefore, I should like some indication from the Minister that he will endeavour to shorten the period between presentation of bills by health boards to the Department and payment by the Department of their share.  If this is done it will remove a completely unnecessary burden because this is a charge on health services which does not confer any direct benefit on the people whom it is intended health services should benefit.</P>
    <P>At present, rates in different areas are between threepence and sixpence in the £ more than they would be if the Department of Health paid their health bills when they received them from local authorities.  Everybody will agree there is not sufficient loose money available to be spent unnecessarily in this way, paying bills which would not arise if the national Exchequer paid its accounts with greater rapidity.  If we could achieve this improvement in payment on the part of the Department of Health, or else an undertaking by the Minister for Health to relieve interest on expenditure on loan charges in respect of health services, there would be considerable benefit for the health authorities and, indirectly, for the ratepayers and taxpayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another angle. Many local authorities during a number of years have adopted a practice of budgeting for a credit balance.  At a certain period of the year it is not unusual to find a local authority with a credit balance of up to £250,000 or maybe more.  The reason they try to do this is that they have to borrow at certain other periods because various Departments, such as Health and Local Government&mdash;Local Government in particular&mdash;will not pay them money due.  In these circumstances, local authorities, to ensure that they have money, try to retain a credit balance. This means that they are, in fact, artificially increasing the rate by using money which they should normally not require. <Col N="1974" /> Some local authorities felt it wrong that this should continue and succeeded in having the credit balance used for useful capital works.  It was then found that the position was worse than before because they had to borrow tremendously high sums to bring them over a period when they had not money and the Department of Health or other Government Departments would not give it to them.</P>
      <P>It is all right when money is being raised by an Act of this House&mdash;the money is made available.  But I think it is entirely dishonest of any Government Department to retain or fail to pay money due.  If we want to cut down the rates&mdash;and we hear enough about this&mdash;this is one way in which it can be done: let the State meet its commitments as they fall due.  Deputy Ryan suggests that there should be a subsidy towards loan charges but this would not be necessary if the State paid the money as it falls due.  This is the obvious answer and the Minister should seriously consider this.</P>
      <P>I know that his predecessors and other Ministers may advise him that this is not good business, not the way things should be done; that the money should be let run and eventually the local authority would have to be satisfied with what they get.  In my personal experience, apart from comments made about the percentage of money due by the State, very much less than that amount is made available by the State when the money becomes due.  Therefore, I ask the Minister not to be persuaded by those who have carried on the bad old system for many years that this has been established as the way it should be done and that it should continue. The Minister is an intelligent man able to think for himself and he should see the injustice of the present system and he should decide that the money should be paid at the very latest, monthly, to the local authorities. This would have a big effect on the health rate of local authorities throughout the country.</P>

      <P>This is a matter that was the subject of representations on quite a few occasions when we went on deputations to the previous Minister <Col N="1975" /> for Health.  The present Minister has told us that this matter is under consideration with the Department of Finance.  All I can say is that I have confidence that he will keep up the pressure to see if this can be done.  If it cannot be done, perhaps, he could allow 50 per cent towards the loan charges?</P>

      <P>I am referring to the method of doing it.  There is no prescription.  It is very easy for a county council or a health authority or a Government Department to ascertain the likely cash flow into their coffers.  They know when rates and other payments come in and they know their payments out.  It is possible for them to agree with the Department of Local Government on when they will be in the red and get the Department to provide the money at that time.  It may be half-yearly or quarterly.</P>

Both the Department and the county councils should make the best use of the available cash as any business concern would do, by having regard to when they make their payments out and when their income is at its highest.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lenihan's approach seems to be sensible, if I understand it correctly, in that there are lean periods in local authorities when they have no money and are, in fact, borrowing money.  It should be possible on those occasions for the Department to pay in advance.  In future, the demand will be decided by the Minister who has got that power in the previous section.  When he specifies the amount he knows the amount of money in that year that will be due to the local authority or health board.  There is no reason why, in lean periods when the health board is not in credit, the Minister could not decide to advance money to them so that they will not have to incur bank interest charges.  That is making the best use of available capital. It is a very sensible approach and I hope the Minister will look into this. He has already said that he will concern himself to see that payments are made more promptly but I am asking him to consider the possibility of making advance payments in order to overcome the need for servicing of debt when a local authority is borrowing.</P>
      <P>On the whole, this is a very sensible section about which there can be little controversy.  I am glad to see in subsection (5) of the section that there is provision for a health authority to accept gifts.  We have had the extraordinary position for years that no local authority could accept a gift, even the smallest, for any purpose from anyone. There was nothing in legislation to enable them to do so.  This holds in local government all over Ireland and I am glad that some Minister had the good sense to include this subsection.</P>

      <P>As the House knows, and I may as well be frank about this, the Minister for Finance at certain times in the year is short of money himself and has to raise it by shortterm Exchequer bond issues and so on, on which he pays interest.  There is also the delay in payment of rates in two moieties.  I hope the instalment system provided for in the recent rates <Col N="1977" /> Bill will operate fairly freely or, perhaps, a system whereby people purchase rates stamps.  I was reminded of this in reading the last report of the rating committee presented to the Minister for Local Government in which they pointed out that at the then rate of taxation a person who paid £60 rates on his house, paid £65 in petrol tax if he drove a medium-size car 10,000 miles a year and almost the same amount of money if he smoked 20 ordinary cigarettes a day.</P>
      <P>Part of the difficulty of rates is the great impact of lump sums in two moieties.  That does not say that rates are not still a heavy impost.  To some extent they might be described as a psychological imposition but they are a heavy imposition.  I hope the instalment payment system will grow.  If it does, the money will come into local authorities more regularly.  But, having said all that, I shall do my best to approach the Minister for Finance on this matter.  I can see that sums spent on paying interest to banks for overdrafts for carrying out these services restrict the local authority, or the health board as to the amount it can spend on various services, restrict expenditure on capital works, maintenance and improvements and so on.  I shall do my best about this but it is no good pretending it is an easy problem to solve.  In view of the tremendous increase in rate charges for the health services that has already been experienced, it will be my duty to urge as far as I can the Minister for Finance to take into account the views of all sides of the House in regard to this matter as expressed by Deputy Burke and other Deputies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 32a:&mdash;</P>
      <P>32a.  In page 17, between lines 14 and 15, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  (a) If immediately before the commencement of this section Eugene O'Keeffe was Chief Executive Officer of the Dublin <Col N="1978" /> Health Authority, he shall become by virtue of this subsection Chief Executive Officer of the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>(b)  If immediately before the commencement of this section James Joseph Nolan was Assistant Chief Executive Officer of the Dublin Health Authority, he shall become by virtue of this subsection Assistant Chief Executive Officer of the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>(c)  If immediately before the commencement of this section Randal Neal Lamb was Secretary of the Dublin Health Authority, he shall become by virtue of this subsection Secretary of the Eastern Health Board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When we sat down to draft this amendment the question of whether or not the names of individual people should be included in the amendment arose.  This was something we were anxious not to do but, unfortunately, when we looked up precedents for this, we found that, in fact, actual names had been put in, and we felt there must be some good reason why this had been done.</P>
    <P>There are a number of precedents which can be cited and which can be looked up, and that is why the names of the three persons are mentioned here.  This is something we all want to avoid in this House if we can, because we are speaking of people who are outside the House.  We put down this amendment because we felt that some clarification was called for from the Minister in relation to the three people mentioned in the amendment who at present hold the three senior posts in the Dublin Health Authority.</P>
    <P>These people have been members of the staff of the Dublin Health Authority since 1960.  Previous to that each one of them held very important posts of one sort or another, and they came into their present positions with considerable experience.  The chief executive officer was the city and county manager in charge of the health services of the seven boards then existing and providing the health services for the entire area.  The secretary of the health authority had previously been secretary of two very important hospital <Col N="1979" /> boards.  The third person mentioned in the amendment was, in fact, a senior officer in Dublin Corporation for a number of years, and was very much concerned with the introduction of the 1953 Health Act in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>I want to explain that these three people are in exceptional positions in so far as there is no other official in the whole of the country in the same position.  They are whole-time officers of a health authority and in the most senior positions in the largest health authority in the country.  In no other case is there a whole-time CEO of a health authority.  In no other case is there a whole-time secretary of a health authority.  In no other case is there a whole-time assistant CEO of a health authority.  These people are in a special position.</P>
    <P>There are a number of precedents in previous legislation, notably in the 1940 legislation, of people who were transferred in a manner similar to the manner recommended in this proposed amendment.  We want to get an assurance from the Minister if possible that, as a result of the proposed reorganisation of the health services, these three extremely able and experienced people will not find themselves in inferior positions, so to speak, and that they will be assured that they can continue on in their present positions.  I do not think there will be any contention about this.  There are two other health authority areas, Wicklow and Kildare, added to the present number of authorities in the Dublin Health Authority.  I do not think there will be any opposition to this because, as I say, in no other health authority in Ireland, in no other local authority in Ireland, will anyone lose a position as a result of this change.</P>
    <P>A man who was CEO of a health authority was also a county manager. The same goes for secretaries of existing health authorities.  They were also secretaries of the local authorities concerned.  They will continue in that position.  We want to ensure that three able experienced people do not lose their positions because of this reorganisation and enlargement of the eastern region of the health authorities.</P>

      <P>Allow me to develop this.  There is no precedent here.  This is the only regional health authority we have had in Ireland since 1960.  These men have carried out their duties in a very conscientious way over the years.  They have been trained to do the work of the regional health authority in dealing with three local authorities.  A precedent was established in a previous Health Bill.  I do not want to mention names, but there was a precedent for this when the regional health authority was set up. The then assistant city manager and the city manager were mentioned in the Bill.</P>
      <P>There is a danger here that we may be doing an injustice to three very conscientious men.  I agree with this amendment, although my name is not down to it.  We agreed to do this.  I know the Minister would not like this Bill to be responsible for doing any injustice to any member of the regional health authority.  It is the only regional health authority we have in operation. As Deputy Clinton rightly stated, this matter does not arise in any other constituency, or in any other health area.  The secretaries of the various councils and the county managers in the various areas will not be displaced. Their positions will be just as they are. There will be the creation of new posts in the regional health areas as cited in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing here with a specific case.  I would not like&mdash;and I know my colleagues would not like&mdash;an injustice to be done to three most conscientious men, men who have distinguished themselves.  I have worked with them for nine years.  I got to know them and I could not speak too highly in their praise.  I do not want to overemphasise it but I want to appeal to the Minister to see that justice is done in this case.  I would be grateful to the Minister if <Col N="1981" /> he could consider favourably what I have said.</P>

      <P>I want to endorse everything which Deputy Clinton and Deputy Burke have said about this amendment.  The amendment comes before the House as a result of a meeting of the Dublin Health Authority at which it was unanimously decided that we should put down this amendment. The Minister is a reasonable man.  Mr. O'Keeffe, the first named in the amendment, gave up the assistant city managership to take over the Dublin Health Authority; Mr. Nolan gave up his position in the Dublin Board of Assistance; and Mr. Lamb gave up his position in the Dublin Corporation.  It has already been stated that these three are the only whole-time members of the health authority and I would press the Minister to accept these amendments, but if he is not prepared to accept these amendments then I would press him to insert into this Bill some method of compensating these three men who have, as I have said, given up positions in the service and who might be passed over with the setting up of the new regional health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur in principle with what has been said.  With respect to Deputy Clinton and Deputy Dockrell, the naming of names is not really contentious. For the Minister's information&mdash;there were precedents mentioned in relation to the naming of these three gentlemen&mdash;the County Management Act of 1940 made provision for a similar situation which existed then, and apparently now exists in relation to this Bill and this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three people mentioned&mdash;the CEO, whom I know very well, the acting CEO, and the acting secretary, whom I know to a lesser extent&mdash;took over a conglomerate of seven health authorities.  They took over the health authority of Dublin Corporation which comprised the largest staff.  They took over the Dublin Board of Assistance which at that time ran St. Kevin's Hospital.  They also took over the Dublin County Council health staff, Dún Laoghaire health staff, the staff of Rathdown Health Authority and the staff of Balrothery Health Authority. <Col N="1982" /> The Rathdown authority covered the south side of the city, while Balrothery covered the north side.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy who has some considerable experience of dealing with the Dublin Health Authority, I have nothing but the highest praise for the efficiency with which these men brought these seven health authorities together and made an efficient unit, and it is a difficult thing to meet that type of demand nowadays.  I can only speak of the Dublin Health Authority <i>per se</i>, I have no experience of the disparate authorities before the Dublin Health Authority became one unit; they look at cases not so much from the financial aspect or from the point of view of how much they are going to lose but rather from the humanitarian aspect of an individual's situation.  They are a humane authority and that is good enough for me in dealing with any such body.</P>
    <P>The section as it stands is not strong enough to bring in the amendment that Deputy Clinton calls for.  However, if the Minister cannot include the names in the section I know he will give this House an assurance that no injustice will be caused to these three individuals named in the section.  I should like to see them getting compensation if the Minister does not see his way to accepting this amendment or a similar amendment to the section.  I want to ensure that these men will be placed in exactly the same position as they are now in. I want to see that they are placed in the eastern regional health board as if their lives were not upset at all by the creation of this new health board. Therefore, I would ask the Minister to transfer them holus bolus to the new health board with no upset to their lives.  They have made their commitment by the manner in which they have done their duty to the city and county of Dublin, and that is why I concur with Deputy Burke on the one hand and Deputy Clinton and Deputy Dockrell on the other hand.</P>

We hope the Minister will do what is asked either through this amendment or in some other way if he does not think the amendment covers the problem.</P>
      <P>I am interested to hear Deputy Andrews describing the gentlemen whom I only know across the table from me in negotiating for wages and conditions for employees.  They have been very tough and very fair.  I have no experience of how they carry out their other duties but I shall take the word of Deputy Andrews and other Deputies who say they have been very humane.  Might I ask the Minister to be as humane as these gentlemen apparently are and to ensure that not alone will those three be looked after but that any employee of the Dublin Health Authority who might be displaced because of this move will also be considered.</P>
      <P>I have had too much experience in my own particular field of provisions which are not really provisions.  No matter what provision is there I want the Minister personally to ensure that the person who has £6,000 a year and the person who has £15 a week are dealt with in the same way and that their interests will be looked after.  Do not let us have provisions which turn out afterwards to be going only half the way.  We remember transfers which took place and which looked after those on the top of the pile and left the men who were depending on a week's wages without a job.  A few hundred pounds compensation is no use to a worker if he cannot find employment again.  I am not being quarrelsome about it but I want the Minister to ensure that provision is made for all the employees if and when this section comes into operation.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and agreement should be reached with the trade unions or the organisations dealing with these matters, so I do not think Deputy Tully need worry about this.  In regard to the amendments, first of all, I should like to say how glad I am to hear these tributes to these three officers of the Dublin Health Authority.  This goes far to contradict the cynical cries one hears outside this House about the appealing evils of bureaucracy, as though it existed everywhere in this country.</P>
      <P>No doubt, we have some bureaucratic deficiencies but I am glad to hear, in connection with these three officers, the very high tributes paid by Deputies from all sides of the House about the conduct of the Dublin Health Authority.  Mr. O'Keeffe's post in the Dublin Health Authority is that of chief executive officer.  His office is not the same as that of the chief executive officer of a health board as provided for in section 12 of the Bill.  The chief executive of the Dublin Health Authority is the city manager, Mr. Macken. Mr. O'Keeffe's position is analogous to that of an assistant city manager performing functions delegated to him by Mr. Macken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 38 (2) (d) of the Bill it is required that Mr. O'Keeffe be transferred to an office, similar to his present office, with the same remuneration, the same superannuation rights and the same status.  This means that his status within the new administration would be at the level immediately under that of the chief executive officer, who would correspond to Mr. Macken in the new health board and that, I <Col N="1985" /> might say, is of course if Mr. O'Keeffe is not the person selected at the Local Appointments Commission examination for the position of chief executive officer.  I can guarantee to the House I will make the order in the manner in which I have said.</P>
    <P>Exactly the same will apply to Mr. Nolan and Mr. Lamb.  They will be transferred to similar offices under the eastern health board.  This position does not arise only in the Dublin area. There is an assistant manager in the Cork Health Authority who works under the city manager; there is a secretary to the Cork Health Authority in addition to the assistant manager; there is a secretary to the Waterford Health Authority; and there is also a secretary to the Limerick Health Authority.</P>

I can guarantee, and I can promise the House when the orders for these are made, that they will include arrangements for these transfers and that none of them will lose remuneration or superannuation in the transfer. I hope I have now fully explained the position.  I consider the amendment for these reasons is unnecessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Burke, I do not think the Minister's remarks are good enough, with respect.  There are a number of things which cause us concern.  The truth is that at the moment Mr. O'Keeffe is the effective head of the Dublin Health Authority, his position is equivalent to that of assistant city manager, as the Minister has said, but, in fact, he is the senior assistant city manager.  The assistant chief executive officer was recruited to the health authority in another Act.  It seems to me that a difficulty arises now in relation to what the Minister proposes.  He has said he proposes to transfer these people under section 33 (2) (d) to what he says are similar offices under the relevant health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's contention is that their similar offices under the new Health Bill will be that Mr. O'Keeffe, <Col N="1986" /> who is the chief executive officer, and the deputy of the health authority, will become the second in command; that Mr. Nolan, who is the deputy head of the health authority, will become the third in command; and that the present secretary of the health authority will be the secretary of the new health board in the Dublin region.  It would appear then that we are to have something in the nature of three heads, unless some of these people are successful applicants through the Local Appointments Commission&mdash;if I have understood the Minister correctly&mdash;for the appointment of head of the new health board.</P>
    <P>I think it is unfair to ask these people to be processed through the Local Appointments Commission for these positions, certainly in the Dublin region, and I say that for many reasons.  We are unanimous, and I am delighted the Minister has interpreted this unanimity for what it means, in praising the officers concerned for their efficiency and humanity.  Indeed, perhaps, one of the reasons why the Department is apparently dragging its feet on the question of appointing them to these senior posts is because their humanitarian outlook might sometimes stretch the elasticity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that there is an anxiety to enforce stricter control which will run contrary to the humanitarian concepts which have operated most successfully in the Dublin Health Authority. It is the anxiety of all who have served on the Dublin Health Authority to maintain the happy position which has operated up to now.  It is because the health authority has confidence in their offices that this amendment was tabled with the support of all parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another good reason why these people should be left in command is that the Dublin Health Authority area, on this year's accounts, is spending practically £13 million on their health services and the only change is that it is now proposed to add to that area the areas of Kildare and Wicklow which are together spending only £2 million.  The Dublin Health Authority region is already spending over six <Col N="1987" /> times more than the two smaller regions which are to be attached to it.  The increase, if I may use the Minister's word, is nugatory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Burke would only listen to me the point I am making is that these three people are already successfully administering a health authority which is spending £13 million. Deputy Burke is one with me on that, is he not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only change, as far as the Dublin region is concerned, is that the £2 million spent in Wicklow and Kildare a considerable part of which was spent in the Dublin region anyway is to be added to the £13 million already spent by the Dublin Health Authority.  At the moment the expenditure of this £13 million relates to expenditure in 59 hospitals in Dublin city, county and Dún Laoghaire.  There is £2 million being spent in hospitals in Wicklow and Kildare, which, and I say this with no disrespect, are not comparable to most of the hospitals in the Dublin region.  The position is that here we have three officers successfully administering what will in effect be nine-tenths or more of the new health authority expenditure.  Does Deputy Burke see that I am not making a partisan argument?  I am making one which supports all we are saying and I am making it on the basis of the efficiency of the people who have successfully done this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is true to say that there were many doubts on all sides of the House when the Dublin Health Authority was amalgamated because it was felt it would become too big and that it would not operate successfully. I have some reservations about this new proposal.  I think we are going too far and that this may be the last straw which will break the camel's back.  The fact is we have three people who most successfully amalgamated these areas. They are in the prime of their life. There are many years ahead of them. It is in the public interest, apart from <Col N="1988" /> what we should consider, the interests of the three men concerned, that they should be given the three most senior offices under the new region.</P>
    <P>Again, I give a final figure to support my argument, the figure of population.  The population of the region at present covered by the Dublin Health Authority is practically 800,000 and the population in Kildare and Wicklow is 126,000.  So, again, these three men are successfully operating a health service, within existing rules, in the Dublin region for a population which is almost seven times greater than it is proposed to introduce.  All these things point to the correctness of providing that these three officers should be appointed to these positions.  They are in most responsible positions and they are in them because they were successful in their applications through the Local Appointments Commissioners and they were appointed by the Local Appointments Commissioners to these positions.  People who have done that and who have been successful in their posts should not be required because of a minor change in the area of their authority to again submit themselves to the process of the Local Appointments Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Of course, it could be argued that if they were all that successful they would probably be successful through the commissioners but there could be many other qualifications which could be imposed in the conditions of service which might eliminate them and that would be unfair.</P>
    <P>To my colleagues on both sides who suggested, as an alternative, compensation for these men I say the law already provides for compensation but no man in the prime of his life, if he is worth a damn, is looking for compensation and I do not believe that these men are.  I am a member of the health authority but the Minister for Local Government will not allow me to exercise my functions as such at the moment and, therefore, I was not a party to any discussions which occurred in relation to this but I speak out of conviction about the fairness of the argument.  I speak out of a knowledge of these men and out of what I would <Col N="1989" /> say was a personal revelation to me. I was and still am extremely critical of health services.</P>
    <P>I suspected before I became a member of the health authority that there were bureaucrats in the health authority who were out of sympathy with the unfortunate people whom I would like to see helped.  But I can say, having had the experience of being on the health authority, that these three officers and, indeed, all the officers and staff of the Dublin Health Authority, are passionately anxious to come to the assistance of every person who is requiring medical and social attention and they work far beyond the call of duty.  Again and again I have been amazed at the large number of members of the Dublin Health Authority staff that I have seen on innumerable occasions in what should be their time off attending to carry out charitable works.  This is the kind of mettle of which these men are made and it would be churlish, indeed, if we were not to recognise it and to pass this section without securing them in the principal positions in the new health board, securing it because they are personally entitled to it and also because, I believe, the people in the region would benefit by having such experienced men there.</P>
    <P>Finally, may I assure our colleagues in the Labour Party that we will certainly be giving our full support to the amendment in the name of Deputy Desmond and others to provide that the conditions of employment of existing officers and servants shall not be worsened.  You are going to worsen the conditions of employment if you demote them in status, as you will if you do not give them the positions in the new health boards that this amendment seeks to secure for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like very briefly to put on record my support and the support of my party for amendment No. 32a.  I do not think the amendment requires any very special pleading, nor, indeed, that it requires any parliamentary backscratching between Deputy Ryan and ourselves in relation to the much more fundamental amendment, No. 41a, <Col N="1990" /> namely, that there should be no worsening of the conditions of employment of anybody, be he a senior executive or a junior executive officer or of even the lowest of categories and grades of employment in any organisation in this type of transitional rationalisation which is being generally supported in the House.  I, therefore feel that amendment No. 32a is worthy of full support.  It is a matter of elementary justice, a matter of the continuation of executive status all ready devolved on these men by the Local Appointments Commissioner, and which should be confirmed with out any ambiguity or any equivocatior on the part of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The House is entitled to get this confirmation.  Otherwise there may be very considerable difficulty in future when we set out to rationalise, as we must, local government and other social services, including the educational service.  Then you will get a backlash if you do not concede this principle. When we indulge in the necessary exercises in the four years ahead of this House, I am afraid the good faith of the senior officers of these Departments and of these essential services will be very much eroded and public confidence will be reduced unless we get this basic assurance from the Minister at this time.</P>

      <P>First, I want to thank the Minister for going the distance he has gone to meet us here. Mr. O'Keeffe is a CEO who has let promotional opportunities in other spheres go by.  He is a very efficient officer.  He was assistant city and county manager.  He was an officer in the Army.  He got this job and became very dedicated to matters concerning the health of the people.  He is the only CEO in the Twenty-Six Counties.  There are secretaries in other health authorities. I think the Minister said there was an assistant manager in Cork.  My colleague and I have been discussing this section.  I would suggest that the words in section 33, line 2, &ldquo;an order under this section may include provisions...&rdquo; should be replaced by the words &ldquo;an order under this section will include provisions&rdquo;.  That would make it more definite.  &ldquo;May&rdquo; is a word that <Col N="1991" /> can be discussed in the law courts and might give a discretion, not only to this Minister, but to succeeding Ministers, or it may be variously interpreted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Lamb and Mr. Nolan would be promoted in the ordinary way in the same line of office. They will hold the same relationship to Mr. O'Keeffe.  If he succeeds, as I hope he will, in being appointed chief executive officer by the Local Appointments Commission, it is inconceivable that Mr. Lamb and Mr. Nolan would not move up in a corresponding relationship to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that a number of these situations will arise all over the country in health authorities <Col N="1992" /> and pressure will inevitably be brought to bear.  We could have a situation in which the senior county manager in a group, with the longest service, would have a pre-empted right to becoming the chief executive officer and I simply could not have these precedents created as a result of the suggestion in this amendment.  I do not know whether Deputies are aware of the operations of the Local Appointments Commission&mdash;I am sure they know much more about it than I do&mdash;but I imagine the officers concerned would have a very, very good chance of being appointed.  If Mr. O'Keeffe is as able as he is said to be by Deputies it seems very unlikely he would not be appointed chief executive officer by the Local Appointments Commission.  The more Deputies speak in favour of him the more likely he is to hold the position as the person best qualified and most experienced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nobody in the country in a comparable position. I want to make that quite clear.  There is no other health authority with a whole-time chief executive officer.  It is somewhat humiliating that a man who was, for quite a period, assistant city and county manager, in charge of County Dublin&mdash;he was, in fact, manager of County Dublin County Council and, subsequent to that, he was senior city and county manager in charge of the health services; he took over the health services of seven boards&mdash;should now have to go before the Local Appointments Commission, as will also Mr. Nolan and Mr. Lamb. Quite frankly, I do not know how the Minister could get a Local Appointments Commission competent to decide.</P>

The senior county manager, or any other county manager, elsewhere in the country would not have the same right as Mr. O'Keeffe because he is not a full-time health official.  That is how Mr. O'Keeffe can be described and he is the only official in the country in that position.

    <P>(2)  All property transferred by subsection (1) to a health board which, immediately before the commencement of section 6, was standing in the books of any bank or was registered in the books of any bank, corporation or company in the name of a local authority shall, on the request of the health board made at any time after such commencement, be transferred in the books by the bank, corporation or company into the name of the health board.</P>
    <P>(3)  Every chose-in-action transferred by subsection (1) to a health board may, after the commencement of this section, be sued on, recovered, or enforced by the health board in its own name and it shall not be necessary for the board to give notice to the person bound by the chose-in-action of the transfer effected by that subsection.</P>

    <P>(5)  After the commencement of <Col N="1996" /> this section, every rule and regulation lawfully made by a local authority which was in force immediately before such commencement and which related solely to services to be transferred on the commencement of section 6 to the health board shall, so far as it is not inconsistent with this Act, continue in force and have effect as a rule or regulation made on such commencement by the health board for the residue then unexpired of the period and in respect of the area for and in respect of which the same was actually made by the local authority and, accordingly, every such rule and regulation may be continued, varied or revoked, and penalties and forfeitures arising thereunder before or after such commencement may be recovered and enforced by the health board in the like manner and as fully as the same could have been continued, varied, revoked, recovered or enforced by the local authority if this Act had not been passed.</P>
    <P>(6)  After the commencement of this section, every resolution passed, order made, and notice served by a local authority before such commencement, the operation, effect or term of which had not ceased or expired before such commencement (being a resolution, order or notice relating solely to services to be transferred on the commencement of section 6 to the health board) shall, so far as it is not inconsistent with this Act, continue in force and have effect as if it were a resolution passed, order made, or notice served by the health board on the date on which the same was actually passed, made or served by the local authority and as if the functions of the health authority were on that date performable by the health board.</P>

    <P>the Minister shall nominate the health board to which the transfer is to be made, and references in this section to a health board shall be construed accordingly in relation to that property.</P>
    <P>(10)  The Minister may by order provide for the transfer of any specified health institution to a regional hospital board and may in such order provide for the application of any provision of this section to such transfer in the same way as it applies to a transfer to a health board.</P>

      <P>It is said that personal cases make bad law but where I work I would find myself on the border of two new health districts.  I understand that the approach to this will be that if there is not a doctor in the convenient area, a doctor who opts to work with the health board may be compelled to take patients from a district within a certain distance, which may be within six or ten miles, and that he may be forced to take all patients on his panel.  I know of other doctors to whom this would also apply.  I do not wish to force a decision on the Minister but I would just like to air the problems.  It may be one for discussion with the Medical Association and the Medical Union.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can take it up with the Medical Union but the position is that there is ample provision in the Health Bill&mdash;I forget exactly which section&mdash;so that dispensary medical officers can work for two health districts on a shared basis or an arranged basis.  Quite obviously, where there are boundaries there will be some anomalous situations.</P>

      <P>To add to the section the following new subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(8)  The conditions of employment of existing officers and servants to be transferred to health boards shall not be worsened.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I move this amendment because of my concern to ensure that the conditions of employment of existing officers in the service who are to be transferred to health boards shall not be worsened.  The Minister has given an assurance on this already but we would like it inserted in the Bill.  This amendment would ensure that the conditions of officers and servants will not be worsened.  Servants and workers under the health board may find their duties and the conditions of employment worsened very much.  It is to prevent this happening that we tabled this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this at considerable length before.  It is inconceivable within the present age that the position of officers and servants could be noticeably or visibly worsened.  I look forward to the completion of the negotiations that are being worked out in the Department of Local Government for a conciliation and arbitration scheme which will be of a more modern type than that involved at present and which would <Col N="2002" /> provide for conditions of employment as well as for remuneration.  I gave the assurances about that; that this scheme is being worked out; that there would be a special joint council representing the health boards.  As the Deputy knows, the present position is that existing officers' duties are decided by the manager of a local authority from time to time and there is an appeal to me.  Therefore, again, simply in the ordinary process of democracy, I should really be in desperate trouble in this House if the position of some officer or servant had quite clearly been worsened.  When officers are transferred, sometimes there could be what might be described as disagreement on what constitutes worsening.  The officer might think his position was worsened when, on the other hand, three out of five people would say it was not worsened, that his work was just as agreeable or demanding.  His pay would be the same, in any event. There would be no question of a reduction in pay.  It is inconceivable that I, as Minister, would give a series of decisions which would have the effect of really worsening the position of these people.  One can imagine the questions I should have to answer in this House.  I think I can be relied on to take the right point of view in regard to this.  There is the special joint council which will operate during the period when the transfers take place and the trade unions concerned can use their full authority in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me it is a very poor reflection on local authorities, on unions and on everybody concerned to have to write in something like this.  I can conceive of no situation which could demand it. In subsection (5) of this section it is implied, in any transfer of people from the authority, that, if there is anything wrong or if their conditions of service are in any way worsened, there is an appeal to the Minister.  Apart from the appeal to the Minister, their associations and unions are composed of reasonably well-educated men.  I can see nothing happening that would worsen a situation.  To write it into an Act seems to express a grave doubt as to the good intentions of all the people <Col N="2003" /> concerned in this measure.  Honestly, I do not think it is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Contrary to what Deputy Lenihan says, it has happened that it has been written into Acts before. Perhaps we have progressed&mdash;I hope we have progressed socially since then &mdash;to a point where it no longer, perhaps, is absolutely necessary to write this into legislative form.  If my memory serves me correctly, in the Act which amalgamated the old National Health Insurance Board with the Department of Health, there was a provision that the conditions of service would not be worsened.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1945-47 period.  I had not reached the age of political maturity then.  But this is my recollection. I was reminded of it since by some people who felt that their statutory rights had been infringed.  One of the terms of promotion in the Civil Service was, of course, fluency in the Irish language.  The old National Health Insurance Board did not have this Irish language requirement.  People in the employment of the Department of Health and of the Department of Social Welfare found themselves under an obligation to undergo tests in Irish for promotion which they would not have been obliged to undergo if they had been in the old National Health Insurance Board.</P>
      <P>Another condition for promotion imposed by the Department was that officers had to serve for a period in employment exchanges in different parts of the country.  This again was not a condition of service in the old National Health Insurance Board and, because of the provision in the legislation at the time, this condition which the Department sought to impose was only of short duration.  I can see a certain wisdom in the amendment and we in Fine Gael gladly support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, if you want another precedent, if my memory serves me right &mdash;and nobody would be better than the Tánaiste to confirm or contradict this&mdash;we have had a provision in transport legislation that conditions of <Col N="2004" /> service would not be worsened and that, if people felt they were worsened, they had certain rights of appeal to have compensation provisions, and so on, determined.  Perhaps it was not in the legislation but in the regulations made under it but certainly it had something in the nature of statutory enforcement.  I cannot see that there is anything wrong in writing into the Bill something which the Minister and his colleagues say will, in practice, operate. Why not state in a Bill what we all agree should operate?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Transport Act, there was an appeal to an arbitrator if there was worsening of conditions in his transfer.  The arbitrator in this case is the Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation has changed very much since then.  Officers and servants of local authorities are very well represented by their organisations, by the local authority representatives and by the people on the new regional health boards.  It seems to me inconceivable in this modern age that this situation has not entirely changed. I have given an assurance in regard to this matter.  I have given an assurance that, if any appeal is made to me, and if there is any obvious worsening of conditions as a result of a decision, I would accept the appeal of the officer or servant concerned.  I want to limit that statement by saying that, as the House knows, what constitutes worsening of conditions in the sense of what might be described as absolute details of work that a person does, is a matter about which there will always be opinions.  In other words, some servant&mdash;it is a terrible term but still it is in use in the Act&mdash;of a health board might be moved to some kind of position where he would think his position was worsened, although perhaps three out of five people in this House, asked to judge the case, would say it was not worsened.  If there was any obvious worsening of his or her position, I would naturally see to it that the appeal against such a worsening was upheld. <Col N="2005" /> I cannot do more than that.  In connection with appeals that have been brought under the previous Health Acts, I think there has not been any great complaint about the action of my predecessor or his predecessor in regard to people.  I do not recall many Parliamentary Questions over the years on this matter.  I hope I can continue the same tradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are responsible for this.  We accept the situation now. However, we have an obligation to write this into this Bill.  Many questions may not occur to us at the present time. I cannot see the objection of the Minister to writing this in.  There may be the case that with the extension of this board, a man may be asked to travel 40 miles.  He may be transferred, within the area, maybe 40 or 50 miles away. Would the Minister consider that that was worsening the conditions of his employment?  These are just isolated cases.  Why can we not write that into this Bill?  That is what I should like to know.  The Minister says, in effect: &ldquo;I do not like this now.  Well, in this day and age, there is no need to do it.&rdquo;  We are trying to produce a Bill that is in the best interests of the public.  This amendment ensures this.  I do not think it will create problems.  Write this into this Bill and everyone will be very happy.  I do not think it is wrong to do this.  If the Minister is so sure, why does he not accept it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>As one with over 20 years experience in health and local administration, and while appreciating the anxiety of those who wish&mdash;as we all would, indeed&mdash;that no worsening of conditions would appertain to any employee, I think the Minister is right. If we write it in, there is a suggestion <Col N="2006" /> that they could be worsened and that this is put in to protect some people. To protect some people from what? Are we to take it that this is to be put in to protect some people from the local administrators, the majority of whom are public representatives who would be most anxious, in my experience, no matter to what party one might belong, jealously to safeguard the interests of the humblest worker?  He has only to come to a public representative, as I am sure Deputy O'Connell knows, to see that his case will be ventilated.  But, if you had a bit of a crank or a crackpot, or if the situation in the area was such that the chairman needed, even for a temporary period, the direction of an official or a medical officer, then surely the public representatives should be given enough freedom to exercise their right.  While allowing the person the right of appeal we should at the same time give them some latitude.  I say this because I have never known&mdash;and things have greatly improved since the time Deputy Ryan was speaking of&mdash; of any man, from the highest to the lowest, who had a real grievance that went unheard, or whose case was not met fairly by the representatives.  In the old days the public representatives perhaps did not have as great a say in the matter as they will have under this Bill.  Therefore, I believe the fears of those people are unfounded.  I say that in all sincerity.  I do not believe there is the slightest fear of this happening in the future.</P>
