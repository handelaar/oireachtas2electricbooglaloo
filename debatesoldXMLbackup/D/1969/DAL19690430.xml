    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach what is the attitude of the Govment towards voluntary community development organisations; and whether he proposes to take any steps to formulate plans whereby those organisations could contribute more effectively to national, economic and social development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government welcome the co-operation of all voluntary groups working to promote community development.</P>
      <P>In the counties in which county development teams operate, their structure is such as to enable them to co-ordinate effectively the efforts of local, official and private groups in the task of economic development and to provide the appropriate machinery for the initial consideration of local ideas and schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout the country, the local authorities are particularly fitted to give form and support to local voluntary enterprise.  They have specific power under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, to help local development associations and similar bodies in money or kind, or by the provision of services and facilities (including the services of staff).  Certain organisations, concerned with aspects of community development, work in close co-operation <Col N="170" /> with Departments of State at local level.  A number of these organisations receive grants from State funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's reply, I should like to ask the Taoiseach if he is aware that the term &ldquo;community development&rdquo; in its modern connotation is now recognised in many countries, particularly underdeveloped countries, as being a very important instrument of economic and social progress?  Is the Taoiseach further aware there is widespread dissatisfaction and criticism in this country among people engaged in voluntary and local activities at the negative attitude of the Government towards community organisation and that this criticism and dissatisfaction was highlighted on recent occasions by such people as His Lordship, the Bishop of Killaloe, and most recently by Fr. McDyer?  Could the Taoiseach say why his Government have ignored for so long the potential in these organisations and whether or not it is proposed to organise and co-ordinate the activities of these organisations along the lines that other countries have done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that community development is in fact an important factor in the promotion of economic and social development throughout the country.  I can assure the Deputy that the Government are fully conscious of that fact and quite recently he will be aware that the Minister for Health asked local authorities to increase the assistance which is available from local authorities, with a subvention from the central authority, to community development, especially in the health field.  I am aware, too, of the statements to which he has referred. I do not think Fr. McDyer has much to complain about in relation to the kind of assistance he has got from time to time and from this Government in the many schemes which have emanated from his fertile mind.  I myself have personal experience of working with him as far back as 15 or 16 years ago when assistance was given to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Further arising out of the Taoiseach's reply, is he not aware that an international community <Col N="171" /> development seminar was held at Gormanston College in 1960?  The report of this seminar was published in a very bulky document.  Is the Taoiseach aware that the then Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, intimated it was the Government's intention to apply the principles of community development on a national basis and in a more effective way and that since 1962 nothing seems to have been done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Government's intention to continue the co-operation and assistance that has been given in the past but I would like to alert the Deputy mind to the fact that spontaneity and local community effort would be damped down if there was too much official imposition on it.  I think what is necessary is that that spontaneity and local effort should be encouraged rather than supplanted by official effort and the official assistance that is being given and is increasing every year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the total imports from France during the year ended 31st January, 1969; the exports to France for the same period; and what action is contemplated by the Government to correct this imbalance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>During the year ended the 31st January, 1969, imports from France amounted to £15.7 million and exports totalled £9.7 million.</P>
      <P>In the case of countries with which we have an adverse trade balance it is our constant aim to improve the position by encouraging the expansion of exports.</P>
      <P>As regards trade in agricultural products, I would refer the Deputy to the reply given yesterday by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to a Question about the export of agricultural products to France and Germany.</P>
      <P>There is available to exporters, as the Deputy must be aware, a comprehensive system of grants, incentives and services from State sources, to encourage and assist increased exports. Córas Tráchtála Teoranta, the Government agency primarily responsible for export promotion, has recently made available additional incentives and services in order to stimulate further exports to markets, including France, other than Britain.  I hope that the additional incentives which the Government have made available will encourage Irish manufacturers and exporters to increase their efforts to expand their exports to such countries as France.</P>
      <P>Our Embassy in Paris will continue to make itself fully available to assist Irish exporters interested in the French market and a senior officer of the Embassy is, in fact, engaged full-time on the promotion of trade and other foreign earnings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach not admit that this adverse trade balance of £6 million with France, plus the increasing adverse trade balance with other European countries, is a serious handicap to our economic progress at the present time?  Will he not admit that the time has come to tell those countries we are prepared to deal with them on the barter system, or not at all?  Will the Taoiseach not further admit that much of the imports from France at the present time could be produced at home and that these increased imports are doing untold <Col N="173" /> harm to the people here who should be employed in our own factories?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been taking effective steps recently in bringing home to countries with which we have an adverse trade balance the importance of their buying more from us. I do not agree at all that the bulk of the goods which we buy from France are such that we can produce them in our own country.  These include sulphur, machinery, maize, muriate of potash, and four or five items such as these constitute the bulk of our imports from France.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the population of County Leitrim in 1926, 1956 and at the latest available date; and if there are plans under consideration designed to halt the decline taking place as a result of emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The following are particulars of the population of County Leitrim according to the censuses of 1926, 1956 and 1966: 1926, 55,907; 1956, 37,056; 1966, 30,572.  The plans concerning Connaught, to which I referred in my reply to the Deputy on the 23rd April, apply in full measure to County Leitrim.  I have in mind, particularly, the special farrowed sow subsidy scheme, increased piggery grants, the mountain lamb subsidy scheme, the higher rates of grant under the Land Project in western areas, the Small Farm (Incentive Bonus) Scheme and the new Beef Cattle Incentive Scheme.</P>
      <P>The Government also provides valuable facilities through the Industrial Development Authority to encourage the establishment and development of industries.  Of particular value to Leitrim and the other western counties is the Small Industries Programme, as the rate of grant is weighted in favour of such counties.  The Regional Development Fund provides supplementary financial assistance towards the development of desirable projects in the western areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not now admit that over 1,000 people a year have emigrated from Leitrim since Fianna Fáil came into <Col N="174" /> office?  Will he not further admit that the incentives that they are giving to keep the people in the west up to the present time have been a failure?  Have the Government any plans to try to keep the people in the counties like Leitrim in the future, or have they lost all hope in the west?</P>

    <P>One of the main aims of the Government's agricultural policy is to maintain the maximum number on the <Col N="175" /> land consistent with social and economic progress, and the various Government measures in support of agriculture&mdash;an up-to-date outline of which is contained in the section on western development in the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development &mdash;are of particular benefit to south-west Cork.  One of the five fishing harbours being provided under our fishery development scheme is Castletownbere.</P>
    <P>As announced yesterday, a new pilot development area to be set up under the aegis of the West Cork Development Team is expected to bring invaluable benefits to the area.</P>
    <P>Commitments to date from the special Regional Development Fund set up by the Government in 1967 include, for the west Cork area, assistance towards the development of a vegetable co-operative giving employment to approximately 100 workers and involving 400 local growers, and the provision of a cable-car from the mainland to Dursey Island to provide transport for the islanders and for tourists.</P>
    <P>The Government provides valuable facilities through the Industrial Development Authority to encourage the establishment and development of industries. At present, there are 16 proposals before the authority for new industries, or extension of existing ones, in south-west Cork.</P>
    <P>In regard to tourism, there are 12 proposals for new hotels in the area at a capital investment of over £800,000. Apart from the direct labour content of the construction work, the hotels&mdash; when open&mdash;are expected to provide additional employment for about 300.</P>

      <P>In relation to the increase in unemployment in Bantry, is this not due to the completion of the Whiddy oil terminal project and is it not true that this will be more than compensated for by the new industries that are going to Bantry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some increase in the unemployment content at Bantry as it appears on the employment register.  It is considered to be due to the laying-off of workers on completion <Col N="176" /> or near completion of the terminal at Bantry.  I am more than confident that the proposals, both industry-wise and tourist-wise, that are now in the pipeline will more than offset any decline. In fact, they will take up much of the unemployment that is there now.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether enough attention is given to attracting Irish dentists in Britain back to Ireland in view of the emphasis given in Local Appointment Commission advertising to knowledge of Irish as an aid to appointment and the fact that very often dentists who apply from Britain are given only seven days notice of the date for interview.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Special attention is given to this matter.  The Commission advertises, in Britain, dental surgeon vacancies with a view to bringing them to the notice of Irish nationals resident there.  These vacancies are advertised in groups, when possible.  This is a help to candidates in Britain as one attendance for interview is then sufficient for a candidate applying for vacancies in several areas.  Several Irish dentists from Britain and the Six Counties were recruited last year, for example, and it is hoped to recruit more this year.</P>
      <P>Candidates, including those from Britain, are usually given at least two weeks notice of the date of interview.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>As I explained to the House on 12th November last in reply to questions in connection with the B &amp; I Company's announcement of its decision to increase freight charges for cattle from 47s per head to 72s as from 1st January, 1969, the company had sustained heavy losses on their livestock carrying. These losses are still continuing. The proposed increase of 25s per head at that time was that calculated by the company to be necessary to enable the revised livestock services to be operated on a break-even basis without profit or loss.  The decision was taken by the company in pursuance of their mandate to operate on a sound commercial basis and my approval was not required.  However, in order to mitigate the impact of the increase on the livestock trade, I asked the company to examine the possibility of phasing the increase.  The company in the circumstances deferred implementation of the proposed increase.  The increase effected as from 21st April amounts to 16s per head.  The company has decided to defer further the implementation of the full increase of 25s a head originally proposed.</P>
      <P>I should point out that of the increase of 16s per head effected as from 21st April, 10s was the re-imposition of a reduction of that amount made by the company on 1st April, 1968.  The overall increase as compared with the rate operative in March, 1968 is therefore 6s per head.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that a comparison of the home market price and freight rates for store cattle shows that as between December, 1966, and the present time, market prices have increased by 39 per cent as against an increase of 21 per cent in the Company's freight rates.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Deputy's information, this whole matter has been under discussion in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and through frequent meetings with all the livestock trade associations for some months.  It is due to a habit which is now prevailing all over Europe of concentrating certain kinds of traffic through one port.  As the Deputy knows, there has been a very substantial change made in British Railways with regard to the carriage of cattle. They have ceased to use Fishguard. Cattle going from Waterford go to Holyhead.  Cattle going from Dublin also go to Holyhead.  The B &amp; I was faced with the situation that rail wagons were no longer available at Birkenhead.  This has resulted in an inevitable loss of traffic to the B &amp; I and this was greater than anticipated. Even though the rate was reduced by 10s in April of last year in the hope of maintaining the traffic the service continued to lose ground because of the preference of cattle-dealers for rail borne traffic for cattle when they reach an English port.</P>
      <P>There has been this very substantial change.  The B &amp; I have still in the first quarter of the year continued to lose traffic, although the service is satisfactory and the ships suitable for cattle. It is due to their inability to obtain rail wagons at Birkenhead.  The position is continuously under review.  All I can say is that the B &amp; I are providing an alternative service to British Railways service, which has shown such traumatic changes in the last 12 or 18 months, and it is essential that the B &amp; I provide an alternative service.  If during the current year they lose something in the neighbourhood of £160,000 on cattle carrying, it will have to be offset by any profit they can make on the more profitable ventures&mdash;which I do not believe will be so offset.  They may be making a contribution but I think the livestock trade understands the position which is still under continuous examination as between the two companies concerned and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the livestock trade.</P>

      <P>I cannot say if it is doomed to failure.  They got about 20,000 cattle in the first quarter of the year but it was less than they anticipated. They cannot compel British Railways to supply rail wagons in Birkenhead and that is the position.  As I have said, the situation is a changing one and will be examined in the light of providing the best possible service.  It would be unreasonable to ask the B &amp; I to make losses that would make them unable to remunerate the capital they have raised themselves without any State guarantee or any State intervention, and so the position will be examined in that light.</P>

      <P>We have regard to the social implications of the telephone service.  A great number of the call offices throughout the country are uneconomic and lose money.  A great deal of the private service in the west of Ireland loses money and has to be subsidised by the more paying elements of the service.  We erect kiosks every year. We have at the moment 1,080 kiosks in provincial areas.  Each year there is a programme which is designed to give the best possible service under the circumstances. In actual fact, as I said to the House a few months ago, I am having this whole question examined to see if we should take further steps in the kiosk programme in order to carry out some of the requests made by Deputies for kiosks in areas where, perhaps, the reasons for not providing the kiosks from the economic point of view were marginal.  I am having the whole question examined.</P>

      <P>A survey made by An Bord Bainne in connection with the Cook-Sprague Report, which was published last year, showed that the total cost to creameries of transporting, receiving and separating milk and of churning butter varied considerably in accordance with the size of the plant. A creamery manufacturing less than 100 tons of butter per annum incurred a cost to point of sale of 8.05 pence per lb while the cost was 4.02 pence per lb in a creamery with an output of 2,400 tons per annum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of proposals.  There is one to reduce further the area of the women's prison. This, apart from providing 46 additional cells for St. Patrick's would provide an additional non-basement workshop and two additional areas, inside and outside the buildings for recreation. There is also a proposal to erect within the reduced area cell accommodation for a small number of female prisoners. This accommodation would be temporary pending the erection of a new female prison for which we are expecting a site to be available within two or three years.  The third proposal is to extend the area of the prison by enclosing the vacant ground adjoining Mountjoy Garda Station and to erect workshops on the added area.  It is proposed also to reduce the upper age limit of youths who may be sent to St. Patrick's from 21 to 19.  This would require legislation which I am having drafted to legalise the Shanganagh Institution.</P>

The present situation is deplorable. May I suggest to the Minister that he should consider transferring women prisoners to an open prison which might be purchased fairly readily on the open market and taking over that area forthwith not only for the purpose of providing additional cell accommodation but of giving space to provide workshops over which he and the rest of the House could conscientiously stand, which is not the position in regard to the present accommodation?</P>

      <P>I do not want to discuss it.  I want to explain the position in relation to it.  Amendment No. 5 was defeated and consequently, so far as we are concerned, we would prefer the Minister's amendment No. 6 to subsection (4) of the Bill as it stands.  If we succeeded in defeating the Minister's amendment the position would be that subsection (4) in the Bill would remain as it stands. While we do not think the Minister's amendment entirely acceptable, it is an improvement on subsection (4) and for that reason we agree to the Minister's amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (7).</P>
      <P>Subsection (7) reads:</P>
      <P>A member of the Garda Síochána may arrest without warrant a person whom he, with reasonable cause, suspects to be guilty of an offence under section 59 of this Act.</P>
      <P>In order to consider the effect of that subsection, and to get the meaning of the amendment, it is necessary, then, to turn to section 59, the section dealing with unlawful possession.  It reads:</P>
      <P>(1)  A person who knowingly and without lawful authority has in his possession or on his premises or conveys in any manner any thing obtained (whether by himself or any other person) in contravention of the criminal law shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
      <P>Where, on the hearing of a charge for an offence under this section, evidence is given of the circumstances in which the defendant was found in possession of or having on his premises or conveying the thing to which the charge relates, the court, if it considers it reasonable to do so, may accept that evidence as constituting by itself alone a <i>prima facie</i> case against the defendant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (7) of section 12 in effect says that in those circumstances set out in subsection (1) of section 59 a member of the Garda Síochána may arrest without warrant.  I referred to this matter in the course of the Second Reading discussion on the Bill and I have put down this amendment because it seems to me that the general power of arrest without warrant, which this subsection purports to give the Garda Síochána, is going a bit too far.  I think I know, and I think the House will appreciate, what the Minister has in mind in this subsection.  It is referred to in the Explanatory Memorandum as intended to replace a similar provision in the Criminal Justice Act, 1951.  The query <Col N="213" /> I raised on Second Reading and which has been raised by others is whether or not the phrasing of the subsection as it stands, and its relationship to section 59 of the Bill, do not carry further than is intended and do not in fact carry too far the power of arrest without warrant which is to be conferred on the Garda Síochána by virtue of this subsection.</P>
    <P>The case has been made that the subsection as it stands would empower a garda to arrest without warrant any person he suspects of being guilty of an offence under section 59: it is the possession of a thing obtained in contravention of the criminal law.  One point made in memoranda which were circulated, and which the Minister referred to in the booklet he published as a reply to critics, was that the words used in section 59 are &ldquo;any thing obtained&rdquo; without further defining what &ldquo;thing&rdquo; is or might be.  The Minister's reply to that, as I recall it rightly or wrongly, in the booklet he published was to the effect that, even in the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, the word &ldquo;thing&rdquo; was not further defined. As I say, the case has been made in the memoranda circulated by the Irish Association of Civil Liberty that, in fact, what we are doing or what it is proposed to do here greatly enlarges the existing law by saying, in effect, &ldquo;...any &lsquo;thing&rsquo; obtained (whether by the person being charged himself or by someone else) in contravention of the criminal law...&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The case is made that this power of arrest without warrant in these circumstances could mean that a garda, withcut a warrant, would be entitled to arrest a person on suspicion of having in his possession such a thing as a bottle of brandy which a relative might have brought from abroad some time before without having declared it at the customs.  It might even, by virtue of subsection (9) of section 12, then give power of forcible entry to premises or into that person's or any other person's home, again without warrant, in order to search or make an arrest.  It may be&mdash;I imagine it is&mdash; strictly intended by the Minister that the power of arrest without warrant being given in subsection (7) should be a replacement as nearly as possible of <Col N="214" /> the existing law&mdash;the existing law as contained in subsection (1) of section 13 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951.</P>
    <P>I move this amendment principally to ask the Minister to look carefully into the matter to see, to satisfy himself and to satisfy the House that in fact all he is doing here is remaining, so far as the criminal law is concerned, within the actual framework and within the actual power that exists under section 13 of the 1951 Act. If that is the position then there is nothing new and nothing novel in subsection (7) as it stands.  On the other hand, it has been argued, that there is here an extension of the powers, that there is here machinery for arresting people who may have stolen property in their possession.  Admittedly the word used in section 59 is &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo;, but then that is open to comment later when we come to deal with that section, and that they should have in their possession something which is obtained in contravention of the criminal law. My recollection is that the Minister, in reply to the question about a customs offence, said that this was a matter entirely for the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda did not enter into this, good, bad, or indifferent.  If that is the Minister's view of the law at present, I accept it.  I think that is the position and what is meant&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that that is the position but the query is: will it be so if subsection (7) passes because the argument has been made that, if it is passed, it will extend the authority of the Garda to arrest without warrant, even in the case of the bottle of brandy that was brought in from abroad without having been declared at the customs?  I know the Minister's view is that at the moment it does not and that it is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners, but my query is: if subsection (7) is passed unamended is it going to capture into its net circumstances such as that and confer power of arrest and subsequently power of search without warrant on the Garda?</P>

      <P>I said yesterday that this appeared to be a lawyer's Bill but that, while the lawyers knew more about it than anybody else, it was necessary for the ordinary layman to understand what is in the Bill, otherwise he would not know when he was breaking the law.  Even the Fourth Estate felt that it was a lawyer's Bill and reading some of the newspapers today it appears that they seemed to think it was a Bill which should be preserved entirely for legal comment. They seem to have missed the point in some of their comments.  We have to be very careful and the debate, if it is listened to, will bring out points to the ordinary layman which will show what he can do and what he can be committed for doing.  I may be misinterpreting this, and if I am perhaps the Minister will correct me, but subsection (7) states that &ldquo;a member of the Garda Síochána may arrest without warrant a person whom he, with reasonable cause, suspects to be guilty of an offence under section 59 of this Act&rdquo;.  What is section 59?  Does it relate to a very serious offence?  Section 59 states:</P>
      <P>A person who knowingly and without lawful authority has in his possession or on his premises or conveys in any manner any thing obtained (whether by himself or by any other person) in contravention of the criminal law shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
      <P>In other words, we are talking about the right of a garda to arrest a person for a relatively minor offence.  This is not a serious offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week the Minister was talking about the man who committed murder and that it was necessary to have the right for a garda to arrest him because he would be stepping on to the plane &mdash;it used to be on to the boat&mdash;and leaving the jurisdiction.  What is this for?  For something for which the maximum fine is £100 and the maximum sentence is six months imprisonment. <Col N="216" /> As I say, I am reading it as an ordinary layman would read it.  If this is in the existing law&mdash;I do not know whether or not it is&mdash;it is extraordinary, and if it is proposed to introduce it now for the first time into the law I think it is a mistake.  I believe it should be the other way round.  Nobody has or should have any respect for a receiver, somebody who is in possession of stolen goods.  The Minister may be rightly concerned with the petty criminals who would not be petty criminals but for the fact that they are able to dispose of their ill-gotten gains. Surely it should be possible, if somebody is in possession of a small amount of goods for which he can be sentenced to six months' imprisonment or fined £100, or fined and imprisoned, to get a warrant to have him arrested?  These people are not going to rush out of the country knowing that they have enough property or money with them on which to live in comfort for the rest of their lives.  This is a case where the right of arrest without a warrant should not be allowed, where it should be necessary for the garda to produce a warrant.  It is dealing with a relatively simple offence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, this is not a new provision; it is merely a re-enactment which is necessary by reason of the redrafting of the law proposed in section 59, with which we will deal later.  We have got to keep an eye on section 59 and to remember that the offence is a serious one, even if the value of the article is comparitively small.  The offence in section 59 involves a person who knowingly obtains or carries, virtually, stolen property or keeps it in his possession. It is something which is in contravention of the criminal law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know, smuggling is not a criminal offence. Importing banned books is not a criminal offence.  If we introduced prohibition and made the possession of alcoholic liquor a criminal offence, well and good, but so far as I know smuggling is not a criminal offence. I regard the possession, with knowledge, of goods obtained in contravention of the criminal law, not in contravention of the revenue regulations, as a serious offence.  In this subsection we are not dealing with receivers of stolen goods as much as the people who harbour them, who are giving them temporary accommodation while the thief is elsewhere.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that this is a re-enactment and not a new provision neither Deputy Tully nor anybody else has any reason for alarm. Granted, you cannot say definitely that a certain offence which is not now a criminal offence will never be one but that is a matter for the Oireachtas to keep an eye on, as I am sure it will.  As matters stand I am perfectly satisfied that if a member of the Garda Síochána has reasonable cause for believing that a person is improperly or knowingly in possession of stolen goods there is no good saying to him: &ldquo;Please go and find a peace commissioner and swear information and get a warrant for arrest.&rdquo;  The person in question will not be so obliging as to remain in the same place long enough.  It is quite obvious that the member of the Garda Síochána who has satisfied himself with reasonable cause that stolen property is being carried or retained by the suspected person must be entitled to arrest him at once. Otherwise, the chance would be gone.  There is really no cause for nervousness about this.  I hope it will be retained.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> When I read subsection (7) in conjunction with section 59 at first I did so with more or less a layman's mind and, like Deputy Tully, I thought it was very far reaching.  I wondered if it was wide enough to cover trivial offences which it was never intended should be covered.  I can see the necessity for a <Col N="218" /> provision such as this in the case of a person conveying stolen goods in a motor vehicle, a large or even a small quantity of stolen cigarettes or liquor or jewellery or anything else, when the goods are actually in transit.  If the vehicle is not intercepted and the goods obtained then it may not be possible to locate them later on.  I can see the necessity for this sort of provision in this sort of Bill but I think it is too wide as it stands.  I am not entirely satisfied that it does not cover the smuggled bottle of brandy.  I should like the Minister to make clear whether he does intend to cover the bottle of brandy or not.  I speak subject to correction but I think smuggling is regarded as a criminal offence.</P>

I understand the superior court held that because smuggling was regarded as a criminal offence the prosecutor did not have a right to appeal.

When I hear Deputies splitting hairs on a section of a Criminal Justice Bill and one Deputy making a reasonably forceful argument that it is undesirable and a Deputy from the Minister's side making an argument to justify the section, I say it is time to clarify it.  That is what we are here to do.  It is not fair that it should be let loose on the country and that innumerable people in lowly circumstances, not in a position to bring this to the superior courts to have it clarified, should be in doubt. Does the Minister intend that this should apply to the bottle of poteen?  If <Col N="220" /> he does not, is poteen-making or distilling or trafficking in poteen within the criminal code?  Or, is it in the same category as the offence of smuggling?</P>
      <P>It appears to me that the subsection is another extension of the right to arrest without warrant where it is not altogether necessary.  It is a very wide section and it is loose.  I think section 59 is meant to be an all-embracing section...&ldquo;has in his possession anything obtained in contravention of the criminal law.&rdquo;  That covers anything from a needle to an anchor.  In some sections of the Bill the right to arrest is governed by the seriousness of the offence and in several sections the seriousness is measured by the punishment applicable to the offence, whether it is five years' penal servitude or five years' imprisonment.  But here it could happen that the arrest without warrant would apply in the most trivial case. That is a move in the wrong direction. I should particularly like the Minister to clarify the case I spoke about which went to the High Court as to whether the prosecutor in a smuggling case had the right to appeal.  I think it was decided that he had not on the grounds that it was a criminal offence.</P>

      <P>Whatever Deputies may think about the details of section 59, one thing beyond dispute is that it is designed to replace section 13 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, dealing with unlawful possession.  This is the purpose of the section.  The section in the 1951 Act has proved to be technically defective and the new section is essential.  If Deputies have any criticism to make I suggest the appropriate place is on section 59 when we reach it rather than on this subsection because the power of summary arrest is absolutely essential to the operation of the section not only in some cases but in the vast majority of cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When dealing with this subsection I do not want to become bogged down in details of section 59 but this is a section that is quite important in the day-to-day, or, if you like, the night-to-night, work of the Garda in the detection and prevention of crimes.  It applies to the sort of case where a garda in the small hours of the morning finds a man <Col N="221" /> furtively conveying, say, half-a-dozen transistor radios or a couple of cameras or perhaps a few thousand cigarettes. The problem is that very often the owners of these goods cannot be identified. The law of larceny as it stands&mdash; I hope to change this at some stage&mdash; makes it extremely difficult to stand over a straightforward charge of larceny even if the man were willing to admit having stolen the articles found on him.  Sometimes he may genuinely be unable to help in the identification of the owner and, in a situation like this, a summary power of arrest is essential if the Garda are to be able to do their job at all. For instance a man caught at three or four o'clock in the morning with a number of transistor radios or perhaps a couple of overcoats may have stolen the articles from cars and it is likely that he will not know who the owners are.  As all lawyer Deputies will appreciate, it is essential, under the law of larceny, to prove ownership of goods.  That is an anacronism in this day and age but, at all events, it is the law of this land and it creates these particular difficulties.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have said that the section goes far beyond this but we can deal with these criticisms when we come to the section itself.  If there is a valid criticism, I have shown that I am willing to take account of it; but, on the other hand, I have also shown that some of the critics can be very wrong and I believe they are wrong on this. However, whatever the final form of section 59 may be, we must have this power of summary arrest as we had in the 1951 Act, which is the Act that section 59 replaces.  If we do not have this power, the section will lose its value and a significant number of criminals will go unpunished because they will have disposed of the evidence by the time the police can get a warrant. This section is designed mainly to enable the police to pick up a man in suspicious circumstances, particularly in the early hours of the morning.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins has referred to the extension of existing powers but I would remind him that, under the 1951 Act, there is power for summary arrests.  Section 13 of that Act reads:</P>
    <P>A member of the Garda Síochána <Col N="222" /> may arrest without warrant a person whom he reasonably suspects of having or conveying in any manner any thing stolen or unlawfully obtained.</P>
    <P>It does not necessarily mean anything stolen by him.  The article could have been stolen by anybody.  It is the opinion of those whose duty it is to deal with these prosecutions that section 59 of the Bill retains probably less than 50 per cent of the existing power from the 1951 Act, which is defective. Whatever about the accuracy of that, it is far narrower in scope than the section of the 1951 Act which it replaces.</P>

      <P>It is narrower.  As regards cases affecting the Revenue Commissioners, the bottle of brandy is not a good example.  Certainly, it is not very relevant to what we are discussing. The Revenue Commissioners, as Deputy Fitzpatrick well knows, have all the powers that they need under their code.  They have the necessary powers to enable them to follow any smuggling cases which they wish to follow.  It is the clearly established policy in this country that the Garda do not take on themselves revenue work.  It is the Revenue Commissioners who pursue this field.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick gave a bad example when he mentioned poteen because, under the Illicit Distillations Acts, a garda can arrest a man on suspicion of carrying poteen at any time; he can search his house at any time without a warrant and he can dig up the man's garden without a warrant. Even if the garda officer finds poteen five miles away from the man's house but on his land he can arrest the man unless the man can prove that he had no knowledge of the presence of the poteen on his land.  Therefore, when the Deputy speaks of poteen, he is giving an example of existing law which goes back for about 200 years.  Consequently, it appears that very many <Col N="223" /> people do not know some of the existing powers.  I suggest to the Deputy again that we should not proceed to discuss section 59 until we come to it, as we will in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point on which I should like clarification.  The Minister and Deputy O'Higgins have drawn analogies between the peculiar powers of the Revenue Commissioners in regard to smuggled goods and the Garda Síochána in regard to spirits distilled without a licence, commonly known as poteen; but section 59 speaks of a person who, knowingly and without lawful authority, has in his possession or on his premises any article.  It says that that man may be arrested by a member of the Garda Síochána without a warrant if the garda reasonably suspects the man to be guilty of that offence.  Surely we are travelling a step further than we ever travelled before if we are to delegate to a member of the Garda Síochána the function of suspicion with reasonable cause that a person knowingly has in his possession or on his premises anything obtained in contravention of the criminal law?</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have always been in a different position.  The Minister knows from his experience in the West of Ireland with regard to poteen, as I know because of my experience as a Deputy for a Border constituency, that officers of the Revenue Commissioners have phenomenal powers.  An officer of the Revenue Commissioners can stop the man in the streets of Carrickmacross, take the overcoat off his back and say to him: &ldquo;Prove to me that that overcoat has been lawfully imported and the duty has been paid on it.  Unless and until you do, it is seized.&rdquo;  He has that right under the revenue law and the obligation of proof shifts to the owner of the overcoat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="224" /> We all know that that is a very odd power.  The Revenue Commissioners have gathered unto themselves down through the years the strangest powers owing to the great difficulty of enforcing a variety of revenue laws.  As the Minister knows, when we were dealing with the Income Tax (Consolidation) Bill we carried on an old provision which the Revenue Commissioners had acquired back in 1910, I think, which was found to be contrary to the Constitution and we had to take remedial steps before the Income Tax (Consolidation) Bill could be passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Is there not a new principle here if we suggest that the Garda officer may arrest when he has a reasonable suspicion that somebody knowingly does a certain thing?  The Revenue Commissioners never claimed that right.  The Revenue Commissioners simply said: &ldquo;I do not care where you bought the overcoat.  We believe that overcoat to have been brought in illegally and the duty was not paid on it.  Inasmuch as that is the fact, unless you can prove the person from whom you bought it lawfully imported it, we hold it.&rdquo;  That is a claim that no other organ of the State makes.  It is doubtful, if somebody raised the matter on a constitutional issue in the Supreme Court, if that claim on the part of the Revenue Commissioners would stand up; but that is another day's work.  I do not think there is any other organ of the State which claims that wide power or to whom the Oireachtas has ever conceded such a wide power.  It has only been conceded to the Revenue Commissioners because of the notorious difficulty they have in enforcing the revenue law.  However, I am quite agreeable to the suggestion made by Deputy O'Higgins that we will leave further discussion of the amendment over until section 59 is under consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It occurs to me that Deputy O'Higgins could make whatever arguments he wishes on his amendment or on the effect of subsection (7) when we come to section 59.  Of course, Deputy Dillon is quite right in saying that the Revenue Commissioners have wider powers, I suppose, than any body there is dealing <Col N="225" /> with the matters with which they have to deal and it is their business to do it. The point he makes about the question of <i>mens rea</i> can be raised in relation to a number of other offences.  It is an ingredient of most offences, in fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in poteen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in poteen but in the kind of offences I am trying to visualise here.  This is some gentleman caught at 2 o'clock in the morning with three or four transistor radios and so on.  What I want to explain to the Deputy is that when the case comes to the court and a point is raised, the garda must satisfy the court and the justice that he had reasonable grounds for suspicion for the action he took. This runs through many branches of the criminal law that would otherwise simply not work, where a police officer detects what he thinks is a crime&mdash; stolen goods being carried or what have you&mdash;and because of the circumstances, perhaps because of the hour, perhaps because of the local situation, he must have power to make a quick arrest. If in such cases the garda had to go around chasing a peace commissioner to give him a warrant, when he came back his bird would have flown.</P>
      <P>Let me say again that when we come to section 59 we can debate whether it is narrower, as I say it is, than the existing law which it is replacing, the 1951 Act, or whether it is wider.  In the meantime however, I feel sure the House will be satisfied that it is essential in the circumstances which I have described for the garda to have an instant power of arrest.  The Deputy, I am sure, appreciates what I have already quoted as the existing law under the 1951 Act and that those powers are there and that the purpose here is to replace them.  If the Deputy withdraws his amendment, we could leave over until the debate on section 59 whether it is in fact broadening the powers, or, as I think, narrowing them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not entirely agree we can deal with this satisfactorily by ensuring that section 59 is no more extensive than the provisions of the 1951 Act. There is a lot to be said for a section such as section 59 but the question <Col N="226" /> here is whether we are to confer the powers of arrest without warrant suggested in section 12 for every offence under section 59.  The Minister has, quite rightly from his point of view, made the case that a person could be found abroad late at night or in the early hours of the morning with half a dozen transistor radios or maybe a large quantity of cigarettes or something of that nature.  That would be a case in which it would be highly desirable to provide for arrest without warrant.</P>
      <P>If we are going to limit the powers of arrest without warrant in respect of an offence under section 59, we will have to do it when dealing with subsection (7) of section 12 because if that subsection stands then the person who commits an offence under section 59 will be automatically subject to arrest without warrant under the subsection we are now dealing with, whether the offence under section 59 is a trivial one or whether it is an offence of the magnitude of the Great Train Robbery.  We should write into subsection (7) some safeguards.  If the Minister would be prepared to accept the powers proposed to be conferred by this subsection in respect of certain hours of the night&mdash;in this Bill we have the precedent in certain subsections where more extensive powers are given to the Garda from an hour after sunset until an hour before sunrise&mdash;I would be with the Minister if he would be satisfied with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is simply an all-embracing subsection which will cover everything that may be held to be an offence under section 59.  I do not think it is a complete answer to any argument made from this side of the House to say: &ldquo;We are not extending the law.  That is the law as it was 20 years ago.&rdquo;  We are now reviewing the law.  This Act and this debate provide an opportunity for having a look at the law as passed and seeing whether it is reasonable or not.  I do not think it is any answer to say that this is the law as it was before, if the law as it was before was undesirable.  I bow to the Minister's greater knowledge and vast professional experience in respect of the <Col N="227" /> illicit distillery business and I accept completely that the position is as he says it is there.  I await clarification from him at a later date about the smuggling code.  Deputy Dillon made a very good point in respect of the smuggling or customs code because it has to be an offence here for the person to knowingly have in his possession something that has been illegally or improperly obtained.  As Deputy Dillon pointed out, that is not a necessary ingredient of a customs offence. The Minister says the customs authorities have all that power at the present time but I say that we are writing into this Act of Parliament that the garda will have power if they suspect that a person has knowingly in his possession something he should not have, although he might have it quite innocently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">

      <P>Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick of Cavan is flogging a dead horse on this.  We have to accept the fact that smuggling something is not a contravention of the criminal code.  It is a most regrettable thing but it happens; and, human nature being what it is, it is hard to avoid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there is power given to the revenue authorities, as Deputy Dillon says, to act without any warrant in honest suspicion, there is already that power in the hands of the revenue authorities and quite obviously that is where it should properly lie.  The offence here is quite a different one.  It is something obtained in contravention of the criminal law.  I cannot see, in spite of what Deputy Fitzpatrick says, that possession of a smuggled bottle of brandy or a banned book, improperly imported, is something obtained in contravention of the criminal law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 59 is virtually a re-enactment of the existing law just as subsection (7) of section 12 is a re-enactment. The main brunt of criticism of subsection (7) so far is that it is an unwarranted enlargement of the power of arrest without warrant.  We have got over that.  Deputy Fitzpatrick has gone <Col N="228" /> on a rather sounder line now by saying that, even though we are not enlarging it, at least we should take an opportunity of reviewing the law as it stands.  I do not see any reason for amending the law as it stands, because I know of no instance where this power of arrest without warrant, which has been the law since 1951, has been improperly used and I am not aware of any complaints in that connection.  I see no reason, having given the members of the Garda Síochána that power 25 years ago, why we should now take it back from them or limit that power in any way.</P>
    <P>Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick of Cavan was trying to be helpful when he suggested we might limit it to certain hours of the night.  The argument does not hold water.  A man can be in possession of stolen property at any hour of the day or night.  The references to certain actions being more apt to be criminal in the hours of darkness appear to refer to loitering with intent, and so on.  In so far as section 59 itself is concerned, we are informed that this is largely a drafting amendment of the previous law by reason of the difficulties in drafting prosecutions under the existing law.  It is quite right that we can pass subsection (7) at the moment, which is certainly a re-enactment of an existing power and then when we come to section 59 we can see whether it is also a re-enactment in a tidier form of the existing law.  If anyone can find something excessive in the drafting of section 59 it will be time enough to discuss that then.  We would be far better advised to deal with subsection (7) as we find it.  We are not prejudicing any discussion on section 59 in any way.  I would hope we would leave the subsection as it stands and then have a closer look at section 59 when we come to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained at the outset, I put down this amendment for the purpose of having examined and clarified the points which were causing uneasiness to some people with regard to the powers of arrest without warrant in the circumstances set out in section 59.  The right approach to this is that of Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i> but we have <Col N="229" /> to consider in relation to subsection (7) of section 12 whether or not it is right these powers of arrest without warrant should apply to all cases coming within the provisions of section 59.  If we pass subsection (7) of section 12 as it stands, then those provisions are going to apply to every offence under section 59 whether we think they ought to or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  I am trying to reply logically to the case which the Deputy and the Minister made as to why they should leave over all argument until section 59 is reached.  Once you pass subsection (7) as it stands, then these powers of arrest without warrant contained in subsection (7) will apply to every offence under section 59.  It would be a very laborious task later on to try to recast the entire section 59 to get in the exceptions.  It was done in a much neater way in the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, when there was a section there specifically dealing with the power of arrest without warrant in particular cases which were set out in section 13. Deputy Dillon has raised a point of importance but the substance of what he mentioned there, and very rightly mentioned, and the effect of it probably is to limit rather than expand the existing provisions.</P>
      <P>As I understand the position at the moment, under section 13 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, a garda has power to arrest without warrant a person whom he reasonably suspects of having in his possession or conveying in any manner anything stolen or unlawfully obtained.  In a case like this, the power of arrest without warrant applies.  He is somewhat more restricted under section 59 of the Bill because not only must he suspect that the goods have been stolen or unlawfully obtained but he must also reasonably suspect that the person whom he is about to arrest knows that is the position. To that extent the position is somewhat more restricted here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to explain the reference to the relevant subsection in the explanatory memorandum because I do not understand it.  He will find on <Col N="230" /> page 7, paragraph 47 (7) this statement:</P>
    <P>...which provides power of arrest where a person is suspected of having committed an offence against section 59 (i.e. unlawful possession of goods), is in effect a re-enactment of section 13 (1) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951.</P>
    <P>I have no comment to make on that, but it goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The re-enactment is made necessary by the fact that subsection (2) of section 13 is being repealed and replaced by the modified provision contained in section 59 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The first comment I want to make is that it is not only subsection (2) of section 13 of the 1951 Act which is being repealed but, according to the Schedule, the entire section 13 is being repealed.  I do not understand this. There may be a perfectly good reason why it is stated that the re-enactment of section 13 (1) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, is rendered necessary by the repeal of subsection (2) of that section, because subsection (2) of section 13 of the 1951 Act deals with the case of a person who is charged in the district court with having in his possession or on his premises, or conveying goods reasonably suspected of being stolen or unlawfully obtained, and fails to give account to the satisfaction of the court of how he came by them.  As I understand the position, it is the failing to give account that is the offence under section 13 (2) of the 1951 Act.</P>
    <P>I do not understand how the repeal of that subsection necessitates the re-enactment of the power of arrest without warrant in section 13 (1) of the 1951 Act.  I may be misreading the explanatory memorandum, but I do not understand the explanation given there.  If I am right in my reading of the 1951 Act, it appears to me that what is in brackets in paragraph 47 is quite irrelevant.</P>

      <P>There is one point I should like to bring to the Minister's notice in regard to this subsection.  The Minister, as a lawyer, has considerable experience, particularly from the defence angle, as a criminal practitioner. <Col N="231" /> As far as I can see, for any offence of a criminal nature which is alleged to have been committed, the garda may arrest under section 12 (7). It has been held under the Customs (Consolidation) Act that it is compulsory to inform a defendant that he has the right to be tried by a judge and jury.</P>

      <P>It is the law that a customs offence is a criminal offence and in such an offence a person charged has the right to go before a judge and jury, as any practitioner in the Border counties knows, and it is the duty of the district justice so to inform an accused.  Most cases under the Customs (Consolidation) Act are held before a judge and jury.  One can imagine an example of a tyre which has been smuggled or the case of a tyre on which the duty has been paid but the person involved has lost the receipt during the months.  If a member of the Garda finds a British manufactured tyre on my car, though the tyre may be half worn, he has the right to arrest me because it is a criminal offence as defined by section 59 of the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is illegal to have the tyre in your possession and the onus is on you to prove that you got it lawfully and that you paid the duty or that somebody else paid the duty or that there was a duty-free licence in respect of it.  That obligation is on the accused and once one is found in possession of that tyre, under section 12 (7) a garda may arrest and the accused must discharge the onus of proof.  There is the humiliation of being arrested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take another example.  As the Minister knows very well, it is now a criminal offence to capture fish which are not up to a prescribed size or standard.  In other words, the mesh of nets is now fixed.  Let us take a simple example, lobster.  Lobster of a certain size may not be captured and if they are there is a severe penalty for doing so.  Supposing a carrier from Killybegs or any of the other western fishing ports is handed a consignment of lobster for delivery in the Dublin market. He is coming along in his lorry and suddenly a garda decides to stop the lorry and to open the box.  He finds a lobster not of the required standard and he can there and then, under this subsection, arrest that man.  That is the main objection to the subsection and that, I think, is the reason why Deputy O'Higgins put down an amendment to delete the subsection.  It would be a very good thing.  I know that what I <Col N="233" /> have said may sound frivolous but the Minister knows that when one goes before a court and says: &ldquo;It is frivolous&rdquo; one is told: &ldquo;But it is the law. We did not make it.  It is there, written into the Act.&rdquo;  That is our difficulty and that is why I should like to see the citizens protected and I think that the powers given under subsection (7) are very unfair to the ordinary citizen.</P>

      <P>I am particularly anxious in our discussion of this Bill to restore public confidence in the process of deliberation in this House in regard to a matter which impinges on individual liberty.  I noticed yesterday that the Minister, understandably getting a little bit impatient with the protracted nature of the debate, spoke of filibustering.  I think he does himself a disservice in this matter.  I think he <Col N="234" /> ought to approach the discussion of this Bill with understanding because so far as this side of the House is concerned it is our duty not only to secure that justice is done but, in so far as it is humanly possible, to ensure that the people know that Dáil Éireann has examined with scrupulous care any legitimate apprehensions that have been raised in connection with this Bill in so far as it limits human dignity or human freedom, especially lest by inadvertence it goes far beyond what, in fact, it is desirable to do.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said in his explanatory memorandum and in his observations today that section 9 which governs subsection (7) is a substantial re-enactment of the law as it stands at the present time.  The case is being strongly made to the Minister that he is mistaken in that view and that probably subsection (7) is widening the scope of the occasions upon which a person may be arrested without warrant. I note with approval and appreciation that the Minister has expressed his readiness to postpone, if that can be made to conform with our procedure, this amendment relating to subsection (7) of this section until we are dealing with section 59.  I do not know whether that is procedurally possible. I am afraid it is not.</P>

      <P>If we could carry conviction to the mind of the Minister for Justice that this is not a dog fight conducted for the purpose of making his position intolerable, that this is not a propaganda campaign to paint him as a potential fiend, that it is the proper discharge by Dáil Éireann of its duty scrupulously to examine the law for the purpose of providing individual <Col N="235" /> liberty for the citizens of Ireland, a useful service would be done and if this would help to carry that conviction to the Minister's mind I would suggest to Deputy O'Higgins that he would, as a gesture, withdraw this amendment, on the clear understanding that if we are not satisfied with the issue of the debate on section 59 this amendment will be reintroduced on Report Stage.</P>

It would be useful evidence for the country that from both sides of the House an effort is being made to make good law and that matters that trouble individual citizens are not being carelessly overlooked in any process of filibuster or wrangle which might seem irrelevant to uninformed observers of our procedure.</P>

It is policy and always has been that they deal with their own business and not the gardaí.  Leaving that aside, however, Deputy O'Donnell spoke of innocent carries of fish.  I think a sufficient answer to that is that the 1951 Act has been specifically modified to bring in the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo;. The Deputy will appreciate the difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tried in the beginning to steer the House away from a full discussion of section 59 on this particular subsection so that we would not get bogged down on it at this point, but if the <Col N="236" /> amendment is withdrawn and if it would meet the wishes of the House to recommit it&mdash;this particular one&mdash;on another Stage, I am certainly agreeable to do that.</P>

      <P>Subsection (8) of section 12 provides:</P>
      <P>A member of the Garda Síochána may arrest without warrant a person who, after warning, refuses to desist from or continues conduct which the member has reasonable grounds for believing to be an offence under Part VI of this Act.</P>
      <P>It is essential, I suggest, in dealing with this subsection, which I ask to have delete from the Bill in its entirety, to consider sections 28 to 33 or 34 which constitute Part VI of the Bill.  Section 28 is the section&mdash;and I am going by the index now&mdash;which deals with unlawful meetings, processions and demonstrations: section 29 deals with power to prohibit meetings, processions and demonstrations believed to be unlawful: section 30 deals with meetings and processions requiring notice: section 31 deals with power to impose conditions with respect to or prohibit meetings and processions: section 32 deals with watching and besetting: section 33 deals with acting at meeting or procession in a disorderly manner and the next section deals with the penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="237" /> The Minister is aware that no part of this Bill caused so much uneasiness in the public mind, and so inflamed public opinion, as this part of the Bill. All the matters in Part VI, which, as I say, inflamed public opinion against the Bill, were seriously proposed by the Government for carrying into the criminal law of this country.  In addition to that, and to all the penalties laid down in Part VI of the Bill, we have here this small section at the commencement.  In addition to all the penalties prescribed in Part VI, the garda were to have power of arrest without warrant.</P>
    <P>To refresh the minds of Deputies, including myself, as to the provisions of Part VI it is suggested here that there should be power of arrest without warrant.  If a Garda officer has reasonable grounds for believing an offence is being committed, he may arrest &ldquo;a person who, after warning, refuses to desist from or continues conduct which the member has reasonable grounds for believing to be an offence under Part VI of this Act.&rdquo; Section 28 has already had some attention from us, even on Committee Stage, by reason of a Ministerial amendment to alter the definition of a public place. This is the section which deals with meetings, processions and demonstrations within half a mile of Leinster House.  It is prescribed according to section 28 that they shall be unlawful. We will, I hope, be discussing section 28 in greater detail later.  For the moment all I want to point out is that under subsection (8) of section 12 it is proposed that the power of arrest be extended to those cases coming within section 28.</P>
    <P>Section 29 deals with the question of the authority of a garda, not below the rank of superintendent, to prohibit meetings, processions and demonstrations which are believed to be unlawful. Section 30 is the section under which it would become an offence, punishable by a fine or imprisonment, or both, for a person to hold or organise, or attempt to hold or organise, any public meeting, or any procession, in or through any public place unless he has given appropriate notice to a garda superintendent.  I know I will be told that the Minister is <Col N="238" /> dropping that, that he has an amendment down later on to get away from trouble and difficulty which were caused to him and to the Government by the introduction of section 30, but, so far as I am concerned, we must deal with this as a whole.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is that the proposal in section 30 is to make it an offence, punishable by a fine or imprisonment, for a person to hold or organise, or attempt to hold or organise, any public meeting without first giving notice to a garda superintendent. What is relevant here is that it is also proposed that if a person failed to give notice to a garda, power of arrest without warrant might apply under subsection (8) of section 12. That is what is proposed in section 30. Section 31 then went on to propose a system whereby conditions could be attached in respect of meetings or processions.</P>
    <P>The whole set-up here, the idea of interfering with the right of the people to assemble freely and peaceably to express their views, or to demonstrate in a peaceful and orderly manner by processions, to hold a public meeting, is wrong.  The fact that it was proposed that that should be interfered with and controlled in a tight manner by the authorities, and should be subject to the giving of notice on the one hand, and to restrictions with regard to the conditions under which such meetings and demonstrations could be held on the other hand, coupled with the fact that if an offence were committed-had this Bill gone through as proposed by the Government&mdash;in relation to the sections dealing with public meetings, demonstrations and processions, the garda authorities would have power of arrest without warrant, really &ldquo;shook&rdquo; the people of this country. They were entitled to feel uneasy about the whole approach of the Government to this measure, and to the provisions about which I am talking now&mdash;the original provisions, some of which still stand in Part VI.</P>
    <P>I have appealed to the Minister already in relation to other parts of the Bill that he should deal with them by withdrawing the Bill as a whole, and coming back with a new Bill dealing <Col N="239" /> with the matters about which there is general agreement in respect of law enforcement so far as crimes and criminals are concerned.  Certainly with regard to subsection (8) of section 12 the Minister should at least make some gesture.  He has gone part of the way in some of his later amendments to drop sections 30 and 31 but he should make some gesture in regard to this subsection by agreeing to drop it as I propose in my amendment and Deputy Tully proposes in his.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support these amendments standing in the names of Deputies O'Higgins, Tully and Corish, because subsection (8) is one of the most objectionable parts of this Bill.  It vests in the Garda wide powers of arrest which they have not had up to now.  It also infringes on the freedom of assembly guaranteed under the Constitution.  We must remember that under Part VI of the Bill we are dealing, by and large, with law-abiding citizens who may feel very strongly about a social evil in our midst and want to do something about it.  It is now possible to arrest them without warrant if they take steps to organise a public protest against a social evil which was probably created by Government inactivity of one kind or another.  I should like to hear from the Minister who requested this power and what is the need for it.</P>
      <P>Meetings and protest demonstrations which get large public support always stem from a very good reason.  Smaller demonstrations and smaller meetings which may be more vocal and may appear to be tougher to handle, do not create any big problem for the Garda Síochána.  Those involved would not be demonstrating for a very good reason or a very obvious one; therefore, their numbers would be small and, under existing regulations, it should be possible to contain them.</P>
      <P>What concerns me and, indeed, all organisations interested in the wellbeing of the community, is that under this subsection any law-abiding person who would be doing his duty as a citizen by trying to bring to public notice some grievance could be arrested without a warrant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="240" /> Under this section we would be extending greatly the confrontation between the Garda Síochána and the public.  It is very necessary that there should be the greatest possible cooperation between the Garda Síochána and the public.  If the Garda Síochána must now extend their activities to public meetings and public demonstrations so that they can arrest people without warrant, then it will build up a great deal of mistrust between the public and members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I am sure the members of the Garda Síochána do not want this power themselves and that they would find its execution very difficult.  It is not always easy to distinguish between a public meeting for an election purpose and a public meeting for some other purpose that could be connected with a political objective.  All demonstrations are of a political nature and can be said to be for an election purpose, whether the election is this month, next year or whenever it is.  I would appeal to the Minister to delete this subsection completely, because it has been objected to by people from all walks of life.  If this subsection is passed we shall find law-abiding, respectable people arrested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with Deputy Dillon that we must go through this Bill with the greatest possible care and demonstrate to the people that we are legislating with real deliberation. But there is a danger if we go on with this discussion on subsection (8) that we shall duplicate the discussion on all the provisions of Part VI of the Bill. Part VI will give rise to a tremendous amount of discussion and it is right that it should.  I would hope, however, that the action that was taken as regards the amendment of subsection (7) might be taken on subsection (8) and that Deputy M.J. O'Higgins's amendment, which was supported by Deputies Corish and Tully, might be withdrawn and, if necessary, reintroduced on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attitude adopted by Deputy Dillon is in marked contrast to that of Deputy M.J. O'Higgins yesterday when he stated that the purpose of Fine Gael was to obstruct the Bill.  I hope that is only a slip of the tongue on <Col N="241" /> Deputy M.J. O'Higgins's part and that we shall be able to get down to discuss it very reasonably and responsibly. However, if we go on in this way on subsection (8) of section 12 there will be a duplication of discussion on Part VI.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This subsection has rightly given rise to the gravest apprehension amongst responsible people.  I want to say this and I hope the Minister will take note of it, for I say it at some personal risk: I wish it were true what Deputy Pattison said, that we should bear in mind that in Part VI of the Bill we are dealing exclusively with the rights of people of goodwill.  I wish that were true, but we ought to face the fact&mdash;and we have a duty to face the fact in the times in which we are living&mdash;that the great evil with which a constitutionally elected Government, such as we have here in the Republic of Ireland, has to struggle against is the exploitation of the demonstrations of reasonable people of goodwill by criminal elements who seek to use such demonstrations for their own felonious purposes of precipitating anarchy; and the dilemma of our time is that constitutionally elected Governments acting as the Executive, concerned with the maintenance of order and government, have a very human and natural tendency to over react to the attempt by criminal elements to turn lawful demonstrations into incipient anarchy in the streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to recall now to the House that there are certain trademarks of this procedure which are known all over the world at the present time&mdash;in the United States of America, in Great Britain, in Northern Ireland and in our own capital city&mdash;and it is something of which we have every reason to be proud in that there is no part of the world in which that attempt has met with less success than here in the Republic of Ireland, because here our people recognise that the Government is a Government with the full moral authority of election of a free Parliament, freely elected by the majority of the people in free elections.  Now it would be a disaster of the first magnitude if, finding ourselves in the position that we have been better able to deal <Col N="242" /> with the evil activities of potential anarchists, we suffered ourselves to be frightened by events in other countries into an over-reaction to what is an undoubted danger.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I have got to recall to the House a personal experience of my own and a vicarious experience of those who went before me.  My father, God be good to him, was arrested in Woodford 80 years ago on a warrant sworn out by the district inspector of the RIC under the Crimes Act for participating in the &ldquo;Plan of Campaign&rdquo; and, mark you, things were pretty hot in Woodford in those days.  He and William O'Brien went down to collect the rents in Woodford, the rents which the landlord, Lord Clanrickarde, had refused to accept. Lord Clanrickarde had fixed rack-rents and the tenants went and tendered what they considered to be a fair rent and, when Lord Clanrickarde's agent refused to accept it, the tenants went down and paid them to my father and William O'Brien for funds for the &ldquo;Plan of Campaign&rdquo; and there is still hanging in our house one of the old Bank of Ireland £5 notes signed by the district inspector of the RIC as material evidence of the crime of John Dillon under the Crimes Act in respect of which he was arrested.  But before the district inspector could arrest him he had to get a warrant and, having got the warrant, he had to take one of the notes off the table, sign it and present it in evidence in a trial in which my father was subsequently acquitted.  That is how the note came back into our possession because, on his acquittal, the police had to surrender the note back to my father and it has been kept as a family heirloom ever since.</P>
    <P>I travel from that date to a date 50 years later and I beg of the Minister to believe that I am not trying to provoke him, but I am recalling a fact of which he has personal knowledge.  I draw his attention to section 31 of this Bill.  One of the offences in respect of which a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent has a right of arrest is where he has reasonable grounds for believing that the holding of a procession may occasion serious public disorder.  Now <Col N="243" /> I remember that day in 1934 or 1935. I went to a meeting in Ballina, the Minister's home town.  We held the meeting in the market square.  It was the first time I ever saw stones thrown at a meeting.</P>
    <P>Supporters of the Minister's Party gathered behind the wall at the back of the market yard, where there was a heap of stones, and they began to fire the stones over the wall on to the platform.  I remember, when I was speaking, I thought that somebody had upset a hive of bees because there were all these little black objects in the air in front of me.  Then suddenly I heard them rattling on the platform and I realised for the first time in my political experience, that I was under fire from stones.  The atmosphere of the meeting, as will be readily understood, was highly charged, to put it mildly, but, in spite of the stones and in spite of the opposition, the meeting proceeded and came to its conclusion.</P>
    <P>After the meeting we proceeded to return in procession to the hotel in Ballina.  I do not remember the street, but the Minister probably knows it well.  We were walking down a street, which was quite steep, and there was a very large crowd at the front of which I was walking.  At the foot of the street there was what I will euphemistically describe as a crowd of the Minister's supporters challenging our right to pass.  The chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána, whom I shall not name but whom the Minister will recognise by his local appellation of &ldquo;Doubtful&rdquo; was walking beside me, and he said to me: &ldquo;Mr. Dillon, you must turn back.  They will not let you pass.&rdquo;  I said to the chief superintendent: &ldquo;You have sufficient men at your disposal to allow a lawful demonstration to proceed on its lawful occasion. I warn you that, if you do not take measures to see that that can be done, I shall clear them out of the way.&rdquo;  He walked beside me down the street for about 20 yards exhorting me to turn back. I refused to turn back.  I told him that, if he did not clear the crowd, I should do so&mdash;I need hardly say, with the assistance of those around me.  Accordingly, when we were about <Col N="244" /> 20 yards from the foot of the street, he assembled the gardaí, charged and scattered the crowd and we proceeded on our lawful occasion.</P>
    <P>I want to put it to the House that, on that day, under subsection (8) of this Bill which Deputy M.J. O'Higgins seeks to delete, would it not have been the duty of the chief superintendent, under section 31 (2), to put his hand upon my shoulder and to say: &ldquo;I arrest you on the ground that I have reasonable grounds for believing that the holding of this procession may occasion serious public disorder&rdquo;?  Now, is there anybody, is there any Deputy on any side of this House, who believes that the chief superintendent should have had that right on that occasion?  I was then deputy leader of the Fine Gael Party in this House.  I was attending a public meeting and I was proceeding, with my supporters, in a perfectly peaceful and lawful way back to the hotel from which the speakers at the meeting had originally come and to which they were now being escorted by their supporters.</P>
    <P>Those were rough, tumultuous days in which the Minister and I found ourselves on opposite sides, energetically opposed to one another, and, for all I know, he was in the crowd at the foot of the street.  He was a good deal a younger man than he is now: so was I.  Does he think the chief superintendent should have had the right to arrest me because I said: &ldquo;I will not allow Deputy Moran or the late Deputy Ruttledge, God be good to him, and his friends to prevent me from walking with my supporters peacefully through the streets of Ballina?&rdquo;  I do not believe anybody in this House, however vindictive, believes that the chief superintendent should have had the right to arrest me when I said to him: &ldquo;Either you clear the mob or I shall clear them; I intend to proceed on my lawful occasion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us remember that, with the British Government here, drawing all the resources of the Royal Irish Constabulary and the British Army against us, they still thought it requisite, before they put my father in Woodford, to swear out a warrant and to satisfy the resident magistrate that there was <i>prime facie</i> evidence that he was <Col N="245" /> breaking the law even though, at the subsequent criminal proceedings, they failed to satisfy a jury, as packed as they could make it, that he had in fact broken the law.  Is it desirable, albeit the world is changing and has changed since those days, that an Irishman should be entitled to the unanimous support of every responsible element in society to take whatever measures, however Draconian they may be, to resist anarchy, to change the law, so that, on that day in Ballina, instead of my being in a position to say to the chief superintendent: &ldquo;Go and do your duty and vindicate the law which is that persons going on their lawful occasions shall not be hindered and intimidated by mobs, however orderly&rdquo;&mdash; instead of law-abiding citizens being in a position to say that &mdash;the chief superintendent should have the right to lay his hand upon my shoulder and to say: &ldquo;Inasmuch as I believe that, if you continue to exercise your undoubted right lawfully to go about your rightful occasions in this town, it may be the occasion of serious public disorder and I arrest you&mdash;not the people who are challenging your right to go about your lawful occasion &mdash;for asserting your right to go about your lawful occasion&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I implore Dáil Éireann: do not let us go on record as saying, at this time, that we are going to make that the law of Ireland.  I implore Dáil Éireann to forbear from doing that in the full knowledge, in the full realisation, that Deputy Pattison is unduly optimistic in believing that we are dealing here almost exclusively with people of goodwill.  We are not.  Undoubtedly, many people of goodwill lawfully desire to assemble in demonstration and public procession but, equally undoubtedly, there are elements both at home and from abroad who are prepared to come here and to mingle with such persons of goodwill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully conscious of that.  Often those persons of goodwill, who pass resolutions and attend public meetings, have not the moral courage to come out and to say: &ldquo;We know these elements are here and we recognise the danger.&rdquo;  But, fully recognising all these dangers and freely declaring &mdash;as I am doing in public now&mdash;that they are here both from abroad and from amongst our own people, I am urging Dáil Éireann not to over-react to that situation.  I understand&mdash;nobody understands better than I do&mdash;the difficulties that confront the Garda Síochána in grappling with these situations but I commend to the Minister's attention the fact that the London Police have grappled with these situations very successfully.  If the Minister will cast his mind back, I think he will remember that, prior to the riots in Grosvenor Square, London, the trend of public opinion was rather against the London Police.  It was felt that they were being oppressive and unnecessarily interfering.  But, once the people whom I have described in this House recently as the &ldquo;Red Berets&rdquo; showed their hand in Grosvenor Square and the police, with restraint, contained them and dispersed them, public opinion swung heavily over on the side of the London Police and has remained in support of the police ever since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people are inclined to ask what I mean when I refer to the men with the red berets and the bullhorns because it is against them I believe this subsection is directed.  We ought to face the fact that there is an international technique being operated at present.  It is that where there is a lawful demonstration proceeding you see people either dressed in red uniforms of one kind or another, or with some other distinguishing mark, and almost always each is equipped with a bullhorn. The purpose of the bullhorn is to direct a crowd into a common course of action, because human experience teaches that once a large crowd begins to move upon a carefully preconceived and directed course of action the possibility of precipitating riot is immensely increased.  That is not the end of the dialectic.  The purpose of red beret with the bullhorn is to force the people of whom Deputy Pattison <Col N="247" /> spoke, the people of goodwill who have come out with no other purpose than lawfully to demonstrate, into conflict with the Garda Síochána here or the police in other countries.</P>
    <P>Invariably red beret with his bullhorn is in the background and it is from his companions come the golf balls with the nails stuck into them or the razor blades or the other missiles habitually thrown at the Garda Síochána or the police as the case may be, up to the point that the police have to react if the purposes of the architective anarchy are not to prevail. But their reaction falls on the decent people who are up at the front and it is then that red beret and his bullhorn scuttles from the scene of the conflict to a prearranged meeting site for the purpose of gathering a meeting to protest, not in regard to the purpose of the procession or the purpose which the procession was originally organised to serve, but to protest against police brutality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Fully conscious of the problems that that carefully organised dialectic of conduct gives rise to for any Minister for Justice, whatever Party he belongs to, let us, the Oireachtas, decide that, despite the stories I have had here to tell from my own and from my father's experience, despite the evidence of what we see proceeding around us, not only in Ireland but all over the world, we are determined not to over-react and to give to the Garda Síochána not only the right but the duty to arrest the deputy leader of the principal Opposition Party in Dáil Éireann for no other reason than he was walking at the head of a perfectly lawful procession and refused to be deterred from doing so by the assembly of an unruly mob that proposed to deny him that right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mark you, at the time the scene in Ballina, which I have described, transpired, feeling was running so high in this House&mdash;and there are few Deputies present who can remember this; the present Minister for Justice is the only other Deputy apart from <Col N="248" /> myself who can recall those days&mdash;that the possibility of personal conflict was never absent from our minds.  It was a constant source of anxiety for the Leaders of the Parties in this House to prevent tempers rising so high that Deputies would assault one another. Yet, we were able to get through all those stormy years from 1927 to 1939 without any subsection (8) which Deputy M.J. O'Higgins seeks to delete from this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take cognisance of this fact.  I hope he will take cognisance of it by the knowledge that there is no present danger in this country of anarchy succeeding in its detestable practices.  There is no such danger because, although I detest the present Government and would long to see them out of office, I would cheerfully lay down my life in defence of their right to enforce the law because they are the legitimate Government.  There is no Deputy on any side of the House who would not support the Government in vindicating the law and in the preservation of individual liberty and the freedom of the individual.  It is that knowledge which gives the Government the moral position which other Governments not 100 miles away have not got.  It is the want of that moral position that makes them rightly fear that lawful demonstrations might deteriorate into anarchy before which, for the want of that moral authority, the Government might collapse.  No such danger exists here because, if such a danger confronted the Government in the morning, every individual in this Oireachtas would hold up his hand until that danger had passed.</P>
    <P>Surely, instead of concealing that fact, instead of doubting that fact, instead of acting as if that were not true here, we should act in the certainty that it is true and that the extremity of power requisitioned by subsection (8) of this section, coupled with the subsection of section 31 to which I referred, is not necessary.  If it is not necessary let it be dropped from the Bill and let it be dropped by a Government that know or ought to know that, if it is the agents of anarchy against whom subsection (8) is directed, they do not need it now because if it ever <Col N="249" /> became necessary this House would give it to them in ten minutes; Dáil Éireann, the Seanad and the President would give them the power they require if anarchy were in a position to make a material challenge.</P>
    <P>There is no division here on the subject of allowing anarchy to replace law.  That is one principle upon which, as far as I know, there is absolute unanimity in Oireachtas Éireann.  Is that not something we should be proud to claim?  Is that not something we should be proud to rest on, something that should reassure us?  We are in a position to say to persons disturbed and alarmed about subsection (8) of this section that we have listened to their representations, sympathised with their anxiety and that, on the assumption&mdash;rightly made in my opinion&mdash; that the individuals participating in these strong representations to the Minister for Justice on this subject are responsible and good people even though we do not agree with some of their views, their representations have been heard with respect in Oireachtas Éireann and in deference to them the Dáil has dropped subsection (8), but on this clear understanding&mdash;I believe it is an understanding that will be forthcoming from every Party in the House &mdash; that, if these or any other powers are required hereafter by the legitimate Government to challenge the disciples of anarchy, they will be made available and with so emphatic a voice that anarchists in this country, no matter from whence they come, will pause before they proceed about their evil work.</P>

Yet, I appreciate it is open to the House to debate the old sections 30 and 31, as they stand, but let us be clear that it is not these old sections 30 and 31 that it is proposed to include in the Bill but the amended versions that have been circulated in substitution for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>No. In relation to the new substituted section there is, in fact, to be no power of arrest, so that the Deputy has been relating something to the existing section.  However, even if the old section 31, to which the Deputy has referred, was law, not alone would it not have been the duty of the superintendent to arrest him under the section but it would not have been possible because under the old section 31, as it stands, the superintendent's power was to prohibit a meeting in certain circumstances subject to a right of appeal to the courts.  The section would not have applied to the situation the Deputy spoke of.  However, the position is that these two sections are to go and, when we get to that stage, they are to be replaced by other sections in relation to which there is to be no power of arrest.  The first of these sections merely proclaims, without any penalty or any offence being involved, that it is the duty of good citizens to notify the gardaí of unusual meetings that might cause traffic difficulties and so on.  In the other section it is provided that if they proceed without giving notice to hold a meeting which ends up causing grave public disorder they then commit an offence but it is an offence which will be dealt with under summons in the courts in the ordinary way.</P>

      <P>I am saying that under the new substituted sections there is no power of arrest.  I do not propose to argue about what was in, and still is in, the old sections 30 and 31.  Let me get to the amendment in my own name, amendment No. 9.  I want to point out that the subsection as it stands gives power of arrest without warrant for offences under Part VI.  Later in the debate I shall move amendments to replace sections 30 and 31 by two new sections.  The new section 30 creates no offence and, therefore, the question of arrest has no relevance and the consequential amendment of section 12 (8) will not be needed.  The new section 31, however, does create an offence and it is not an offence in respect of which a power of arrest without warrant would be appropriate.  It is because of this that it is necessary to amend section 12 (8) in order to exclude section 31 from the ambit of the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I think the Deputy was mistaken.  We do not regard this power as being appropriate here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with the whole of Part VI and its relevance to subsection (8) let me say again that it appears to me that we are in much the same difficulty as when we were discussing the previous amendment.  By that I mean that we shall be discussing every section in Part VI from section 28 to section 34 on this amendment.  I think it would be far better and more satisfactory if we discussed these sections as we come to them because we shall still be going back and forward from section 28 of Part VI to subsection (8) and <Col N="252" /> similarly with the various other sections. For instance, let us take section 33 of Part VI which states that &ldquo;Any person who at a lawful public meeting acts in a disorderly manner for the purpose of preventing the transaction of the business of the meeting, shall be guilty of an offence&rdquo;, that is a reenactment of existing law.  I think it is the Public Meetings Act 1908.  If a public meeting is taking place nobody who has had long experience in this field minds a few interruptions but if there are a few people who set out deliberately to prevent a public meeting continuing in an orderly way, and if they have been warned not to persist in their conduct and if they still continue to do so in order to prevent the orderly lawful holding of that meeting then under this particular subsection a garda could arrest such a person for refusing to desist from this particular conduct.</P>
    <P>I move from that back to section 28 which has been mentioned by Deputy O'Higgins.  Section 28 deals in a very particular way with this House and with the rules that should be laid down by the House for preserving the independence of Deputies and ensuring that they are not interfered with in regard to their assembly here for the purpose of doing their national business. As I said on Second Reading, I should hope that this particular section will be dealt with in a very special way by Deputies when we come to it. I hope that it will have the serious consideration of Deputies from every side of the House and that we will have the considered view of all Deputies as to what should be the law in respect of keeping Parliament independent and what should be the law in preventing undue interference with Members coming here to do their business.</P>
    <P>Subsection (8) may have some relevance in that field but if we continue as we now are we will be roaming from section 28, which I have mentioned, to the other section about public meetings and to various other sections. Therefore, I suggest to Deputies, if it would meet with the wishes of the House, that we would discuss these particular sections as we come to them. We shall not get anywhere if we continue to discuss all the sections some <Col N="253" /> of which will undoubtedly be amended. Therefore, the most reasonable way of dealing with this situation is to let us have this with my amendment and if the House considers it desirable after we have discussed Part VI of the Bill we could, on the next stage, have it recommitted to a committee of the House and at that stage discuss Deputy O'Higgins's amendment.</P>

The presentation of the Bill and the manner in which it is framed are matters that were laid down by the Government when they drafted and introduced it.  It is not our fault.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There was very great weight in a number of the speeches made on this section.  We should bear in mind that this Bill was hatched by the Government before there was ever any question of, for example, civil rights marches.  Permission for the printing of this Bill was given by this House as far back as the 22nd June, 1967.  The Bill came after the agricultural trouble.  It came after the confrontation between the Government and the NFA.  Therefore, it is relevant to inquire if the sections or the provisions of the Bill dealing with <Col N="254" /> arrest without warrant were brought into this Bill because of the difficulties in which the Government found themselves in dealing with the NFA and with the ICMSA.</P>
      <P>One such section is section 32, the first subsection of which reads:</P>
      <P>Every person who, with a view to compelling any other person (in this subsection referred to as the said person) to abstain from doing or to do anything which the said person has a legal right to do or abstain from doing, wrongfully and without legal authority, watches or besets the house or other place where the said person or any other person resides, or works, or carries on business, or happens to be, or the approach to such house or place, shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>I wish the House to consider that section in the general picture that was presented here some years ago when the office of the Department of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries was being picketed by farmers.  I invite the House to come to their own decision on whether, in those circumstances, if this Bill had been enacted with the power of arrest without warrant as applying to section 32, the position would have been that the members of the NFA and the members of the ICMSA who were picketing outside the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries would have been and could have been arrested&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;without warrant.  This is quite independent of section 28 of the Bill, quite independent of the fact that the activities may have been taking place within a half mile of this House, independent of the fact as to whether the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries happened to be in Government Buildings or elsewhere in the city.  Had this legislation been enacted, the Minister would have armed the Garda authorities with power to arrest immediately and thus prevent the orderly protest that was carried out on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="255" /> I fully understand and appreciate the necessity for arming the garda authorities or any other authority, for instance, the military authority, with adequate power to put down riots or disturbances of that nature but those powers are there already and there is sufficient authority vested in the Garda force to quell riotous behaviour should it take place.  The necessary power to arrest or take whatever action is necessary to prevent or quell a riot is already there under Common Law. Consequently, to my mind, we have got to differentiate between that situation and the situation which the Minister seeks to deal with under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with Deputy Dillon that we have got to retain our sense of balance in those matters.  Many of us would react, and react very quickly and very forcibly, to intimidation by mobs and to the kind of situation foreseen by Deputy MacEntee when he spoke some time ago and which I quoted yesterday.  Apparently the <i>Irish Times</i> was so impressed that they gave a subheading to his speech of &ldquo;Question of Mob Rule&rdquo;.  We have got to retain our sense of balance, as I said, because there are a number of things involved here.  We should not, as Deputy Dillon quite rightly put it, over-react against a situation.  Not only should we not over-react against it, but we should take care in our legislation here not to provoke the ordinary law-abiding people of this country&mdash;the people who wish to continue to have the right to engage in public meetings, protests or demonstrations, and to express freely their views in public in a peaceful and ordinary manner.  There is no doubt that at the time this Bill was introduced, with the extraordinary powers it sought, as originally introduced, to deal with the control of public meetings and demonstrations, it inflamed not the agitator so much as the ordinary, peace-loving citizens who wanted to preserve their right to tell the Government, the Opposition or any other section of the community what they thought of them in public and who have under the Constitution the right of free assembly and free speech.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> The Minister referred to section 33 which appears in Part IV and which is one of the sections for which it is sought to give power of arrest without warrant.  He mentioned, quite rightly, that the provisions of section 33 in relation to public meetings are in fact merely a repetition of what appears in the Public Meeting Act of 1908 with the great difference that in the Public Meeting Act of 1908 there is no power of arrest without warrant.  The Minister is seeking to incorporate that now not in section 33 but by the operation of subsection (8) of section 12 of this Act.  It would be dangerous and unnecessary to give those powers to the Government.  If the Minister could make a case for this House showing it was necessary that the Garda should have power of arrest without warrant in those cases it would be something we could consider.  If we did not agree with this we could argue about it and we could express our own points of view.  I do not think the Minister has made the slightest case to show there is any necessity for those powers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If he showed it was necessary and there was a situation in this country where there was an emergency situation which would require the use of emergency measures I have no doubt at all that the Minister would get whatever powers he thought necessary with the goodwill and cooperation of all Parties in this House. All Parties in this House would know in doing that they had the backing of the people they represent.  The Minister comes in here looking for those powers in a Bill which, as I say, was hatched and plotted some two years ago and, to my mind, although the Minister may think he has made powerful arguments himself, I do not think he has given the House any reason as to why those powers should be given.  He has not advanced any argument which could be seriously considered here as being one showing the necessity for giving those powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not mind whether we consider subsection (8) of section 12 in the <Col N="257" /> context of the Bill as it stands at the moment or in the context of the amendments which the Minister will propose later on to sections 30 and 31. Regardless of sections 30 and 31 either in their present form or amended form in the amendments which the Minister proposes to move to them later on I do not think those powers should be given in relation to the other sections which are comprised in Part VI of this Bill.  Certainly, and the Minister himself has recognised this, there is no justification for giving the power of arrest without warrant for offences coming within the framework of section 31 of the Bill, either the original section 31 or the amended form which the Minister is proposing.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself recognises that and I think he was wrong in arguing as he did with Deputy Dillon that section 31 was not a section where the power of arrest without warrant would have applied.  Obviously it was, otherwise why is the Minister proposing his amendment No. 9, the purpose of which is to exempt section 31 from the power of arrest without warrant? That is the only purpose of the Minister's amendment No. 9.  If I do not get acceptance of the amendment which I am proposing, to delete this subsection entirely, then, making the best of a bad bargain, I am prepared to accept the Minister's amendment No. 9 at least to take those powers of arrest without warrant out of the application of this Bill so far as section 31 is concerned.</P>
    <P>The very fact the Minister found it necessary to frame and propose amendment No. 9 shows, to my mind, if that was not done then the power of arrest without warrant which is given by subsection (8) of section 12 would apply to section 31 of the Bill.  I would appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment and to drop this power which he is seeking from the Bill.  It seems to me to be unnecessary, to be uncalled for, to be provocative and to be inflaming public opinion about this Bill.</P>

      <P>The trouble with the situation which we now have in this House is that some of us are so experienced in our own procedure <Col N="258" /> that we have become oblivious of the difficulty which people outside the House have in following our procedure. We have got to discuss each section of each amendment on its merits as it comes up.  The Minister says &ldquo;But look fifteen sections ahead and see what is going to happen there.  Pass this subsection now and you will see, if we pass the section 20 sections later on, most of the harm in this section will disappear.&rdquo;  If the Minister has decided to amend his own Bill so radically he ought to do what his predecessor, Deputy Brian Lenihan, did and withdraw his Bill and bring in a new Bill drafted in the form appropriate to the copious amendments which he proposes now to a Bill which he or his predecessor introduced two years ago.</P>
      <P>We have got a duty, over and above the actual business of legislating and questioning Ministers, to try to carry conviction to the minds of our people that Parliament is a vigilant, effective body for protecting their fundamental freedoms and for legislating within the Constitution.  I venture to swear there are not half a dozen Deputies in the House now, or available from our membership, who have sufficient procedural expertise to envisage what this Bill would be like if all the amendments on the amendment paper were incorporated in it.  I doubt if there are three Deputies in the House who could tell us what this Bill would look like if those amendments which the Government propose to accept are put in, and those amendments which the Government propose to resist are left out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in the fantastic position that our public duty imposes upon us an obligation to argue issues which our parliamentary experience teaches us may never arise.  The people&mdash;and God knows they are a minority&mdash;who follow our proceedings with close attention cannot be expected to understand the procedural problems with which we have to grapple in trying to legislate. They look at a Bill which they have been reading about consistently for two years since it was first published.  They have held their meetings, made their protests and representations.  Now they believe that what we are discussing <Col N="259" /> here today is substantially the Bill which they discussed in the Mansion House and in their debating societies and at their protest meetings.  They ask themselves why is there not the passionate indignation in Dáil Éireann which they felt when they were discussing this Bill 18 months ago.  The answer, of course, is that we, knowing the procedure of Dáil Éireann, recognise that the Minister has, in certain respects, gutted his own Bill.  The Bill we are considering at the present time is one which we, as parliamentarians, know is not the Bill they discussed at all.  The things that shocked them most are, in many cases, gone.  We are failing in our duty here in Dáil Éireann if we create in the minds of such interested people the impression that we are treating with relative indifference what seemed to them to be matters of immense importance.  It shocked me a little to read in this morning's newspapers of the Minister's somewhat irresponsible allegation yesterday that the Opposition were leading a filibuster.</P>

It is a mistake to suggest that the discussion of this Bill has been on a frivolous level or that it has been conducted for any other purpose than that we consider it requisite to direct the attention of Dáil Éireann to the full gravity of the problems that arose. Discussions here ought not only to improve legislation, but they ought to carry conviction to the minds of our people that in dealing with matters so grave as those dealt with in this Bill Dáil Éireann is fully alert to its responsibilities and conscious of its duties.  It does not necessarily mean that the whole House is thronged with Deputies.  They delegate to those Deputies of each Party, who are specially concerned and qualified to deal with the relatively obstruse matters raised by legislation of this kind, to come in and fulfil their duty of speaking for them.  It is only when the division bell rings that a body of Deputies come in to participate in their <Col N="260" /> historic function of voting.  I am afraid I must charge the Minister with the primary responsibility for this confusion, against which he has so violently reacted.  He spoke contemptuously of people whom he described as busybodies and mischief-makers.</P>

The Minister is, in part, responsible for misunderstandings, if such exist.  When he came to the conclusion that such comprehensive amendments were necessary he could have laid those ghosts by simply saying &ldquo;We will drop the Bill in its original form.

The Minister would have elicited from the House the kind of reaction which I think a Minister for Justice most urgently needs in times like these, which would have proclaimed to the country, whether we like him personally or not, or whether we like the Government to which he belongs, that <Col N="261" /> one thing is certain: if he acts in this country in defence of justice and in defence of decency he will be supported by all sides in Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking last night, I expressed, as some of my colleagues had done, dissatisfaction at the small improvement being given in this measure.  After the 1953 Act had been applied throughout the country, there was, and still is, great dissatisfaction with the different features of that measure.  I do not think the Bill we are discussing provides any great improvement: I believe it will leave the people as confused as ever with regard to their entitlements under the heading of health services.  The people still believe they are not being treated properly as far as health services are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill requires means tests and we should go to the utmost to get rid of such tests, particularly where health is concerned.  My Party advocate a free health scheme embracing the whole community.  We know that the people who violently opposed this in the past are still violently opposing it now, but the main opponents still appear to be Fianna Fáil.  They do not want to go the whole way in providing the service <Col N="262" /> we in Labour have advocated, and though Fine Gael have proposed a health scheme embracing about 90 per cent of the community, they do not go the whole way with us.</P>
    <P>I repeat that our proposal is a free health scheme for all, because we believe it could be administered more easily and effectively than that proposed by Fine Gael.  There are those who oppose such a free-for-all health scheme on moral, ethical and financial grounds but I should like to remind them that they were the same opponents to Labour's proposals for free primary and secondary education as far back as 1929.  Therefore, there should not be any moral or ethical objections to a free health scheme for all our people.</P>
    <P>In our social welfare and health services the State always seems to want means tests.  We have a number of examples of this in the application of such social welfare benefits as pensions, whether they be for old age, widows or orphans, blind or others.  Perhaps we are not any more peculiar in this country than in others in that we appear to have means tests in the matter of providing grants for assistance to the poorer sections of the community, but when we come to other things there does not appear to be any means test. For instance, if a person wants to build a house, to certain specifications, of course, he gets a grant from the local authority and from the State without any requirements as to income.  Industry is another example.  Whether people need grants or not they get assistance from the State.  We also have free-for-all provisions as far as children's allowances are concerned: they are provided irrespective of means.</P>
    <P>I suggest, therefore, that as far as health is concerned we should have a free scheme, that we should not subject people to hardship because they appear to be on the income borderline &mdash;because their income may be a few bob a week more than the required amount for entitlement to medical cards.  We have a free health scheme in one small respect, to cover what are regarded as infectious diseases: the treatment of these is absolutely free to the community.  Therefore, we should <Col N="263" /> aim at a free health scheme for all our people.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat what Deputy Kyne said in this respect.  I do not think it would be possible to introduce a free health scheme immediately this Bill becomes law.  It would have to be done in stages, having regard particularly to the financial aspect.  This is what we should aim at but from what I understand of Fine Gael's proposals, we wish to go further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Labour's proposals are a little advanced in that we want a free health scheme for all our people. A lot of people may be deterred by the example in Britain where the British Labour Party would be the first to agree that mistakes have been made and that there must be amendments: their scheme went awry in respect of many features.  As I have said, we should not be deterred by that.  The ultimate objective should be a scheme which will provide for all our people and which will not leave families in a position where they get into serious debt because they do not qualify for medical cards and because, at the same time, they cannot be in a voluntary insurance scheme.  The people I refer to are in the middle-income group. Many of them have been left in a very bad way because of hospital and general medical expenses.</P>
      <P>I wish to say here a word of praise for the majority of our local authorities who show concern, one might say compassion, for those who have not got medical cards but who have had to incur heavy medical expenses.  In many cases in which drugs are required they have remitted the full amount of the charges.  That would be in cases where people show hardship in the provision of drugs in cases of protracted illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great deterrent in a free health scheme is the fear of the finances that would be required.  One of the biggest disappointments in the measure now before us is that it does not provide for any substantial change in the financing of the scheme throughout the country. The present system of financing health <Col N="264" /> services, and the system proposed in this Bill, are grossly unfair to those who have to meet the greatest part of the burden&mdash;the ratepayers.  The present health services are financed by contributions from the rates struck by the various local authorities, plus a contribution from the Exchequer.  The system which the Labour Party propose is one through which a far greater number of the population would participate in its financing.</P>
    <P>In the present situation, the householder is responsible for the payment of rates.  The father may have £20 or £25 a week.  Three or four sons may also have similar amounts but the tax bill is presented to the father, to the householder.  He must pay the rates in full.  We have no hesitation in saying, as we proposed in our health policy document, that the burden should be shared in order to embrace these people.  We believe that the burden of local taxation as far as health services are concerned, and, indeed, as far as all rate charges are concerned, is unfairly placed on the head of the household and we believe it should be spread because, after all, those who do not contribute directly to the rates, those who do not directly contribute to local charges for health services can avail of them.  This is particularly pinpointed in the new suggestion in this Bill where by in the majority of cases a person's income is regarded as being his own for the purpose of qualification or otherwise for a medical service card.</P>
    <P>Our idea would be that the rates should make a contribution, that the Exchequer certainly should make a contribution but that every working citizen or any citizen who has an income in the State should also be required to contribute weekly to a social fund.  We believe that this social fund should be established, not alone for expenditure in connection with health but also in connection with social welfare benefits.  As a matter of fact, we go so far as to say that there should be one Minister for Health and Social Welfare because there is a great alliance between these two.  Those who are sick are dependent on the Department of Social Welfare for what benefits <Col N="265" /> they may get by way of sickness benefit or on the local authority by way of infectious diseases maintenance allowance.  Therefore, the Minister should examine the possibility of spreading the cost on to very many more shoulders than at the present time.  I feel that if this system had been introduced five or six years ago we would not have the great furore we have now about the high level of the rates throughout the whole country.</P>
    <P>The present services are limited and if we are to be honest with ourselves we must confess that they are limited because we have not got the financial resources.  The Minister, the Taoiseach and some of their colleagues met a deputation of members of the Dublin Corporation and as far as I can gather the attitude of the Taoiseach and the Government was: &ldquo;We just have not got the money&rdquo; and I suppose their attitude also was: &ldquo;If we give it to Dublin we will have to contribute to the other local authorities as well&rdquo;. But the Minister for Health and various Ministers for Health have hamstrung themselves in that they are confined to what the ratepayers can pay and what the Exchequer can afford from year to year.  If other people benefit from the health services I believe they should share some of the responsibility for the financing of these services.  I would include not alone health in that but the local benefits that are provided by the local authorities.  They are benefits that are freely used by those who do not pay directly and it is a tragedy that for too long we have employed a system under which the householder is directly responsible for payment to the local authority for services like health, the roads that are provided, the light that is provided, the water that comes out of the tap and sewerage.  All these things are of benefit to every citizen and we believe that every citizen who has an income, wages or a salary, should make a contribution towards these and particularly towards health which is so directly the concern of the Minister for Health because they also get the benefit of that service.</P>
    <P>I know it would be impossible for the Minister to make radical changes in <Col N="266" /> the Bill but he should seriously consider the suggestion in the Labour Party policy documents as to the financing of a health scheme and, of course, consequently extending it to very many more people rather than confining it, as it is in the main, that is as far as free services are concerned, to about 30 or 31 per cent of the population. If he is going to hamstring himself to depending on rates and contributions from the Exchequer we can only have the type of health service we have had up to this and the slightly improved one the Minister now proposes.</P>
    <P>We have advanced in thought and in attitude in recent years because many of the things advocated by those who were regarded as radical ten or 15 years ago are now being accepted by all Parties in the House.  Radical suggestions, if you like, from the Labour Party with regard to free education and free choice of doctor which were laughed at and derided so many years ago are now regarded as common place.  Thank God the community and Governments are accepting that because these are desirable it is also possible for them to be implemented.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear more from the Minister with regard to the free choice of doctor.  He did qualify, in his statement or in the White Paper, the idea of the free choice of doctor when he mentioned that it would not be possible in some areas.  This is very understandable. In towns and urban areas one can have a free choice of doctor. Perhaps, there will be three doctors in one town and seven or eight in another but there will be a choice.  However, as far as rural areas are concerned what inducements there will be to have a doctor at all I do not know but I am sure there will have to be some incentive for a doctor to practise in a rural area.</P>
    <P>In that respect I should like to subscribe to a view I heard last night, one which was probably mentioned by other members of the House, and that is the present position with regard to dispensary doctors and the uncertainty in the minds of people and particularly those who are members of local authorities as to the servicing with doctors of dispensaries where there is <Col N="267" /> no permanent one.  There is absolute chaos in the rural areas because a doctor who is not going to get a permanent appointment and sees himself there for years in a temporary capacity will not attend in the rural areas very often and will not act as a <i>locum tenens</i> because he believes he will be far better employed in a big town or city.  The Minister will have to, even now before this Bill is implemented, and I assume it will take quite a time for it to be implemented, make some provision whereby dispensary doctors may be induced to stay in dispensary districts. In some places there is one doctor trying to serve three dispensaries.  In dozens and dozens of cases there is one doctor trying to serve the vast area of two dispensary districts.  There is utter dissatisfaction and there is neglect.  It is not the doctor's fault but there is neglect of those who are sick and need to see a doctor urgently and in a case where there is a <i>locum tenens</i> if there is a call at night the doctor must travel, if he will, long distances in order to visit the patient in a dispensary district that has no permanent doctor.</P>
    <P>I do not see much in this Bill to improve certain of the present services. One of the great deficiencies in our health scheme in the last 16 years, and there does not seem to be any improvement in this Bill, is the absence of a proper dental service.  I do not know what the real reason is.  It has been suggested that this country cannot get dentists because we will not pay them. Whether this is a fact or not I do not know.  If this is the case we should be prepared to pay them because good care of teeth is vital for the health of a child.  Because we have not got a proper dental service our children are suffering, and they are suffering from ailments caused by bad teeth which will affect them for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>The scheme for the provision of dentures is an absolute joke.  In many parts of the country, and in many local authorities, there does not appear to be any proper scheme for the provision of dentures.  It is a terrible trick to play on someone who has a few teeth to tell him that he can have them out free <Col N="268" /> and afterwards, when they are out, to tell him he cannot get dentures.  Many of these are elderly people who, I would say, might prefer to have the three or four black stumps they had before rather than to have no teeth at all.</P>
    <P>I do not think there should be any insuperable difficulty in providing proper professional men to give this service.  I would not go so far as to say that the local authorities are falling down on the job.  I would say that some of them are a bit dilatory in ensuring that this service is available to the people in their jurisdiction.  The Minister should, as a matter of urgency, and even within the terms of the Act we are now operating, try to ensure that proper dental services are provided in every county or local authority area. If it is a question of money, we should provide it.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, with regard to a question tabled by Deputy Treacy today, there was a suggestion that dentists should have a proper knowledge, or a speaking knowledge, of the Irish language.  I am as keen as anyone else on the Irish language.  I have always spoken in this House for the promotion or revival of the language, but it is a bit of a joke to ask people who have been in Britain for ten or 15 years to come over here to practice as dentists and then tell them, even tacitly, that if they have not got a knowledge of the Irish language they need not apply.  I do not think it should be mentioned at all.  We who want to come into this House are not required to have an Irish qualification.  I do not know whether we are doing a better job than dentists.  This should not be a deterrent to an Irish emigrant dentist who is prepared to come over here and work professionally for people in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister can do in any substantial way for nurses.  I suppose there cannot be provision for them in this Bill.  We have all spoken on occasion about the hard and unhappy lot of nurses, their meagre pay and long hours.  The Minister should concern himself about them.  I think the late Deputy O'Malley did.  Perhaps the Minister is doing so.  I do not know.  In 1969, in the second part of the 20th <Col N="269" /> Century, we should not tolerate a position in which nurses have to work 12 hours a day and then go on night duty for a further 12 hours, and for ridiculous pay.</P>

      <P>I do not say it is entirely the Minister's fault.  Whether it is the fault of the local authority hospitals or the voluntary hospitals is anyone's guess.  My advice to the nurses organisations would be that they should become a registered trade union.  If I am right, they are not a registered trade union, but they may have a negotiating licence.  I do not think they have been militant enough. Let no one think that I am advocating that they should walk along O'Connell Street&mdash;although they might do so&mdash; or parade to O'Connell Bridge and sit down there.  They have the example of the various trade unions in the country who in recent times, because of their strength and having regard to their talents, have got themselves reasonable salaries, wages and conditions.  I do not think we should, by our silence, appear to condone a system under which a nurse is required to work a 12-hour day, and then go on night duty for another 12 hours for miserable pay and, in some cases&mdash;I will not say the majority&mdash;their accommodation leaves much to be desired.</P>

      <P>I do not know if the Minister is in a position to go into any great detail about the regional hospitals. There is a suggestion that the regional specialist hospitals will be <Col N="270" /> located in Cork, Galway and Dublin, and that there will be lesser hospitals in other parts of the country, which will be recognised on a regional basis. I think the Minister should have another look at this.  He should reconsider what is now described as the Fitzgerald Report.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister is a man who is not afraid of trouble but he will meet quite an amount of trouble not so much on the location of these hospitals, but on the downgrading of other hospitals. I do not know much about those who were appointed to sit on that commission and bring in that Report.  I had occasion to say in the House that they had excellent professional qualifications. Were these men, reputable though they may be, the right people to say exclusively what type of hospitalisation we should have in this country?  I agree that we should have these specialist hospitals.  I do not think any of our county hospitals or district hospitals are equipped to do heart or brain operations or specialist operations.</P>
      <P>I am concerned with the proposed down-grading of certain hospitals.  I am alarmed at the fact that we are taking from the people a service which they enjoyed back to the Poor Law Board of Guardian days.  I have several examples of my own and I am sure other Deputies have examples in respect of their own constituencies.  So far as I can gather from the report, it is proposed, although not in a specific manner, to downgrade the Wexford County Hospital and, for that hospital, you can read any other hospital you like, the Clonmel County Hospital, or the Wicklow County Hospital, or the hospitals in any other part of the country you care to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I question the ability of those people to determine where our regional hospitals and county hospitals should be located.  I believe this commission was weighted in favour of the specialists. There should have been other people on the commission, people who have been interested in and concerned with the administration of the health services for years and years, and the people who are on local authorities.  I do not believe that all aspects were <Col N="271" /> considered, or that the repercussions of the change were adequately considered by the eminent men appointed to that commission.</P>
    <P>Is it suggested in the case of the Wexford County Hospital, which is located in Wexford town, that for treatment for an appendix a person should have to travel 40 miles to Waterford?  Is it suggested that anyone who needs surgical attention will have to travel 40 or 50 miles, or in some cases in my area, 60 miles to get attention? Recently there was an accident in Wexford town in which a man suffered severe abdominal injuries.  The county surgeon verified the fact that if he had not been so close to a county hospital, a matter of a couple of miles, and if he had had to go to Waterford with the type of injuries he had, he would have been dead before he was half way there.  I do not think that hospital should be downgraded.  The existing county hospitals should be upgraded, and given even greater facilities than they have at present.</P>
    <P>This is a lobsided report and it should have included the experience and vision and wisdom of people who have served on local authorities, and of county surgeons and their staffs in the various county hospitals.  I know the Minister set up the commission in good faith, and that its members were appointed in good faith, but I would ask him to think again before implementing the report, to have another look at it and consult with other people.  I know he has many people in the Department with whom he can consult, but I suggest he would consult with the local authorities as well.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of this downgrading of county hospitals that ought to be considered.  There is the medical aspect, and I have given the example that the distance is much too far for people to travel, particularly those who become ill suddenly and whose illness necessitates an immediate operation, or those who have accidents. It is just not good enough to suggest that they would travel 40 or 50 miles in order to have an operation.</P>
    <P>There was a very representative meeting in Wexford town some two <Col N="272" /> months ago, and it provided a very good argument for those who are in favour of the retention of the facilities that are in the County Hospital in Wexford.  It was a week of snow and the roads were like glass.  If a situation arose in Wexford town or in Wexford county necessitating the removal of a patient to Waterford city, it would have been impossible, because cars could not move.  Therefore, we should not take away from the people this service they have had so long.</P>
    <P>There is also what I might call the social side.  People find great difficulty in getting to hospitals far distant in order to visit their relatives.  County councils are not very flathúlach when it comes to issuing travel vouchers. Those in the medical card group find it virtually impossible to get free travel vouchers from the local authorities to visit relatives or friends in a hospital 10, 20 or 30 miles away.  The regional hospital should not be located so far away that people would find it extremely difficult to make these visits.</P>
    <P>There is another reason&mdash;I suppose it would not be regarded as the best one&mdash;that of economics.  The hospital and its staff are part of the town.  The staff are in receipt of wages and salaries and they spend money in the town.  The contracts usually go out to the town in which the county hospital is located.  If the hospital is removed to another area these benefits will be lost to that locality.  That is not my main point in regard to the downgrading of the hospital, but regionalisation could do a disservice to the people in relation to the administration of the Health Act.  May I appeal to the Minister to have a further look at that and not to depend on those who brought in the report, not to depend on those good officials in his Department, but to consult with the local authorities, to consult with the representative groups from those various areas in which there have been strong protests.</P>
    <P>As far as the measure is concerned, we would recognise that there are some improvements.  I cannot be too enthusiastic about them, but they are improvements and for that reason we believe we should support the Minister <Col N="273" /> in his efforts.  On the other hand, we want to express grave dissatisfaction that he has not introduced a real health scheme.  He should be prepared now not alone to review it, because that has gone on since 1953 and particularly since 1961, but to say what the Government's policy and what his policy is.  Do they believe there should be a free health scheme for which every citizen would be eligible?  Does he believe that the burden of local taxation should be spread more widely in order to ensure that the ratepayers will not be hit so hard, and will there be improved and extended services?</P>

      <P>We have waited for this Health Bill for a long time and I am quite disappointed at what has emerged.  There are a few good things in it but there are many things that need explanation, and I am hoping that when the Minister is concluding he will enlarge on some of these matters.</P>
      <P>In theory a free choice of doctor is a good thing and this is what everybody in the House wanted.  However, I cannot see it working, particularly in my constituency.  There are not enough doctors.  I am not very clear from the Bill how it could work in an area where there was a dispensary doctor prior to this.  Take a case where there is a dispensary doctor and a doctor in private practice.  If there is a free choice of doctor and the medical card patient goes to the doctor in private practice, who pays the doctor in private practice?  I do not know either how it would be decided that X area should have a medical officer, dispensary doctor, call him what you will.  As the Minister knows, in the vast area of South Galway with a population of 8,000 people there are two dispensary doctors.  In a wide rural area obviously two doctors cannot cope with such numbers.  The new scheme will not improve it; in fact, it might be worse.  All areas west of the Shannon, certainly Galway, the two Mayos, parts of Sligo and parts of Leitrim, will have to be treated like the Aran Islands: doctors will have to be appointed willy-nilly and kept there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country has gone in a peculiar <Col N="274" /> direction in regard to health.  We cater now for medical card holders, and this is a great thing.  For too long were the people who could not afford to pay for services badly treated.  I am delighted to see them getting treatment, but now it appears that the private patients have no rights at all. A constituent said to me quite recently: &ldquo;I am paying gigantic rates and a doctor can refuse to see me because he is too busy.&rdquo; It is the ratepayers who are keeping the hospitals and the dispensaries there, and surely they must have some rights?</P>
    <P>In Galway we have an astronomical rate: it is almost £5 in the £ in the county and it is over £5 in the £ in the city.  Surely a person who is paying rates of this size is entitled to tip-top service, but this is not what is happening. We have a few doctors who are grossly overworked.  Instead of encouraging people to stay in the west of Ireland, we are driving them out of it. We are not offering them adequate medical services; dental services are practically non-existent in the west; certainly they are non-existent in County Galway.  Saving the west is something we hear a great deal about. If we give people proper services and amenities they will stay in the west.  If a man is making a good living and suddenly becomes ill and dies because he could not get a doctor, what good is that living to him or to his wife and family?  People cannot be expected to set up home in an area where they cannot even get a doctor.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about this now famous Fitzgerald Report.  There is a hospital in my constituency, the Portiuncula Hospital, which will come under the hammer if this report is adopted.  It will become a health centre and will handle geriatric cases and, according to the explanation given to me, all straightforward maternity cases.  There are only four Members in this House who can speak of maternity cases from personal experience.  There is no such thing as a straightforward case.  For over eight months of pregnancy a patient may be perfectly normal, but in the last three or four days an emergency may arise and even within the last three or four hours and the obstetrician, or whoever it happens <Col N="275" /> to be, may decide that it is a case for Caesarean section and, in the middle of winter, the patient has to be taken 40 miles from Galway.  This constitutes a desperate risk and, if I were the patient, I would refuse to go there.</P>
    <P>Portiuncula is a new hospital, comparatively speaking; it is an excellent hospital and it is in process of expanding at the moment.  It serves parts of Westmeath, parts of Galway, parts of North Tipperary and a little bit of Offaly.  It fills in the gap in the Midlands. The hospital in Athlone is very small and there is no maternity unit there.  I do not know if it has a surgeon. Actually, Portiuncula takes in patients from the Athlone area also. For those in County Galway and in the adjoining counties it will be a dreadful tragedy if Portiuncula is downgraded. As Deputy Corish says, there is more than just a surgical or a medical problem in the downgrading of hospitals. Taking a hospital out of a town is like closing down a big factory in that town because literally hundreds of employees are affected&mdash;doctors, nurses, cleaners, maintenance personnel, wardsmaids, porters, lift attendants, ambulance men and so on.  Visitors visiting a hospital bring a great deal of business to the town in which it happens to be situated because visitors to hospitals invariably bring gifts to patients&mdash;flowers, grapes, cigarettes, sweets and fruit.</P>
    <P>The closing of a hospital in these circumstances could well constitute a financial drain on the town and the loss of a great deal of money out of the town.  There is, too, the difficulty of relatives and friends visiting patients in big regional hospitals.  The distance to be travelled will be infinitely greater. As it happens, these hospitals are very sticky about visiting hours and, if one has to travel a long distance to the hospital, one runs the risk of being delayed because anything can happen on a long journey.  If one reaches the door late then one just does not get in. With a local hospital one can get there in a matter of minutes.  Again, it is imperative that parents should visit young children in hospital every day. If the hospital is a long distance from <Col N="276" /> the children's homes then visiting will be impossible.</P>
    <P>This Bill does nothing to help the ratepayer.  Help was what we were all hoping for, but the hospital service will still depend on the rates.  To put it mildly, the ratepayers are getting a little bit sore about the rising incidence of rates year in and year out.  Now, because of the non-payment of rates up to a certain valuation, those who have to pay rates feel slightly aggrieved because they believe they are paying for a service from which they themselves derive no benefit.  I know that the well-off section in any civilised community has a duty to care for the less well-off, but there are people who are aggrieved because, though they pay rates, they get no benefit from the hospital service and, as well as that, the service seems to get worse instead of better I do not see anything in this Bill designed to improve the hospital service.  I do not think big regional hospitals are the answer.  I am not, of course, an expert, but they have been tried in Britain and now, in Britain, they are going back to the idea of small local units.</P>
    <P>With regard to the formation of these regional health boards, I think the Minister is getting too much power. I am not now speaking of the Minister at the moment; I am speaking about any Minister for Health.  No Minister should have the power to elect the chairman and vice-chairman.  One could easily arrive at a situation in which the Minister would look down a list and see that X paid so much to Party funds and here is a job for him and X might be absolutely and utterly incompetent in the particular job.  That is one of the dangers.  I do not say for a moment that the Minister would do anything like that, but Ministers are human and there is too much of an element of &ldquo;jobs for the boys&rdquo; in this. The powers of local health authorities are being eroded in this Bill and too much power is being vested in the Minister.</P>
    <P>I understand that four CEOs will be appointed.  One or two of these should be medical men.  I know that various Ministers for Health have had uneasy relations with the medical profession <Col N="277" /> over the years.  I know the medical profession has been tricky and, perhaps, difficult, but then politicians are tricky and difficult too.  Indeed, all professions are difficult.  In fact, we are all difficult if someone rubs us up the wrong way. With the best will in the world these chief executive officers would not be competent or qualified to tell a doctor how to run his hospital.  There should be at least one doctor, if not two, amongst these CEOs.  He would see the pitfalls that the ordinary layman would never notice.  I think this is a sensible suggestion, even though I make it myself.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see provision for help for the old and chronically ill in their own homes.  This service is urgently needed.  I hope the Minister, when this provision comes to be implemented, will rely to some extent at least on the marvellous voluntary organisations which have done and are doing so much excellent work in this field.</P>

      <P>In rural Ireland, in particular, we should really be ashamed of our treatment of the old and chronically ill.  Some of it may be due to ignorance.  Some of it may be due to carelessness.  Some of it is due to the modern trend; children no longer want to look after aged parents or elderly relatives.  In my constituency St. Brendan's is literally bursting at the seams and no more elderly people can be taken in there.  Only last week a man came to me with a problem; he is living with his 94-year-old mother and, while she is quite mobile, he is afraid that she will fall into the fire, or something, some day.  St. Brendan's cannot take her.  It is in cases like these that the new provision in regard to care for the old and chronically ill in their own homes would be particularly advantageous.  I hope this provision will come into operation as soon as possible.  I do not know how it will be implemented, but I am sure it can be worked if time and energy and money are spent on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish referred to the living conditions of nurses.  Time and time again I have been told by matrons in hospitals, even in training hospitals, <Col N="278" /> that they cannot get nurses.  Of course, they cannot get nurses.  The living conditions are bad.  The free time is bad. The pay is bad.  Practically everything is bad.  Local authority hospitals have pension schemes.  Some of the voluntary hospitals have pension schemes, but not all of them.  I know hospitals which have no pension scheme and the nurses stay on in these hospitals, working until they are 70 years of age and are eligible for old age pensions.  That is a scandalous situation.</P>
    <P>The regional hospital in Galway has a big nurses' unit with quite pleasant living conditions.  The only drawback is that it is not big enough.  As well as that, a new system, a disastrous system, in my opinion, is now being put into operation there.  Meals used to be served in the diningroom and the cost of food was deducted from salary. Now they are starting a cafeteria system&mdash;pay-as-you-eat. Young nurses are human and, if it is a choice between a new skirt, a new coat or a holiday, and a proper lunch, the holiday, the coat or the skirt will be the winner. They will skimp on food and, skimping on food, their health will deteriorate. They will not be able to work if they are half-starved.  This new system is a dangerous one and it should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>There is some provision for dental services in this Bill.  People do not seem to appreciate&mdash;this is particularly true of rural Ireland&mdash; the value of good teeth.  Parents do not seem to appreciate the importance of making children care for their teeth.  This sort of education could be given in all sorts of ways&mdash;through the schools, through lectures, through pictures and television. Television is a marvellous medium because everybody seems to watch it, certainly in rural Ireland.  If the dentist were paid enough, they would stay.  At the moment, the minute they are qualified they are gone.  In some towns in my constituency there are none.  In one particular town, the population has increased by over 1,000 but there is no permanent dentist there. A dentist comes there one day a week. It shows that the inhabitants of the town have no regard at all for their teeth.  Even if they went to the dentist for a check-up once a year, a dentist <Col N="279" /> would be kept more than busy.  If teeth are neglected, it can lead to chronic ill-health.</P>
    <P>This is a point that I do not think has been got over&mdash;particularly in classes&mdash;to the children, to parents, or to anybody.  One sees even quite young children with their teeth broken or decaying and nothing being done.  The tendency with them is to go to the clinic once and have all their teeth pulled out&mdash;one meets that with quite young girls and boys&mdash;instead of having simple fillings, and so on.</P>
    <P>I want to mention the ridiculous position in our part of the world as regards the supply of dentures.  I had a constituent once who told me that he had applied for dentures six years before that but had not got them.  The next time I was in the county buildings I asked about the matter and, as a result, he got them.  Some time after that, I met him but he was not wearing the dentures and I asked him why he was not wearing them. He said they did not fit him.  It is easy to understand that a change in his gums would take place from the time the impression was taken for his dentures six years earlier.  Surely the most sensible and economic thing would be to take out the wretched teeth and put in the dentures almost immediately?  Because of changes in the gums, it is a complete waste of money to give a man dentures after six years which were made on the basis of the condition of his gums after the extraction of the teeth in the first instance.</P>
    <P>We have a drug problem, even if we do not want to admit it, or, if we have not a drug problem, I am afraid we shall rapidly have one.  I was glad to note that the Dublin Health Authority are to have a secret depot for storing their hard drugs.  There was a time when, any evening one took up the <i>Evening Herald</i>, one seemed to read the heading &ldquo;Another Dispensary Raided&rdquo;.  They are not raided for fun, obviously, if they are raided regularly. These drugs are used rapidly.  A doctor told me that when his dispensary was raided some of the drugs were used there and then and the dispensary <Col N="280" /> was left in a neat and orderly condition but ampoules were left on the desk.  The drugs were used immediately and the whole job was done neatly and all of the remaining drugs were taken.</P>
    <P>A doctor not living in this country, tells me he is almost sure that this country is being used as a dump for drugs&mdash;that the drugs are coming here and going out for other areas.  If this is the case, the Minister would need to get in close and rapid contact with his colleague in the Department of Justice and quite a large drug squad&mdash; a specially trained drug squad&mdash;should be set up.  I think that, at the moment, our drug squad is very limited.</P>
    <P>We should have proper clinics for drug addicts.  I think we have one in Saint Brendan's.  I have a theory&mdash;I do not know how right it is&mdash;that drug addiction should not be considered as suitable for treatment in a mental hospital. I think it is a bad thing that a unit for drug addiction should be attached to a mental hospital.  I think such a unit should be placed in a general hospital.  I think that some, one or two or even three, general hospitals in Dublin or anywhere around the country should have special care units for drug addicts and some sort of register should be kept so that a patient who is an addict could not go to Hospital A and get the quota of drugs there which is necessary while the person is being reduced on drugs and then be able to go to Hospital B and Hospital C for similar quantities.  I am aware that it is popular to say that we have no drug problem here but, unfortunately, we have a problem.</P>
    <P>A short while ago I was at a lecture which was attended by a number of secondary school children.  I was horrified to learn from them that they knew where drugs could freely be got in the city.  Admittedly, some of them were soft drugs but the hard drugs can also be got.  There is no point in codding ourselves that we have no drug problem.  They went on like that in Britain and now they have a gigantic drug problem.  We must nip it in the bud.  It can be done through lectures in the schools and in the universities as well as through films, slides and all <Col N="281" /> these sorts of things which will show the horrors and, indeed, the dangers attached to the taking of drugs.  Indeed, I think that very often addiction ends in death, particularly for quite young people.  I think that if this could be got across to the youngsters, they would not start to take any drugs.  At the moment, I think it is a sort of &ldquo;something to do&rdquo; to say &ldquo;I was taking drugs just for kicks.&rdquo;  If these people saw films and heard talks on the subject&mdash;if it was got over to them &mdash;and if they realised the end that faces drug addicts, they would be very slow to start.  This is something that this Bill does not take into account at all.</P>
    <P>Usually, when I sit down, I think of all the points I wanted to raise before I got to my feet.  I want to mention nurses' salaries and pensions for nurses. Local authority hospitals have a pensions scheme and that is fine for the younger nurses but the position is serious for the senior staff nurses because the pensions scheme did not start until they were senior and getting on a bit.  I understand that the pension for matrons, for instance, is very light: that is a pity.  I was told of the case of a nurse in a certain Dublin hospital who qualified in 1914 and who is still working with the same hospital because her pension is so small: she is being kept on the staff on a part-time basis. Her pension would be about £300 per annum because she did not get in &ldquo;on the floor&rdquo; when the pensions scheme was started.  The youngsters who got in at the beginning will get increases but that is because they came under the pensions scheme from the start of their career.  The senior nursing staffs who came into the pensions scheme at the tail-end of their career are hard hit. Perhaps it might be possible to pay a gratuity to the senior staff in such instances&mdash;the assistant matrons and the matrons of hospitals.  I had intended to have some figures for this point which a matron promised to send me but I have not received them so far.  I shall pass them on when I get them.  They would be quite interesting. Those people have given very dedicated service.  They have served prior to this without great pay and certainly twenty years ago with almost no pay <Col N="282" /> at all and they should now get some sort of recognition by way of gratuity or bonus when they are going out on pension.</P>

      <P>This debate has proceeded for some time.  As Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins said one forgets what one wanted to say when one stands up to speak and one usually thinks of all the points one should have raised after one has sat down again.  I have made some notes to try to avoid that situation if I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering this whole question of health and in talking about the various Health Acts, we must also consider the views of the medical personnel engaged in promoting good health and we must be grateful to the various members of the medical profession who have taken part in the various commissions which were set up by this Minister and by his predecessor. Today there is a volume of information available to us as Members of this House, and, indeed, to the general public, which was absent heretofore.  This information brings home to each and every one of us the vital importance of trying to promote a system of preventive medicine.  I will go into that in more detail later on.  At the outset I should like to refer to the remarks of the President of the IMA at their recent conference in Killarney.  These show that in a way sometimes harm can come from well intentioned ideas. It is often said that a well-intentioned person often does more harm than good and while it is a strange saying it is often borne out by the facts.  Dr. Cawley was referring in his address to the conference to certain parts of the British health scheme and he indicated that great harm could befall the community as a result of certain practices under part of the English scheme which is now legalised.  He was warning us in advance of the danger which lies ahead in the field of medicine.  It is no harm to mention that.  As I said, it brings home to us the great difficulty there is in dealing with this whole question of a health scheme both here and in England.  I am not saying that those practices would be considered here but it is enough to bring home to us the <Col N="283" /> fact that those practices are taking place very near to us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I merely made the remark that this information can be gleaned from the daily newspapers. When he was introducing the Bill the Minister referred to the great cost of various health schemes and he also indicated that expenditure on health has increased from £18 million, away back in 1958-59, to £51 million, if one includes the grants to the voluntary hospitals.  Those increases are apparent and real and the Minister rightly indicated that we have made great advances in medicine since then. There is no doubt about that. It was said that there had not been any great advance in the scope of the health services here but this point could be contested on figures relating to general health.  If we go back to the 1947 <Col N="284" /> Health Act we find that the figures for tuberculosis since then have fallen dramatically.  The death rate is down from roughly 3,500 to 300-odd.  The death rate in 1945 was 3,694 and in the 24-year period since the figures have fallen to 341 which is the figure for 1967, the latest date for which I have a figure.</P>
      <P>That is a great achievement and I am prepared to argue, no matter what may be said about the 1947 Act or subsequent Acts, that we have been advancing towards better medicine, better preventive medicine and towards better health.  Preventive medicine is one of the ways in which we can reduce the mortality rate from infectious diseases. This has been borne out by the figures for infant mortality.  As a result of the mother and child health scheme sponsored by the 1953 Health Act, child health has improved considerably. The death rate of infants per 1,000 live births in 1945 was something like 70 while in 1963-64, the latest check I have, the figures were down to about 25 per 1,000 live births.  If that is not an advance on two fronts I do not know what people would call an advance towards better health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to this, recently we have had a report on child health services. In discussing this report at the Killarney conference I inferred from the press that medical personnel, some of them general practitioners and some of them doctors engaged in the public health service, disagreed.  Of course, we think then of the old adage that doctors differ and patients die.  They disagreed more or less in principle in regard to child health, for example, in regard to the school end of it, some of the county medical officers of health were prepared to argue that public health could handle it better.  Against that, the general practitioner or family doctor was prepared to argue that the family doctor was the best man to deal with it.  It is a matter of concern to us as Members of the House and members of the general public.  The more doctors we can involve in the scheme the better.  I suggest this question could be settled easily as between the various elements in the health service in order to work out the best possible scheme <Col N="285" /> for the detection and treatment of disease among school children.  Whether it be the general practitioner or the medical officer of health in the last analysis we believe that the patient is the most important person concerned. We hope the various groups in the health service will be able to arrive at a satisfactory solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>There are some fundamental aims we should keep in mind in considering the Bill.  I believe our aims should be to provide the best child health service we can organise, the best general medical service and the best hospital system we can provide.  Certain supporting factors follow such as making the most of our resources in manpower, improving medical organisation and promoting cost consciousness which is lacking in the population because it must be seen and if it is not seen in this House it will surely not be seen outside it.  Health calls for high spending and increased spending each year.  Various arguments are advanced about how this money could be raised in order to spend it on health but if we want to advance towards better health we must be prepared to spend the money.  There is no such thing as a free health scheme.  That is a concept which in our conditions we cannot realise.  We may as well face this fact in time and not waste our energy arguing about the relative merits of one method of raising the money as against another. The main point is that the money must be found if we are to improve our health services.  Those should be our primary aims.</P>
    <P>Steady progress has been made in the field of preventive medicine and also in hospitalisation and in the general medical services.  The one unfortunate feature of the health services is that whether it arises from what the Americans call the affluent society or not, we do not seem to be able to make any inroads on the mortality rate from cancer and heart disease. We are not alone in this.  One could develop this point and say that those diseases are brought about by various factors but it is not our function as laymen to attribute disease to any particular factor; we should leave <Col N="286" /> that to the medical personnel and be advised by them.</P>
    <P>This Bill sets out to do several things, to consolidate the law regarding health services and to make a number of changes in the various branches of the health services.  It seeks to express in a more definitive way policy regarding eligibility for general medical services. This eligibility question has given rise to great heartburning in the past, as those of us who are members of local authorities are aware, and we know that the cause of the heartburning was that under the present Health Act eligibility was not defined to a great extent.  It was left to various local authorities to investigate the means of applicants and decide whether or not they were eligible for admission to the general medical services register. Strangely enough, I do not condemn outright the old system as a number of Members of the House have done because I have some experience of it and I like to see both sides of an argument.  From my experience I should like to say that, by and large, the local authorities handle this end of the scheme very well.  However, when the home assistance officer was called upon to investigate the means of an applicant he did not have available to him the aids which are included in this Bill.  From my experience, the home assistance officers carried out their work in an impersonal way without infringing on the dignity of the claimant.  They carried out their work to the best of their ability and tried to arrive at a fair and objective decision in bringing the case to the county manager for his decision.</P>
    <P>I was a member of the Select Committee on Health Services set up by this House. That Committee held over 60 meetings during a period of three years and heard evidence from representatives of every branch of the health service, including evidence from county managers.</P>
    <P>The present Bill seeks to express eligibility in a more rigid way but, if it does so, it has the advantage of providing for a degree of flexibility.  When a system like this is set up and it is necessary to have a formal procedure on appeals, the appeals system must be <Col N="287" /> something like the one we know under the Social Welfare Act or a similar system. I hope that, under the system, the Minister will not find there is a big build-up of paper work and that there will not be long waiting periods.  Such a situation would be liable to occur in connection with an appeals system. However, the fact that power is given in another section to provide limited eligibilty should relieve this pressure.</P>
    <P>One encounters cases every day in the week which could not possibly be covered by a Health Bill no matter how the Bill sought to define who was eligible and who was not.  The Bill also expresses the view that a person should not be denied medical care because of economic circumstances.  We have accepted this in every Health Act up to now.  We accepted it in the 1953 Health Act and the aim is restated in this Bill.  On the other hand, the Bill clearly indicates a rejection of the view that every person should be unconditionally provided with free medical, dental and auxiliary services.  This was rejected, as I said at the outset, in the light of the knowledge that we would not be able to have such a scheme.</P>
    <P>If anybody wishes to argue on this point he need only look at the British health services.  The founder of the social welfare system in England, the late Lord Beveridge, before he died, indicated that the scheme was a failure.</P>

      <P>I will provide the reference for the Deputy later on.  At any rate, the principle is rejected here that the State has a duty to provide free medical aid unconditionally for the whole population.  It is rejected on realistic grounds in view of our circumstances, in view of our national income per head of the population and in view of our gross national product. The people who talk about this&mdash;the hurlers on the ditch&mdash;may talk about it for as long as they wish.  They can talk about it in the knowledge that they will not have the power or the responsibility, currently at any rate, to undertake the raising of the finances for such a system.  Although they postulate this idea, they are well aware that our circumstances would not permit a free-for-all health scheme.  There is no such thing as a free health scheme. It must be paid for at some level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>If the British Government could water down their free-for-all health scheme, they would do so. Strangely enough, indications are that people in Britain are providing for health by way of contracts with insurance companies and not through the State.  You must not forget that, whatever may be said about development, it sometimes works out as costly development.  The big insurance companies in England can offer very attractive terms in providing for insurance against health risks.  The various Health Acts here have been derided and scorned without any reference to achievement.  I do not have any regard to an argument which sets out merely to destroy, especially an argument which does not refer to what was achieved under our various Health Acts.  The fact that today roughly 90 per cent of the population are eligible <Col N="289" /> for hospital and specialist services is generally overlooked by those critics. The fact, having regard to our size, that one-third of the population enjoy free full medical aid in every sphere is also conveniently forgotten and neglected by those carping critics of our various Health Acts.</P>
      <P>One would imagine here sometimes, listening to informed critics, that we had the worst health service in the world.  This is trotted out many times. My reply to that is &ldquo;Go and see. Faraway hills are green.&rdquo;  I remember, as a member of the Select Committee on Health Services listening to evidence given by various personnel, by doctors who worked here and who went abroad and, comparing like with like, those men were prepared to argue that under the 1953 Health Act we had as good a service in general as elsewhere.</P>

      <P>We have here at the moment the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme under which is covered I think, something like 300,000 of the population.  I often feel it is a pity that more of our people who could do so do not join the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme.  The scheme offers value for money.  It provides high insurance, if you could put it that way, against ill-health.  At the start the scheme mainly dealt with hospital treatment but today it also covers the cost of drugs when it exceeds a certain figure.  As well as this there is a supplementary out-patient scheme.  We should have not merely 300,000 members enjoying the benefits of the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme but three times that figure.  If we had, the Voluntary Health Insurance Board would be enabled to offer much more attractive terms by way of insurance against ill-health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to the fact earlier on that we were provided with ample information by the Minister for Health and his predecessors.  We had, as I said, the Select Committee on Health Services. We had the 1965 Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Mental Handicap, which I think was issued in April 1965, and we had the Report of <Col N="290" /> the Commission on Mental Illness, which was issued in March, 1967.  I cannot but mention here the great progress which has been made in the field of mental illness.  I remember not long ago reading a report on mental hospitals in England and I was more or less taken aback, to say the least of it, when I looked at the silhouette of the buildings, the dreary, dark grey outline of the mid-eighteenth-century buildings, which have improved very little in the meantime.  I contrasted that with the strides which had been made, for example, in Mullingar Mental Hospital on a very small budget.</P>
    <P>I said to myself that the hills were green far away, that one heard about the great strides in medicine and medical matters made in other places but, when one came to relate those to conditions at home, I felt I would be able to answer, if I was asked, that we have a much better system in our own locality.  I must say this is due mainly to the motivation of the present RMS with a small staff.  He has succeeded in taking away the ugly grey appearance of the building.  He has succeeded in introducing everyday activities into the lives of the inmates there.  He has succeeded to such an extent that he has brought about the situation that neither lock nor key is needed in the institution.</P>
    <P>We are wonderful critics in this country.  Lately we have become &ldquo;super-duper&rdquo; critics because we do not refer to facts at all.  In this way one can say almost anything one likes without being challenged on it.  I have already referred to the report, for example, of the group set up to examine child welfare clinics and school health services.  All those reports indicate that we have made very great strides in all those branches of medicine.</P>
    <P>Even though it may be said that the scope of the 1953 health scheme has not been extended this is a misnomer because within the scheme itself we have made all those advances.  All those reports point the way to provide us with the knowledge.  Let us equip ourselves with the means of improving those services.  This is what those reports are intended for.  Certain politicians <Col N="291" /> seem to think it is a great election gimmick to talk about health.  I myself am a politician and I am subject to all the ills, faults and failings of a politician but I do not think I would be so shortsighted as to seek votes on a Party plan criticising my own health services unless I had good grounds to do so and unless I could show where the service was seriously at fault.</P>
    <P>There are many illnesses at present which we never heard of in the past and which were neglected.  I suppose they were taken as the natural consequence of approaching age.  Geriatrics is one of the branches of medicine which is going to exercise our minds in the future.  It may be argued that rising standards of living and less activity can bring about ageing ailments in life earlier than would afflict an active person.  Geriatrics has come to the fore.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister indicate the progress which has been made in the past number of years in converting county centres for the purpose of dealing with this branch of medicine.  I remember when I was a member of the Council of Europe for a very short while being on a visit to a hospital in Switzerland.  We were shown some of the advances in medicine, with special reference to geriatrics.  The practice there is that the patient is taken into hospital until he is rehabilitated and able to live at home. During our period there we discovered that work therapy made up the routine of the patient's day.  The patients in the particular home we visited were from 65 to 80 years of age.  We discovered that people who could not use their hands because of arthritis were put to shedding linen.  This was done many years ago in the homes by the women who used the thread to sew new garments.  At this centre it was discovered that such activity enabled patients to regain limited use of movement in their hands.  Discovered also were the other methods used to get circulation moving in those patients and to &ldquo;free them out&rdquo;, as they said.</P>
    <P>When the Minister talks about phased development and phased change this is what he means.  This is to be <Col N="292" /> welcomed.  The Minister is of the opinion, and so am I, that if a patient has a reasonable home and can be taken into a centre for a period if he is suffering from an ailment like arthritis and can be rehabilitated and sent back to his own home it is to his advantage.  That is clinical medicine and is a good way of treating the ailment. In this way the patient will have the best of both worlds.  If the patient is able to live at home for a while and even if he has to be taken to the centre again for treatment it helps the patient if conditions at the centre are congenial.  Where the grey appearance is abolished the patient will respond to treatment.  Patients in other countries responded to such treatment. This is why I welcome the idea of the Minister in trying to promote a number of pilot areas where this particular type of medicine can be practised.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other measures in the Bill which I do not propose to discuss in detail.  We all welcome the phased change.  We all welcome the fact that the system of eligibility will be moved and advanced by the changes proposed in the Bill. The scope of eligibility will be widened to a certain extent and in this way this change will be more or less acceptable to all.  The choice of doctor was also a bone of contention in the 1953 scheme.  It was argued that those who participated or went into the medical services register were denied their choice of doctor.  We recognise the effort the Minister is making in order to bring about this choice in areas where it will be workable and feasible. It will be more difficult in country areas because of the fact that doctors live a distance from each other and to this extent the people will not, for a while at any rate, have the same choice as people living in towns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>He did lead on, and not blindly.  The provisions in the Bill abolishing the specialist charges for out-patients and involving matters concerning the dispensing of drugs will be a success.  The Bill in this respect makes for a more civilised approach to the dispensing of drugs without infringing on the dignity of the patient. That was an important point.  There is provision in the Bill regarding eligibility for drugs.  It is wise to provide this.  It is definitive in the matter of means because when one defines &ldquo;means&rdquo; rigidly one will realise that it is wise to provide this limited eligibility clause in the Bill so that there will be an avenue of appeal.</P>
      <P>The increased maternity grants provided for in the Bill are also welcome because this will back up and promote the mother and child scheme which we brought in in 1953 in the teeth of very bitter opposition, in this House and outside it, not from the Labour Party. We in Fianna Fáil always welcome improvements on any front and let us be wise enough to welcome the improvements provided in this Bill.  All of them will make for better standards of community health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier I mentioned the choice of doctor and this brings me to another <Col N="294" /> point.  I am thinking of group practice among doctors which we should do everything in our power to promote. I make special reference to country areas.  It was said earlier that two doctors, practising together, could provide a more efficient service.  I think that three doctors practising together could provide an even more efficient service in country areas.  The more the merrier, because the more personnel we can involve in every branch of medicine, the better.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the subject of the general medical services, I should like to say that all the proposals in the Bill, no matter how limited they may be, will cost money.  If we genuinely are interested in promoting these proposals for better services we must appreciate that they have to be financed. While certain politicians in local authorities are prepared to bare their breasts and shout about the rates, they forget that the cost of the health services has been increasing year by year and that indications are they will increase progressively in the future.</P>
    <P>Up to 1965, roughly, the rates bore half of the cost of the health services. Then the Minister for Health made provision by way of a supplementary grant, which can vary from one per cent to eight per cent above that.  I must remind Deputies that every day when one takes up an Order Paper, either in this House or at a council meeting, one finds proposals by members which would cause either the Exchequer or the local authority to spend more money.  Against that background, I cannot help but think that the people who practise this calling for services, which they know will have to be paid for, should remember that when the particular service is provided it must be paid for.  I cannot reconcile this mentality&mdash;every day either in the House or at local authority level we have those calls for more expenditure &mdash;with the fact that when the bill is presented they shout: &ldquo;Goodbye, good luck, we will not pay it.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>In his opening statement the Minister said that a contributory insurance scheme to cover the middle income group was being examined. If nothing more came of this than the promise that it was being examined, it would be a good idea because it will require people to think of the extent and the scope of insurance and how far it would go, for example, in financing a health system.</P>
      <P>I referred here tonight to Lord Beveridge and I refer now again to the British health services.  Despite the fact that they have a large industrial population in England and better ways of creating an insurance fund than we have, the insurance fund still had to fall back on the Exchequer.  The British worker found himself not merely being pinched on one corn by the insurance fund but nipped on the other by the Exchequer in order to raise taxation to help the fund.  This will only be a limited examination of the feasibility of starting an insurance scheme which would cater for the middle income group.  That statistics will be produced will be a good thing, even if nothing ever comes of it otherwise. The examination will be revealing in the sense that it will highlight the depth and the extent of the finances needed to support the health services.</P>
      <P>Before I comment on hospital services I want to say that we should always hold in high regard the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes.  Over the last number of years&mdash;since 1948, I think&mdash; Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes contributed £21½ million towards the improvement and building of hospitals.  I think the total figure spent was something like £35 million over this period.  We should acknowledge our good fortune in having an organisation like this to support our hospital system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have read the Fitzgerald Report <Col N="296" /> on the future of our hospitals.  Perhaps I should have read it again but, like the child with the school book, I had not got the time.  However, I have extracts from it which I shall quote. We would be very shortsighted and it would be a miserable attitude if we condemned the Minister on parochial grounds or through shortsightedness or for political reasons.  This report, which was drawn up by 18 eminent members of the medical profession, is an excellent one.  Indeed, it is a blueprint to take us into the 'Nineties. It would be shortsighted if because of parochialism or vested interests we set out to condemn this plan. I shall quote briefly from this report. At page 17 it deals with defects in the present hospital system and it says:</P>
    <P>There are altogether 169 separate hospitals providing acute medical, surgical and maternity services.  Most of them are inadequately staffed and equipped.  In county hospitals, the single consultants in surgery and medicine are isolated from colleagues in their fields.  Many maternity patients throughout the country have not convenient access to the services of a consultant obstetrician. Inadequate operating theatre, out-patient, laboratory and radiological facilities are keeping patients in hospital longer than necessary. Teaching standards for our medical students and nurses are falling behind as our hospitals fail to adapt themselves to the rapid advances of modern medicine.  The older hospital buildings are unsuitable for remodelling while the majority of the modern ones were planned on too rigid and too restricted a scale to permit satisfactory conversion.  We realise that available public funds are limited, but even if there were no limitations on financial resources it would clearly be unrealistic and a waste of money to attempt to develop so many hospitals to desirable standards of staffing and accommodation. As we shall show later, the requirements of a modern hospital service have become so complex that we can only meet them by a radical reorganisation of our hospital system involving, <i>inter alia</i>, a considerable <Col N="297" /> reduction in the number of centres providing acute treatment.</P>
    <P>The report goes on then to supplement this information and to say that in the opinion of those 18 members of the commission it is highly desirable that our hospital system should be in conformity with the demands of the 1970's, the 1980's and 1990's.  As far back as 1963 and 1964, when the regional surgeons were giving evidence before the Select Committee on Health Services, it was contended by them that we could only have a regional hospital based in a university city and that the reasons for that were obvious.  This means that we would have about three fully-fledged regional units.</P>
    <P>The reason they gave at that time was the fact that in these university cities all the faculties would be represented in the university, and that those hospitals would draw for personnel on the medical faculty, that they would have the specialised advice of the best laboratories, and that those regional units would be backed up by the best appointments, the best aids in medicines and the best personnel.  It was said, and postulated, and demonstrated, and, in fact, brought home to us as members of the committee, that those regional surgeons were right in their contention that if we wanted to provide for the future, if we wanted to see our population catered for in the realms of higher surgery, then regionalisation would have to come in one form or another.</P>
    <P>As I said previously, we shall be discussing this again at a later stage, but let us not from shortsighted motives, political motives, motives representing vested interests, or just mean carping motives, condemn the Minister's proposal out of hand, because it is going to be phased development which it will take at least 15 to 20 years to complete.  A start is being made here on the basis of this report. I am prepared to submit to the House that it is a good start and should not be condemned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to Deputy Carter, I am more pessimistic about this measure than I was before I came in here this evening.  Deputy Carter was a member of the health <Col N="298" /> committee which was established in 1961 when we re-assembled in this House.  Assessing the widespread indignation of the populace at that time concerning the inadequacy of the health services, the then Minister, Deputy MacEntee, was compelled to set up this health committee.  I doubt if any committee was in operation for so long, and did so little good.  Indeed, it did quite a lot of harm.</P>
      <P>It is true to say that this committee which sat for three years called quite a number of witnesses and compiled a lot of evidence.  There was a mass of reports, there were tons of waste paper, after that committee, but no tangible progress was made towards the improvement of our archaic health services.  Members of my Party, and, indeed, of the Fine Gael Party, on that committee realised that its constitution, its approach and attitude was merely a gigantic stalling device by the Government Party and the then Minister for Health.  Our patience wore out eventually and members of this Party resigned as a token of protest against the procrastination and overall attitude of ineptitude on the part of the Minister and the Government at that time.</P>
      <P>We then had the White Paper on the Health Services issued in January, 1966, by the late Deputy O'Malley. Worthwhile improvements were contained in this White Paper and it was anticipated that they would be given speedy implementation.  Instead of implementing what was contained in that White Paper in 1966 the Minister was not allowed to remain long in office.  He was switched to another Department lest the somewhat progressive objectives contained in the White Paper might be given effect to.  Nevertheless, I believe that what was contained in this White Paper was of very great benefit to the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Carter spoke about health being used as a political gimmick.  He ought to know very well that this is so, because his Party have used health in particular as a great political gimmick at all times.  Not the least of those gimmicks was this White Paper on the Health Services.  Very many important promises were made to our people in it.  It was said that the odious means test for medical cards would be eased <Col N="299" /> and liberalised, if not abolished altogether, that we would have a choice of doctor, and that the outmoded dispensary system would be abolished completely. It is over three years since that White Paper was formulated and, as yet, nothing has been done to achieve its objectives.</P>
    <P>We are not told in this Bill that these things will be done.  I think it pertinent to ask when they will be done.  I am concerned about the remarks of a man such as Deputy Carter who has obviously taken a very deep interest in all aspects of health.  He is one of the few Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party who have shown such an interest and consequently one is bound to take cognisance of what he says in this House.  I wonder is this merely another political gimmick because everyone now knows there is a general election in the offing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carter told us tonight that what is contained in this Bill are, in very large measure, long term objectives to be attained in 15 or 20 years time&mdash;a gradual implementation of these proposals to be attained in 15 or 20 years time.  I wonder does he reflect the views of the Minister in this regard.</P>

      <P>I listened carefully to what Deputy Carter said.  I believe he was trying to allay certain anxiety on our part in respect of what is contained in the Fitzgerald Report about the regionalisation of the hospital services by saying it would be phased over a relatively long number of years, <Col N="300" /> 15 or 20.  This is to take the sting out of a proposal which is so radical in its implications as to close down and wipe out altogether most of the hospitals in this country.  Certainly it will close down, and render redundant, and run down, all the hospitals in my county of Tipperary.  Not one hospital will remain, county or district, if and when the Fitzgerald Report is implemented.</P>
      <P>This Bill is an improvement on our health services in all it contains to implement the White Paper on the Health Services.  But the Bill also contains an outline of our future health system as recommended in the Fitzgerald Report which has been accepted in principle by the Minister.  This report, which, as yet, has got little publicity, when implemented, will have the most widespread repercussions on the lives of our people because it calls for radical changes in our hospital system.  It calls for the establishment of a relatively small number of regional and general hospitals based, at a minimum, some sixty miles apart.  It recommends that all hospitals in between, general or district, as the case might be, be abolished.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the eighteen gentlemen who drafted this report are very eminent specialists in the field of medicine, but what they are recommending here is the cold clinical approach to health and hospitalisation with little regard for the human considerations involved.  This is a report based on economy and efficiency of the clinical kind that one associates particularly with specialists in the field of health.  It may be economically wise to adopt it, but to my mind it is socially imprudent to embark upon a measure which will result in the closure of so many of our hospitals, thereby obliging people to travel considerable distances in order to receive medical attention.</P>
      <P>The mind boggles at the thought of a patient, critically ill, having to be transported some sixty miles to receive medical attention at a district, regional or general hospital as contained in these new proposals.  There is also the problem of the inability of relatives and friends to visit patients hospitalised so far away from home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the sacrifices made to <Col N="301" /> build up our hospital services within the various county council areas, it seems a tragedy that such a proposal should be contemplated.  When I consider the amount of money expended on these old workhouses, so to speak, these old buildings which we inherited from the British, and the transformation which has taken place as a result of the courage and devotion of county managers, medical men and county councillors and the modern facilities now provided for our people in the hospitals in our counties, the thought of their being closed up, the thought of the crows flying through the windows of these institutions, appals me.</P>
    <P>We appreciate fully the need for some form of regionalisation and specialisation.  We understand fully the need for economy and efficiency.  But this report is too far removed from the real needs of our people; and when our people realise what is contained in this report in regard to our future hospital system, I believe there will be consternation.  I do not think it has dawned on our people yet what is contained in this report.  It is a wise and astute tactic on the part of a Fianna Fáil Deputy here tonight to say: &ldquo;Do not worry unduly about this.  It will be implemented gradually, phased over a long period of time. This is for the 1970's and 1980's.  Do not worry about it in the meantime&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are being asked to legislate here for the implementation of this report. The Minister and his Government will have the authority to implement it as soon as this Bill is enacted.  If and when the Minister gets a mandate for the implementation of the Fitzgerald Report I fear very much&mdash;and I would welcome sincerely an indication about this from the Minister when he is replying&mdash;that the Minister will commit himself too much to this report and that it will result also in his Department refusing sanction to the necessary monies for the maintenance of our present hospitals, and that we shall see a deliberate policy of the gradual running down of those wonderful hospitals of ours for which we now have responsibility.  That is the sinister way in which our health authorities, as we know them, will be compelled to accept this radical change.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="302" /> I am naturally concerned about what will happen in my own constituency. My primary purpose in speaking here tonight is to indicate to the Minister the outright opposition and hostility of all public representatives of all Parties who have become aware of this report in so far as it affects the hospital services in Tipperary.  I want to place on record what this report states in reference to Tipperary hospitals.  I will quote now from page 110:</P>
    <P>At present there are county hospitals in Nenagh, Cashel and Clonmel. The hospital in Nenagh provides a general medical, surgical and maternity service for North Tipperary while the two hospitals in Cashel and Clonmel combine to provide a similar service for South Tipperary.  Our recommendation is that the role of these three hospitals should be changed to that of community health centres.  We realise that this recommendation involves leaving County Tipperary without its own hospital service.  It has been fundamental to our approach, however, that county boundaries have little or no relevance in the proper organisation of the hospital service and, in fact, many areas can more conveniently be served from centres in other counties.  Nenagh is less than 25 miles from Limerick on a fast, main road and we could not justify the development there of a hospital which would duplicate many of the services already available at Limerick General Hospital.  Cashel is about 36 miles from Limerick while Clonmel is less than 30 miles from Waterford.  We are satisfied that the areas now served by these hospitals can be fully catered for from the hospital centres in Cork, Limerick and Waterford.  In spite of the absence of a hospital within the county no potential patient will be at a greater distance than 60 miles from a well-equipped and staffed regional or general hospital (Vide Map 3).  There will, of course, be available locally the out-patient facilities provided by the consultant staffs of the main hospitals at the community health centres.</P>
    <P>This means, as the Fitzgerald Report <Col N="303" /> so clearly states, the closure of all the hospitals in the vast county of Tipperary. Not only does it mean the closure of the hospitals stipulated here&mdash;the surgical hospital at Cashel, the maternity hospital in Clonmel and the county hospital in Nenagh&mdash;but it also quite obviously recommends the closure of the other district hospitals as well: the hospital in Tipperary town, the hospital in Clogheen and the hospital in Carrick-on-Suir.</P>
    <P>The prospect is an appalling one for my constituents and we cannot be expected to lend our support to such a radical and far-reaching measure as this Bill which places one of the biggest counties in Ireland at the will and pleasure of other districts or regions. As I have said, without boasting, the members of our county council down through the years, irrespective of politics, have been a very dedicated group, particularly in respect of health. As the Minister well knows, we have made vast strides in building up our institutions at Cashel, Clonmel, Tipperary, Carrick and Clogheen.  We have not skimped on the monies required for improvements, extensions and maintenance.  All our hospitals are fitted with the most modern equipment and we have been blessed with an exceptional staff of doctors, sisters and nurses.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to contemplate the closure of a hospital in places like Clogheen or Carrick-on-Suir.  Clogheen has no industry of any kind.  It has a very high incidence of unemployment and it is noted for its abnormally high emigration.  The lovely hospital there is its status symbol.  It is the place of greatest social activity in the town.  There is an excellent service for the patients.  It serves a vast hinterland and anyone who visits it cannot but be impressed by the welcome extended and the happy relationship that exists between patients and staff. Everyone knows everyone else.  The doctor knows all his patients personally. There is a wonderful spirit of cordiality and goodwill.  That is bound to be conducive to speedy recovery. Yet, here we have a proposal that these people must in future go to <Col N="304" /> Cork, Limerick or Waterford, at the very nearest, for hospital treatment, to become digits in a large institution, numbers in a book, patients in an alien atmosphere, faced with an impersonal approach, to say the least of it.  It is a pity that the more human aspect of this problem has not been examined.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to say that this will be a gradual transformation. We challenge this policy in its entirety. We want to nip this proposed transformation in the bud.  It is significant that all the people who compiled this report on the future hospital system are all medical men.  Surely the layman's point of view ought to be considered?  We are the representatives of the people and I believe that I am tonight voicing the sentiments of my constituents in Tipperary and West Waterford.  I believe I know their needs, their hopes and their fears in regard to the implementation of a policy of this kind.  I lend my voice to the opposition to this measure.  I set my face against it.  I do not think it is good enough that specialists in any field should impose this kind of policy on our people.  I do not think it is good enough that a Government should lend itself to the implementation of this kind of policy without grave and compelling reasons.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the indecent haste with which the Minister adopted this Fitzgerald Report.  It is not very long off the printing press.  Other reports have been published for years, reports the Government have been loath to implement.  On the other hand, they are more than anxious to accept this radical document.  We were not unduly worried when we heard the Minister had accepted the report in principle but we are gravely concerned that he should ask us to give it the force of legislation with such speed.  I hope I shall never see the day when this is implemented.  I would appeal to the Minister to consult with the members of the health authorities on every phase of its implementation and to change this policy wherever the needs of local communities dictate it.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of this matter about which we are concerned.  There <Col N="305" /> is the setting up of the health boards, the membership of which will be comprised of not more than half members of local authorities and half members nominated at the instance of the Minister.  I understand the Minister has taken to himself the right to appoint the chairman of these boards and the vice-chairman as well.  Clearly, the Minister is seeing to it in the structure of these boards that he will have an overall majority for the implementation of his policy at any given time.</P>
    <P>I would look with disfavour upon a health policy which was implemented at the behest of the medical men, at the behest of the bureaucrats or even at the behest of the Minister.  Our feeling is that whatever health policy we conceive and implement should, in the main, be implemented at the behest of and with the approval of all the people and not of one clique&mdash;be it the medical profession or an overbearing group of bureaucrats.  Undue Government interference or overbearing control should not be tolerated in respect of the implementation or administration of our health services. The voice of the common people must be heard.  It is the people that we are concerned with.  We are not concerned, in this Party at any rate, with placating any clique or professional interest.  We are not concerned about conceding to any Government undue control over the affairs of our health services.  It is appreciated that the more the State subscribes to the maintenance of our health services, the more they will be entitled to have a say and control in the health services.  At the present time, the contribution would be approximately 50 per cent.  Let us have an equal say but let us not have domination by any one section.  We are concerned lest a Minister would bow to the dictates of vested interests in matters of this kind.  We would hope, as a Party which has consistently cried out in this House and in the country for a free health scheme embracing all our people, that the community's health requirements would be met without regard to money and that need would be the sole criteria which would apply.</P>
    <P>We welcome the improvements in <Col N="306" /> this Bill.  We welcome the intention to implement the good things in the White Paper on the Health Services. It is long overdue.  We welcome as important the liberalisation of the means tests for medical cards, making clear the eligibility for medical cards and clearing away the ambiguity and doubt which existed as to who was and who was not entitled to a medical card.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carter seemed to infer that there was nothing fundamentally wrong with our present health services. He re-echoed the sentiment of the ex-Minister for Health, Deputy MacEntee, who always consistently maintained that our health service&mdash; the present health service: it has not changed an iota since his time&mdash;was adequate for the needs of our people. That was one of the last sentiments he expressed here before he resigned as a Cabinet Minister.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Anyone who tries to maintain that point of view is completely out of touch with the people.  It will be denied by anyone who understands the frustration and fear of not being able to afford doctor's fees or to pay for costly drugs or medicines, by anyone who understands the ingrained fear and worry of individuals and families about the prospect of going to hospital and not being able to pay the bill there.</P>
    <P>There are countless thousands in this country who have been putting off receiving badly-needed medical attention because of inability to pay the doctor or the specialist.  There are others who, having started treatment, are unable to continue the course of medicine prescribed because of the inordinate cost involved.  We know these things to be a fact.  We know the concern felt about the odious means test involved in granting medical cards. We know how humiliating it is for our working class people to be exposed to rigorous investigation by a home assistance officer&mdash;the interrogation, the searching inquiry into their innermost private lives, the compilation of a report on the income of all the members of the household, whether or not they be members of the family.  All of that was taken into account and, instead <Col N="307" /> of being granted the medical card, you were told you were virtually a millionaire and should not be looking for a medical card.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish reflected the views of the Labour Party when he said that we regard the means test as utterly contemptible. The people of the lower income group and the working classes generally are the only people to whom these means tests are applied.  As he pointed out, in respect of grants for new houses, grants for house repairs, grants for farm enterprises and the like, there are no means tests of this rigorous kind.  These grants are given on merit and on merit alone.  We wonder why we have held on for so long to this degrading system.  Too many people have suffered under this degrading system for far too long.</P>
    <P>We welcome the change.  We welcome the proposal for a choice of doctor and we hope the Minister will find it possible to have this choice in every area.  We appreciate his difficulty in outlying areas and in sparsely populated areas but wherever it is feasible or practicable let us have a choice of doctor.  Let us not forget that this was a most demoralising piece of legislation which condemned medical card holders, the mass of our people, to one doctor but if you had money you had all the choice in the world.  The medical card holder was tied to the dispensary doctor and the doctor was tied to that patient.  Was it any wonder that with this natural ingrained desire for a choice of doctor thousands of medical card holders were exercising a choice and going to a doctor other than the dispensary doctor and paying him?</P>
    <P>The lack of a choice of doctor was particularly unjust.  It condemned the doctor to continuing to provide treatment for a patient whom he may not have liked and it condemned the patient to continuing to accept treatment from a doctor whom he did not like.  Obviously this was not conducive to good relations or good health.  The proposal to have a choice of doctor is long overdue.  I also hope that something will be done to end the long queues we find at our dispensaries.  Of course, the Minister proposes to <Col N="308" /> abolish the dispensaries in certain areas.  He has not said precisely how the people will be provided with their drugs and medicines but presumably the doctor will issue prescriptions and the people will be entitled to go to the chemist of their choice.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This has not yet been made too clear.  Where the dispensaries are to continue I would ask the Minister to ensure that reasonable comfort will be provided for doctors and patients, that there will be adequate lighting, heating and seating and that adequate privacy will be provided as between patient and doctor. In dispensaries where large numbers are congregating I hope that the courtesy of providing a cup of tea for sick patients, who may be waiting, perhaps, for an hour or two before their turn, will be extended to them, or some little refreshment, especially for patients who have come long distances.  This is being done in most of our better-run dispensaries and clinics but sometimes it is forgotten and we hear justifiable complaints about a lack of regard for sick patients waiting unduly long periods in clinics or dispensaries without any refreshment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whenever I go to a doctor I am too nervous to sit down. I keep walking up and down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, you go to a doctor in his surgery but I am talking about people who are obliged to queue up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and wait a long time.  I agree that people are nervous on these occasions and that is all the more reason why they should get some refreshments.  Even a &ldquo;half one&rdquo; would do.  I also welcome the regard shown in the Bill for the care of the aged, the principle that their hospitalisation should be cut to a minimum and that the emphasis should be on the care of the aged in their homes.  Something has already been done along these lines and our very many voluntary organisations are to be congratulated for what they are doing for the aged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="309" /> The Meals on Wheels organisation and the many other social groups of that kind are doing great work in bringing succour, relief and comfort to these aged folk.  I am glad that the Minister has now facilitated the health authorities by financing to a much greater extent the wonderful endeavours of the voluntary organisations who at great sacrifice, in time, energy, effort and finance, are doing such wonderful work.</P>
    <P>In my speech on the Minister's Supplementary Estimate I referred to nurses at some length and I merely wish to reiterate briefly what I then said.  I should like to see a greater appreciation of the wonderful work nurses are performing and a due regard for their educational attributes.  I should also like them to have reasonable promotional opportunities to progress to the position of ward sister or matron in their respective hospitals.  It has been a matter of concern to me for a long time that we do not provide sufficient training opportunities for nurses, and because many of them are unable to gain admission to our hospitals they have to go to England to be trained.  This position should not be allowed to continue.  There should be designated centres where girls who wish to make a career of nursing would have the opportunity of being trained, in an Irish environment, so that the benefit of their wonderful experience would be given to our own people.</P>
    <P>One of the most distressing duties a public representative has to perform is to try to get hospitalisation or proper institutional treatment for mentally or physically handicapped. Improvements are taking place in this field today with the help of the religious orders and very many other dedicated people and it is becoming easier to find accommodation in a proper institution for the mentally and physically retarded.  It is easier to find a bed for such people, especially for the mildly retarded, but it is still extremely difficult to secure proper institutional treatment for the severely mentally retarded.  It is deplorable that so many of these relatively young boys are finding their way into our mental hospitals.  This is not a proper environment for boys of that kind and <Col N="310" /> it is a very black spot on our health services that this position should be allowed continue.  The Minister should strive to make a great break-through in regard to severely handicapped children and provide, at least, proper institutional treatment for them.  It is also important that more and more employment opportunities should be provided for the retarded.  I applaud the great work done in this sphere by voluntary associations in the provision of work for those mentally or physically retarded.  I congratulate all those engaged in this great work of mercy and also the employers who, more and more, realise that these trained people, although seemingly handicapped, can be very competent and highly productive. I appeal to employers to engage such boys and girls in gainful employment.</P>
    <P>My primary purpose here tonight was to express my views on the Fitzgerald Report in particular and to ask the Minister to be very slow in implementing it.  Deputy Carter gave me a gleam of hope when he referred to the phasing of 15 or 20 years but I hope it will be nearer 100 years before all the radical changes in this report see the light of day.  I compliment the Minister on introducing the improvements now envisaged.  We are a Party of whom it can be never said that we did not provide the necessary money to improve health services.  The health of our people is of primary importance and at every opportunity we are pleased to support an advance towards the attainment of the ideal of a happy, contented and healthy community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage of the debate there is little left to say.  While I welcome the attempt to modernise present health legislation, I am disappointed with some of the proposals in the Bill and with some of the omissions.  Society demands and expects those who are better off to provide for those less well off.  In a Christian community, such as that in which we live, any Government legislating to eradicate many of our ills should be a most popular Government.  Deputy Carter said that very often Opposition Members criticise the Government for <Col N="311" /> spending money on health services. For the record, I want to say that any criticisms I have made were not of the spending of monies on health services but of mismanagement and misspending.</P>
      <P>When these proposals were first circulated in 1966 we were promised many things.  It was not too late to think about the inadequate health services we provide.  Comparisons have been made between the British health and social services and those existing here.  Again, Deputy Carter went to great lengths to indicate that the British people now consider that their health services and social services generally have failed.  I do not know what fairytale the Deputy has been reading: in my opinion, coming from a parish divided by the Border where one part of it has the benefit of the British health services while the other half must tolerate the 1953 Health Act as introduced by the then Minister, Deputy MacEntee, there is, in reality, no comparison.  However, one must be realistic.  The British health and social services in my opinion are without parallel anywhere in the world. We are a very humble nation and can only provide what we can afford and, therefore, it is unfair to make the comparison I have made.  I do so only to put in proper perspective Deputy Carter's arguments.</P>
      <P>Deputy Carter would have us believe that the health services initiated by Fianna Fáil in 1953 are the last word in meeting our needs.  Far from it.  There are far too many people at present in need of specialised care and far too many entitled to and expecting services and not getting them.  It is not too late to introduce the present Bill.  While I have the utmost respect for Deputy Flanagan, the Minister for Health, I think this Bill is designed more to hit the headlines than to hit the target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Treacy concluded his speech by mentioning the mentally handicapped and it is peculiar that I should begin where he left off.  It is even more peculiar that I am prepared to put on the record of the House that the Minister is more conscious of the need in this field than possibly any other <Col N="312" /> Minister of whom I know.  I believe that the Minister has been left such an impossible task by all his predecessors that he will fail in his endeavours unless something is done quickly.</P>
    <P>The mentally handicapped child falls into three categories, generally speaking, the mild, the moderate and the severe.  While the mild cases are generally the responsibility of the Department of Education, to some extent they are the responsibility also of the Department of Health.  The moderately handicapped child is the responsibility of the Department of Health and much more accommodation is needed for this type of child.  This is a type of child that to some extent has been the embarrassment of the family in years gone by.  He was pushed into the backroom and forgotten.  This is a child who could be trained in home-crafts and who could make some use of his life if given a reasonable chance. We, in this country, have been more concerned with building skyscraper flats with wall to wall carpets in the city than in looking after our retarded children.  Indeed, we as Members of this Parliament are not without blame because we agreed to tremendous expenditure for extra office accommodation for this building which, of course, was necessary but we did it at a time when so much money was needed to provide accommodation for the moderately handicapped child.</P>
    <P>As I see it, whatever chance a moderately handicapped child has if he is accepted into an institution he will have no chance whatsoever if he is not given this opportunity.  Too often, when such a child reaches the age of 16 or 17 years, there is no provision for him.  Of the categories I have mentioned, I consider the severely handicapped child as presenting the greatest problem.</P>
    <P>We reached the situation in Donegal where the county council was forced to convert a fever hospital into a unit for severely handicapped children under the age of 12 years.  The position is that if a child is not admitted to an institution his parents must keep him at home and when the child reaches the age of 16 or 17 years he is forced by circumstances or otherwise to be admitted <Col N="313" /> to a mental hospital, the very place to which he or she should never be admitted.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in this Bill, as I see it, which will solve this problem. The situation in Donegal is such that if a child is under the age of 12 years and on a waiting list he will be admitted to Carndonagh Fever Hospital but if the child is one month over 12 years&mdash;I might add here that the days of the year have very little meaning for a child who is severely mentally handicapped&mdash;he will be kept at home until such time as he will be admitted to a mental institution.  I should like the Minister for Health to pay particular attention to this matter.</P>
    <P>I had occasion during the past few weeks to ventilate in this House my views on how money is mishandled and misspent.  Donegal County Council handed over St. Columba's Hospital, Killybegs, to the Department of Education and the Department of Education with the consent of the Minister for Education agreed to expend £181,000 &mdash;the figure which the Minister claims is the final one but which I dispute&mdash; on converting the hospital into a hotel training school when the hospital could have been converted into a unit to cater for 60 mentally handicapped children at a cost of between £7,000 and £10,000.  This estimate was given to the county council by the county engineer but the proposal was shot down.</P>
    <P>The local association for the mentally handicapped were forced to purchase a hotel seven miles away for conversion into a hospital to cater for those children.  I must say that the Minister gave a handsome grant to the organisation which is a voluntary one to help them purchase the hotel.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Carter misunderstands my position all I ask is that he would be a little more observant or that he would at least read the Dáil debates when they are presented to him.  If he does this he will find that I never protested against expenditure under any health headings as long as I was satisfied that the money was spent properly.  A sum of £22,000 was spent on the purchase of a hotel in one part of the county and we are spending another <Col N="314" /> £16,000 on preparing it to cater for about 30 mentally handicapped girls while in the northern part of the county, Donegal County Council have spent a large sum of money to help cater for 18 severely handicapped children. Is this bureaucracy going wild? We have a situation in which civil servants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was about to make was that the Minister proposes to appoint chief executive officers on the regional boards and I am pinpointing that we will have civil servants making decisions that local county councillors will support.  Civil servants are being given far too much authority as proposed in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, the Chair would remind the Deputy that the Minister for Health is responsible for the administration of the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have the power to appoint chief executive officers and other assistants to the regional boards and the point I am making is that public representatives are in a much better position to adjudicate on what is right and wrong having had the facts placed before them.  Very often people placed in positions of authority become wildly enthusiastic and, without being too harsh, they indulge in a lot of daydreaming such as is envisaged in the <i>Outline of the Future Hospital System.</i> Page 97 of that report refers to Letterkenny General Hospital.  I must say here that I agree substantially with the report except in so far as page 97 is concerned where there is a reference to the district hospitals in Dungloe and Carndonagh but there is no reference to the Lifford hospital.  There is a story behind this which might be of some help to the House.  It was proposed to close the Lifford Hospital in 1958.  I might say it was the first time I became actively engaged in public life.  The Department of Health decided they would <Col N="315" /> close Lifford Hospital when the new County Hospital at Letterkenny was opened and the local committee only asked that the county council should wait until the new county hospital was actually opened before they closed Lifford Hospital.  That was quite a modest request but it took about six meetings to get a decision.  Needless to remark Lifford Hospital is still open and is almost full to capacity any time I visit it.  The only protest I have got to make in this regard is that it has been downgraded and is now a unit more for geriatrics than an ordinary district hospital.  I have a feeling that bureaucracy is again playing its part in trying to run this hospital down so that it will be closed eventually.  If there was no use for it I would be the first to admit it.  Like Deputy Treacy, I feel that another look should be given to the matter of closing hospitals and that none of them should be closed until we are satisfied that it is essential to close them.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister did not say what he intends to do about fosterage. When the Minister had his Supplementary Estimate before the House recently I dealt in great detail with the problem of fosterage.  In this country we have children being brought up in criminal conditions.  I do not want to go into this in detail because I have already done so, but I am not at all satisfied that the Department of Health are doing what they should be doing to solve this problem.  Suffice it to say that every child brought into this world is entitled to family conditions and that a child will grow up recognising right from wrong in a more natural way when part of a family than in an institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are prepared to pay as much as £7 10s per week for the maintenance of a child in an institution and we have local health authorities paying as little as 13/6d per week for the maintenance of a child in boarded out conditions with foster parents.  I might add that I have already stated, and it is on the records of the House, that Donegal County Council are paying the highest amount <Col N="316" /> in this country at £2 per week.  I cannot understand, when there is so much accommodation needed for mentally handicapped children and for geriatrics, why we allow strong healthy children to remain in institutions when they could be boarded out to foster parents.</P>
    <P>When I was speaking on the Minister's Supplementary Estimate I mentioned some details and I asked the Minister to let me have the total number of children in fosterage in this country at the moment.  I have not yet received those figures and, perhaps, the Minister might have them for me when the Dáil meets tomorrow morning at 10.30.  At that stage I would again discuss the question of foster children.</P>
    <P>In Great Britain last year the British Government amalgamated the Departments of Health and Social Welfare. I believe it is high time we in this country followed suit.  The present health system is controlled basically at local authority level by the superintendent officer who is more a social welfare worker than a health worker. Needless to say 75 per cent or 80 per cent of his work relates to health and medical cards.  I believe that, if the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare were amalgamated, a better return would be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carter, when speaking earlier, said that we on this side of the House criticised the present health structure and he, in turn, welcomed the new Bill.  Deputy Carter went to great pains to explain that the Fine Gael proposals for an insurance system would not work.  Before he concluded he praised very highly the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme.  This is a change of heart for Deputy Carter because when Deputy Tom O'Higgins, as Minister for Health, introduced the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme in 1957 it was criticised by the Fianna Fáil Party as being a scheme for the lazy rich.  They said it would not solve any of the health problems experienced in the lower and middle income groups. The Fianna Fáil Party contended at that time that this is what would happen.  It is only in recent times they have come around to accept that the Voluntary Health Insurance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I must apologise, first, for keeping this very responsible Minister back tonight, but I think in the interests of the public it is necessary to clear up the situation in regard to the desertion of the Fine Gael and Labour group of the Dublin Corporation. We know that today when Deputy S. Dunne was at the wake with his pallbearers, Messrs.  Butler, Dunne, O'Shea and Inglis, Deputy Ryan was laying a wreath on the tomb at the City Hall.  This is in keeping with the mentality of the Fine Gael and Labour group.  Having deserted their posts and having failed the people, they now try to convey to them that they have reached the stage of wakes and wreaths.  In a short time the people will have another opportunity of giving Deputy S. Dunne and his Labour colleagues, with Deputy Ryan and his <Col N="318" /> colleagues, some wreaths also when the election comes about.</P>
      <P>The number of Fianna Fáil councillors in the council was 16 and the total opposition was 29 other members. During the course of the discussion in relation to the estimates of various committees&mdash;the various committees which were presided over by Fine Gael, Labour and independent chairmen&mdash;Fine Gael and Labour passed and adopted all the estimates of the various committees.  When we got this group of people who eventually decided to betray the citizens of this city to go in committee behind closed doors they voted in favour of making no change in the estimates and recommended to the council that the rate be adopted.  This was the type of individual we had in Fine Gael and Labour, who said one thing behind closed doors and something else in the open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the city council are well aware of the situation in relation to the reduction sought in the health estimates. A reduction of almost £2 million in the health services was demanded by the Fine Gael and Labour groups.  This means that the unfortunate weaker sections of the community in the city would be deprived of essential medical services&mdash;drugs, medical cards and the other services that go to people in need of them.  It would mean the closing down of the Dublin Health Authority with all the unemployment that would follow.  It would mean a desertion of the workers of this city by the Labour group in conjunction with the Fine Gael Party.  This is not new.  It is not the first time this clique decided to desert the nation and the workers of this city.  We are aware that in 1951 they fell asunder trying to introduce the Health Act which we heard so much about in the discussions in Dublin Corporation.  Then the Government ran away from their responsibilities even though they had a majority in Dáil Éireann.  In the second Coalition Government they ran away from their responsibilities in the middle of the night even though they had a majority in Dáil Éireann.  In the third Coalition of Labour and Fine Gael in the Corporation, members of the Fine Gael and Labour Party ran away from their <Col N="319" /> responsibilities rather than strike the rate.  This gives another indication of their complete irresponsibility when the going gets tough and problems arise. If there is a fourth Coalition of Fine Gael and Socialists the people might have to run away because there will be nothing left for them.</P>
    <P>If the Dublin Health Authority sued for the amount of £870,000 which they were duly entitled to if the estimates had been passed by the council, then it would mean a reduction in some of the other services of the corporation.  I do not know whether Deputy S. Dunne, Deputy Ryan and their colleagues wanted the rents of the corporation houses increased by 15/- or 10/- per week.  This would be the amount required to meet the deficiency which would then mean an overall rent increase of 15/- per week to the people of Drimnagh, Ballyfermot and other centres.  This was one of the means that could be adopted if the amount was to be met by way of an increase in the housing estimate.  On the other hand, they could have abolished altogether the cleaning services of the city, thereby saving £850,000 which is approximately the amount they tried to short-charge the city.  They could have suspended the fire services and have caused complete unemployment in the various other services.  This was a direct attack on the workers of this city and on the corporation in an effort to throw men out of employment by a reduction in the estimates of the city council.</P>
    <P>We are aware that the Fianna Fáil group measured up in full to their responsibilities.  We wanted to ensure that the increases which were granted in the Labour Court last year to the workers in the public services would be honoured in full.  It was our intention to ensure that the workers of this city got in full the amount of monies it was agreed they would get by way of compensation for the various increases which had taken place, but Fine Gael and Labour again deserted the workers of this city by failing to provide the necessary monies so that they could get their legitimate increases.  It is not the first occasion, and probably will <Col N="320" /> not be the last, that Fine Gael and Labour deserted the workers.  I do not know whether it was by cutting down on the health or housing estimates or on the estimates for other services like fire fighting or cleansing services that they wished to obtain the money; however, it was clear that some services would have to go by the board to the tune of probably £1.7 million.  This would mean substantial unemployment for the workers of this city and we would not allow it happen.  We would not allow this gimmick by the Labour Party and Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>We know the gimmick that was eventually introduced by Deputy S. Dunne&mdash;the Dunne gimmick as it is now known&mdash;when he sought legal advice on a Minister's directive to council. He knew at that time this particular demand was lawful.  Nevertheless, he sought to impose on the backs of the ratepayers and the rentpayers of this city an additional burden which they should not have to bear.  The Dunne gimmick&mdash;which now goes down in history as one of the gimmicks of the last council&mdash;is not the only discreditable act of the members of the Labour and Fine Gael group in the last council.  This particular gimmick was ill-advised by very bad lawyers, probably the lawyers that assisted in the drawing up of the Cuban Socialist policy which we have heard so much about in the past.  If they want to treat the people of this country as Cubans they are mistaken, because we will not allow them to do so.  That goes for the Fine Gael group also.</P>
    <P>We will ensure that the people of the city get the services they require and which we are bound to provide for them.  We know exactly the type of mentality in the Fine Gael group who, year after year, walked out from the council.  Their desertion did not start this year.  It started many years ago when these people trotted out of the council and failed to measure up to their responsibilities when the striking of the rate took place.  When they were in power it was a different situation. We had a Leader of Fine Gael stating that they should accept joint responsibility for the health services and that if they were made a national <Col N="321" /> charge there would have to be national taxation and indirect taxation to meet the cost.  This is what they said when they were in power.  What they did in opposition was different from what they said when they were in power.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the Labour tomb is now vacant.  This, of course, is nothing new.  I know Labour do not want to hear the truth of the situation.  While the council were in operation, Labour ran away from tackling the problems of many Irish workers.  On one occasion they discredited the trade union concerned by having pickets removed from City Hall so that they could discuss petrol pumps.  Petrol pumps were more important to them than the provision of services to the citizens.  On the same occasion they offered another insult to the unions, with the connivance of Fine Gael, by pushing them away from the Mansion House.  They allowed people to go into the Round Room to scavenge&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Because of their activities, an official had to be appointed in order that the city services would be operated and in order that the workers of the city would get the services and the rights to which they are entitled.  The Fine Gael-Labour group have demanded money for additional services as have the Independent members of the corporation and the ratepayers' representatives, but when it came to the crunch they voted against the provision of the money to finance those schemes.  They voted against the provision of swimming pools for the people of Drimnagh and Ballyfermot and by voting against the striking of the rate, they voted against the provision of these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Madame Tussaud will arrive here tomorrow to ensure that we will have the images of Deputy S. Dunne and the others who paraded today, a thing they were not entitled to do.  It was a clear indication of the irresponsibility of the two groups.  It is an indication to the country at large that we have two political Parties who are prepared to cut out the necessary services for <Col N="322" /> the aged, the blind, the widows and the orphans.  They were prepared to let the citizens go without hospital services. Labour and Fine Gael had no regard for the old or the sick.  From the rush to the public houses after the corporation meeting, it is apparent they have no respect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Labour's unconcern for the poor of the city was recently brought home clearly when they wanted to impose on the ratepayers of the city a sum of £46,000 in increased charges for the abattoir to benefit profit-making businessmen.  These two groups were in league with those profit-making people. They wanted to ensure that the money which would be provided by the people in Ballyfermot and Coolock would go into the pockets of those people, the operators of the abattoir.  That is the type of council we had.  They were prepared to put £46,000 into the pockets of the profit-makers but they were not prepared to vote for the extra services which the citizens need.  That is an indication of the hypocrisy of Fine Gael and Labour.  They are the type of people who give failure a bad name.</P>

Deputy James Tully instructed them to leave the House and he, too, is upstairs.  They are renegades to the people of Dublin who will never forget their irresponsibility.  An Independent member of the City Council for Dublin South Central said early on that he would do all in his power to ensure that the proposed rate would be reduced by 5/3d.  He could have tried to reduce it by 10/- and this would still further have reduced the services for the city over which we had control.  It shows the lack of regard Mr. O'Rourke had for the citizens of Dublin South Central.  Of course he is one of the vice-chairmen who, as well as sending <Col N="323" /> letters to the Pope, engaged in a few other jobs.  I do not know where Deputy Ryan is tonight.

      <P>This is an attack on a man who has given a lifetime of loyal service to this State and not to any political Party, a man who has served with distinction under 12 Ministers for Local Government.  Deputy Ryan, as the agent of the Fine Gael Party, comes in here with these niggling, petulant and scurrilous questions to try to get material which he thinks he can use to undermine the character of the man who has been appointed as Commissioner to administer the affairs of Dublin Corporation, which Deputy Ryan was so much instrumental in seeing could not be administered by the representatives whom the people elected to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This adjournment debate arises because of the attempt by the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition in Dublin Corporation to continue here in this House the scandalous political play-acting that they have been indulging in in the Dublin Corporation over the past couple of months and, indeed, I may say over practically the whole period of office of this City Council. The time of Dublin City Council has been taken up almost entirely with matters that are no concern of the corporation and the work that the corporation should be doing has been going by default.  At committee level, of course, these same people have, in fact, been controlling the affairs of the Dublin Corporation because they have a majority there and if there are any excess provisions made in regard to the services in Dublin it is Fine Gael's and Labour's responsibility.  Throughout the year they have been taking the decisions that require the raising of a certain amount of revenue but when it <Col N="325" /> comes to the taking of the final step in their year's activities they run out, as Deputy Dowling said, on their responsibilities and, to quote the former Fine Gael Minister for Health, Deputy T. F. O'Higgins who, I understand, having been ejected from his former constituency of Laois/Offaly, is now aspiring to be one of my colleagues in South County Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Political play-acting is the way he described a very determined attempt in 1956 by the Fianna Fáil Members of Dublin Corporation to bring home to him the desirability of having health charges paid by the State.  I was a member of Dublin Corporation at that time and I remember that there was an increase required in the rate for Dublin City that was at least as serious as the present increase and mainly due to the health charges.  We protested about it and the members of Dublin Corporation who were Members of this House protested about it here and they were castigated by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins as Minister for Health for daring to suggest that it was appropriate that health charges should be paid by the Central Exchequer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>When Fianna Fáil suggested this they were told it was political play-acting.  He threatened them with what would happen if they continued it but Deputy Bob Briscoe was Chairman of the Finance Committee of Dublin Corporation and when it came to the time of decision, when it came to the striking of the rate, Deputy Briscoe, because he was a Fianna Fáil representative, had as his primary concern the welfare of the <Col N="326" /> citizens of Dublin.  He undertook his responsibility and proposed the striking of the rate so that, first of all, the citizens of Dublin would not be deprived of the essential services administered by the local authority.</P>
      <P>That is the contrast between the whole mentality of the people who are on the different sides of this House. Fianna Fáil believe in honouring their responsibilities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and in this case it imposed on them the obligation of supporting the striking of a rate to provide for the services that had been decided by the Dublin Corporation.  They undertook to do that, but for mere political play-acting the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition decided to deprive the citizens of involvement in local government and decided deliberately to bring about the dissolution of the City Council.</P>
      <P>These questions were intended to furnish material for a Fine Gael whispering campaign against the person who has been appointed Commissioner. I do not think there is any need for me to defend him.  His career is one of devoted service to the State. He has served loyally under 12 different Ministers for Local Government. of different Parties.  He has 41 years service, 18 of those as Secretary of the Department of Local Government. Probably because of the fact that he had such long service as Secretary of one of the busiest Departments of State he decided to retire earlier than the retiring age.  He was entitled to do that. He had given this loyal and devoted service.</P>
      <P>It is a disgraceful thing that he should be attacked here by anybody but it is particularly contemptible that he should be attacked by an individual who also has a Civil Service record but not a record that can be examined in the open light of day, a man who served for the short period of three years, a period coterminous with the period of office of the last Coalition Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
