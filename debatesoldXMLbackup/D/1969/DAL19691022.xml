      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say if there has been any request for such a discussion since 1st May last?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The request was made at the end of April and maintained during May but, then, as I shall be explaining in the course of my statement later on, there were difficulties of convenience on both sides; on the one hand, for the British Prime Minister and, on the other hand, for me.  The matter was not eventually pursued.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The request was made towards the end of April and frequent inquiries were made during the couple of weeks following that as to when it would be possible to have such a meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether an invitation was extended to any public representatives from the Six County area to speak in other countries on the Six County situation; if so, if he will state the names of those invited and the criteria employed in making the selection; and whether it is proposed to continue this arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No invitation of this kind was extended by or on behalf of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say if Mr. McAteer was invited by any group on this side of the Border to speak on this problem on the Continent recently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that Mr. McAteer spoke on at least one occasion recently on the Continent at the invitation of an organisation in the Hague.  The invitation was conveyed to him through our Department of External Affairs and the Government Information Bureau but it was not extended to him by us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Government Information Bureau have anything <Col N="1303" /> to do with extending the invitation in the first place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can understand it, this group asked our Ambassador in The Hague for a number of names of people who would be in a position to give an <i>exposé</i> of the situation in the Six Counties.  The name of Mr. McAteer was amongst those mentioned as he, apparently, was known in Brussels among people of this organisation.  They immediately expressed a preference for Mr. McAteer and the invitation was then extended to him.  He went of his own volition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say whether a preference was indicated for a politician like Mr. McAteer and whether, in fact, no encouragement was given to an invitation to any civil rights speaker to speak at such functions?  I note that Senator McGill of the Nationalist Party spoke elsewhere.  Would the Taoiseach ensure that the civil rights people, who have borne the heat of this campaign, are regarded as people suitable to speak on this subject?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no responsibility whatever for the lists or categories of people.  Regarding Senator McGill, I understand that Mr. McAteer was invited to speak on the second occasion by a different organisation. He was unable to attend on that occasion and he suggested Senator McGill as a substitute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the Government Information Bureau will continue to mount a publicity campaign to deal with the present situation in the Six Counties; <Col N="1304" /> the present staffing position of the Bureau; and whether a limit has been set to the secondment of public relations officers from semi-State bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with the first part of this question in the course of the forthcoming debate on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The staff of the Government Information Bureau consists of a director, two assistant directors, an assistant, a deputy assistant, four staff officers, and four clerical assistants.  To assist in providing a special news service on the situation in the Six Counties, this staff was augmented by the addition of personnel on loan from other Departments of State or seconded from semi-State bodies.  There are at present attached to the bureau thirteen officers qualified in publicity and public relations work, nine of whom are serving abroad, assisted by an executive officer and three clerical assistants.</P>
      <P>While there is a continuing need to meet the demand created abroad by the awakened interest in Irish affairs, some of the personnel who have been engaged in the expanded news service are being released.  It is not possible, however, to state when the secondment of all the public relations staff involved will terminate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach indicate what exactly is the purpose of the publicity campaign?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be dealing with that in my statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if in view of the non-sectarian tradition of society in the Republic he will inform the House of the Government's intentions concerning the all party committee's report on the Constitution which specifically referred to Article 44. 1. 2º and 3º of the Constitution of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he proposes to hold an early referendum on Article 44 of the Constitution and at the same time to hold a referendum to amend the Constitution so as to provide for the granting <Col N="1305" /> of votes in this country to all who have reached the age of 18 years; and when such referendum will be held.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <P>8.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <P>9.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has considered drafting a new Constitution in conformity with the recommendations of the all party committee on the Constitution; whether the committee will reconvene; and, if so, if its terms of reference will enjoin the drawing up of a new Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>10.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if it is intended to reconvene the all party committee on the Constitution to review the possibility of having all party agreement on a referendum relating to Article 44 and any other articles in the Constitution which might be amended at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 10 together.</P>
      <P>As I suggested in the course of a radio interview on the 21st September last, if Article 44 of the Constitution is regarded as an obstacle to the reunification of Ireland, the Government would be prepared to initiate a proposal for an appropriate amendment of that Article.  A proposal for the deletion of sub-sections 2º and 3º of section 1 of that Article, which was recommended by the Informal Committee on the Constitution, and which &mdash; I understand &mdash; was recently approved by the two Parties of the Opposition, would probably receive a wide measure of general support.  Pending full and detailed consideration of all aspects of the matter, however, I am not at present in a position to furnish any more definite indication of the Government's intentions in regard to the amendment of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1306" /> As regards Question No. 8, the position is still as set out in the reply given by me to a similar question asked by Deputy Cosgrave on the 8th February, 1968, in so far as the recommendations of the committee, other than that relating to Article 44 of the Constitution, are concerned.  As regards the points mentioned in Questions Nos. 9 and 10, concerning the terms of reference of the committee and the possibility of reconvening it, I would refer the Deputies concerned to the reply given by the former Tánaiste on my behalf on the 21st July, 1967, in which it was indicated that the procedure of the committee is a matter for the committee itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's reply, may I ask him, in view of the fact that this change has been specifically recommended by the all-party committee on the Constitution and the fact that there is widespread support throughout the country for such a change, and particularly following the Taoiseach's statement that this would require further detailed and full consideration by the Government, would he consider it opportune to revive the Committee on the Constitution with the possibility of setting in train the course of development which he would wish?  We would like to see an all-party, unanimous approach to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the all-party committee completed that part of their work which concerned suggesting amendments to or alterations of the Constitution.  I do not believe there would be any point in bringing the committee back for that specific purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was set up to abolish PR and it failed in its work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It failed in its work but those who opposed it failed in their purpose as well.  When the time comes for any amendments that seem necessary, full consultation will be held with the Opposition parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach feels he has no function in reconvening the committee on the Constitution but if he <Col N="1307" /> feels that this whole question should be given further deliberation, could he not be a little more specific in informing the House through what channels these deliberations will take place and when, if ever, the Government may be able to make a firmer statement of their intentions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not clear that in relation to the suggested amendment of Article 44 and other matters there should now be in existence an all-party committee to consider Northern Ireland affairs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That might yet be premature, but as Deputy Thornley's question relates to Article 44 only, it would not be necessary to reconvene the all-party committee.  It would not be necessary to reconvene the all-party committee on Article 44 only.  That has been well discussed already.  If there is a desire to reconvene the all-party committee then it is for the existing members through the chairman of the committee to make suitable arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Taoiseach has set no time limit whatsoever and in view of the other statements on his part that this would occur when the time comes and in view of the consensus of opinion nationally that this should come about, and particularly in view of the interest in Northern Ireland in this Article, could the Taoiseach not see his way, in order to avoid further equivocation and further disquiet and cynicism in Northern Ireland in relation to this Article, to give a more positive and definite indication to the House as to when he might be in a position to give information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid not.  I will be dealing with this matter in the course of my statement shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if the Government have considered the merit of granting votes at 18 years of age and, if so, what decision was taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That has not been <Col N="1308" /> considered formally by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it likely to be considered by the Government since action in this matter has been taken by other Governments or lesser democratic institutions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at an early date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach says this matter has not been considered by the Government, is the Taoiseach saying that the report of the committee on the Constitution was not considered by the Government, as this was one of the recommendations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I told the House before that the recommendations of this committee were not binding on any party, much less on the Government.  Any party is entitled to consider them.  We considered them in a broad way after this report was published, but we did not consider them specifically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The report was not considered at all.  We wasted our time for six months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will arrange that all important policy statements by members of the Government are made in future in Dáil Éireann and not at functions outside the House so that Members may have first hand information and be in a position to query such statements where necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I inquire from the Taoiseach if it is not considered most unsatisfactory that Ministers should avail themselves of <Col N="1309" /> the opportunity of making prominent statements of national policy at political party functions, dinners and dances?  Does the Taoiseach consider it advisable that such a practice should be followed?  If Parliament is to be recognised as the supreme authority, Parliament is the place where these important policy announcements should be made.  Does the Taoiseach propose to take any action in this matter so that such important policy announcements will be made in Parliament where they may be questioned, if necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy O.J. Flanagan had Ministerial office he resorted to this procedure on very many occasions, as did his senior colleagues in office.  I do not propose to change the situation.  Any important announcements made by a Minister in the course of attending a function such as the Deputy mentions can be debated at length in the House.  There are times when it is not opportune to come before the House and it is more opportune to make statements at these functions.  I do not propose to change the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the many developments since the publication of the Government's White Paper of 30th June, 1961, on the European Economic Community containing a survey of Ireland's external trade with particular reference to trade with the United Kingdom and the member states of the Community and in view of the further publication outlining the developments subsequent to the White Paper laid before each House of the Oireachtas on the 28th June, 1962, the Government will now publish a further White Paper stating in detail the implications of the economic and political obligations of membership of the Community at this point of time.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to a report (details supplied) to the effect that Ireland's entry to the Common Market would mean that both production and consumer prices would increase and that sugar beet, potatoes and eggs might be slightly cheaper; how Ireland's entry will affect the incomes of beet producers and egg producers in this country; and if this matter has been examined in the light of the report of the European Commission in Brussels on 13th October, 1969.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>In April, 1967, the Government issued a White Paper which brought up to date the information as to the obligations of membership of the European Communities contained in the two White Papers referred to in Question No. 12.  I also dealt comprehensively with the subject in my statement to the House on the 25th July, 1967.</P>
      <P>I doubt if any more detailed or firm assessment of the implications of membership is possible at this stage when the member Governments are confronted with finding solutions to a number of major internal problems likely to affect the future evolution of the Common Market.  While it is my intention to keep the House as fully informed as possible on EEC matters, Deputies will, no doubt, appreciate the need to avoid disclosure of information which could prejudice our negotiating position.</P>
      <P>As regards the position of the specific agricultural products referred to in Question No. 13, the price to producers here for sugar beet is slightly higher than the minimum price applicable in the Community.  Our ability to maintain a higher price will depend largely on the efficiency of our sugar beet processing industry.  In the cases of potatoes and eggs, prices both here and in the EEC fluctuate in accordance with market supply and demand and it does not appear that there would be any significant change in prices here for these commodities following Ireland's accession to the Community.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that in none of the White Papers we have had so far has there been an attempt at an assessment of the economic gains and losses involved in membership?  Does he not agree it is feasible, for example, on the basis of information on the Second Programme targets for industry, and on the basis of the prices structure of the financial policy of the EEC?  Bearing in mind the desirability of informing people of the gains and losses involved would the Taoiseach consider initiating such an economic assessment and publishing the results, and having it carried out by some independent body?</P>

      <P>That may be premature. It is, however, a matter I am keeping under close review.  With regard to Deputy FitzGerald's supplementary question, it would, I think, be very difficult in advance of negotiating the terms we can get on entry to the Common Market to assess precisely what the gains and losses will be but the Deputy will be aware that there have been some debates in this House in the course of one of which, at least, I made an attempt to assess in a broad way what the economic effects may be. I suggest, however, that it is very difficult to do this in advance of knowing the terms pertaining to entry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach indicate the kind of variation in terms of which he is thinking?  The question I am asking relates to agriculture and industry.  What is involved in industry is, as we know, complete free trade and that is not negotiable but, as regards agriculture, could we have an assessment?  Have we not got all the data required to make such an assessment now?  Would it not be desirable to make such an assessment?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the <Col N="1312" /> Deputy that complete free trade is not &ldquo;not negotiable&rdquo;, if I may use a double negative, in that we would be looking for a transitional period at least.  I would not like the Deputy to get the idea across that we will accept free trade, willy-nilly.  As far as the general exercise is concerned, the Department of Finance and the other economic Departments are keeping abreast of developments from week to week and are trying to assess the information as it comes to hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions 14 to 18 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position still is that our application for membership, along with those of the other applicants, remains on the agenda of the Council of the European Economic Community.  The enlargement of the European Communities has again become a live issue but it is not possible at this stage to say whether early agreement on the opening of negotiations is likely.  The recently reported statement of the President of the EEC Commission that the prior solution of certain agricultural problems <Col N="1314" /> will be necessary is relevant in this context.</P>
    <P>Much will depend on the outcome of the Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Six which is to be held in The Hague on the 17th and 18th November to discuss the major questions at present confronting the Communities, including that of enlargement. It is to be hoped that the conference will result in a positive movement towards the opening of negotiations.  Given the sustained progress which has been achieved in the economy, I am confident that when the time comes the country will be ready to assume the obligations of membership.</P>
    <P>The recent up-dated Opinion of the Commission on the question of enlargement will, no doubt, be a considerable help to the Hague Conference in its deliberations.  I greatly welcome this valuable and constructive document which recommends the early opening of negotiations and the simultaneous accession of the four applicants.  Copies of an unofficial translation of the document have been placed in the Library of the House for the information of Deputies.</P>

The average waiting time was one year for patients under 12 years and one to two years for patients over 12.  The improvement in Sligo Hospital will take away some of the waiting list because up to now people in the Sligo area have been going to the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, so that there will be <Col N="1322" /> an improvement in the position arising from that.</P>

      <P>No statistical examination has been made of the number of hospital beds occupied at any time by persons injured in road traffic accidents but sufficient relevant information is already available to enable me to reach a decision on the issue mentioned by the Deputy.  I am considering whether, in the regulations under the Health Bill, there should be included a provision whereby the cost of treatment for persons eligible in the ordinary way for services should be recoverable from insurers where hospitalisation follows a road accident.</P>

      <P>If the Minister has not had a census taken of the number of persons in hospital because of injuries sustained in road accidents can he say what is the information upon which he is now considering making the regulation?

      <P>To a considerable extent it is.  Out of a total of 9,716 persons injured in 1968, 5,000 were hospitalised.  We know the total number of persons in hospital.  The Deputy can discuss this on section 69 (2) of the Health Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, having regard to the urgent need of more modern hospital accommodation, particularly if the proposals of the FitzGerald Report are to be implemented in the foreseeable future, he will now indicate that substantially increased investment in new hospitals will be made over the next five years; and if he will particularly ensure that <Col N="1327" /> the capital allocated for such purposes keeps pace with declining money values and increasing building costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for modern hospital accommodation and facilities is one of the major issues arising from the Report of the Consultative Council on the General Hospital Services which are at present under active consideration in my Department, in consultation with the various other organisations and interests involved.  It is not possible at this stage to indicate precisely the extent to which substantial investment in new hospitals will occur over the next five years, but it seems possible that, within that period, a number of major new hospital projects will have commenced.</P>
      <P>As regards the capital moneys required for such investment, the Deputy is no doubt aware that expenditure on hospitals, in common with other capital works financed from public moneys, is subject to the overall control of public capital expenditure at Government level which in recent years it has been necessary to introduce.  I am confident that adequate moneys will be made available at the appropriate time to meet approved capital expenditure on any new hospitals on which work commences during the next five years&mdash; including expenditure arising from increased building costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered that the figure in the Third Programme for the next five years for hospital building is about £40 million less than is necessary if the proposals in the FitzGerald Report are to be implemented and, having regard to this necessary tremendous expenditure to provide us with the minimum hospital accommodation and facilities, what special steps will be taken to provide the capital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We are actively planning two regional hospitals and two general hospitals in Dublin in relation to proposals in the report of the consultative council and we reckon that, in spite of the stringency in the provision of capital and the many claims upon it, we should be able to do <Col N="1328" /> something about the constructing of certain hospitals in Dublin by the end, shall we say, of 1972 or 1973 and then, of course, as the Deputy knows, there are proposals for the improvement of certain hospitals in the country.  I might add also that there is not any country that I know of, even countries much wealthier than we are, where it is not found difficult to provide capital for all health and hospital purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>In considering the future of the county hospitals in the context of the FitzGerald Report, it must be emphasised that the implementation of the recommendations in this report will take a considerable time and will require very heavy capital investment.  It will be necessary to concentrate at first on proposals which are of major priority.  A reorganisation of the existing facilities in Dublin and Cork is urgently required because of the need to replace buildings which are in poor condition, which contain major medical specialities, some of national significance, and which have an essential role in the training of our future doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many county hospitals are modern buildings in good condition and, while I accept the recommendations in the FitzGerald Report that they need to be reorganised into larger units, the need for action is not as urgent as in the metropolitan centres.  A serious drawback of the present county hospital system is the relative isolation of the <Col N="1329" /> consultant medical staff at individual centres.  It is hoped that this will be mitigated by the reorganisation of local health structures provided for in the current Health Bill, but some steps in this direction can be taken in advance of the introduction of regionalisation.</P>
    <P>In the case of Monaghan County Hospital closer ties should be formed with Cavan County Hospital.  The staffs of both hospitals can, on a voluntary basis, commence to work in closer co-operation.  This will provide an immediate improvement in co-ordinating the services for patients and the working conditions for the existing medical staffs at both hospitals.  In this connection I am pleased to say that the Monaghan County Council and the Cavan County Council have recently agreed to proceed with the appointment of an obstetrician/gynaecologist to serve in both hospitals.</P>
    <P>In the case of Roscommon County Hospital, some ties have already been formed with the Regional Hospital in Galway.  Pathology, E.N.T., paediatric and orthopaedic services for Roscommon are provided either direct from the regional hospital or in close association with the staff of that hospital.  I would like to see an extension of these ties, particularly in the fields of general medicine and general surgery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>In County Monaghan, as is pretty well known, we have a fairly modern hospital which can accommodate under pressure up to 190 beds. The FitzGerald Report proposes a unit of 300 beds.  We have there this modern hospital capable of taking up to 190 beds and I should like to know if the Minister would give any decision or if he intends to downgrade the hospital or to develop it as a regional hospital as outlined in the FitzGerald Report?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

      <P>In reply to Deputy <Col N="1330" /> Fox, I have not made any decision about the Monaghan County Hospital in relation to the proposals in the FitzGerald Report.  This is an immensely complicated report that requires very careful consideration.  Might I add for the benefit of all Deputies, as the years go by, the FitzGerald Report will be outdated and there will be still further changes?  Anything that anybody says at any general election is likely to be altered by subsequent information and subsequent circumstances.</P>

      <P>The Deputies may laugh but they will laugh out of the other sides of their mouths when they hear the final results of what has to be done in this country in relation to the Todd Report on the training of doctors. We had to examine that and to learn what the Royal College of Surgeons in Great Britain and some of the other colleges which have branches here and what our own general practitioners think of the implications of the Todd Report on the training of doctors. It is only when we have examined that that we will then be able to see the effect of that upon the general concentration of hospital facilities in this country, the kinds of consultant services that will have to be provided and new arrangements for the training of general practitioners.  So, there is no need for the Deputies to laugh.  The Todd Report itself, with its many important proposals, has to some extent already modified the implications of the FitzGerald Report and this is going to continue.  There is nothing unnatural in Deputies of any Party choosing to make expressions of opinion and policy in a world that must inevitably change. We cannot wait forever to make declarations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not intended to reconstruct the existing county home at Tullamore or to erect new buildings on the site to replace the present accommodation entirely.  It is proposed to separate beds for the chronic sick from provision for aged persons who need welfare type accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with that policy it is intended to provide for 100 patients on the site of the county hospital.  This will facilitate the integration of services for the aged sick who need care in long-stay units with the medical, <Col N="1333" /> nursing and ancillary services available at the county hospital for the acutely ill.  Planning of the new units and of essential ancillary accommodation is in the final stages and I understand that it should be possible to invite tenders before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Pending the provision of the new units improvements in the heating and sanitary facilities and redecoration in the present county home have been undertaken.  It will be necessary at the same time to consider the nature and location of the accommodation to be provided for persons who will require residential rather than hospital care. This question is being taken up with the health authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health what autonomy he proposes to allow to the owners and management of voluntary hospitals in future; and if he will specify particularly their rights of ownership, disposal and use of equipment and buildings and selection of medical consultants and staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In answering this question, I should first make it clear that there is no intention on my part, or on the part of my Department, to acquire the ownership of voluntary hospitals.</P>
      <P>It is clear, however, that, in order to reach and maintain a high standard of medicine in our hospitals, many changes in the present system of organisation of these hospitals are inevitable. These changes, which have been described in the FitzGerald Report, arise from the need to combine the hospitals into larger units, to avoid unnecessary duplication and overlapping, particularly of highly specialised services, and to break down barriers between hospitals. The need for regrouping of what are now independent and largely isolated hospital units has received a broad measure of acceptance.  Such a grouping must lead to modifications in the exercise of some rights of ownership and management of hospital buildings.  In Dublin, negotiations are already taking place between some of the voluntary hospitals and the Dublin Health Authority and I am hopeful that agreement will be reached amongst those concerned on the establishment of one or more new bodies, to be representative of the different interests involved, to operate a reorganised grouping of hospitals in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible for me at this stage to be precise on the form which the various changes will take&mdash;as these will to a considerable extent depend on detailed <Col N="1335" /> negotiations&mdash;but I expect that reorganisation will be facilitated by the new administrative structure which is proposed in the Health Bill.  A major element of this will be Comhairle na nOispidéal on which the voluntary hospitals will have a strong representation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave public recognition of the fact that many of our hospitals represent an investment of charitable work and sacrifice by religious communities and other people and by private charitable donation and that, with the ownership of these hospitals and institutions, go certain rights and that no steps will be taken which will put the owners of these properties in the position of being little more than permissive occupants.  The fear continues to exist that the Department is endeavouring to use the hospitals and the owners to carry out policies which are at variance with the policies and wishes of the people who set up these institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware. There is no such intention on our part. Obviously, we should have to get freely-negotiated and voluntary agreement for any changes that take place. If there is to be joint administration between a hospital administered by a religious order or an order subject to some charter arrangements and a local authority hospital, it is quite evident that, if they make an arrangement to combine, their conditions and rights will have to have due consideration. There would have to be a freely-negotiated contract.  There would be no question of a dictatorial attitude.  If that <Col N="1336" /> were so, I do not think the result would be good.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of the larger roto-rest beds has been in use at the National Medical Rehabilitation Centre, Dún Laoghaire, for the past few years.  The experience so far indicates its significant value in the nursing of patients suffering from certain types of paralytic condition.  The number of patients for which the larger bed is necessary is limited but a smaller type has wider application and can be used in nursing patients at home who otherwise would have to remain in hospital. I have approved applications for its use in any case where this was recommended by the appropriate medical authority.</P>
      <P>To date five of the smaller type bed have been purchased for home use; two were purchased by health authorities and three privately.  There are nine beds in use at institutions other than the National Rehabilitation Centre.</P>
      <P>While the use of the roto-rest bed in appropriate cases provides convenience in nursing care and greater comfort for the patient, the evidence so far does not indicate any substantial reduction in the overall cost of treatment. This latter aspect is the subject of continuing study.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the total cost of drugs and medicines under the health services in 1963-64 and in 1968-69 distinguishing between general medical services and hospital services; the principal reasons for the substantial increases indicating the extent to which each reason is responsible; and what steps are being taken to analyse the causes and prevent any avoidable increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The total cost of drugs and medicines provided under general medical services was £608,000 in respect of 1963-64 and £2,072,000 in respect of 1968-69.  Corresponding figures for hospital including mental hospital services provided by local authorities are £693,000 and £1,346,000, respectively.</P>
      <P>The increase in expenditure on drugs and medicines supplied under general medical services is due to a variety of factors.  It is estimated that increased prices, an increase in the numbers covered by medical cards and in the numbers provided with medicines on hardship grounds would account for about one-third of the increase in expenditure.  The remaining two-thirds arises from factors whose relative effect cannot be measured precisely.  These include increasing issues at dispensaries to patients after their discharge from hospital, in particular psychiatric patients who are provided with the initial supply of drugs at a psychiatric clinic but frequently obtain subsequent supplies from dispensary stocks.</P>
      <P>Apart from price increases, the increase in expenditure on drugs and medicines used in hospitals may be attributed to increased usage particularly of newly developed and more effective drugs which are usually more costly than those which they replace. This development has helped to achieve a reduction in the average length of stay in hospital and an increase in the numbers of patients treated with no significant increase in the extent of hospital accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The experience in this country in regard to the cost of medicines used in the health services is consistent with experience in other comparable <Col N="1338" /> countries.  In view of the rate at which the cost has been increasing, however, the matter is constantly under review in my Department, and the attention of health authorities is drawn to any situation in which economies appear to be feasible.</P>
    <P>Under the proposed new arrangements for the provision of a general practitioner service for lower income group patients medicines will, in general, be provided through retail chemists. It is envisaged that more detailed analyses of medicine costs will be possible when the revised arrangements are introduced.</P>

      <P>I move: That the Dáil do now adjourn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever about the length or duration of this debate I was not completely happy that the timing just now <Col N="1399" /> would be the best but, nevertheless, I acknowledge the desire of the two Opposition Parties for an early debate and recognise, too, that this matter, the position that obtains in the Six Counties of north-east Ireland, has been debated on a number of occasions in Stormont and at least on one, if not on two, occasions in the Westminster Parliament.  Therefore, I welcome the opportunity which this debate affords not only to give the Government an opportunity to clarify and re-state their position regarding the North of Ireland situation, which has been the cause of so much suffering, anxiety and concern in recent months, but also Members of the House so that they may make their own assessment of the situation and make their views known about it.</P>
    <P>There are few topics which can arouse such passionate feelings and such deep emotions as the one that we are now about to debate.  I feel certain that there is no desire whatsoever on the part of any Deputy to say or do anything which would in any way tend to further exacerbate an already tragic situation.  On the contrary, I feel certain that there is a sincere and genuine desire on all sides of the House to approach the problem calmly and objectively and to act responsibly in this grave situation so that we might, all of us together, contribute as constructively and as objectively as we can to the easing of present tensions, to the elimination of fear and hate and to the establishment of the free and unrestricted exercise in the northern area of basic human rights and fundamental freedoms.  The whole matter is one which I appreciate can arouse a great degree of emotion.  Therefore, I want to commend the considerable restraint exercised on this side of the Border during the events in the North.  There has been a most gratifying and I might even say a tremendous degree of unity of approach and co-operation among all our people including, it is fair to say, the Opposition Parties and their Leaders.  I should also like to pay tribute to the press, daily and provincial and to RTE for their responsible treatment of the matter.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting, however, that <Col N="1400" /> everything that the Government have done, everything that I have said, will find agreement among all responsible people.  It is not necessary for me here to recall the history of what we believe and know to be the cause of the present situation in the Six Counties nor to recount the events of the last 12 months or so but whatever we say now must be directed towards securing justice, tolerance and peace in the North, while continuing to assert as I do now on behalf of the vast majority of the Irish people our deep and legitimate desire for a united Ireland.  In my speech in Tralee last month I set out the basis of the Government's thinking and policy in regard to the Northern situation. The Stormont Prime Minister subsequently replied to that speech. While the temptation on my part to reply in some detail to the points raised Major Chichester Clark's acknowledgeis one that I propose to resist.  My concern and that of the Government is not to indulge in recrimination or to engage in a battle of words but to do whatever we can to bring the present tragic situation in the North to an end and to establish a friendly and fruitful relationship between all our people North and South.  However much I would disagree with much of what Major Chichester Clark said in his reply to me, I welcome its tone.</P>
    <P>I welcome in particular his acknowledgment that we have the right to express the hope that one day north and south will move into a closer and agreed relationship and that there is no reason why we should not work together not only for the good of these Ireland but for the good of these islands as a whole.  I welcome also Major Chichester Clark acknowledgement of the right of every nation, like every individual, to its aspirations.  Our national aspirations are no secret.  It has been and will continue to be our concern to see to it that these national aspirations of Ireland and of her people are pursued.</P>
    <P>I do not intend here to repeat in detail my Tralee speech nor do I think it is necessary as I believe it got fairly wide publicity already but I shall refer to some aspects of it later.  Before I do so, I think it necessary for me to review <Col N="1401" /> briefly the events of the past three months or so.  The House has been in recess during this period, an unduly long period, I agree, due primarily, of course, to the need for the work that has now been done in rewiring Leinster House.  As far back as April last it was clear to the Government that a serious situation was building up in the Six Counties.  I instructed the then Minister for External Affairs to advise both the British Government and the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the serious consequences that were likely to follow unless urgent steps were taken to remedy it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs visited the Secretary-General in New York and I sought a meeting with the British Prime Minister at the same time.  Mr. Wilson was preoccupied at that time with pressing domestic problems and continued to be so occupied for some weeks afterwards by which time the Dáil, as the House is aware, had been dissolved and I was engaged in the course of the election and the proposed meeting did not take place.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of July, after the Dáil had recessed for the summer holidays, it came to the notice of the Government that the annual Apprentice Boys parade to be held in Derry this year was to be held on a considerably augmented scale.  We felt that the holding of this parade at all could well have serious consequences but to enlarge participation in it threefold or fourfold, as we were reliably informed would be the case, we were convinced, would be highly provocative, to say the least of it.</P>
    <P>On 1st August the Minister for External Affairs visited London and conveyed the views of the Government direct to the British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Stewart, and urged upon him that the British Government should see to it that this parade would not be held or, at least if it was held, to ensure that it be restricted to its usual size and proportions.  Our views and advice, as the House is aware, were not accepted.  Mr. Stewart asserted that his Government were satisfied on the assurance of the Stormont Government that matters would be kept under <Col N="1402" /> control.  We now know, and the world knows, that the tragic events that followed the holding of the parade on 12th August justified our fears.</P>
    <P>On the following day I called a special meeting of the Government and we took a number of decisions which I announced later in the day during a television appearance.  One of these decisions was to establish at once Army field hospitals in a number of places adjacent to and on this side of the Border.  We had evidence that a number of persons were seriously injured following the previous night's disturbances in the Bogside of Derry and that they were reluctant to go for treatment to hospitals in the Six County area, not because of any lack of confidence in the quality of the treatment they would get in these institutions but because they feared that once they left the Bogside they would be in grave danger of arrest.  Many scores of people were treated for injuries in these field hospitals and treated also for the effects of CS gas.</P>
    <P>We also decided to make accommodation available at Army camps and barracks such as Ballykinlar and Kildare for any Six County residents who sought accommodation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I took my eye off my notes for a moment.  It was at Finner and in Kildare.  Several hundred people availed of the accommodation in Finner, Kildare and other places.  In my television address I also called on the British Government to seek from the United Nations the presence of a United Nations peacekeeping force in the Six County area and I called for discussions between the British Government and ourselves on the future constitutional position of the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We took this course in relation to the peace-keeping force &mdash; asking Britain to make the request to the United Nations &mdash;because we felt if the request was made in that way it would facilitate the <Col N="1403" /> United Nations in meeting it.  However, both these suggestions were rejected by a spokesman on behalf of the British Government even before they were formally put.</P>
    <P>Following the outbreak of further violence in Belfast on August 14th as a result of which some lives were lost, the Minister for External Affairs again visited London to put these two requests formally, that is the peace-keeping operation and the discussions on the future constitutional position.  On this occasion and in view of the earlier reaction by the British Government to our suggestion of a United Nations peacekeeping force the Minister suggested that the British Government might agree to a joint Irish-British force in the alternative.  To this end we authorised the mobilisation of our first line reserve Defence Forces so as to ensure that sufficient regular army personnel would be available for such a force.  On this occasion the Minister met Lord Chalfont and he formally rejected these two requests.  However, the Minister also pressed strongly that extra B Specials be not put into action at that time and that those who were already on active service be withdrawn. He gave very cogent reasons for that suggestion which I need not elaborate to the House.</P>
    <P>He also urged that as a means of defusing the situation that had developed in the Six Counties the British Government should ensure the immediate implementation of some measure or measures of civil rights in the area. Lord Chalfont took note of these two latter points.</P>
    <P>After the events in Derry and Belfast on 12th, 13th and 14th August the Government Information Bureau and many of our embassies abroad were inundated with inquiries from individuals, organisations, the press and other news media for information not only on the issues and current happenings in the north and the attitude of the people and Government of the 26 Counties towards them, but on the background of these happenings, both immediate and historical.</P>
    <P>Because existing staff either at home or abroad was not sufficient, we decided <Col N="1404" /> to recruit trained personnel, journalists and public relations officers &mdash;the latter almost exclusively from semi-State bodies&mdash;in order to fulfil the great need for personnel which the crisis in the north occasioned.  I should like at this stage to pay tribute to the director and staff of the Government Information Bureau, to those men and women who were specially recruited, to their dedication and zeal in undertaking their task at short notice, a task which occupied their time long beyond the normal hours of duty.  I should like to thank also the State-sponsored bodies who so readily released officials of a very high calibre, obviously at considerable inconvenience to their own organisations.  I decided some weeks ago that it was no longer necessary to retain all this personnel for the purposes for which they were originally recruited, and the process has already started of releasing them to resume duty with their own organisations.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of our decision to seek, and our desire to have, an impartial military presence in the Six County area, the Minister for External Affairs subsequently visited New York where he formally raised the matter in the Security Council of the United Nations. There was a debate, as everyone knows, on the question of putting the request for a United Nations peacekeeping operation on the agenda of the Council, but the question was adjourned.  Before it was adjourned, however, the Minister made a very full and effective statement on the whole situation in the Six Counties, and on its background.  Subsequently, when the United Nations General Assembly met in September in New York, the Minister returned and sought to have the subject matter of conditions in the Six County area inscribed on the agenda of the general committee.</P>
    <P>The British permanent representative argued that, in accordance with Paragraph 7, Article 2, of the United Nations Charter, the Committee was not entitled to inscribe the subject. After a preliminary discussion the matter was adjourned, and so it stands. The Minister for External Affairs will later intervene in this debate, but I want to say this: the success achieved <Col N="1405" /> by the Minister in his efforts to have the northern situation brought before the United Nations Security Council was most satisfactory and effective. Because of this initiative, because of the Minister's subsequent address to the General Assembly and his talks with member States and with members of the other delegations at the United Nations and because of the very efficient work in giving information by the expanded Government information services, the facts of the present Six County situation are now better known than ever before, not alone to the member Governments of the United Nations but to the world at large.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the British Home Secretary, Mr. James Callaghan, visited the Six Counties.  Although I refuted the assertion which he made at the commencement of his visit that the Border was not an issue, it would be less than gracious of me if I did not pay tribute to the thorough and objective manner in which Mr. Callaghan set about his task of examining the situation for himself, to the recommendations he made, and to the steps he initiated towards reform and restoring peaceful conditions.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks we have seen two very important reports, that of the commission headed by Lord Cameron which was set up in March of this year by the former Prime Minister, Captain Terence O'Neill, and the report of the advisory committee on the RUC, headed by Lord Hunt which was set up following the first visit of the British Home Secretary.  I do not wish to refer to the findings of the Cameron Commission or to the findings and recommendations of the Hunt Committee except to say that they speak for themselves and that both of these objective reports bear out the case made by, and justify the fears of, the minority in the north.  I know I speak for every member of the Dáil and for all responsible opinion when I express the hope that the Hunt recommendations and all the other proposed reforms will be expeditiously implemented.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that I would refer again to some aspects of the speech I made in Tralee on 20th September.  I want to assert again that it is Government <Col N="1406" /> policy that our legitimate desire for a united Ireland will be realised by peaceful means.  First of all, we want to see peace and tolerance restored in the Six Counties so that Catholics and Protestants, minority and majority, can live side by side with co-operation and in understanding based on equal citizenship. Ultimately we want to see all Irish men and women in all parts of Ireland, irrespective of class, creed or politics, living in that same peace and harmony and unity.</P>
    <P>Over the past month there have been constantly recurring references to Protestant fears in the north.  The people mentioning them have called them real fears, very real fears, deep fears, genuine fears, legitimate fears and so on but, for the most part, these fears have not been specified.  Last week, however, the Northern Minister for Commerce, Mr. Bradford, listed three fears: first, fear of external threat across the Border; second, fear of armed attack from within; and third, the threat of a mass demonstration which boils over into violence.</P>
    <P>My immediate concern here is with the first of those fears listed by Mr. Bradford, that is, fear of external threat across the Border.  Although I cannot say exactly what he meant, I feel it my duty to repeat again what I said on a number of occasions recently, namely, that the Government in this part of Ireland have no intention of mounting an armed invasion of the Six Counties.  We could give a number of reasons for this attitude but the most cogent, in our conviction, is that the use of force would not advance our long-term aim of a united Ireland.  Nor will the Government connive at unofficial armed activity here directed at targets across the Border.</P>
    <P>I should say that Mr. Bradford stated that he knew the fears he listed were not founded on fact.  His Prime Minister has said he did not share these fears.  Therefore, could I ask responsible people in all quarters in these islands not to be clouding the issues by talking about legitimate Protestant fear of us, or of our warlike designs on them?  We recognise, however, that there may be apprehensions among the Unionists in the Six Counties.  I was not old enough to know, but it is probable <Col N="1407" /> that similar apprehensions were held by Unionists in the 26 Counties shortly after the Irish Free State was set up.  If there were any such apprehensions they were abated because the minority here were treated as equal citizens.</P>
    <P>I want to assert again as I did in Tralee, that we have a legitimate interest in any change in the British arrangements for the administration of the North of Ireland and to re-affirm that our views on how peace and justice can be ensured in such a small island as ours are relevant and entitled to be heard.  As for the long term, it is our aim to win the agreement of a sufficient number of the people in the North of Ireland to an acceptable form of reunification.  I said several times recently that we have no fixed ideas as to what this form of reunification should be.</P>
    <P>We are, indeed, prepared to be very liberal on this point, recognising the need to overcome the various apprehensions and the legitimate reluctance of the people of the north to forgo material advantages.  I want to make it clear again that we would not prove to be unmindful of or unreceptive towards the genuine apprehensions and reasonable expectations of northern Protestants.  We would be more than willing to go half way to meet them, and even beyond that, if it were to mean the ending once and for all of the bitterness, bigotry and frustrations which have been present in our small country for so long.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to say that we do not want to seek to impose our will on anyone by force.  We do not wish, as I said before, to extend the domination of Dublin.  I and my predecessors have said more than once that we are willing to seek a solution along federal lines and in intermediate stages if that is what will be acceptable, desired and effective.  We are prepared to explore all possibilities in constructive discussion. Our aim is a scrupulously fair deal for everybody.  We want to see religious freedom, civil rights and liberties protected for all Irishmen.</P>
    <P>Since I first spoke of the possibility of a federal solution I have been asked once or twice what I had in mind.  I am <Col N="1408" /> not going to pretend that I have any readymade formula, and if I had I do not believe I would be expected to disclose it in detail at this juncture.  As I have already said, we are prepared to examine all the possibilities.  We are prepared, for example, as an intermediate stage on the road towards closer unity to contemplate a loose federal or similar arrangement under which the north's financial and economic links with Britain might be preserved while we independently pursue our own development policies though with an eye on eventual harmonisation of various standards.  These and alternative possibilities are at present being studied.</P>
    <P>References have been made by many commentators to the need for constitutional change, and I have made known my views already on that part of Article 44 which recognises the special position of the Catholic Church.  When the point is reached at which we can see clearly the various changes needed in our Constitution to facilitate a re-unification settlement, I am sure that both Dáil and Seanad and our people generally will not be reluctant to consider and approve the necessary changes.  In any case, we are, as I stated in Tralee, anxious to maintain and develop co-operation between north and south which in recent years had become more systematic in economic and other matters of mutual concern.  Our most immediate and earnest hope is a quick return to peace and progress, and a just and acceptable environment in the north.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to speak at any further length at this stage.  No doubt many points will be raised during the course of the debate to which I shall reply to the fullest extent I can.  I do not think it is necessary either to repeat my opening remarks that we can debate this in a constructive and objective manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach remarked at the beginning that he was not particularly happy at the timing of the debate while at the same time paying tribute to the responsible attitude of the political parties and others who were involved in and concerned <Col N="1409" /> with recent events in the North of Ireland.  I think it is a measure of the maturity of our democratic system and the State that has been established here that it is possible to debate this very grave and contentious matter in a responsible fashion.</P>
      <P>I want to reiterate clearly the fact that we believe that the problem of the re-uniting of this country is the remaining outstanding political question, indeed the last remaining cause of dissension not merely in this country but between ourselves and our ancient enemy, Britain.  The ending of the division of the country and the achievement of a united Ireland is the paramount aim and objective we wish to see accomplished and for which we must continue to strive.  This objective will require hard work, patience and goodwill before it is achieved.  Convinced of the righteousness of our aim we must pursue with diligence and resolution the steps necessary to reach that goal.</P>
      <P>The re-uniting of our nation requires not only patience, diligence and goodwill but the adoption of attitudes that are constructive and progressive and the disregarding and rejection of attitudes or approaches, however much satisfaction they may give emotionally, that are not constructive or not calculated to achieve the ultimate aim and objective which the majority of our people wish to achieve.</P>
      <P>I feel no restraint in expressing what has been the consistent attitude of this Party on this matter.  We have, throughout our history, expressed publicly the view that the only way to achieve the ultimate unity of this country is through peaceful means and through co-operation.  Tangible evidence has been given of our conviction that that view was the right view and that policy was the right policy in circumstances, in times and in conditions in which it was far less fashionable and far less profitable politically or personally to do so than it is today. We asserted that view and we carried that assertion into practice by a realistic approach to the problem, and I shall give details of practical examples to indicate how that approach was implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present troubles in the north <Col N="1410" /> find their origins to a very large extent in fear by both sections of the community of each other.  These fears have been magnified and exaggerated by politicians and others for their own particular ends.  One can point&mdash;as the Taoiseach did in the course of his opening speech here this afternoon&mdash; to the fact that since this State was set up the most scrupulous regard has been taken to ensure that all minorities, particularly religious minorities, received equal treatment in every respect.  This Party asserted its right and defended the freedom of minorities with a total disregard of the personal or political interests of itself or its members; that duty was discharged at times and in circumstances when it was less fashionable and under conditions when it was neither popular nor profitable to do so.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, many non-Catholics in the North of Ireland have genuine fears as to what might happen to them or how their interests would be affected if they were incorporated into a united Ireland.  While we can understand the genuine concern and appreciate the anxieties of people not familiar with conditions here there can be no similar understanding of the Unionist politicians and leaders.  Many of them come to this part of the country year in year out for various purposes, but mainly to enjoy themselves.  They are familiar with conditions here and are aware of the manner in which all sections of the community are dealt with.  Irrespective of religion, political opinion, party or other affiliation, their rights, their interests and their security have been guaranteed. The Unionist Party had an obligation to make it clear to their own extremists and to those who were genuinely and really concerned that so far as this State is concerned we can stand not merely before our own people, but before the world, as an example of fair and equal treatment for every citizen before the law.  The responsibility for not explaining that situation and for not making it clear to what scribes and others describe as the &ldquo;wise men of the extremists&rdquo; rests heavily on them.</P>
    <P>We have stated recently as the Opposition Party in this country, and above all as Irish men and women, that we are not interested as others may have been interested in other circumstances <Col N="1411" /> and in other times, in playing politics.  Our concern is to maintain the supremacy of the interests and the wellbeing of the people in all parts of this country at all times no matter what the cost.</P>
    <P>In the Six County area under the control of the present Government efforts have been made to play on the fears of the ordinary people that in a united Ireland, or in a State in which what is now the majority would become a large minority, they would be denied equal rights.  It is essential we make clear the conditions, the circumstances, and the laws of the system under which people would be expected to live.</P>
    <P>Of vital necessity in the present circumstances of implementing the recommendations made in the recent reports, namely, The Cameron Commission, The Hunt Report and the undertakings given by the British Home Secretary with regard to the ending of discrimination, are the implementation of the principle of one man one vote in local elections; the creation of electoral areas with boundaries fairly and impartially drawn and the absolute guarantee that gerrymandering would not be possible in the future in the North of Ireland; not merely that they be understood but that we make it abundantly clear that, so far as this country is concerned, in either or both parts of it there will be no discrimination in respect of electoral boundaries, employment, housing or the principle of one man one vote.  We have asserted that the right of the minority in the north to participation in and responsibility for representation in government should be and must be guaranteed.</P>
    <P>I think most people in this country have been impressed in recent weeks by the desire of both political parties in Britain to contribute to a solution of the acute problems of the North of Ireland.  It is not for me to say whether this is due to a sense of guilt over past wrongs or a genuine desire to solve those problems, or the realisation that an election is pending for the House of Commons.  I think the two chief spokesmen for the two political parties, <Col N="1412" /> Mr. Callaghan and Mr. Hogg, in so far as lay in their power, have made an effort to understand the situation in the North of Ireland.  At the same time, I am bound to say that I hope both political parties in Britain do not display the same lack of knowledge they have shown in the North of Ireland when they are dealing with problems elsewhere, because if this happens it will not be surprising if they get into difficulties.</P>
    <P>However, they have endeavoured in recent months to understand the position in the North of Ireland and to get to grips with the problems created and maintained there by British policy during the years.  The main responsibility for this situation devolves and remains a British responsibility.  So far as this State is concerned, we have shown in practice we respect and guarantee the rights of political and religious minorities here.  We have shown we are prepared to allow people in this part of the country to participate in every area of Government and public administration; that we are anxious to extend that system to the rest of the country; that we have asserted, and now repeat, our conviction that the unity of this country can never be achieved by force and that the only way this can be brought about is with the consent and willing co-operation of the people who at present constitute the majority in the North of Ireland, who would then be a minority in the whole country.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we must work to create in this part of the country economic and social conditions which would not appear to lessen the attractiveness, or worsen the circumstances or operate in any way as an obstacle to the reunification of the country.  To that end we have given practical evidence of our desire to co-operate with and to participate in the necessary measures to deal with the economic and other problems. I noticed in, I think, yesterday's <i>Irish Times</i> a critical and condescending comment on what Fine Gael had done or had not done in order to help to reunite the country.  I am not particularly disposed to be receptive to advice from that quarter when I look back on the comments&mdash;it is hardly necessary to repeat them or to refresh <Col N="1413" /> the public memory&mdash;in leading articles in the <i>Irish Times</i> going back to a number of dates in May 1916 referring to the national insurrection to assert the rights and to defend the interests of the people, but I am prepared to point to the practical contribution which this Party made to a project many years ago which has been brought to public attention recently in the tragic circumstances where a man died in an attempt to detonate the Kathleen Falls power station.  As a member of the Government which piloted that project, I can look back with a sense of pride at the construction of this power station which has benefited people living in both parts of the country irrespective of their religious or political views. It was a practical effort in co-operation and it does not require condescending articles from any quarter.</P>
    <P>This party have consistently defended and made secure the rights of all and afforded them the opportunity, whether they had an alien background or otherwise, to express freely and without restraint any comments they wished to make, recognising at the same time that they had an alien background and that their circumstances and attitudes did not, and do not, reflect the majority view of the Irish people.  We are a fair-minded community and are prepared to treat with impartial justice all sections of the population.  It might be well to say that the new-found semipink approach of the same journal cannot obscure the written record that in other circumstances and other times, which they may like to forget, our attitude has been realistic, practical and above all patriotic.  So far as the re-unification of Ireland and the wellbeing of our people are concerned, that will continue to be our paramount consideration and our predominant aim in the policy we adopt or the attitudes we recommend in regard to this tragic situation.</P>
    <P>We have rejected and we now repeat our rejection of force as a means of solving this problem.  We reiterate our view that the consent of the majority of the people in the north to a united Ireland must be forthcoming.  There is an old saying that God helps those who help themselves, but we should <Col N="1414" /> like a little evidence of willingness to co-operate and a realisation on the part of those who have invested themselves with place, power and privilege in the north in the last 50 years that this is not 1912, 1914 or even 1920. Events have moved, circumstances and conditions have changed and things can never be the same again.</P>
    <P>I think it is right that a tribute should be paid to the constructive and realistic efforts of the politicians and others in the north who have realised that, while not abandoning the ultimate objective of a united Ireland, in which all our people would be united, in which all our people would have their rights of fair treatment and of equality before the law guaranteed, we must ensure that interim steps are taken to end discrimination, repeal the Special Powers Act or if any similar legislation is to be implemented, implement it fairly and impartially, put an end to discrimination in respect of housing, employment, the franchise, the police force, or wherever else it may happen to exist, and guarantee fundamental human rights and freedom for everyone, irrespective of religion or political opinion.</P>
    <P>It is right, I think, that we should realise that so far as this State is concerned and so far as we are concerned our approach has been based on the attitude that was expressed with such foresight in retrospect&mdash;indeed quite remarkable foresight looked at in retrospect&mdash;by Michael Collins when he wrote on this matter in <i>The Path to Freedom.</i> Indeed, in this the government in the North of Ireland have an inescapable responsibility that they must assert and ensure equal and fair treatment for all sections.  They cannot in this day and age operate a system which denies effective participation to more than one-third of the population in the affairs of government, in employment, housing, and in the local franchise and administration.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate in present circumstances to quote an extract from a letter written by Lincoln on representative government in which he said:</P>
    <P>We must settle this question now whether in a free government the <Col N="1415" /> minority have a right to break up the government whenever they choose.  If we fail it will go far to prove the incapability of the people to govern themselves.</P>
    <P>At present the challenge in the north is a challenge from the right wing extremists and in certain circumstances from what they might consider the IRA or Nationalist opinion to the right of the majority to decide upon and implement a fair policy in respect of all the people of the area.  We have expressed the view that this requires determination, that it requires courage, that it requires the capacity to make sacrifices, political sacrifices, in the interests of the majority of the people.</P>
    <P>We have repeatedly expressed the view that our aim and objective here must be to convince, through our diplomatic initiatives and through demonstration of our unalterable conviction of the need to show we are implementing in practice what we express.  In that regard we must be scrupulously careful not to enact here any legislation which could be criticised or objected to on any grounds similar to those, the operation of which up to now have been carried on in the north of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the responsible attitude adopted here by public organs of press, radio and television. It is right, I think, that we should pay a tribute to the RTE film shown in August last, I think on 12th August, which accurately portrayed events there and which brought before world opinion conditions which existed there.  I believe the press and public commentators have behaved in a most responsible fashion.  There are those who are always concerned to denigrate political life here, who are concerned to denigrate politicians and political parties, who see some virtue in either sneering at or trying to devalue them in a particular way.  I do not claim we are any better but we are certainly no worse than some of the paragons of virtue which they exalt and give as examples which we should imitate.  We here have sought, not without cost and not without great sacrifices, sacrifices as I said earlier made to a very considerable extent by members of this Party, to vindicate <Col N="1416" /> the right of the people to assert the principle of fair dealing, the right of free expression of opinion, to assert and vindicate the right of free choice of public representatives, to maintain and guarantee the rights of religious and other minorities in the belief that the democratic system we sought to establish was one in which and to which all people could and would give allegiance and respect.</P>
    <P>I know in recent months there has been some speculation and comment on the need to eliminate from the Constitution certain sections of a particular Article that are regarded as objectionable, that the terms of the sections of that Article may be regarded as in some way or other an obstacle to unity. They are not objections of substance and I think it would be wrong for anyone to imagine that those changes on which all political parties here are agreed are fundamental or major questions.  They are not and if they were removed the extremists in the Unionist Party or elsewhere would seek some other peg on which to hang their objections.  We are prepared to give, as we have given over the years, tangible and practical evidence of our desire and our anxiety to allay in any sense fears, however unjustified, in respect of any of these matters.  We have shown that we are prepared to demonstrate it in practice.  The abuses to which we have referred and the discrimination that has existed must be eliminated, as also must this legacy of bitterness, of hatred and of religious intolerance that exists in this day and age in a small part of a very small country.</P>
    <P>In an age that has been characterised by a great forward-looking movement, characterised by a forward-looking progressive approach, an age in which old attitudes of intolerance, of bigotry, of bias and prejudice have been ended, as they have been ended to a great extent by the ecumenical spirit indicated by the Second Vatican Council, there never has been any time since this State was established in 1922 that will not show clearly that we have been fair and just &mdash; I do not like the word &mdash;&ldquo;tolerant&rdquo;.  We have been just because it was the right thing to do. We have guaranteed these fundamental <Col N="1417" /> rights because, as Christians, we recognised that it was the proper and correct approach and no matter what was the personal or political cost involved, we were prepared to vindicate that approach in the name of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>It is our aim, as it has been expressed before and as it has been often repeated, to unite the whole people of Ireland, to abolish the memory of all past dissensions and to substitute the common name of Irishman in place of the denominations of Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter.</P>
    <P>These are our aims and objectives. These are the beliefs to which we subscribe. These are the objectives for which we will work and we invite those who are prepared to work with us to achieve these objectives to join us and to travel the same road.</P>

      <P>Despite what the Taoiseach has said in his opening remarks on this debate, it is my belief and the belief of my Party that he is to be criticised for his failure to reconvene the Dáil before now in view of the events that occurred in the Six Counties during the month of August.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach should have considered the vital interest and the concerns of my Party&mdash;and I am sure, also, the concern of the Fine Gael Party &mdash; when these events were taking place.  I requested the Taoiseach on 14th August to call the Dáil together for the purpose of discussing the situation but he refused.  I must say it was not just a blank refusal.  In his reply, the Taoiseach expressed the concern of the Government and said that they were watching events.  When the situation worsened on the 15th August, I repeated my request verbally to the Taoiseach but, again, he believed that the Dáil should not be reassembled. Yet again, to show our vital concern and interest in the matter, we requested the Taoiseach on the 24th of last month to initiate a debate on Six County affairs on the resumption of the Dáil.  He was reluctant to do this but I should like to thank him on behalf of my Party for eventually acceding to the request that there should be a debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As to whether there should be a debate.  The question was one of timing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to that in his opening remarks and said he resisted a request that the Dáil be recalled but, on the other hand, he said he welcomed the fact that there was this debate here today.  It is hardly necessary for me to emphasise that the Stormont Government, who were also in recess, decided to have two special sessions.  This was the most important if not the most tragic development in the Six Counties during the past 50 years and my criticism is that the Government decided to keep the action to themselves.</P>
      <P>As far as I can remember, the Dáil was specially convened on at least two other occasions: one was to discuss a Bill that was described as the ESB Emergency Powers Bill and the second, which was, I suppose, a little more important, was the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  It is not good enough that when events such as those that have occurred in the Six Counties take place we should be blandly told that the Dáil is in recess, the people are on holidays, or, worse still, that the House is being decorated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy ought not to allege these things against me. I did not make these excuses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the recess, I asked the Taoiseach if Leinster House was not ready would there be some other place where the Dáil might sit. I am suggesting that, even if repairs were being carried out to the House, it should have been possible for us to assemble in this city in order to discuss the subject matter of this debate. Maybe the Government and the Taoiseach believed that some Members of the House would run amok and further inflame an already too-inflamed situation. But, after all, this is a democratic Parliament.  May I also point out that the British Government regarded the situation in such an urgent fashion that they devoted the first day of their <Col N="1419" /> session to a discussion of events in the Six Counties during the past two months.  I understand the responsibility of the Government as far as decision making is concerned.</P>
      <P>The Government have this important responsibility, but Parliament, Dáil Éireann, is more important than the Government.  If there were any fears as to what line a debate might take on the 16th August or the 15th September we should have been able, as democratically-elected representatives of this nation, to live up to our responsibility and to treat Dáil Éireann and the subject with the utmost dignity.  We should not have been treated as second-class Members of Dáil Éireann, as if all wisdom and knowledge were in the custody of the Government or of Members of the Government Party.</P>
      <P>I believe Dáil Éireann should have been recalled.  We have expressed concern for the Six Counties.  For the last fifty years we have spoken about Partition in this House and in various assemblies throughout the world.  Here was a situation in which people were being shot and killed, houses burned, people forced to evacuate their homes and in many cases to flee down to the Republic; yet it was not considered opportune to call a meeting of the national Parliament.  If a meeting of Dáil Éireann had been called and if we had had a debate the Government would have been fortified in any actions they subsequently took.  Important and far-reaching decisions were taken.  Some decisions were taken that could have had far-reaching consequences and which, in my view, normally would be the responsibility of the whole of Dáil Éireann.  We do not mind criticism. We in the Labour Party do not believe anybody can criticise us too severely for our activities during the crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Labour Party did what we believed was the right thing to do in order to try to prevent further loss of life and property and to ensure the preservation of law and order in the Six Counties.  To that end, we visited London on the 17th or 18th August.  We found ourselves in a position where we had to defend the right of the Government to be concerned <Col N="1420" /> and to express its concern.  We were in this position without being given the opportunity of assisting and co-operating with the Government through discussion in Dáil Éireann. This was a matter of vital and urgent concern, not alone for the supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party but for those of the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party as well.  A discussion in the Dáil would have enabled a united front to be presented not alone to this country but to Britain and the whole world.</P>
    <P>In addition, our brethren in the Six Counties would have been given a sense of re-assurance and of the concern felt for them by their countrymen in the Republic.  A meeting of Dáil Éireann would have given the people of the Republic a spirit of involvement rather than leaving them with a sense of frustration which many of them undoubtedly felt during that critical time, particularly during August.</P>
    <P>I have made my protest so far as this matter is concerned.  I do not want to pursue it further.  My party discussed the situation for many hours.  We belive that in a national crisis, such as that in which we were all involved at that time, the fairest and most responsible thing to do would be to have a discussion in which the three Parties in this House would participate.</P>
    <P>With regard to the situation in the Six Counties I believe &mdash; and the Taoiseach and Deputy Cosgrave have subscribed to this view &mdash; that Partition is not a matter on which to score political points, particularly at this critical period.  The Taoiseach may resent my criticism of him as leader of the Government in not recalling the House.  He may not agree with some of the views and may resent some of the criticism in this debate, but I want to reassure him, the members of the Fianna Fáil Party and the House generally that my views are being given sincerely and honestly on matters which affect the livelihood of the people of the whole country.  It must have been obvious that the political parties in this country and, indeed, the people in the country generally were concerned about the events in the Six Counties.  This must have been obvious, particularly during the past 12 months.  It must have been <Col N="1421" /> obvious from the activities in which we engaged with regard to the Six Counties.  We were in constant consultation with our colleagues in the Council of Labour in the Six Counties. The Council of Labour has a membership which includes people like Paddy Devlin and Gerry Fitt, who were at the centre of the heat in what can be described as the battles of the Falls Road and elsewhere and in the city of Derry.</P>
    <P>We, as a political party, believed that the most useful thing we could do would be to use our contacts with the British Labour Party in order to emphasise the risks and dangers in the situation and in order to emphasise the necessity to speed the pace of reform. We felt our duty as a minority party was to refrain from criticism of our Government's action.  Incidentally, on occasions we had to rebut some British criticism of our Government's actions.  We did this, not because we thought that the Government's action was not deserving of criticism but because we felt that the right place to make that criticism and comment was here in our own national Parliament to which we had been sent by the electorate so shortly before.  There may be risks involved, as the Taoiseach has stated, in this debate.  We believe it is our democratic right and duty to express our point of view on behalf of those who sent us here.  All three Parties are concerned in this situation because we have to be concerned.  Let us face it &mdash; we are all not blameless in the attitudes we have adopted towards the Six Counties and the people who live there.  Prior to October of last year it could not be said there was great concern in this Parliament about civil rights.  It was only the events at Burntollet and the situation in Derry that brought home to the people, not only of the Six Counties but of the Republic, the demand for civil rights and the abysmal absence of civil rights so far as the minority were concerned.  None of us is blameless in that.  We can all share various degrees of blame.  There has been a certain amount of complacency in our attitude towards the Six Counties in recent years and for many years back.</P>
    <P>In recent years the Government pursued <Col N="1422" /> a policy which I, as leader of this Party, applauded.  I am speaking of the policy of fraternisation between this Government and members of the Stormont Government.  The policy was initiated by the former Taoiseach, Mr. Seán Lemass.  We supported it at the time.  Not only did we express our support at that time for fraternisation between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister, or between Ministers from each side of the Border, but we also advocated that there would be greater fraternisation so far as the rank and file were concerned in other institutions in the two parts of this country.  I am afraid the Government in pursuing that policy fell into the error of ignoring the systematic denial of rights to the minority in the Six Counties.  The Government must take its share of the blame for that action.  They just cannot ignore the situation.  All of us who were Members of the Eighteenth Dáil remember questions being asked by various Members of the Labour Party with regard to civil rights.  When a question was raised about a meeting between Ministers either in Dublin or Belfast &mdash; as Deputy M. O'Leary was wont to ask &mdash; as to whether there had been discussions on the question of discrimination in housing and jobs and local government franchise, invariably the reply was that these matters were not discussed.  On other occasions Deputy O'Leary was ignored and I remember occasions on which he was shouted down by members of the Government front bench who told him he was trying to create trouble.  We should reflect on that at a time when we know from our contacts with representatives from the Six Counties that this was the vital question which concerned not alone those of the minority, who are usually described as Catholics, but many hundreds of thousands of others as well.  Attention to the speeches and comments made by people like Deputy Michael O'Leary might have obviated a great deal of the misunderstanding and trouble that the people in the Six Counties have experienced over the last two or three months.</P>
    <P>Our concern, needless to remark, became much greater after 5th October of last year, after the events of Burntollet <Col N="1423" /> and Derry.  Prior to that, because we knew what the situation was we visited London with two parliamentary colleagues &mdash; I describe them advisedly as colleagues &mdash; Paddy Devlin and Gerry Fitt who, at all times, have been and still are in the forefront of the fight to ensure that civil rights will be fully applied.  I do not think it is any secret because we declared publicly through the press, radio and television that we were disappointed when, in the month of May of last year, there seemed to be a certain amount of complacency, or ignorance, on the part of the Home Office in Britain.  If we did not take notes I am sure Lord Stoneham's private secretary will see in the notes he took, if he refers to them, that we warned that the Six Counties was developing into a situation which would, if not corrected and taken notice of by the British Government, degenerate into a virtual state of civil war.  Unfortunately, this to a degree did happen. The British Government did not concern itself and was not prepared to act on the question of civil rights.</P>
    <P>I must confess again that, when we visited in May and met some people, Members of the House of Commons, who were not entirely <i>au fait</i> with the situation, they dismissed the matter as another row between Catholics and Protestants or, globally, as another row amongst the Irish.  I do not know whether it was, as I say, complacency or ignorance on the part of those who met us in the Home Office, but they were quite unable to see any necessity for urgency in this particular matter.  I accept what the Taoiseach has said with regard to the visits of the Minister for External Affairs to Lord Chalfont and others and I accept his efforts in the United Nations.  We made efforts as a minority Party.  How much more effective could our Government spokesmen have been had they in February, or even May, of this year made these things known to the British Government, the Government which says it has responsibility for affairs in the Six Counties?  It would be an understatement to say how disappointed we were that the Taoiseach did not meet the British Prime Minister.  I cannot conceive <Col N="1424" /> of any reasonable excuse by either for not meeting at some time from the end of April or at the beginning of August before the trouble started in Derry and Belfast.  I do not know whose fault it was, but had such a meeting taken place a great deal of the trouble that took place over the last two months might have been avoided.</P>
    <P>When the crisis was at its height, again as a minority Party, as a group who had visited the Six Counties twice during the week in which 12th August fell, we asked again for the recall of the Dáil in order that we might be at one.  I am not breaking any confidence when I say that I spoke to the Taoiseach and told him we were going to London to see certain people and he remarked: &ldquo;As long as we are all on the same lines&rdquo;. I gladly accepted that.  We visited London to emphasise again the seriousness of the situation.  We met Lord Chalfont.  The Minister for External Affairs had met him previously. We met our colleagues; I say &ldquo;our colleagues&rdquo; deliberately despite the ridicule to which we are at times subjected by members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  We met members of the British Labour Party and members of the Executive.  Even though most were on holidays they were available to meet us because they could gauge the temperature in the Six Counties.  We told them what the situation was and what we believed should be done in order to save lives and property.  At that particular stage the urgent necessity was to ensure law and order in Belfast, Armagh, Derry and elsewhere. That was the important thing, not talk about the Constitution and Partition.</P>
    <P>In mid-August the Catholics in Derry and Belfast were in imminent danger of their lives.  Unfortunately, some lost their lives.  As far as law and order were concerned, they were in the hands of the B Specials and other groups of armed Orange fanatics.  It was quite clear to us, as it must have been quite clear to everybody, that the RUC would not protect these people.  Indeed, they went so far as to threaten this minority in danger of <Col N="1425" /> their lives.  Our Government hinted at armed intervention.  The Taoiseach has referred to that, but he must have known that we were in no position to protect the minority in question.  I may be unpopular for saying that, but it is time that truth and honesty prevailed. Had the Government through its agent, the Army, intervened to save Derry there is no doubt at all but that that would have precipitated in Belfast and elsewhere further tragedy and disaster.  The Taoiseach had no intention of intervening.  Nobody thought our Government would intervene.  Even Major Chichester Clark seemed to appreciate the difficulty; he stated recently that he knew there was no intention of moving the Irish Army over the Border.</P>
    <P>In an effort to prevent lives being lost the Government decided to call for a United Nations peace-keeping force.  The Government must have known that at that particular time there was no possibility of getting that peace-keeping force.  Even if they had succeeded in getting a peace-keeping force they must have known how impossible it would be to organise such a force in a matter of days or hours. That was the degree of urgency to ensure that the situation would not go entirely out of hand.  There was also a call for a joint Irish and British peace-keeping force.  I suppose, if that could have been got at the time, there would have been no objection to it.</P>
    <P>The situation was that you had the RUC and the B Specials, the B Specials who ran amok in the Falls Road, in Derry and elsewhere.  You had the RUC who openly showed their hostility to the minority.  We ask ourselves now, as we asked ourselves on 13th August, who was there to protect those who were being attacked, shot at and killed.  They needed some protection.  They could not get it from the United Nations.  There could not be agreement on a British-Irish peace-keeping force; they could not depend, to put it mildly, on the RUC.  They certainly could not depend on the B Specials.  What was the only alternative? It was to utilise the armed forces from Britain in order that they might preserve law and order.  Instead <Col N="1426" /> of being an occupation force they could be turned into a peace-keeping force.  Nobody deplores as much as the Taoiseach and Deputy Cosgrave the presence of British Forces in the Six Counties at any time, but it was to be protected by them that the people in the Bogside and the Falls Road asked.</P>
    <P>This is what they told the delegation of the Irish Parliamentary Labour Party who visited these stricken areas that week, because they realised better than anybody else that this was the only protection they could get.  I firmly believe that if that force had not intervened the toll of lives would have been much greater than it has been.  The people in Bogside and the Falls Road welcomed this force as the only protection available at that time.  As a matter of fact, they went further and asked that it be made more effective by the addition of further strength.</P>
    <P>We supported them in their demands and we are not worried about the cheap jibes that may come &mdash; not from this House &mdash; from people outside in criticism of the attitude we took in regard to ensuring that people's lives and property would be safeguarded in the Six Counties.  The Government, again at that time, renewed their call for a United Nations peace-keeping force and I am aware that many people in the country were encouraged by this, encouraged by the speech which the Minister for External Affairs, Dr. Hillery, made and they honestly believed there would be a very successful outcome.  As a matter of fact, many people believed that there would have been a decision by the Security Council in about three or four hours from the commencement of the debate.  However, let us face it, the Government must have known, and the Minister and his Department with their special knowledge of the United Nations must have known, that this was not &ldquo;on&rdquo; either.</P>
    <P>Having said that, we all realise that the crisis is not by any means over. It may have assumed a different aspect but it is not over.  There is slightly less danger to the minority who were in such a dire position in August but it is significant that for the first time, because <Col N="1427" /> they had to, a British Government have shown their concern.  They had to because they had no option. British Governments have been indifferent for too long not necessarily to Partition, about which they have been reminded so often, but about the denial of civil rights to about one-third of the people in the Six Counties.  The Labour Government in Britain must accept responsibility for their indifference to this situation as well.  The Labour Government have been in office on three occasions in the past 50 years and as far as we know they have done very little to acquaint themselves with the real situation there.  They were a minority Government in 1930 and in 1949 they were in office again and their only act of interest in the Six Counties at that time was the passing of the Ireland Act of 1949.  The Government, since they came into office, seem to have been unable or unwilling to act until the situation developed into crisis proportions, of which we now have ample evidence.</P>
    <P>We saw no awareness of their interest in our talks with the Home Office, particularly in May.  They were better informed when we visited them in August but it was not until the 12th August, with the Apprentice Boys parade, that the British Government became alive to the seriousness of the situation, a situation highlighted not on the question of Partition but on the question of the denial of basic civil rights to the minority.  It was also highlighted to a lesser extent for the people in the Republic of Ireland.  I would subscribe to what the Taoiseach said that even at this late stage there must be recognition of the initiative of the British Government, led by Mr. James Callaghan, the Home Secretary, and the steps taken to insist that reforms be decided on as a matter of urgency and a further recognition of Mr. Callaghan's apparent determination and insistence that the reforms be carried out as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>We will certainly maintain our contacts with the British Labour Party who are now, and I hope after the election will continue to be, the British Government.  I have not seen the Taoiseach's <Col N="1428" /> script yet but I do not think he mentioned what, if any, discussions there will now be between the British and Irish Governments so that they also can insist and pressurise as much as they can on the particular reforms which are so badly needed.  For our part, in our meetings with the British Labour Party, we shall continue to insist on these reforms, on the granting of civil rights, in regard to housing, jobs, local government franchise and reforms in regard to discrimination in any form in which it exists now.</P>
    <P>One of the most important reforms that must be carried out and about which pressure must be continued is the implementation of the Hunt Report on the RUC and the B Specials.  I find it confusing to read the various interpretations of the recommendations in the Hunt Report.  One wonders if they are to be abolished and if they are to reappear under another name, in another guise, but with the same role in which they have been employed over a long period of time.  Under whose control will they be?  That will be a very important factor.  Certainly it is not quite clear from reports in the press and statements from various Ministers of the Stormont Government what is intended.</P>
    <P>We had the position in which 117 B Specials in Newtownards resigned because, I expect, they believed that they were to be disbanded and shoved into a backroom, but, after certain promises were made by the Six-County Prime Minister, they decided to change their minds.  There must be a clear recognition of what the recommendations mean and if the Stormont Government cannot indicate what they mean it is up to Mr. Callaghan to give his interpretation &mdash; I know what it will be &mdash; and to make sure that it will be implemented. There is recognition that the RUC should not be predominantly a Protestant force but again there is no indication from Stormont as to what the real recommendation is in regard to the RUC.  In any event, one is prompted to ask, if there was any necessity for the B Specials at all, why they are necessary now.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said, and I agree with him, that there is no real armed threat <Col N="1429" /> to the people of the Six Counties.  If they have fears, real or imaginary, in that regard I do not know if we can dispel them.  I believe if the real Hunt proposals, with their proper interpretation, are truly accepted the minority in the Six Counties should be prepared to play their future part in the preservation of law and order in that area. Law and order in the past has meant to the minority fear and suspicion and also the promotion of the interests of the Unionist Party, but if a properlyreorganised police force, in which the minority would participate, is set up most, if not all, of that fear and suspicion would disappear in a short time.</P>
    <P>We have been partitioned now for nearly 50 years.  I cannot say, the Taoiseach cannot say, Deputy Cosgrave cannot say, any honest Member in this House cannot say precisely, nor can anybody at present say, when this country will be reunited. But there was the Partition that was enforced by a British House of Commons and I think we must again take some share of the blame in that we have tolerated two Irelands in the one Ireland over the last 50 years.  To all intents and purposes, even though, on either side of the Border, we call ourselves Irishmen, we are poles apart, may be much farther apart than we are from people from England or Scotland or Wales.  Our communication is very limited, indeed, save for the excellent communication that there is, for example, in the two organisations that come to my mind &mdash; the trade union movement and the Gaelic Athletic Association &mdash; and to some extent, I suppose, in some of the other sporting organisations.  For the future there must be the closest possible communication with all sections of those who really believe in the application of human and civil rights so that we may act in concert with them in the aspirations, which I believe they have, for a united Ireland and accepting that force, the withdrawal of troops, the abandonment by Britain of the Six Counties, will not of itself solve the problem of Partition.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach, I think again has said, there is no use in ignoring the attitude, even though we may regard <Col N="1430" /> it as a stubborn attitude, of the Northern Unionists who have fears, whether they are real or imaginary.  These fears, whether they are real or imaginary, are there and must be taken into account in the solution not alone of Partition but certainly of the other problem also.</P>
    <P>Let me reiterate, I do not believe for one moment that if the British troops were taken out of the Six Counties in the morning this would provide a solution.  I think we could run ourselves into much more trouble than there has been in recent times.  There is no consolation now in beating our drums or our chests and telling ourselves that Partition was created by a British Parliament and that no Irish man or woman north or south of the Border voted for it.  Partition now exists and, let us face it, if we do not believe in coercion and the use of force, it exists because there is a majority, in the main Unionists, who want this country partitioned.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if we want to see the country united we must make our own contribution.  There will be a contribution by those now in the minority in the normalisation of politics in the Six Counties where the electorate will be attracted to policy, to political philosophy and abandon their attachment, and, in particular, the working-class will abandon their attachment, to the Unionist Party.  The only way this can be done, in my view, is by full equality, by these reforms which we hope will come pretty soon, to operate for some years.</P>
    <P>Those who now oppose the régime have a responsibility to offer an alternative. It is not for me to criticise the public representatives in the Six Counties, whether they be from the Unionist Party or this party or that party but I think they must recognise, and seem to have recognised, that the time has come when, collectively, those who believe in the application of human rights and those who believe in the reunification of this country, under conditions, have a responsibility to offer an alternative in the way of policy and in the way of attitude.</P>
    <P>At this stage there should be a tribute paid to the trade unions, particularly <Col N="1431" /> in the city of Belfast, for the fact that in the riots in Belfast city in August, in the shipyards and the various places of work sectarianism was virtually ignored.  For those who can remember, this is a far different situation from that which obtained in the pogroms of so many years ago.  We, too, can certainly give a lead.  This point will be further expanded by members of my party who will speak in this debate.</P>
    <P>The repeal or deletion of Article 44 is not the complete solution.  I do not say that the Taoiseach has put this up as the complete solution.  There are other constitutional changes that we must consider.  I do not think we should have a referendum.  I do not think it would be necessary to have a referendum &mdash; may be we will have to go through the motions of it &mdash; in order to delete Article 44.</P>
    <P>Not alone must we have constitutional changes but we must have changes in our economic and social policies.  The Taoiseach has said this. The Taoiseach must recognise this. But the Taoiseach as Head of a Government who, it now appears, will be there for the next four years must take steps to provide for these economic and social changes in accordance, for example, with what he said in an interview to a British magazine &mdash; I think it was the <i>Director</i>, in October, 1968.  I do not purport to quote him entirely but I do not think he will say that I quote him wrongly when I say that he said apropos the reunification of this country:</P>
    <P>We must improve our standards so that unification would not mean material loss to people in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>There is a genuine fear, and not because they are Catholics or Protestants, in the minds of people that reunification for them means a diminution in their standard of living.  I know this from personal conversations with people in the Six Counties.  They may be very fervent about their religion, they may be very fervent about the reunification of Ireland, but they have a genuine fear when they think in <Col N="1432" /> terms &mdash; I do not want to flog this &mdash; of social welfare and so on.</P>
    <P>For us, force is out.  Unless subsequent speakers may say the contrary, it appears to me from the two speeches made, and I have known from my own party and have known for years and years, that as far as reunification is concerned force is out and, further, coercion is out.  In the long run we believe and have always said it, there is a solution and it is James Connolly's solution.  These are not his exact words but Connolly, when he talked about the unity of Ireland, to which he was devoted, said that when ordinary people in Belfast and Derry recognised their identity of interest with ordinary people in Dublin, Cork and Limerick we would be well on our way to a united Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take the last point made by Deputy Corish first, that is, his expression of the Labour Party's fears that the loss of benefits to the people of the Six County area is detrimental to the reunification of our country.  It certainly is not because, in the first place, there will be no losses in social welfare. There is no difference at the moment in social welfare when one considers that a married man with four children here gets £7 a week and in the north a married man with four children gets £9 a week but during his working time overpays the difference.  Of course, if the country were reunited in the morning, people in Northern Ireland would lose. This is what it is all about.  The people in privileged positions and kept in privileged positions through the Unionist Party and that Government that has been in office there for so long would lose.  If you are going to have fair play in the north or if you are going to have a united country with civil rights, then the small section of privileged people who are keeping the present situation in operation in the North of Ireland will and must lose materially and it is wrong for any party here to say that we must ensure that they will not lose.  We cannot ensure that the privileged classes in the Six Counties will not lose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good part of Deputy Corish's speech was devoted to a criticism of the <Col N="1433" /> Taoiseach and the Government for not reconvening the Dáil during the recess. This is a debatable point.  I cannot see any great good that would have come of it.  Points of view would have been put forward.  He indicated that the Stormont Government did have two sessions of Parliament in the meantime and that the British Government devoted one day to it.  Of course, why should they not?  This is a problem which the Northern Ireland Government and the British Government must solve.  The situation there at the moment cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>I think the British Labour Government are genuinely interested in seeing that reforms will be carried out. I think Mr. Callaghan is in earnest: indeed, he must be in earnest.  Since 5th October, 1968, the minority in the north are not prepared ever again to live under the type of legislation and the implementation of that legislation that has gone on for the past 40 years. I think that, since 5th October, 1968, never again will that situation be allowed to continue in the Six Counties. I believe that the British Labour Government are genuinely interested in the reforms suggested by Mr. Callaghan himself, suggested by the Civil Rights people and suggested in the Cameron and Hunt Reports.  We certainly cannot have the type of community relations and the type of government Northern Ireland has had in the past.  The O'Neill Government did its best to go part of the way.  It is most unfortunate that the right-wing people of the Unionist Party did not allow some progress: they brought a lot on their own heads by not allowing Captain O'Neill to carry out reforms. Now, I think the British Government are seeing to it that these reforms will be carried out.</P>
    <P>There was talk about the need to reconvene the Dáil during the recess. We shall have many more debates on the situation in the Six County area. No miracle will happen overnight. There is a programme of reform.  It will be a long, heavy, uphill drag. Even with the best wishes in the world, the Six County Government will not be allowed to go full speed ahead with some of the reforms.  Indeed, this is <Col N="1434" /> a problem there at the moment.  Even though there are those who are in favour of carrying out the wishes of the British Government and the recommendations of the Cameron and Hunt Reports, they have their own right-wing Unionists and others breathing down their necks so that it will be a very uphill drag for both the Stormont and the British Governments.</P>
    <P>There are fears, even at the moment, that sections of the Northern community will not allow either of the two Governments, or both together, to implement the decisions already taken. That is why there is so much querying of what was meant by statements by Major Chichester Clark and by Mr. Callaghan.  It is a very difficult situation and it is one on which we should not heap any more coal.</P>
    <P>We should make our position clear. I am glad the Taoiseach and the Government have done so and have been doing so since this trouble started.  In Derry on 12th, 13th and 14th August, there was widespread congratulation on the Taoiseach's speech and restatement of the policy of the Government of the Republic in regard to the north.  There was widespread appreciation of the field hospitals along the Border and of the fact that refugees were being catered for.  This was a very necessary and practical step.  Apart from the urgent need to deal with casualties there was the overall declaration that we, on this side of the Border, were very much alive to the problems, to the woes and to the ills, of the minority in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>I do not think we have any difficulty in convincing Unionists that there is fair play for all sections of the community in the Republic.  There is a very high proportion of non-Catholics in the community in which I live.  I know that, down through the years, they have had a fair crack of the whip. They have got that in regard to education, agriculture &mdash; in which they are deeply involved &mdash; and the other benefits enjoyed by the community at large. They have certainly not been behind in the receipt of any of these services. A northern Unionist need go no further than the Border to discover that his brethren, on this side of it, have <Col N="1435" /> no cause for complaint.  That fact has been expressed, and strongly expressed, by the leaders of the Protestant churches in Donegal and on the Border. It has publicly been stated and stressed that this is the case.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any fear that if there is a 32-County Republic those people, in general, will be treated as second-class citizens.  In the Republic, our minority do not regard themselves as second-class citizens: they never have and never will.  However, as I said at the outset, a fairly small, privileged class in Northern Ireland, who have succeeded in having more than their share of the benefits and of the wealth up there, fear they will lose it.</P>

      <P>Consider, for instance, the businessman who, as a commandant in the B Specials, gets £2,000 a year for which, in return, he does very little.  This sort of thing is repeated all over.  I think that this small section has convinced some of the ordinary working-class Unionists that they will be worse off if they come under a 32-County Republic.</P>
      <P>When Mr. Callaghan visited the Shankill Road in Belfast and Fountain Street in Derry he saw small houses in bad condition, and these are Protestant Unionist parts of both cities, where there were no sanitation, no flush toilets, no bathrooms.  This, in itself, bears out the fact that a small group have convinced these people that they would be worse off in a 32-County Republic.  Nothing could be worse than the conditions in which they live at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share with Deputy Corish the belief that the present Labour Government genuinely mean to provide &mdash; and this is what is important &mdash; equal opportunities in housing, equal opportunities in jobs and equal voting rights. I must say I am surprised that the Belfast Government have not long ago given equal voting rights.  This only applies to local government.  It does not affect more than three or four <Col N="1436" /> areas in the Six Counties.  I feel that it was a major tactical blunder on their part that they did not say: &ldquo;OK, we will give you equal voting rights.&rdquo; One of the places which would benefit is Derry city which now they do not control; they have a Commission there.</P>
    <P>I feel that what we should be doing here is ensuring that we are keeping a firm watch on the situation.  We agree that the Hunt and Cameron Reports and Mr. Callaghan's statements of intent are desirable and that they will go part of the way towards solving the problem there.  But we must also try to ensure in every possible way that those measures of reform will be carried out because there are several people north and south of the Border who have grave doubts that they will be or fear they will be watered down or that if legislation to implement them is forthcoming that, while <i>de jure</i> they will be forthcoming, <i>de facto</i> and behind the scenes the full value of the reforms will not be got or felt.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the right wing of the Unionist Party have found some reason to come and interfere with the hydro-electric scheme in Ballyshannon. This is a scheme which supplies both the Six Counties and part of the Twenty-six County area.  It is of benefit to both sides.  It is an example of what should be done, can be done and will be done in future between north and south.  Other such co-operative efforts have taken place and it is desirable that they should take place.  It is unfortunate that some of the extremists from the north have seen fit in their anger and hatred to try to do away with this link.</P>
    <P>I feel that what the Government should do in future and in the immediate future is to create more links with our people of all classes in the north, create more bridges, and in that way assure the people there that we have given fair play here and that we are behind and will back fair play in the Six Counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to pay tribute to the Taoiseach for the manner in which he conducted the <Col N="1437" /> entire affair.  I suppose I can go so far as to say that being leader of the Party of which he is leader it was an almost impossible task.  I also wish to compliment him and thank him for the attention he gave me when I felt it my duty to contact him with information that was available to me and which I thought he should have.</P>
      <P>The whole tenor of this debate has been concerned with the reunification of the country.  Some speakers, not all, have brought in partition.  I am afraid that politicians this side of the Border for far too long have been looking at the northern question in the context of the 1920s and that too many people, particularly people belonging to the Government Party, have been afraid to come away from that.  I believe that the Government Party entirely misread the situation north of the Border and were only prepared, for their own domestic political gains, to bring in Northern Ireland and the Border issue and partition whenever it suited them. I do not believe for one second that any one of them was sincerely interested in the domestic matters or the wrongs north of the Border and I am convinced beyond shadow of doubt that all the achievements that have been gained by the civil rights people north of the Border have been gained by themselves alone.  Anything which has been achieved they can claim credit for, and no Member of this Parliament, including myself, can say that he contributed anything towards those achievements so far.</P>
      <P>This is another sad episode of Irish history.  This is the sad story of Irish people failing to understand Irish people.  This is the sad story of people who said certain things simply because it was the popular thing to be Republican.  But everything, they said simply hindered the reunification of Ireland and alienated people who were really Irish but who had not got the same patriotic priorities that we claim to have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have over the last few months been in contact with people north of the Border.  I want to say, lest perhaps I be misunderstood, that my journeys north of the Border were purely to try to get a picture of what was happening there, to try to understand what the <Col N="1438" /> Orangeman, the Unionists and the nonCatholic north of the Border objected to when he looked at people like myself from south of the Border.  I wanted to know why people north of the Border resent any statements from politicians from this side.  What kind of picture have we been presenting to the Unionist, the Orangeman, the non-Catholic north of the Border?  What type of united Ireland have we been trying to sell him?  Every time we opened our mouths it was: &ldquo;End partition&rdquo;; and when we talked about ending partition it had to be done today, tomorrow, next week or as soon as possible.  When we talked about partition we gave the impression that the ending of partition would solve all our difficulties and would be the beginning of theirs.  Whether we like it or not, and perhaps I contributed in some small way myself, we painted this picture.  This is the type of picture we have painted for the Unionists with whom I had the privilege of discussing the matter over a cup of tea in cafés and hotels.  Nobody in this House or in Stormont or Westminster at present has a solution to the Irish problem. Nobody has a solution, least of all myself and I do not propose at this stage to tell the Taoiseach what he should do but I believe he deserves the utmost praise being a person from the Party to which he belongs, for the way he conducted himself and controlled the affairs of the nation in the very delicate situation of that week in mid-August.</P>

      <P>I say this because I know it to be true and I am giving honour where honour is due.  I remember the evening in Derry when the British military came in there.  I had heard stories coming across the Border.  I feel as much at home in the city of Derry or in the town of Strabane as I do in my own constituency because, as the Chair knows, these people have much more in common with the Donegal people than possibly the Cork and Kerry people have.  When I visited Derry, not disclosing who I was or making any effort to identify myself, I moved through Paisleyites, civil <Col N="1439" /> rights supporters, through Catholics and Protestants.  I went to the Protestant part of the town and I went to the Bogside.  I witnessed terror, revenge and hatred such as I never thought I would see from human beings.  I asked myself why people lose their heads in such situations.  Why do they want to throw petrol bombs?  Why do they want to get guns to shoot others or to defend themselves?  Why should this happen in a Christian country like Ireland between neighbours who are playing football with each other or going to dances with each other, or sitting beside each other in the cinemas?  Why should this happen? It is not an easy question to answer but I feel that the reason for most of it is fear, fear of each other.  If there is fear it is coming from both sides and we must share the same responsibility for that fear as the northern Unionists, to some of whom Deputy Cunningham referred, who go to extremes to protect themselves.  There is real fear in Sandy Row and Shankill in Belfast and in Fountain Street in Derry.  I should like to know how this fear can be abated or dispelled because if you remove this fear you can then get people to understand each other.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Taoiseach accepted virtually <i>verbatim</i> the Fine Gael document on Northern Ireland and I am proud that I contributed in a major way towards the compilation of it.  This document asks this House formally to reject the use of force as a means of reunifying this country.  While many of us know that this has always been the position and while sensible men south of the Border have always believed that force or the gun was not the answer to the reunification problem, we were too hesitant in saying this publicly.  As a result, and because of misguided deeds of over-enthusiastic people who would like to call themselves Republicans, people north of the Border became afraid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The answer to the Irish problem lies in time and understanding.  We must go north of the Border and we must ask those Unionists who do not want to join us in a 32-county Ireland what it is we represent that they do not like. <Col N="1440" /> We must ask them what type of 32-county Ireland they would like.  I do not care what party one represents in this House, we all want to see a 32-county Ireland at some stage.  We should get away from this phraseology of &ldquo;united Ireland&rdquo;.  United Ireland represents to the Unionists north of the Border a place where, when you hear the National Anthem of the Republic of Ireland, you click your heels, stand to attention and salute; when you see the Tricolour you wave it in the face of a Unionist; a country completely dominated by the Catholic Church; a place where you must learn Irish before you are successful; a place where, if you play national games, you must not play any foreign games.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, these are the realities and I would be failing in my duty if I did not bring them to the attention of the House.  We must get away from the concept of a united Ireland which we have been putting before the Unionists.  The Unionist reacts to this concept with fears which we know are unjustified.  It is not his fault that he sees these fears.  While not a member of the GAA, I respectfully suggest that Association should have a look at this point.  I also respectfully suggest that the Government should have a look at their Irish language policy.  As a Member of the House I am satisfied that the interference of the Church in matters of State is of no consequence.  When the Church does interfere I welcome such moves because they are undertaken only in the interests of the community.</P>
    <P>The future policy of this State towards reunification must be decided in consultation with democratically elected people north of the Border because these are the people who will be concerned.  I cannot understand why people in Cork and Kerry &mdash; I name those two counties because they are so far removed from the Border &mdash; can throw up their hands in horror and protest when somebody says: &ldquo;Let us take Partition out of the Irish question at the moment.&rdquo; Partition is not an issue in this crisis.  Irrespective of what the Government may think, among the many people, Catholic and Protestant, Nationalist and Unionist, <Col N="1441" /> that I have met in the past few months, I have not heard one person &mdash;I say this deliberately&mdash;north of the border say that at this time he would like to make partition an issue, despite the fact that most people, including Unionists, realise that, ultimately, Ireland must be a 32-county nation.</P>
    <P>But what type of 32-county nation? Is it one where we shall have our way all the time or a 32-county Ireland where we will agree with the majority of the people north of the Border? There is much talk of <i>de facto</i> and <i>de jure</i> recognition of Northern Ireland, and it is sophisticated talk so far as I am concerned.  I am concerned about the real fears of the ordinary workingclass people, Catholic and Protestant, north of the Border.  I am concerned about an understanding between Catholics and Protestants in Border constituencies, such as my own and I should say publicly a word of praise particularly for the people in East Donegal, where you have 50 per cent Catholic and 50 per cent Protestant, for the manner in which they kept the lines of communication open when it was very easy to take sides.  This is the danger of the tragedy: it is far too easy to take sides.  You have extremists in our midst and on the Protestant side.  They do not represent majority thinking of any group of people.  I do not agree that the extremists on the Catholic or the Republican side represent my view or the view of ordinary Catholics or Nationalists, and neither do I say that the extremists in Shankill represent the average Protestant viewpoint north of the Border.  What they do is this: they draw battlelines from which it is very hard to depart.</P>
    <P>I had the experience of being in the Bogside when people lost their nerve and were using every means to protect themselves, where there was no opting out and where the situation was so serious that I telephoned the Taoiseach direct from Derry city and gave him an on-the-spot report.  I told him that if the Bogside were attacked that night he would be involved and I would be involved and that there would be an invasion across the Donegal border to protect people.</P>
    <P>That is the danger in this whole <Col N="1442" /> situation.  That is something to which we must be alive.  That is why in the document presented to the people by the Fine Gael Party we have called again on the Government to set up an all-Party committee, so that we can elevate Partition and the Northern Ireland problems above the political arena of southern politics, so that we can go to the Northern Ireland people as a three-party group and say: &ldquo;Look, we have come here as friends.  We came here to try to understand you.  We came here to make Ireland a 32-county Ireland in which everyone, Catholic and Protestant, Nationalist and Unionist, can live a better life.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the approach I want and that is why I have made myself more involved and more concerned with the northern problem than possibly I could have if I wanted to be neglectful about it.  I was shaken out of complacency on that evening in Derry when, as I say, terror was in the eyes of Catholics and Protestants, life meant nothing and blood was a victory instead of something of which to be ashamed and it was not all on one side.  I want to say that any efforts I made were made to seek a solution, to understand the people.  I was seeking to find if we could get those people who share our own point of view, if I may put it that way, to accept what total involvement in life north of the border means.</P>
    <P>I was present in the Bogside when the British troops arrived.  I do not know what other people think, but I never thought that I would witness a situation in which Catholics would be making tea for, and sitting down and talking to British soldiers when there were Protestants almost attacking them. This was a sight to be seen and again it demonstrates clearly the thorny situation, the impossible situation, which is the northern crisis at the moment.</P>
    <P>Many people in this House could speak at great length and become very passionate about what has happened north of the Border.  I want to endorse what the Taoiseach said in his opening remarks when he asked for understanding and restraint, and that we should be constructive.  I want to take up the Taoiseach on this point.  I want to ask him seriously to consider setting <Col N="1443" /> up an all-Party committee to work in conjunction with elected members north of the Border, and to work in conjunction with people in all walks of life north of the Border, to see if we could at some stage find a solution to the problems which seem to divide us at the moment.</P>
    <P>Some speakers have mentioned discrimination. We have continuously accused the Northern Government of religious discrimination and, at first glance, it might appear that this was a valid charge but when one looks at it closer it may not be as valid as it appears at first sight.  I quite admit that there have been wrongs north of the Border, wrongs that most people have protested about.  Any person who says there have not been wrongs north of the Border does not know the situation. There has been discrimination north of the Border but I want to say that, perhaps, it is not religious discrimination. Perhaps, I could explain it this way.</P>
    <P>If a Catholic and a Protestant look for a job in the city of Belfast we know who will get the job.  This is simply because the Unionist Party in power realise that the Protestant boy will continue to vote Unionist, whereas they have not got the same confidence in the Catholic boy.  Let us change the picture and suppose that two Protestant boys go for the same job and one happens to be a member of the Labour movement in Belfast or belongs to the Civil Rights in Belfast and the other is a Unionist, then you see the true picture.  It is the Protestant boy who supports the Unionist Party who gets the job.  When we accuse the Unionist Party north of the Border of discrimination we should hesitate to do so because people who live in glasshouses should not throw stones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Taoiseach to contact the British Government with a view to setting up a council of Ireland so that the British Government could invite people from Stormont and from this Parliament to act on that council and so that anything which is difficult to understand <Col N="1444" /> at that level could be put right.  This may have been repulsive to an older generation but at this stage the scene is completely different.  In the 1920s the Irish were fighting the British.  The enemy was Great Britain.  That is not the trouble in the north at the moment.</P>
      <P>I think it is only right to say that but for the interest which the British public took in the affairs of the north the Civil Rights movement might not have been so successful.  The row at the moment north of the Border is between Unionism and anti-Unionism.  While this may not be acceptable to the older generation, perhaps, it might be mature of us at this stage to recognise a situation in which members of the British Government, the Stormont Government and the Dublin Government could sit around a table and work out their differences.  This was envisaged at the time of the Treaty.  I do not know whether it was dropped at that time or at discussions later on but I see no reason why it cannot be re-introduced now and consideration given to it.</P>
      <P>I am told by Unionists of the older generation that for the first ten years of its existence Partition was as big an embarrassment to Unionism as it was to Nationalism.  If this is so, the only time there has been an economic boundary between this country was since the economic war.  For the first ten years from 1922 to 1932, the Border between the Six Counties and the 26 Counties was an embarrassment to the Unionists as much as it was to the Nationalists.  I was only a child in those years and I cannot say for sure.  I am quite certain that if we got away from the economic boundary again, that line which divides Derry and Donegal, and the Six Counties from the 26, would become as big an embarrassment as it was in those years. If we stopped talking about this united Ireland which we dream about and if we could present a different type of a 32 county Ireland, I am quite sure that there are a number of Protestants or Unionists who realise that they could play a very major part in the 32 Counties and they would welcome this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to tell a few stories. A very prominent man who has made <Col N="1445" /> a name for himself in the Civil Rights movement in the city of Derry and I went into a hotel for a cup of tea. He was recognised by a young boy who said he would like to talk to him for a few minutes.  We invited him to join us and he told us he was a member of the Young Unionists club in the city of Derry and that he was one of the most die-hard bigots ever born into the Protestant religion.  He said he idolised Ian Paisley until he left school. He was a boy of 17 or 18 years but he was an intelligent lad.  He said he did not realise what Catholicism was until he found it his lot to work side by side with Catholic boys and girls. He now has come to the point of realising that the only hope for the North of Ireland is in a 32 County Ireland.  They will have the same say as we have because the working class north of the Border realise just as we do that this battle is not between Catholic and Protestant but between Unionist and anti-Unionist.  It is power that is at stake.  Just the same as when we go to an election, the Fianna Fáil Party will do everything they can to stay in power&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. P.J. Lenihan Mr. P.J. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's Party would do the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe so, but I am only giving the example.  If the Fianna Fáil Party were in such an entrenched position as the Unionist Party were in Belfast, perhaps they would go to the same limits to maintain themselves in power.  That is what is shaking the hardline Unionists in the North of Ireland.  They know that if they have 60 per cent of the rights and the civil rights people have only 40 per cent, that if that is to be brought up to 50 per cent then they must lost 10 per cent. This is the trouble in the north.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Army hospitals which moved up to the Border may have served a purpose at the time, they are a sight embarrassment now and should be withdrawn.  There would not be much involved in bringing them back again if the need should arise.  I do not think it will and, therefore, the Taoiseach might, as a gesture of goodwill, ask that the military hospitals be withdrawn <Col N="1446" /> from immediately beside the Border.</P>
    <P>Very often when the Government are making representations or when they are spending money on trying to sell the problem of Partition they will spend money over the entire world.  They have embassies scattered all over the globe.  Perhaps, if they opened an office in Belfast or in other parts of Northern Ireland or established Telefís Éireann booster stations along the Border, they might sell the proper image of southern Ireland to the Unionists and in that way we would be gaining ground.  Maybe in the present dilemma north of the Border the Unionist Party have failed to sell the Hunt Report and the Cameron Commission to the Unionist hardliners.  Whether that is my business or not, there is that point to consider.</P>
    <P>During the period when the temperature of people north of the Border and, indeed, south was at its height I asked people&mdash;I have already stated I have been in very close contact with people whom I felt it was my business to consult, church leaders of all denominations&mdash;particularly those whom I felt would not share the political view I hold, to keep their opinion to themselves but to keep the lines of communication open.  I have never tried to push my political dogma down the throat of any person.</P>
    <P>Whether we realise is or not, in this small island there are two different types of people.  If I may be allowed to generalise, we have about 2½ million Nationalists who want a united Ireland, and about 1,250,000 Unionists north of the Border who will not accept that.  To those people who are loudest in praise of their own achievements, who continually proclaim at public function that they and they alone have the right to say what type of united Ireland we should have, to those people and particularly to the Republican extremists south of the Border I would make this request: For goodness' sake try to understand the political point of view of the Northern Protestant or the Northern Unionist.</P>
    <P>Whether the Republican south of the Border is prepared to accept this point of view or not, I have grown up amongst these people; I have got to <Col N="1447" /> know them.  I will not try to guess the percentage but a very big percentage of them are as much Irish as any Member of this House.  They will claim to be Irishmen and will be proud to walk down Fifth Avenue, New York, on St. Patrick's Day or will be proud to wear a shamrock in any part of the world on that day.  If we continue to tell them they have not the right to do these things in this country we are putting them into a shell and doing nothing to achieve unity.  The people most vocal in their protests about the wrongs north of the Border sometimes do more harm to national unity than the good they intend to do.  Therefore I say to all people south of the Border who want to see a 32-County Ireland, let us organise a crusade of goodwill; let us go across the Border; let us invite people north of the Border to come south, and let us be brother-Irishmen in the true sense of the expression.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There are, it seems to me, two separate issues which nevertheless, are connected.  The first is the question of the winning of a greater degree of civil right in the Six Counties at this moment.  The other question is the winning of national unity. Although they are separate issues they are, as I have said, deeply connected with each other.</P>
      <P>To those now I want to add a third issue, which is the question of civil rights and of the quality of our life in this part of Ireland.  The debate so far from the Government benches, half an hour from the Taoiseach and the speech by Deputy Cunningham, has been a perfect example of the fundamental Fianna Fáil attitude on the question of Irish unity: for external consumption loud noises, but in terms of real action practically nothing, and not even, if one can judge from this debate so far, very great interest except in so far as the matter affects the electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of the Government the situation is practically impossible. It is impossible because it is not within the power even of the most adept contortionists to face in two directions at the same time.  Internally <Col N="1448" /> for home consumption the Republican Party is Republican but in reality, in terms both of its industrial development and in terms of the controlling of its finances, they are entirely dependent on imperialism and have no intention whatsoever of struggling against it.</P>
    <P>The same sort of contradiction expresses itself through the whole of the attitude of the Government here and through the whole of the attitude of what one might call &ldquo;the Establishment&rdquo;. Since the Thirties we have had a Constitution whereby we claim jurisdiction over the whole island and yet we have an Article 44.  On the one hand we have the claim to speak for the whole nation and on the other hand we have legislation which limits the basic civil liberties of, if we consider the island as a whole, a very substantial majority of people.</P>
    <P>The same dilemma expresses itself in regard to our Government postures on the international scene since the eruption of the crisis early in August. For home consumption demands were made in regard to a United Nations' peace-keeping force and a joint British/ Irish force which we knew, in advance, would be rejected but which were treated as so much window-dressing. In terms of an effort to raise the matter in the United Nations a deliberate choice of method and of sequence in our effort was followed to ensure that we would get nothing like the discussion at the United Nations that we could have got had we realised it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw that remark.  There is, none the less, evidence of a most profound conflict inside the party between those who wish, I think, personally, with propriety, to behave as the Taoiseach has done in many ways in regard to the north and the action of those people who obviously have strained very severely in lots of ways at the discipline of keeping a coherent united front bench in the face of this present crisis.</P>
      <P>This again, to me, is an example of the basic impossibility of facing two ways, of being genuinely antiimperialistic and at the same time economically and socially subservient to Britain.  If we want to consider the things which we in this part of the country can do in order to improve the possibilities of the winning of more extensive civil rights in the North of Ireland and if we want to improve the possibilities of building a united country, then it seems to me we should set about putting our own house in order.  We can set about giving a good example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amazed to hear Deputy Cunningham saying, if I understood him correctly&mdash;I have not got the figures here to refuse him because I did not <Col N="1450" /> think anyone would make such a claim but the figures to refuse him have been published in the last few months &mdash; that the reunification of the country would mean no loss in social welfare for the working class of the north.  The documentation is precise and extensive.  For example, there was a detailed setting out of the comparative social benefits north and south in the <i>Financial Times</i> some time early in August.  It is beyond argument at this time; it is simply a fact that the workers of the north would be worse off in regard to social benefits at the present scale in the Republic than they are at the present time in the north.</P>
    <P>It can be argued, of course, that we cannot afford to have an equal scale of benefits.  We certainly cannot afford to do so without a more rapidly developing economy.  If we have an open market with regard to finance and with regard to labour with the United Kingdom, if, in fact, we are to a predominant degree, economically part of the United Kingdom, then it is simply impossible without a direct mixed economy to expand production at the rate that would ensure the possibility of paying equal or higher social benefits.</P>
    <P>We have simply not grown fast enough because we have to try to do an impossible thing within the framework of being financially part of the United Kingdom.  We have tried to exert partial independence but we have failed to develop that rate of economic growth.  We do not have equality of social services in the scale of our benefits; and by the system of, on the one hand, opposing imperialism and, on the other hand, being dependent on it and at the same time saying to any sort of foreign industrialist: &ldquo;Will you please come in with a tax holiday and develop our industry because we cannot do it ourselves?&rdquo; we will never close the gap, we shall never have the possibility of giving equal social benefits. Real economic independence and the guided development of our economy are essential if we are to be able to offer inducements that are based on an equal scheme of social benefits.  We are trying to do something which, by the rules of the game, the Government have accepted is almost impossible to do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1451" /> We can talk about the quality of the social services as well as the quantity of them because we do not need just more of them; we need to reform them.  We need to make them entirely independent of a religious influence. When I say that I do not mean of religion in general but of the influence of a particular church, because if we really want a united country we have to build a country in which more than one million Protestants&mdash;a very substantial minority of our people not like the little five per cent which we have in the south&mdash;can feel they are thoroughly equal citizens in every way. That is not the situation at this time and we could refer to various headings under which it is not the situation.</P>
    <P>For example, this has to be said and faced again: do we seriously ask that more than one million people should come into a united 32-county Republic if we deny them basic human rights in regard to contraception which they believe they have the right to?  In the same way, can we justify some of our censorship laws in regard to books, can we justify the structure of our school and hospital systems?</P>
    <P>We have been congratulating ourselves today with suggestions from the two larger parties here that, in fact, everything is fine for Protestants in the Republic.  It is true that things are vastly better for Protestan in the Republic than they are for Catholics in the Six Counties, but in all sorts of little ways the lack of a real feeling of equality expresses itself.  I have heard from both the Government and Fine Gael benches today the term &ldquo;non-Catholic&rdquo; used and it seems to me, from the sort of relations I have with Protestants, that this phrase is as offensive to them as would the term &ldquo;non-Protestant&rdquo; if applied to Catholics.  This is an offensive phrase and is an example of the thinking which expresses itself to a great extent in our political talk and in our educational system &mdash; that because we are a very fair people we will allow Protestants to live reasonably decent lives here but are merely extending this out of kindness.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1452" /> There are three strands in this country: there is what one might call a Catholic Celtic nation&mdash;this term is not very precise but it will be understood; there is the Presbyterian-Scottish group; and there is what is known as the Church of Ireland English strand.  They are all strands of considerable antiquity in this country and of total validity.  I was interested to hear a broadcast from a former Taoiseach, Mr. John A. Costello, recently. When he was asked about the crisis in relation to the mother and child scheme he said&mdash;I hope I am quoting him accurately, but it is easy to verify &mdash;&ldquo;I would do the same again because this is a Catholic country&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If we are thinking in 32-county Republic terms, which we claim to do under the Constitution, then we have to say that this is not a Catholic country, that this is a country of mixed ethnic population, of mixed religious background, of mixed culture, that our social and legal structure, even our architecture, our habits in food and dress, have a profoundly British influence, particularly in the cases of architecture, food and dress.  Therefore, if we are to tell the truth, this is a country of mixed traditions of every sort.</P>

      <P>I will accept the word &ldquo;Catholic&rdquo; with a small &ldquo;c&rdquo; to the extent that it means universal, but I am suggesting that if we are really to think in 32-County terms, the glory of Ireland is that we are, in fact, a country of mixed traditions.  This has given an extraordinary richness to our language, attitudes and culture and it is a badge of which we should be proud. We must accord complete equality, <Col N="1453" /> validity and participation in the life of the nation to Presbyterian and Church of Ireland denominations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This should be accorded them not merely through our generosity or fair play and I am glad to see there is unanimity on this from the other side of the House.  The point I am trying to make is that if we want to help the struggle for civil liberty in the north, we must look to our attitudes, to our circumstances in regard to social services in this country.  We must also look to our own civil liberties as they exist here.</P>
      <P>We have been right as citizens of this island to put our finger on the gerrymander that exists in the north, on this very scandalous and shameful thing that has given a new word to the English language, recognised everywhere. However, I should like us to be in the position where we could attack this situation in the north with clean hands.  In the last general election we had a situation in which the Government's vote dropped but their number of seats increased.  We had the disruption of the intention of PR by a gerrymander here which the figures inescapably reveal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be, but it is true nonetheless.  The fact that it is sour grapes does not lend honesty to the situation.  We are right to look for and to demand one man, one vote in the local elections in the north.  It is our duty and right to make that demand, but if you are in Dublin Corporation's area it is one man, no vote. They are better off than we are because we have abolished the local authority. If the principle is good to have honest local government in the north, it also applies to the south, and our argument for it in the north is weakened by the state of our own internal affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the Criminal Justice Bill, we understand; we have the Offences Against the State Act, and, when the late Deputy Seán Dunne in 1966 moved a Private Members' Bill to repeal that Act, it was opposed by the Government. <Col N="1454" /> There are many ways in which we need to put our house in order. The intention of the Boundary Commission was that PR should operate in Northern Ireland, and, even with the present restrictions on civil liberties, we would have a much healthier political situation there if they had PR.  Therefore, how can we advocate a 32-county Republic and at the same time strive to abolish PR which is the one way to guarantee fair representation to the various minority strands?  That is the beauty of PR.  It gives fair representation to every minority group. How can we say to those in the north &ldquo;Come on in&rdquo; when the Government Party wish to abolish the system which will guarantee those people fair representation?</P>
    <P>There is argument after argument in regard to all aspects of our life in the 26 Counties which indicate that our case would be much stronger if we could say to the 1.2 million Unionists in the North: &ldquo;We accept you as Irishmen, we accept your validity, your point of view; we accept the statements of all those who have spoken here today that we do not want to change your point of view by force of arms but by argument, because we want to be a 32-County Republic&rdquo;.  All those statements would be stronger if we did not have the blotches on our democracy which I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Finally, although great progress has been made as a result of the struggle of the people, most of whose leaders are socialists in the north, it may be lost, if it is not consolidated, but there seems to be real progress towards the winning of certain important civil liberties.  If that is done, will there suddenly be no serious further task for us?  Will the struggle for a 32-County Republic resolve itself into simply trying to change the minds, by persuasion, of honest and honourable people who are now Unionists? Will we be able to say: &ldquo;Look, we have built a better place in the 26 Counties.  Do you not want to participate in it?&rdquo; There will remain for a very considerable period much more to the struggle than that because it is not just a question of the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>It is also an essential question of <Col N="1455" /> British imperialism.  The Partition of Ireland was a manoeuvre by British imperialism, a very successful one. The northern workers, whether Catholic or Protestant, are bitterly oppressed by imperialism, but the struggle against imperialism will have to go on because it is the source of the oppression in these islands and that imperialism exercises its oppression not just in the Six Counties but in the 26 Counties as well.  The basis of our present effort at economic development is, in fact, to strengthen imperialism economically again.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The first rays of that dawn were to be seen in the Belfast shipyards this time where, regardless of religion, the workers stuck together.  That is the great positive event in the North of Ireland in the last few months.  Those <Col N="1456" /> are the first rays of the dawn, as I say, which will, firstly, guarantee civil liberties in Northern Ireland and, secondly, guarantee unity for the whole of Ireland.</P>

I believe it is agreed by all Parties in this House that that is what is called for at this time.  His colleague, Deputy Keating, rejected the call for an adult and reasoned debate.</P>
      <P>He made remarks in the context of his nature and quality of life speech on the Six Counties like &ldquo;Mr. Boland Bunting&rdquo; and &ldquo;John ChichesterLynch&rdquo;. They were childish, irresponsible, cheap jibes and unworthy of any Member of this House in the context of the present atmosphere and in that of the debate.  Deputy Keating has by his remarks exposed himself to the contempt of decent people and set his own standards.  We must measure him by the standards he sets himself in the context of his remarks against our political leader and despite what he thinks against his political leader.  Let me follow that point up for a moment. I think it is true to say that the Taoiseach, our political leader, the political leader, by the way, of all political parties, the political leader of this Dáil, the political leader of this Republic, has been universally applauded for the decent and responsible manner in which he handled the whole tragic situation which exists in the Six Counties.  He received both national and international praise for the manner in which he dealt with this situation and the contemptible contribution from the last Deputy is pitiful in comparison with the Taoiseach's contribution.  That is really all I have to say on this particular topic.  I will deal with it, indeed, some time outside the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Another very important matter the Taoiseach brought out, and, indeed, the Fine Gael Party and the bulk of the Labour Party have stressed and reiterated, is that our desire for a united Ireland will be achieved by peaceful means.  Any right-thinking member of the community down here will accept that as one of the main guidelines towards achieving a lasting settlement in the context of a united Ireland.  Anybody who proposes any other method in my respectful opinion is all wrong.  It is to the credit of all political parties in the Republic that they have taken this line and will continue to take that line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As one who has gone north and to the Six Counties on his own factfinding mission, for his own personal edification as it were, without publicity and in an unflurried fashion in the company of a number of the leading people in the recent struggle in Derry and so on, I saw the situation first-hand. I do not pretend, like Deputy Harte who has been living there all his life, arising out of my visit to those areas to have an immediate solution.  There <Col N="1458" /> is no instant solution to the situation which exists there.  There is no instant solution to the re-unification of our country.  Having spoken to many of these people I believe that the whole question there is one of civil rights&mdash; it is a question of the non-application of civil rights as we know them to exist down here.</P>
    <P>We have been brought up in a liberal tradition in this part of the country, where the idea of people not having houses because of the religious beliefs to which they subscribe, or of people not having a vote because they do not hold sufficient property, is difficult to understand.  However, that is the situation at this point of time in one part of our island.  We have been told by Mr. Callaghan that the situation will be righted and for that we are grateful. This beginning of the end of a situation that has existed for the past 40 or 50 years has been brought about entirely by the civil rights people.  Having spoken to people of the quality of the Independent M.P. for Derry, Mr. John Hume, I am convinced that the credit for the ending of this situation must be given to the civil rights people. We must look forward now to the implementation of the recommendations of the Cameron and Hunt Reports but we must allow sufficient time for their implementation.</P>
    <P>I went to the north and examined the situation first hand.  I must admit that it was a cursory visit but it was not my first visit to the Six Counties. I have been going up to Queen's University since 1965 as often as I possibly could and no later than a year and a half ago I called for an interchange of Dáil Deputies with members of the Stormont Parliament.  I just mention these things in case people might accuse me of taking a sudden interest in the north.  Of course, my late mother came from Derry, so I also have family connections there.</P>
    <P>However, in a collective political sense, I must take the blame that has been levelled against us for what might be called a sudden re-awakening of our responsibilities to our brethren in the Six Counties.  Collectively, we did very little about the situation and it was not until after the Burntollet march that our interest was awakened.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1459" /> The question of communication is a very important one.  It is not possible for people in the Six Counties to get very good reception from Telefís Éireann and it is important that we let these people know what we are like, that we are normal people and not a priest-ridden or a tricolour-waving group of fanatics.  Therefore, booster stations should be erected by Telefís Éireann along the physical boundary known as the Border.  If these people can see our television programmes especially our open discussion programmes, many of the prejudices that exist both north and south of the Border will be removed.</P>
    <P>We get Ulster Television here and from their programmes we can see that the people of the north are, in the main, decent, reasonable people and if they could receive our television programmes they would realise that we, also, are decent, reasonable people and that we do not have entrenched or inflexible attitudes.</P>
    <P>There has been a call for an all-party committee to represent the Irish viewpoint in regard to Northern Ireland. I do not agree with this call.  The Government have been elected to represent all the people and it is they and not an all-party committee who must project the views of the Republic.  It is the Government who must make the decisions on behalf of supporters of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour.</P>
    <P>I ask the Taoiseach and the Government to continue to handle the situation as they have handled it to date. I had a question on the Order Paper today in connection with the setting-up of an all-party committee on the Constitution. I would agree with the setting up of such a committee to discuss Article 44 and other Articles and then to present a report to the Taoiseach. However, the Taoiseach says that the Constitution review committee has never ceased and that, in fact, it still exists.  Reading into what he says, it appears it could be re-constituted simply by calling all the members together.  I would agree with an all-party committee to review the Constitution but I would not agree with an all-party committee to represent <Col N="1460" /> Ireland.  We have a government to perform the latter function.</P>
    <P>Having gone through Bogside and seen the human tragedy that exists there, I wonder at the great distinction that exists between the welfare benefits in the Twenty-Six Counties and those in the Six Counties.  Is employment not better than unemployment benefits? People want employment and not unemployment benefit.  That is the message that I received having gone through Bogside and visited many of the homes of the people who lived in Derry all their lives but were never employed there.  Let us talk about employment rather than unemployment benefits.  If we could bring about a situation where we could give tax-free concessions to companies who intended to establish factories and give employment in places such as Derry we would be helping to break down prejudices.  We would be helping if we could send representatives up north to set up factories with the encouragement of the Westminster and Stormont governments.  Such representatives could act as our emissaries, showing that we are willing to help and to give employment rather than unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish, Leader of the Labour Party, criticised the Taoiseach for not reconvening the Dáil.  It is sometimes as well to say nothing in the context of a given situation.  Words can be as damaging as bullets at a particular point of time.  It might have been as well not to have reconvened the Dáil at that particular point.  There were discussions at Stormont and in Westminster Parliament in relation to the Six-County problem but still we have the tragedy of Sunday fortnight last in Belfast.  We have had words contributing really nothing to the situation that exists up there.  Had the Dáil been recalled we might have caused great harm.  It was as well not to have recalled the Dáil.  This is the correct time, if any such time exists, to discuss the Six Counties in calmness and in retrospection.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay particular tribute to the role played by Deputy Dr. Hillery at the United Nations.  It is true <Col N="1461" /> to say that he brought this matter to international attention.  His handling of the situation reflected very well on this country.  We are very grateful to him. He has come into the Chamber now and I feel I am only embarrassing him, but I felt that a tribute was due to him.</P>
    <P>Tributes should be paid to the founding fathers of the 1916-22 period, such as Deputy Frank Aiken and the former Minister for Defence, Deputy Hilliard.  We must be very grateful for the legacy they have left us in the context of liberality and lack of religious bigotry.  They fought the good fight but did not become introspective. They did not look inwards, but rather outwards.  As a son of a man who could be called a revolutionary, I am proud of the manner in which I myself and people of my generation were reared in this country.  We lived beside Protestants in Dundrum, County Dublin, under the shadow of the local Protestant church.  We could tip our hats in tribute to the Rector of the church without loss of face or feeling that we were going to hell for so doing.  There existed in Dundrum and in other places around that area this spirit of modern ecumenism.  Such was the situation 20 years ago.  We must be grateful to our founding fathers for that legacy.  I would consider myself one of the second or third generation of revolutionaries and we must be grateful to our fathers that they did not rear us in a tradition of like or dislike for a person on religious grounds, or discrimination against a person because of his religion.  We liked or disliked a person because he was a decent person or not as we thought.  That was the situation that existed in my youth.  One did not consider the religion of a person visiting the home, whether he was a Catholic, Protestant or Jew.  It is a credit to our fathers that such a situation should exist and it is a tremendous thing to be able to say without overindulging ourselves in praise.</P>
    <P>I should like now to quote from the context of the Taoiseach's speech in Tralee.  He quoted Mr. Asquith, former British Prime Minister, who said: &ldquo;Ireland is a nation; not two nations but one nation.  There are few cases in history, and as a student of <Col N="1462" /> history in a humble way, I myself know none, of a nationality at once so distinct, so persistent, and so assimilative as the Irish.&rdquo; He also quoted King George V speaking in Belfast at the opening of the Northern Parliament in June, 1921, who hoped that the opening would be &ldquo;the prelude of the day in which the Irish people, north and south, under one Parliament or two, as those Parliaments may themselves decide, shall work together in common love for Ireland upon the sure foundation of mutual justice and respect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government of Ireland Act presupposed the final reunification of our country.  These eminent or otherwise gentlemen, depending on one's point of view, expressed the hope of reunification when they were setting up the Stormont Parliament.  It has always been intended that the situation that exists in the Six Counties should be brought to an end by the Westminster Government.  In the final analysis it must be the Westminster Parliament which are responsible for the division of our country.  This is historical and real fact.  Westminster Parliament, Tory or Labour, are responsible for the situation that divides the two areas of our land.  The Taoiseach, in common with other leaders of this country, has called for a federal solution. What that solution may be in relation to unification of our country is speculation at present.  The Taoiseach made it clear at Tralee that in seeking reunification &ldquo;our aim is not to extend the domination of Dublin&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If we can get this kind of thing across to our brethren in the Six Counties we may achieve something; we are not trying to dominate them and neither do we expect them to try to dominate us from Stormont.  The Taoiseach goes on to say:</P>
    <P>It is quite unreasonable ... to expect my Government or any future Government to abandon the belief and hope that Ireland should be reunited. It is unnecessary to repeat that we seek re-unification by peaceful means.</P>
    <P>We must all hope for the re-unification <Col N="1463" /> of our country and, in the context of the whole question, the existence of the Border must come into play.  It is an oversimplification to say that Partition is at the root of all our present troubles.  We should seek to find out what Partition has accomplished because there are patterns and trends which will continue into the future no matter what reforms are brought about or no matter how much goodwill is contributed.</P>
    <P>In connection with the Constitution, it is quite unrealistic to talk about the abolition of Article 44, and so on, as a panacea; it is unrealistic to think that on the abolition of Article 44 the Border will disappear and, as far as our northern brethren are concerned, it will be a case of &ldquo;Hands across the Border&rdquo;.  That is so much rubbish.  The amending of the Constitution will not cure the Border problem.  There are far deeper issues involved.  Amending it may possibly portray our <i>bona fides</i> in some small measure, but we must bear some responsibility for the situation which exists and for the lack of relationship between the Six and the Twenty-Six Counties.  We have built a pluralistic and multi-religious society here.  I do not think some of the legislation here appropriate to such a society. It is now recognised that these matters belong to the area of private morality, which is not a fit subject for legislation, and it is in that context that we should be examining our conscience and possibly our Constitution.  It is a small point.  I admit that.  I do not share the view that the moment we amend the Constitution or pass this, that or the other legislation the problems will be resolved.  The problems are only beginning. Let us all recognise that.  It is important that those who contribute to this debate do not indulge in polite, meaningless words in the context of the present situation.  We should all respect the Taoiseach's, Deputy Cosgrave's and Deputy Corish's appeal to debate this matter in moderate language.</P>

      <P>The House should be grateful to Deputy Andrews because, for the first time in this House, he has put on record from those Benches the real cause of Partition. He has told the House that no Irishman, north or south, ever voted for the 1920 Ireland Act and that this country was partitioned by an Act of the British Government before the Treaty.  It was big of Deputy Andrews to say that.  How many times has the finger been pointed at Fine Gael as the party responsible for the partitioning of this country?  Now that Deputy Andrews has mentioned the <i>de facto</i> partitioning of the country under the 1920 Act may I quote from <i>Time Magazine</i> of last week which may give us the reason why we have had strife here for the past 50 years.  The 1914-18 war had ended.</P>
      <P>At war's end the struggle began again with the long years of the Troubles.  The Irish Republican Army, brilliantly led by Michael Collins, fought one of the first of this century's guerilla wars.  Bloodletting was continued until 1921, and was ended when Britain's Prime Minister David Lloyd George offered peace on the basis of a partition of Ireland into 26 independent counties, called the Irish Free State, and six of the original nine counties of Ulster, which would remain united with Great Britain.  Michael Collins accepted the offer, but diehard IRA men, who wanted a united Ireland or none at all, plunged the newly independent State, later called Éire, into civil war.  The internecine fighting cost Collins his life.</P>

      <P>: Probably the Department of External Affairs could give the Deputy that information.  I accept what Deputy Andrews has said. It is a tragedy that it was not accepted for the past 50 years.  It was not the signing of the Treaty that caused the partitioning of this country.  However, I did not get on my feet to talk about Partition and I would not have done so were it not for the fact that Deputy Andrews spoke as he did.  His approach was a most objective one.  It is the first time I have had experience of such an approach from that side of the House.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies have told us about their visits to the north and the things they saw there and how shocked they were at the damage done.  I was in the north for three nights and in those three nights I saw the most savage fighting I have ever seen.  I saw defenceless men and women attacked, their houses burned and fear written large in their faces.  They were not all on one side.  They were on both sides. I know the fear that was driven deep into them and I know why they approached us and asked us, for God's sake, not to do anything about ending Partition; they said that what they wanted just now were civil rights so that they could live in peace for some time and then, if they got on well together, north and south, the ending of the Border could be discussed.  But they emphasised that all they wanted at the moment were civil rights.  Remember these people were not all Catholics.</P>
      <P>What they want in the north is full employment if they can get it, a fair distribution of houses if the houses are provided, an unbiased police force and the abolition of the armed Special Constabulary, the abolition of gerrymandering and one man, one vote in local elections.  I will guarantee the House that if the people of the north are assured of that tomorrow morning they will be quite satisfied for the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remember this, and it is interesting: it is not the Taoiseach of this country today, or the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, or the Leader of the Labour Party who is cheered when he goes down Falls Road in Belfast or down the Bogside in Derry, but it is Mr. Callaghan of the British Labour Government <Col N="1466" /> and Mr. Quintin Hogg, his shadow in the Conservative Party, who get the cheers.  Ministers and Deputies have told us that they went north, and I went north, but I got no cheers but I saw, as we all saw, these men being cheered on television.  What has happened within the past six weeks that there has been such a <i>volte face</i> on the part of these people in those traditionally depressed areas of the Six Counties? I am only afraid they have lost faith in us down here and that they now look forward to having the army, which they detested, there for their protection. A famous queen, when Calais was lost, said that it should not be mentioned but that if her heart was opened after her death the word &ldquo;Calais&rdquo; would be found written on it. The less we say about the Six Counties at present the better.  Let us keep it in our hearts and let us try to do what we can to unite with them by full co-operation.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to hear the speeches of the Taoiseach, Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Corish.  They were unanimous that force is now ruled out for all time. If that had been said many years ago there would have been less danger from the majority who live in the north.  We have got to look at this and see if we are setting a proper headline down here.  It is all very fine to go into the Shankill Road and see inscribed on the walls &ldquo;No Popery Here&rdquo; or in the Falls Road &ldquo;To Hell With the Queen.&rdquo; We have seen this in Derry, in Bogside and in other places.  Have we set a very high standard in our example down here?  We all know the minority here and we all know that we welcome them into politics but as far as I can see there are two types of Protestants, one, if he joins Fianna Fáil is a patriot while the other, if he joins Fine Gael, is looked upon as a renegade.  It is all very fine for Deputy Lenihan, whom I admire very much, laughing at that.  It does sound silly but last June during the general election we had in North East Donegal a Protestant, an honourable man who had represented his constituency in Donegal County Council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When we have that kind of mentality there is no use arguing with it.  I have seen written up &ldquo;Vote for Boggs the B Special&rdquo; and &ldquo;Vote for Boggs the Paisleyite&rdquo;.  Was that an example in June last to his brethren across the Border who were reaching that period in the year when tempers and national spirits are usually aroused?  I do not think that did a lot of good.  I know it happened in another Border constituency and I will leave it to the Deputy from that constituency to tell the House what occurred and to produce a poster which was exhibited in his constituency telling the people not to vote for him, I do not mind that, but giving the reason why they should not, namely, because he was a Protestant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must put our house in order.  We have on all sides of the House very respected Protestants but immediately a Protestant from the Border counties stands for an election the finger of scorn is pointed at him.  That is something we must try to eradicate.  Again, we talk a lot about gerrymandering and there is no doubt whatever that over the past 50 years there has been gerrymandering in the north.  It is as a result of the gerrymandering that a minority of one-third can procure a majority of the seats on Derry Corporation and they have done it for 50 years.  That is gerrymandering.  Have we set a very good headline down here in recent years?  I do not think we have.  We all agree, with the exception of the Government Party, that a serious attempt was made down here to <Col N="1468" /> gerrymander and if they say in reply &ldquo;we just did justice&rdquo; not only must justice be done but it must be seen to be done and certainly it was very difficult to see it in the redrawing of the constituencies here in recent times.</P>
    <P>I was rather amused to hear Deputy Andrews suggesting as a method of co-operation that we should set up our factories in the north.  In God's name, set up our factories in the north when our whole rural population is fleeing from the country because of the lack of factories.  What sort of mentality lies behind such a suggestion?</P>

When we have sufficient factories and full employment down here then we can say to the north: &ldquo;Here we are, look at what we are doing to give employment, something the Government of the north have not done for the past 50 years.&rdquo; We must first examine our consciences in that respect before we point a finger at them.</P>

    <P>All speakers today praised the press for their restraint but I must disagree. One thing which did more to inflame passions during August than anything else was the headline which appeared in the <i>Evening Press</i> on August 14th&mdash;&ldquo;Irish Troops Are on The Border&rdquo;. The report stated: &ldquo;Army spokesman admits large forces of Irish Troops are at the moment on manoeuvres in County Donegal and in the Cavan area&rdquo;.  The report went on to say &ldquo;Very large forces and convoys are moving near Border areas&rdquo;.  Further on the <i>Evening Press</i> reporter wrote that on his way through Donegal to Letterkenny and Fort Dunree, near <Col N="1469" /> Buncrana, he passed other groups of Irish Army vehicles&mdash;moving north, remember.  There was no indication that the vehicles were in any way equipped to deal with medical cases.</P>

      <P>Why were they reported by an Army spokesman to be moving north on the evening of 14th August, the evening before the AOH march in Dungiven was banned?  Was there anything more encouraging to people in Dungiven to march than that?  That was the most inflammatory thing done in the north that week.  I happened to be in Dungiven on the night of the 14th.  I was in Maghera and Dungiven that night.  I was talking to a non-Catholic liberal that night who said to me, &ldquo;Have you seen the <i>Evening Press?</i>&rdquo; I said I had not.  He said, &ldquo;It has done more harm to civil rights in the north than anything else that has been said for some time&rdquo;.  I asked how could that possibly be and he said, &ldquo;Look, we are now led to believe that the Irish Army are about to invade us&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I quote from the <i>Evening Press</i> of 14th August:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the rumours&mdash;troop rumours&mdash;sweeping the Bogside on the night of 14th August last.  The people are hopeful that aid in some form will arrive from somewhere. Their eyes are turned chiefly to the Border only five miles away where they have heard Irish troops are building up.  This news spread <Col N="1470" /> through the Bogside this morning like wildfire.  It is one of the things that keep men at the barricades, gives them the courage and strength to hurl stones and bombs at the police and the bravado to stand while tear gas bombs are bursting all around them.  But, why don't they come? Why didn't they come last night?</P>
    <P>Was not that a disgraceful bit of propaganda to hold out to those unfortunates in the north?  Is it any wonder that they now welcome the British Army with open arms?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not even denied.  I did not wish or intend to make an inflammatory speech but, for God's sake, do not lay all the blame on sectarianism in the north.  We have a lot to do with it down here.  When we put our house in order down here then we can invite people to come and look at our house and if they find it all right they will be very glad to come in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the impassioned speech of the disappearing shadow Minister.  I started to earn my living in the north.  For three and a half years I endeavoured to teach English and Latin to a class in Divis Street which street was decimated in the riots.  I can claim to know something about Belfast.  I played for Belfast county football team.  I was a member of the Arts Club and was friendly with Protestants and Catholics.  Deputy O'Donnell may look at it from the distance of Dungloe.  I have lived amongst them.  I was earning my living there for three and a half years.  I attended harvest festivals.  As a Clare Catholic I was very impressed by the strange manifestations of Christianity in Belfast.  I found a strange desire for Christ, &ldquo;God is love&rdquo; on every corner and William riding the Bann.  It was a queer, strange atmosphere.  As an ordinary Catholic, or at least different from the northern Catholics, one wondered what it was all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the north better than anyone here.  Ballymacarret Convent is across Queen's Bridge, near the shipyards which in the middle Twenties were a <Col N="1471" /> fierce flashpoint of sectarianism.  I used to visit the convent to teach Irish on Saturday evenings.  The nuns told me that some time in the Twenties an Orange mob attacked the convent. They broke in the main door, set fire to it.  There was a statue of the Blessed Virgin inside.  In the flames and heat suddenly Her Ladyship began to assume strange forms.  Her hands went up and she was uplifted.  For the first time, the Mother of God put the fear of God in an Orange mob and they ran up the street.  The nuns rang for the military who came and saved them.  I spoke to the Reverend Mother who witnessed that awful thing. British soldiers saved them from the mob.  In the recent troubles not one stone was thrown in that area of Ballymacarret, not one word was said in anger.  Why?  Because the trade unionists in the Queens Island Dockyards, both Catholic and Protestant, said that they would have no more trouble in that area and they were backed up by their clergy.  It is only in the queer, real old ghettoes of the Falls and the Shankill that the trouble is.  The palm must be given, first of all, to the trade unionists in the Queens Island Dockyard for saving us.</P>
    <P>This is one lovely thing that I see about the north.  I praise the restraint of everybody.  We should all be restrained in a matter like this.  I do not mind Deputy O'Donnell or Deputy Keating talking about this thing.  When we passed the Republic of Ireland Act in 1949, surely we did add things to the whole problem; we made it a little more difficult.  Be that as it may, in the context of an EEC situation where we are all the same, this Border will wither away; it must wither away; it has to wither away.  In that situation, the federal idea suggested by the Taoiseach could possibly arrive.  All these things are quite possible.  All it needs is standing back from the situation, not firing a gun.  I remember a time when I served in the Free State Army. I was a very young boy in the university when Collins asked during the Truce period for volunteers who would invade the north.  I remember putting my name to it.  It was rather stupid when one thinks of it.  These were the <Col N="1472" /> things done in those days but 1969 is a different day.  I suppose Deputy Smith and I must be the oldest members of the Fianna Fáil Party in these back benches.  I appeal to younger men to keep sane about these things, to catch themselves on.  We are not always wrong.</P>
    <P>I remember one Sunday I was trying to play the piano in a &ldquo;digs&rdquo; in the north's Falls Road.  The landlord came in and said that I could not play the piano on a Sunday.  That was out of consideration for his Protestant neighbours.  That was the situation one was in.  That is the situation as it is. So, in the name of God, be nice and decent and friendly and stop codding yourselves.  We will not get them by force of arms.  To conclude, I shall quote the words of the Reverend Eric Gallagher as reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> of 20th October, 1969 &mdash; they are worth quoting.  The Reverend Eric Gallagher first of all praised the shop stewards in the Belfast shipyards and concluded, as reported in the <i>Irish Times,</i> as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ulster needs more religion, not less of it, but it must be the religion of Christ,&rdquo; Mr. Gallagher said. &ldquo;There is a future for the community tomorrow if it is built on truth, righteousness and faith in God; there is no future for any of us if it is not.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>What I did intend when I was in the UN and before this debate was asked for was that my <Col N="1473" /> speech on the Estimate for the Department of External Affairs this year would be largely taken up with a narrative of the events in which I was involved since the Dáil rose in July.  I think the best contribution I could make to this debate is to give the Dáil a narrative of what happened, as I saw it and as I was involved in it.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether I have to repeat that the tragic and terrible events in the north have been of deep concern to all of us, of all parties, in this House and to everybody, I think, in the country and the reason ordinary decent people in the North of Ireland felt compelled to demonstrate on the streets, and publicly, for basic civil rights does not have to be recounted to Dáil Éireann now.</P>
      <P>Each time I addressed the nations of the world I stressed that my Government believed that the origin of the problem of the lack of human rights in Northern Ireland is in the 1920 Act of the Westminster Parliament which separated six north-eastern counties from the rest of Ireland and created there an entity calculated to cover as large an area as could comfortably be controlled by a Unionist majority which, in itself, was mainly localised within about 30 miles of Belfast.  The Act of 1920 left within the Six County area a substantial minority.  I think it is true to say that this substantial minority has never willingly accepted its condition as the solution of the Irish problem.  A constant policy of political, economic and social discrimination against the minority has been the main &mdash; indeed, I would say, probably the only significant &mdash; characteristic of the administration of the Six Counties since it was established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anybody any longer disputes the existence of discrimination in the north or denies what went on. The Cameron Report and the Hunt Report have made a dismal record, which we knew, official.  In Ireland, we have been long aware of the intolerable conditions imposed on the minority in the North of Ireland.  Only recently did the catchcry &ldquo;Law and Order&rdquo;&mdash;the transparent cloak for police repression &mdash; reveal the final <Col N="1474" /> breakdown of Unionist policy.  Over the past year, while the Civil Rights Movement gained increasing momentum and support and, at the same time, attracted even greater effort at repression, our Government made every effort &mdash; and I do believe with every discretion &mdash; to direct attention both for the need for reform and to the dangers of the situation.</P>
    <P>Last April, Deputy Frank Aiken, my predecessor in this office, briefed the Secretary General of the United Nations on the situation in the North of Ireland and he also brought our views to the attention of the British Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, Mr. Michael Stewart, last May.  When it became evident last July that there was a serious reason for fearing an outbreak of violence in Derry on 12th August if the Apprentice Boys parade took place &mdash; and, this year, I think everybody realised it was intended to be on a much larger and much more provocative scale &mdash; I went to London and on 1st August I advised Mr. Stewart of our Government's concern. I was informed that this matter was one for the Stormont Government in the first place and that final responsibility for the affairs of Northern Ireland rested with the British Government. I was informed, too, that, in the judgment of both these Governments, it was better not to ban the parade: at the time, I had asked if they could not ban it and, if they had not the courage to ban it, they could at least make quite sure that it was not held on the escalated dimensions and in the parts of Derry where it was so provocative. Their judgement was that it was better not to ban the parade and that the situation would be controlled. I had, and our Government had, no desire to contribute to the tensions existing in the North of Ireland at that time and we were careful to be sure that our apprehensions were not made public.</P>
    <P>In spite of our conviction that the British Government and the Stormont Government seemed incapable of realising how matters stood in the Six County area which, over and over again, they told us they regarded as their internal area, the Apprentice Boys <Col N="1475" /> parade went ahead &mdash; and we all know the consequences.</P>
    <P>In the situation which was rapidly deteriorating and in which the Belfast Government showed, to my mind, neither the capacity nor the will to assert impartial authority, the need for some action on the part of our Government became evident.  On the evening of 13th August, as the Taoiseach has already explained to the House, he announced that our Government had requested the British to apply to the United Nations for the urgent dispatch of a peace-keeping force to the North of Ireland.  Field hospitals were set up by us in Border areas and refugee centres were established.  On 14th August, British troops intervened in Derry &mdash; and in Belfast on the following evening.  By then, several lives had been lost, many homes burnt to the ground and hundreds of refugees were crossing the Border.  The Government decided that I should go to London again.</P>
    <P>On 15th August I had a meeting with Lord Chalfont of the Foreign Office who was accompanied by Lord Stunham of the Home Office.  I urged on them that they should apply for a peace-keeping force or, failing that, that they should agree to a combined Irish-British peace-keeping force.  These requests were refused.  Consequent on this refusal, the Government decided that the situation in the North of Ireland should be raised as an urgent matter with the United Nations Security Council.  I may say that at this stage we had &mdash; and we have &mdash; no desire to bring Britain unnecessarily before the bar of world opinion.  However, our repeated warnings about the situation in the north had been ignored and the attitude adopted by the British Government that this was solely an internal affair of the United Kingdom files in the face of the facts of history: it is one that no Irish Government can ever accept.</P>
    <P>It has been our policy not to bring the Irish question formally before the United Nations.  The issue was mentioned I think, however, on many occasions on which it was appropriate to do so but, as is shown by the record of the debate here in Dáil Éireann in <Col N="1476" /> July, 1946, on the question of our seeking admission to membership of the United Nations, we never looked upon membership as providing a means of securing the unity of Ireland.  The recent grave deterioration of the situation in the north, coupled with the repeated refusals of the British Government to recognise its gravity and our legitimate interest in the matter, pressed upon the Government the decision to raise the question with the Security Council.  To that end, I travelled to New York on Saturday, 16th August.  On the following day, Sunday, after consultation with the President of the Security Council&mdash; Ambassador de Pinies of Spain &mdash; we submitted to him a letter formally requesting an urgent meeting of the Security Council in connection with the situation in the north.</P>
    <P>The text of the letter is contained in document S/9394, copies of which have been placed in the Dáil Library. The Council met in response to our request on Wednesday, 20th August. The provisional verbatim record of that meeting is contained in another document, S/PV. 1503, of which copies have likewise been placed in the Library.</P>
    <P>The issue immediately before the Council was whether or not to adopt the provisional agenda containing our letter of the 17th.  Briefly, the proceedings consisted of a statement by the British representative, Lord Caradon, objecting to adoption of the agenda. I am sure everybody is aware that this was done essentially on the grounds that his Government regarded the Six Counties as being part of the United Kingdom and therefore the matter was one, to his mind, of domestic jurisdiction, so for the Security Council to discuss it would be a violation of Article 2, paragraph 7 of the Charter of the United Nations.  There was then a proposal by the representative of Finland &mdash; and this is significant &mdash; that in view of the possibility that the agenda might not be adopted and that Ireland would consequently not be heard I should be given an opportunity to make a statement in explanation of our request before the council took their decision about the agenda.</P>
    <P>Then there was acceptance by the <Col N="1477" /> members of the Council of that proposal which involved, I think, an almost unprecedented departure from the standard procedure.  There followed a statement by me elaborating on the content of our letter, explaining why the Irish Government felt obliged to have recourse to the Security Council and requesting the despatch of a United Nations peace-keeping force. Then there was a statement by the representative of the Soviet Union supporting our request that the matter be examined by the Council, a further statement by the representative of Britain repeating his objection to adoption of the agenda and finally a proposal by the representative of Zambia that the Council adjourn a decision on whether or not to adopt the agenda and approval by the Security Council of that proposal.  Since then the Security Council has not met on this matter which just stands as it stood at the conclusion of the meeting on the 20th August.  Whether or not the Council will hold further meetings on our request will depend I should say on circumstances.</P>
    <P>The question may be asked whether I should not press for a further meeting of the Council.  On this point I should like to make some observations.  The first observation I wish to make is that Ireland is not a member of the Security Council and is therefore not entitled to participate in all aspects of the debates of the Council and is not entitled to vote.  It is true that a member state which requests a meeting of the Council on a given problem is permitted in practice to appear before the Council after the agenda has been adopted and to make statements in explanation or elaboration of its request. Such a State however is not entitled to intervene actively in the actual discussions within the Council on how to deal with the request for inscription or on the decision of the Council on the substance.  Consequently the State concerned, in this case Ireland, cannot directly affect the Council's decision whether on adoption of the agenda or on an issue of substance.  These decisions are solely within the competence of the 15 members of the Council. All decisions of the Council require a <Col N="1478" /> majority of nine affirmative votes so that if more than six members vote against or abstain from voting no decision is taken.  In addition the House knows that each of the five permanent members has normally a right of veto on issues of substance.</P>
    <P>The second observation I should like to make, and which is I think of great importance in considering this matter, is that it was quite impossible to forecast reliably how the Council would vote on the preliminary question of adoption of the agenda.  I think Deputies know that I was very active in the United Nations in the days immediately preceding the meeting of the Council with the object of securing a favourable vote both on the adoption and on the request for the despatch of a peace-keeping force to the North of Ireland.  I naturally formed certain impressions about the probable pattern of voting.  These impressions, were, however, no more than impressions which could only be borne out or belied by the actual occurrence of a vote.  It would not serve any useful purpose to enter into the assessment I made at that time.  At the meeting of the 20th August Ambassador Jacobson of Finland in making the proposal that Ireland be heard said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are concerned however about the possibility that in the event that the agenda is not adopted we shall have disposed of the matter without hearing the representative of the member State which has brought this matter before the Council.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In his second intervention Lord Caradon of the British delegation stated that he had heard the suggestion made in the informal consultations which they had had before the meeting convened that, and I quote him:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We should adjourn our meeting...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would have thought, Mr. President, and we all expected that we would now proceed in a normal and straightforward manner to vote on the adoption of the provisional agenda.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1479" /> I think the House will be able to interpret these statements.</P>
    <P>I come now to our request for inclusion of the item which we called &ldquo;The Situation in the North of Ireland&rdquo; on the agenda of the 24th session of the General Assembly which opened on 16th September.  This request was formulated in a letter addressed to the Secretary General on 5th September which was accompanied by an explanatory memorandum as required under the Rules of Procedure of the Assembly.  The texts of the letter and memorandum are contained in United Nations document A/7651, with corrigendum, of which copies have been placed in the Library of the House.</P>
    <P>The agenda of each regular session of the Assembly is determined on the basis of a recommendation from the General Committee to the Assembly. This Committee consists of the President of the Assembly, who acts as chairman, the 17 vice-presidents and the chairmen of the main committees, which number seven.  Thus it comprises 25 members.  Ireland is not a member of the general committee of the 24th Session.  Our request for inscription of the item was placed on the provisional agenda and numbered 102, as being an additional item &mdash; it there figured as the third last item.</P>
    <P>The General Committee met on the afternoon of 17th September and went through all the items on the provisional agenda.  When item 102 &mdash; our request &mdash; was reached I was asked by the Chairman to address the Committee. I made a brief statement explaining why the Government felt that the item should be included on the agenda for discussion.  I was followed immediately by the British spokesman, Lord Caradon, who objected to the inclusion of the item as being contrary again to Article 2, paragraph 7, of the Charter of the UN.  He then appealed to me to withdraw the item on the ground that a debate at the UN would be detrimental to the situation prevailing in the north and the efforts being made by London and Belfast to remedy it.  The representative of the <Col N="1480" /> Soviet Union then intervened in support of my proposal for the inclusion of the item.  The representative of the USA followed saying that he did have a statement to make but &ldquo;before being required&rdquo;&mdash;I am quoting his exact words&mdash;&ldquo; to take a stand on an issue which I think confronts many of us with a very unhappy dilemma,&rdquo; it would be of the keenest interest to his delegation to know whether I would be interested in responding to the appeal addressed to me by Lord Caradon.</P>
    <P>The representative of Chile then suggested that more time would be required.  After a further statement by Lord Caradon in reply to certain observations made by the representative of the Soviet Union, the Chairman asked me if I would like to reply to Lord Caradon's request or appeal.  In response I made another brief statement in which I called attention to the fact that the situation in the North of Ireland has endured for 50 years without any remedial action being taken by the British Government.  I said I was concerned to see that the reforms mentioned and promised by Lord Caradon would be put into effect and that I would need to reflect on the consequences which withdrawal of our proposal would have on the prospects of early introduction of the promised reforms.  I did not withdraw the proposal. I indicated my anxiety that the promissed reforms would be put into effect and my fear that withdrawal would remove some encouragement to the British Government to sustain their efforts.  I was followed by the representative of Nigeria who stated that his delegation shared the anxieties of two very friendly countries whose relations with Nigeria were very cordial.  He formally proposed that consideration of the item be suspended for a period of time to be decided by the Chairman. This proposal was supported by Chile and was adopted unanimously by the Committee.</P>
    <P>On the following day the General Committee met again and decided to defer a recommendation to the Assembly on whether or not to include our item on the agenda.  The recomvailin <Col N="1481" /> mendation was noted by the Assembly two days later, on Saturday, September 20th.  For the convenience of Deputies I have placed in the Library a copy of the UN documents relating to our request for the inclusion of the item on the agenda of the twenty-fourth session of the General Assembly and the consideration of the matter by the General Committee.  These documents are, in addition to the letter of September 5th which I have already mentioned, (1) A/BUR/SR/180 of 22nd September being the provisional summary record of the meeting of the General Committee of 17th September, (2) the full draft transcript of the discussion in the General Committee on 17th September and (3) document A/7700, of 18th September being the report of the General Committee to the Assembly of which paragraph 11 deals with our item.</P>
    <P>I should say that the provisional summary record of the meeting of the General Committee on 17th September is defective and in its final form will incorporate some corrections, in particular corrections submitted by our delegation and by the delegation of the USA.</P>
    <P>Since 18th September the General Committee has not resumed consideration of our request and again it may be asked, as in the case of the Security Council, whether the item will at a later date be further considered by the General Committee or whether we propose to take any action to that end. Naturally, I cannot say whether the Committee will take up the matter. That is their decision.  It is always open to us to reactivate the question. Whether we do so would depend, among other things, on the progress of reform in Northern Ireland.  At this moment we do not intend to make any move.  Deputies will realise that another important factor for us in deciding whether to do so or not would be the probable outcome of a vote.  The Irish delegation formed certain estimates on this question of a vote from the many contacts they have and have sustained through the years.  It will be clear from the transcript of the debates that of the five members of the Committee who intervened one was absolutely opposed <Col N="1482" /> to inscription &mdash; that is Great Britain; one, the Soviet Union, favoured inscription, and the other three who spoke wished to see a decision deferred &mdash; that is the US, Chile and Nigeria.</P>
    <P>In my first statement to the Committee I quoted Ambassador Cabot Lodge who at one time spoke in the UN for the US, in 1959 and 1960, on the principle of inclusion of an item on the agenda of the General Assembly for discussion.  He was in favour of discussion and said that discussion did not constitute intervention.  The representative of the US at the meeting which I attended nevertheless felt, after hearing my quotation of the principles enunciated by Mr. Cabot Lodge, that the item confronted many members with an unhappy dilemma.  Subsequently, as Deputies know, I spoke at some length about the situation in the north when I addressed the General Assembly in the general debate.  The full text of that statement will be found in the provisional verbatim record of the 1,768th meeting of the Assembly contained in document A/PV/768 of 26th September.  Again copies of this have been placed in the Library.  On that occasion I adverted to the reasons why we had not hitherto raised Partition at the UN.  I mentioned the trend of the debate in this House on July 24th and 25th in 1946 on a motion by the Government that Dáil Éireann recommended the Government to take steps with a view to our admission to the United Nations.  It is now more than 23 years since that debate took place and many of the Deputies who participated are no longer here.  Some Deputies including in particular the present leader of the Labour Party and more tentatively, perhaps, the present leader of the Fine Gael Party, took the view that membership of the UN would offer an opportunity of raising the issue of Partition.  But I think it right to say that it was the general sense of the Dáil and of the Party leaders at the time that we should not look to the UN to solve the Partition problem and that we could not reasonably expect the United Nations to do so.</P>
    <P>This question was dealt with by the then Taoiseach, Mr. de Valera, in <Col N="1483" /> presenting the motion.  I may recall what he said on the point as recorded in columns 1323 and 1324 of volume 102, No. 10, of the Official Report for 24th July, 1946.  I quote from Mr. de Valera's words:</P>
    <P>One could not reasonably hope that through the organisation itself we would be able to bring about the unity of our nation; although circumstances might develop which would lead in that direction there is no system provided under this Charter by which we could bring about our own unity.</P>
    <P>This, with different degrees of emphasis, seemed to be the view also of many of the leading members of the Opposition parties at the time.  I can refer to Deputy Costello, Deputy Dillon, Deputy Coogan, Deputy O'Higgins, Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Cafferky and so on.  It would be true to say, I think, that the position as outlined by the then Taoiseach was accepted by the Dáil when it approved, without a division, on 25th July, 1946, the motion empowering the Government to apply for membership of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Our approaches to the United Nations this year brought the serious and dangerous nature of the northern situation to the notice of all the member States.  I think it brought home to Britain how deeply distressed we are at the strife in the Six Counties and how concerned we are to obtain a solution.  Statements made by politicians of all political parties, I think, in Britain in recent weeks show that they are now aware that, in the long run, the Irish Government is a necessary party to any final solution of the Irish question.  In the meantime, if the situation in the Six Counties again deteriorates seriously, we remain in a position to re-open the question at the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Our approach to the United Nations was reasonable and not at all disruptive. Our standing there remains high.  It would be ungenerous, a Cheann Comhairle, not to recognise that the Stormont Government have now accepted a series of reforms which, if honestly implemented, will introduce <Col N="1484" /> in the North of Ireland a standard of governmental behaviour which is closer to the ideal of democratic responsibility. But it would be idle to pretend that these alone will or can be the final chapter of the Irish question. No enactment by Westminster or Stormont can change the fundamental fact that, in this island, we are all Irish and between us will have to re-discover an end to bigotry and divisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It probably has not been his fault but, as a layman not very well versed in the complexities of the United Nations activities, it strikes me that the biggest non-event of all was the Minister's activities or the result of his activities at the United Nations.  In my simplicity I thought he set out to put the matter on the agenda. He did not succeed in that.  We have had a long speech explaining why we were rebuffed at every stage in the matter of bringing it to the attention of the United Nations.  I agree with the Minister.  I do not think the achievement of the unity of this country can be brought about by UN action.  I think this would be to misunderstand the whole problem.</P>
      <P>I certainly thought that at a certain stage the issue of the civil rights events had forced on this State an obligation to bring the matter of civil rights before that body of which we are a member. I cannot help thinking, on hearing his account of his activities, that the excellent staff he has at his disposal must have known, to some extent, some of the rebuffs that lay in store for them in certain of the requests they made at the United Nations.  I cannot help believing that there was an element of make-believe in the entire UN attempt. However, this will probably be dealt with later in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was also the reference in the Minister's speech &mdash; not directly in relation to the UN &mdash; to his intervention before the events of August of this year. Indeed, the Taoiseach today in his speech referred to this initiative before the Apprentice Boys march in Derry. In fact, the positive intervention of the Government of this State appears to date from shortly before the events of <Col N="1485" /> that march in Derry.  Indeed, the Taoiseach in his speech today remarks on the Government's recognition in April of this year of the fact that the position in that area was worsening.</P>
    <P>I do not wish &mdash; I think we should avoid it or attempt to avoid it &mdash; to dip back into the history of the civil war and other matters relevant to past discussions on this matter in this House, but we must dip a little further back than the August initiative, the meeting between the Minister and Lord Chalfont, or the realisation by the Government here of the growing gravity of the situation in that part of the country.  There has been a policy of sorts in relation to that part of the country.  There were cross-Border talks which were welcomed by all spokesmen in this House when they took place.  These talks have continued over a number of years.  We remember that the first talks between Deputy Lemass, who was then Taoiseach, and Captain O'Neill took place some time before the 1965 general election.</P>
    <P>There was a great deal of publicity about those talks and many possibilities were read into the continuation of such talks.  At various times most Ministers of the present Government have met their counterparts, I think, in the Stormont Administration and we had, over those few years, some very happy photographs of joint Cabinet meetings. Several Stormont Ministers, whom we later discovered to our horror were bigots of one kind or another, seemingly could meet quite happily and discuss matters with Members of this Government.  In fact, I do not think these discussions escaped the attention of Lord Caradon. The British representative to the UN, I think somewhat to the embarrassment of our Foreign Minister, mentioned these talks which had been going on for so many years.</P>
    <P>The official attitude to these talks was summed up by the then Taoiseach in answer to a question on this very issue of these talks early in 1965 just after the preliminary meeting between himself and Captain O'Neill.  He lays down the ground work, the understanding and the background against which these talks took place in the Official Report of Wednesday, 10th <Col N="1486" /> February, 1965, in answer to a question by Deputy Corish.  He said:</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, I have on many occasions urged the desirability, in the national interest, of achieving, between the two areas into which Ireland is now divided, the maximum possible measure of co-operation in practical matters of public concern and expressed the conviction that this was possible without sacrifice of principle.</P>
    <P>I accepted Captain O'Neill's invitation with the intention of exploring this possibility.  I found that he also was of the opinion that action such as I had in mind would be practicable and beneficial.  Our discussions were confined to this subject, and no political or constitutional topics were touched upon either at our meeting in Belfast or at the meeting yesterday in Dublin. We have agreed that the scope for practical co-operation is extensive and should be further examined.</P>
    <P>That was the background against which these talks took place.  They were, in Deputy Lemass's words, to concentrate on co-operation in practical matters of public concern and no political or constitutional topics should be discussed.  That was a fair enough estimate at that period and we all welcomed those talks, but in the period since then there has been a mounting struggle on the civil rights side in the Six County area.  There was for the first time a new movement, what appeared to be a new kind of opposition to the Unionist Party.  There was for the first time a civil rights platform.  All of us now accept this as a logical approach but it was very new when first adopted in the Six County area.  Previously the line had been a united-Ireland platform.  Therefore, we had agitation on civil rights issues and we had these discussions proceeding between the two Governments.  There was a feeling, at least on our side of the House, that the time had come for these talks to consider some of the subject matter of the agitation in that part of the country.  I can remember speaking here in 1967 on the Adjournment Debate before the Christmas recess, and I quote from column 2037, <Col N="1487" /> volume 231, of the Official Report of 13th December, 1967:</P>
    <P>The most recent visit has been that to Captain O'Neill.  They discussed&mdash;</P>
    <P>I hope the House will forgive the levity of some of the points in my reference to this meeting with Captain O'Neill, but like other members of my Party I was becoming critical of these meetings, having regard to the background of the civil rights movement and the opposition it was encountering in the Six County area.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;and certainly this was a good thing, the foot and mouth epidemic and so on.  It is three years since the last visit.  There should be nothing remarkable in two people from different parts of this country meeting together and chatting about the weather, foot and mouth disease, snowballs and so forth&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>If you remember, somebody threw a snowball at the Taoiseach and he said that at home they do the same thing.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;but the time has come to ask ourselves what to expect from these visits.</P>
    <P>It is no longer fashionable to refer to it, but it is no harm sometimes to be awkwardly old-fashioned and to say it should remain part of our policy, whatever about a united country and an all-Ireland Republic, to see that discrimination is ended in the Six Counties.  That should be the price of these cross-Border talks. We are not there to discuss the weather or to savour Captain O'Neill's daughter's cooking.  We are there to gain political results.  Political results are not to be summed up in a political settlement of the whole country in the immediate future, but we should certainly seek the achievement of a real democracy in the Six Counties.  That is what we are after and that is what we should say we are after.  Let us be quite honest about it.  There is nothing sinister in such a motive in 1967, that real democracy should operate at local authority level in the Six Counties. We shall gain no respect from anybody in the Six Counties if we ignore this problem, and hope for <Col N="1488" /> some kind of improvement in our relations.  I would say this Government stands condemned in that they have not brought sufficient pressure on the Six Counties through the British Government, which is responsible for that part of the country and which, after all, is the most sympathetic Government ever towards Irish aspirations.  We have not brought sufficient pressure on the Government to bring in changes there.  As long as the United Kingdom controls the Six Counties they have the responsibility to see that the same rights which other citizens of the United Kingdom enjoy are also enjoyed by the people of the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient excuse to say that Captain O'Neill has his extremists as we have extremists around the country.  There is nothing extreme in our request that ordinary democratic rights should be the equal possession of every citizen in the north.  It is not easy to get these results from discussions with the Unionist administration in the Six Counties.  It would be very difficult for that administration to agree to such changes because the Unionist Party administration enjoy power through the exercise of a great degree of discrimination at local authority level against the religious minority.</P>
    <P>If we do not get results through this so-called liberal wave that is supposed to be swamping the Unionist Party, then we have our remedy in going to the British Government and looking for changes.  No doubt the discussions with Captain O'Neill will cover gerrymandering, because if we are to believe some of the rumours that are going around this House, we shall be taking some leaves out of Captain O'Neill's book in the New Year in the matter of gerrymandering.</P>
    <P>These problems must be discussed openly with Captain O'Neill.  If we are to believe everything about his sincerity, his liberalism, and his desire to eradicate the abuses which exist in the area under his control, he should be agreeable to discuss these matters and see that any misgivings <Col N="1489" /> people might have about democracy in his area are removed.  This is leaving aside the possibility of an ultimate political settlement and merely asking that ordinary human rights be respected in the area under his jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Those were the requests some of us were thinking should have been made as long ago as 1967 of the Stormont Government.  There was no answering feeling on the Government side that these requests should be made of the Stormont Government.  There was no desire to depart from the Lemass formula for these talks, that they should avoid such contentious areas.  Therefore, I would say the Government now stand condemned for their lack of initiative on these problems over the years, even over the years since the Lemass talks.  I do not think such initiative as has come has been of the best kind.  We have all been asked here to be responsible in our discussion of this matter and to avoid acrimony. However, I do recall, when the civil rights movement asked that there be no repetition of old-time slogans about Partition and so forth, at least two Ministers of this Administration would not accede to that request and at least two Members of this Administration at various times have indulged in the old-time sloganising despite the request and the pleas of the hard-pressed civil rights people in the north that they desist from such speeches.  I can recall asking the Taoiseach in this House if he would ensure that Cabinet Ministers would refrain from such aggravation of a very serious situation.  I can also recall saying here at Question Time that it was a stab in the back for the civil rights movement for Government Ministers to continue with this kind of clap-trap.  I can remember saying that these Ministers were not thinking of the real demands of the situation and they were not really sincere about seeing that the civil rights people gained their demands if they persisted in making such speeches.  While we must avoid acrimony, this Government stands condemned in many respects over the past few years in relation to the situation we now have.</P>
    <P>It can be said of all of us on this <Col N="1490" /> side of the Border that we stand condemned to some extent for our lack of interest in the problems of the area, for our lack of sincerity in relation to the measures that would be needed to achieve real unity.  However, this Government stands condemned in that they have been in office in a period in which this struggle has achieved new heights; they have been in office in a period in which this movement took interesting new turns, in which gains were made, and have been found lacking in their response to the struggle at different points.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Taoiseach say for the first time that peace and the ways of peace must be used to gain unity and if reconciliation is to be achieved it must be on the basis of amity and agreement.  I heard him say today we must wait until the majority in that area are ready to embark on unity with us.  This is the first time I have heard that declared so unambiguously from the benches opposite, and I am glad that this has been said.  The kernel of this problem is the bridging of the gap separating the people whose traditions have been against an all-Ireland Parliament, who have been pro-Unionist, and those whose traditions have been for a united Ireland or, to call a spade a spade, the difference between Catholic and Protestant in that part of the country.</P>
    <P>I agree that no international body can hand us unity on a platter.  The unity we desire must be sought in this country and it must be sought by constructive discussion and agreement. We have a situation where a sectarian administration has been running a semi-independent state for 40 years.</P>
    <P>The events of August found politicians on this side of the Border not looking facts squarely in the face. We had a population imperilled, their lives in danger with so-called law and order being administered by RUC men and B Specials, which meant thumping the Papists as often as possible.  It appeared that wholesale bloodshed was in store for many people who were anti-Unionist, who were Catholic, in Belfast and Derry.  The call went out for protection for these people.  Our <Col N="1491" /> army, those who went as far as that, quite properly stopped at the Border. The B Specials were on the rampage in Belfast and Derry and yet both the Taoiseach and Deputy Cosgrave criticised the idea of British troops coming into that part of the country.  They also criticised the idea of extra British troops coming in to defend the people in that part of the country.  They objected to the principle of it.  Our troops were quite properly not going in.  The forces of law and order were punishing the people in the area; where were the people to look for help but from Westminister? This party quite properly called for more British troops to defend the people whose lives were in danger.  I do not think we have any apologies to make to anyone for that plea.  We have worked in that area through the different things we have done in the years past such as the Council of Labour which we formed in 1967.  We have attempted, according to all political philosophy, to bridgebuild with the Northern Ireland Labour Party, the Republican Labour Party and ourselves.  We have attempted to erect a platform of political co-operation but we have at all times realised that if we are seeking the normalisation of politics in that area political reform is essential.  It is my conviction that that area from its own resources cannot reform.  The pressure and the will to reform is not there.</P>
    <P>As in the spirit in which we called for more British troops for protection in August so our appeal tonight goes out to the Westminster Government to ensure that the reforms they have already announced will in fact be implemented. It is true that at a certain stage we called for the abolition of Stormont as we saw it.  The question seems to me to be whether the Unionist Party are going to attempt to impede these reforms so that they are never implemented.  I do not think we should be unduly sensitive about the role of the Westminster Government in the northern situation.  It must have that role and all our pressure should be brought to bear on the British Government to ensure that these reforms <Col N="1492" /> go through, because if the reforms do not go through we will never achieve this normalisation of politics. We will never see Catholics and Protestants joined together under one political Party in the North of Ireland and if we do not see that we shall never, however distant the prospect may be, see a united Ireland.  That is why we must ensure that the reforms go through.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal that we ourselves must do.  References have been made to some of the things we must do.  I have the impression from listening to the Taoiseach today and to a lot of other speakers tonight that we look from a superior position at the problems of the north; that we look at problems which we can hardly understand so distant are they from the kind of society we live in.  We look at a sectarianism that leaves us puzzled.  We cannot understand its roots or its background.  It seems to me that this is disingenuous on our part and not entirely honest.  If we are serious about unity &mdash; and this is a good question for us all to ask ourselves &mdash; things must be anticipated in the part of the country under our control, things must be implemented and incorporated into our Constitution which anticipate the kind of country a united Ireland would be.  Changes would be needed in our Constitution but I do not think that is sufficient, nor is our seriousness proved when we are as complacent as the Taoiseach here tonight when he said we were willing to meet any people who were not entirely satisfied with us half way at some distant point.  Our work is now if we are serious about unity; it is not at the stage where people come and say, &ldquo;We are ready to join you in unity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>People referred to the &ldquo;fear&rdquo; in the North of Ireland.  That fear is often summed up in the phrase &ldquo;Home Rule is Rome Rule&rdquo;.  We must consider seriously the implications of this charge.  Those of us who belong to the Roman Catholic Church must realise that the beliefs we hold are not necessarily the beliefs held by our fellow Irishmen.  We must see to it that our laws do not seem to deprive <Col N="1493" /> fellow Irishmen who are not of our religious persuasion of liberties and civil rights which they believe to be rightfully theirs.</P>
    <P>In a united Ireland I would question whether denominational education would be as widespread.  In a united Ireland could we have a Constitution which, in its Preamble, excludes Unitarians and Jews?  Can we say all things are right here in the Twenty-six Counties and that we cannot understand these queer Protestants, these peculiar Paisleyites?  Are we entirely free from sectarianism ourselves?  The odious term &ldquo;non-Catholic&rdquo; has been used today.  Would we find the term &ldquo;non-Protestant&rdquo; just as odious?  Does that not sum up an attitude on our part?</P>
    <P>Everybody has agreed now that Article 44 must go.  Not everyone agreed last year after the All-Party Committee on the Constitution had sat that Article 44 must go, but nobody was in favour of it.  I recall a great dearth of politicians in favour of the abolition of Article 44.  I wonder where this extraordinary courage has come from.  The Taoiseach has only now declared that it must go, yet the report has been published a long time.  I wonder how much events in the north have shown how necessary it is that Article 44 be superseded before we can honestly answer the charge of our fellow countrymen in Northern Ireland about the fear of the domination of a particular religion.</P>
    <P>People have said this is going to be a continuing problem.  I agree about that.  I think it is a very difficult problem and I believe the Unionist Party is not behind the reforms they are officially declaring.  From what I can see the Unionist Party is divided into two: the diplomatic hardliners and the honest hardliners.  I would say that some did not declare themselves freely and that others did declare themselves.</P>
    <P>I do not say we have not a very difficult job before us and we must keep up pressure on the Labour Government in Britain.  It was a Labour Government that gave us the only hope of achievement, though I recall the sneers of Members opposite in regard to the Wilson Government, but it must be admitted that under that Government <Col N="1494" /> more reforms were carried through in relation to the north than in the entire preceding 50 years.  There is, of course, a danger that a Tory Government might return in the future.  I do not know whether the Members opposite would feel more comfortable with a Tory administration but we are more comfortable with a Labour Government. We must remember our kith and kin in Britain who vote Labour; I do not know whether we can persuade them to do the same in this country but we will do our best.  We see the Labour Government in Britain as the best hope of ensuring reforms in the north of Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, the question of censorship.  Inevitably, some people will howl and say we are opening the doors to pornography.  I am not speaking of pornography but I am referring to our ridiculous legislation regarding censorship to which the people in the north can point.</P>
    <P>This afternoon, our leader, Deputy Corish, said quite rightly that we had refrained in our previous activities from criticism of the Government.  In our visits abroad and in meetings with Lord Chalfont we adhered to the Government line but I think it is only proper that here, in this Parliament, we should declare our differences with the Government on aspects of their policy. There has been an unwillingness to speak out on the realities of the situation. I welcome a note in the Taoiseach's speech in which he appears at least to recognise the realities.  It has been a pretty expensive education but I suppose we should be glad that he shows signs of learning from the facts of the situation.  A long time ago one of the members of our movement, James Connolly, said that if this country were divided we should have a carnival of reaction on either side of the Border.  I believe that the future of political co-operation on both sides can be summed up in a socialist movement on either side.  Whatever we may think of some individuals, whatever reservations we may have about their activities, we must praise the bravery and idealism of the young people who have changed the face of northern Ireland.  They are as brave and as <Col N="1495" /> idealistic a generation of young Irish men and women as there have been in the past 100 years.</P>
    <P>In the past we, in this House, have ignored the problem.  When we have thought of it at all we have spoken of it in terms of having a plebiscite, and as long as we had those shibboleths and slogans and this half-thinking approach we were happy to bury the idea of eventual unity in those slogans. We were happy to bury it with full military honours but we did not face up to the situation.  I believe there is nothing to be lost by trying to look at the facts in the face, by tackling the problem in constructive steps and by making an honest appraisal of what the facts seem to dictate.</P>
    <P>There has been too much belief in fictions and half-truths in this matter and the Government throughout have not really lived up to the sectarian strain of Irish history.  Recent Irish history has shown evidence of this sectarian strain.  We must understand, as Deputy Keating said, the different traditions of the people of this island&mdash; the excitement of the variety of the people of this country.  Therefore, if there is to be a united Ireland of people of so many different attitudes and religions, we have work before us not only politically but in the social, economic and constitutional sphere. We can begin most of this work now. We do not have to wait for signals from the other side.  We do not have to wait for a federal solution which is unthinkable because it presupposes that reconciliation has been arrived at. To be talking of a federal solution is to be talking as if the solution had already been arrived at.  What we should be talking about, what we should be attempting to do, is to lead public opinion on this side into the complexities of the problems.  We should not be giving them half-truths, things that suit our parties, our political attitudes.  We should be leading them to realise the steps that will be necessary and we should be encouraging them to take such steps.</P>
    <P>There will be those of us who will say that these things are meant to placate Orange people.  If we are serious <Col N="1496" /> about uniting Ireland, we must be serious on this: we cannot any longer believe that we can continue to base our whole approach to the unity problem on the original villainy of the British and on the institution of Partition. A hell of a lot of villainy lies in our own hearts and it is the job of this Assembly to give the lead to the men and women of this part of the country.  I am disappointed at the lack of response on the part of the Government in this matter.  As I argued back in 1967, they did not fully exploit the talks that were then taking place, they did not exert pressure on Stormont at the right time.  I do not believe they feel the urgency of the situation because it is not sufficient to point to a vague future and to say they will meet those people half-way in any spheres they may wish.  We must be able to show to the people of Northern Ireland the kind of future they can have with us one day in reconciliation in a united Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me, listening to the speeches here today such as that of Deputy O'Leary and those of other Deputies from all sides of the House, that this debate is the first occasion in the history of the State in which we are seriously facing the problem of Partition.  That issue was not faced even in the Treaty debate. We deluded ourselves it was.  In the Treaty debate both sides became obsessed &mdash; I know which side started the obsession, the others had to reply&mdash; with the irrelevancy of the oath and, because Ireland had always been united, because they could not conceive its being disunited and because they could not conceive of such disunity being other than temporary, they lost sight of this issue and it does not feature to any great extent in the Treaty debate.  In the debates since then it features from time to time but it is featured in terms of clichés and shibboleths.  Today, for the first time in this House, from all sides we are hearing people speak in the terms in which they should have spoken 50 years ago and, had they done so, the history of this country would have been different.  Partition would have ended and the country would have <Col N="1497" /> been re-unified well within that 50 year period.</P>
      <P>We have then, today, to look not just at the faults on the other side of the Border, not just at the faults and the blame attaching to the British Government &mdash; although to that I will have to refer in a minute or two also&mdash; but to the faults on our side, as Deputy O'Leary has said.</P>
      <P>First of all, let me just say something about the British.  There is no doubt when they &ldquo;settled&rdquo; the Irish problem in 1921 they breathed a sigh of relief&mdash; it had bedevilled their affairs for a long time &mdash; and put it out of their minds. There is no doubt there has been in Britain over the last 50 years a kind of psychological determination not to let that problem raise its head again, a determination to believe that it was settled, a determination so strong that no matter what evidence was put forward from the North of Ireland or from us or from the British Parliament itself, evidence of malpractices, discrimination and injustice in Northern Ireland, ears were closed to all that was said, ears were closed because they wanted to believe that it was not their problem and they bear the guilt for that 50 years of neglect, 50 years of refusal to face the problem.</P>
      <P>They are now facing it and it must be said they are facing it courageously and unitedly.  Within the British Parliament, as I think in this Parliament also today, there has been a unity of purpose &mdash; though we may disagree about the details of how we have been managing our affairs in the last couple of months &mdash; a unity of purpose and a desire to do the right thing and to rise above the situation, as we, I hope, will also do here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The guilt on our side is a guilt of neglect above all.  Since my childhood I have heard the <i>clichés</i> and the shibboleths trotted out on suitable occasions and indeed with recurring refrain in a kind of cycle like a trade cycle, which tends to come up again after certain intervals of time.  But what I have not seen, and because of my own partial northern ancestry, I am perhaps more sensitive to this than most, is any sign of real interest in the north of Ireland among people here.  Real <Col N="1498" /> interest means you concern yourself with the problem, you go to see it, you try to meet the people involved, you try to understand.  What I have found, in talking to people about Northern Ireland, is a desire to forget about it.  When the appropriate occasion arises you make the appropriate antiPartition speech but you do not go there.  The &ldquo;Black North&rdquo; is something to be avoided at all costs.</P>
    <P>It is spoken of frequently in private of course by people as the &ldquo;Black North&rdquo;, somewhere we do not have anything to do with and indeed in private many people, politicians included, say &ldquo;Thank God we do not have the problems of the north, thank God it does not belong to us&rdquo;.  That is the kind of dishonest and hypocritical attitude, the attitude of humbug that has left us after 50 years with a country perhaps more firmly partitioned than it was say, 30 to 40 years ago.  The result of this, the result of the extent to which we are cut off from the north, so that people here are not familiar with what has been going on, has been the quite extraordinary ignorance in this part of the country about the developments of the last ten years in Northern Ireland.  Because I have had, for personal reasons, occasion to have more to do with the north than most people I have had the opportunity to know a little more about what is going on.</P>
    <P>It is just by chance that it is my lot.  If I had not had those personal reasons for that contact perhaps my neglect, my disinterest, might have been as bad as that of other Members of this House. I have been conscious of the fact over that period, as any of us could have been conscious who bothered to talk to people in Northern Ireland, people of all parties, of a great change occurring in the attitudes in that part of the country.  I can recall about six years ago a northern Nationalist MP who was down here got in touch with me.  I went to see him and I asked him what he hoped might happen in Northern Ireland in the next ten years.  He told me what he foresaw was the growth of the Paisleyite movement in power and strength, feeding on prejudice and bigotry to a point where at some stage the Unionist Party would split because <Col N="1499" /> the decent people in the Unionist Party could no longer tolerate the extremists and Paisleyites in their midst.  At that point in time he hoped there would emerge, within ten years he said to me, a government comprising moderate Unionists, moderate Nationalists and Northern Ireland Labour.  There were at that stage no civil rights people.</P>
    <P>He, in touch with opinion there and looking ahead, could see the way in which things would go and he looked forward to such a coalition government. I asked him what we in this part of the country could do to help.  I was a bit taken aback by his reply and I had to say to him I did not think much could or would be done about it in the immediate future.  He said &ldquo;There is one thing that would help&rdquo;&mdash; I emphasise I am talking of a Northern Nationalist MP &mdash;&ldquo;You could take out of the Constitution that section appertaining to the re-integration of the national territory, not the bit about the Catholic Church we have heard so much talk about but that particular bit which in the ears of northerners, including indeed many of the minority &mdash; because of the rather unfortunate wording the Constitution Committee itself has commented adversely on &mdash; has an unhappy ring.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I said to him, as I have just said here, that I did not believe much progress would be made with that, because such a proposal would come up against prejudices down here that would not be easily shifted.</P>
    <P>Those are the two comments he made about six years ago.  He would have made them to anybody who was interested, any of us, any other Member of the House, who went to the north and met northern MPs. Any party down here could have known of the changes of opinion, could have known of the growing frustration of the people, Nationalist Catholic people of Northern Ireland, with the utter bankruptcy of the abstentionist policy &mdash; if it even was an abstentionist policy; it was a wobbleof the Nationalist Party.  It was a policy of wobble, wobbling between an unhappy, uncertain and unproductive presence in Stormont and the policy of abstention.  Then there was the frustration <Col N="1500" /> of the Nationalist people with the effects on them in their position of the IRA raids, a growing determination to break out of this and to play their part in that community, to normalise the situation there and to get the civil rights which were their due.</P>
    <P>This is not just a growth of the period since the 5th October last.  This is not something which suddenly emerged from nowhere.  The civil rights movement was not invented by somebody and imposed on somebody.  It was the product of a long process of re-thinking going on in Northern Ireland, of which we should have been aware and of which we were not aware and indeed the extent to which we were not aware of it has been borne out even by the reactions of the Government in particular to the events of August when it took them several weeks, even at that stage, to wake up to the reality of the position in Northern Ireland.  I must not put all the blame on the Government for that.  It is their responsibility and therefore most of the blame attaches to them because the responsibility attaches to them, but all of us on all sides are responsible because we have not wanted to know what has been going on in the north.  It has been alien territory and we have had in a sense the same kind of feeling the British have had.  &ldquo;Let us keep away from it, if we do not talk about it too much it will go away and if it does not go away let us talk about it and that is all we will do about it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So, we approached this crisis unprepared and uncomprehending.  The extent to which the Government did not realise even in the course of this year what was happening has been shown by the Taoiseach's failure to make direct contact with Mr. Wilson during the summer.  I share with the leader of the Labour Party the feeling, having heard the Taoiseach speaking on this, that his explanation was ineffective to an extraordinary degree.  Contact was made in April. It was maintained for some weeks and then, because it was not possible to arrange a meeting then and the election occurred, it was dropped.  The election occurred quite a while ago and after the election several months elapsed before the trouble happened in the <Col N="1501" /> north but the Taoiseach, having been re-elected, did not apparently even seek to have this contact reopened.  I think it could have been helpful to have had this meeting.  It does show, I think, a failure to understand how the situation in the north was evolving that he failed to persist and to insist on having such a contact.</P>
    <P>I have also seen in the Taoiseach's speeches, and I refer perhaps particularly to the speech of the 29th August, and in utterances by other members of the Government, a persistent tendency to talk of Partition as the cause of the trouble.  This I find incomprehensible.  Partition occurred in 1921.  There were Pogroms there before and what we are witnessing now is a repetition of the pogroms not only of 1935 and 1922 but the progroms of the latter half of the 19th century.  The problem in Northern Ireland is a problem in Northern Ireland is a problem which exists between two communities and it was because of the existence of that problem that Partition happened. It happened because of the existence there of an intransigent minority who, generation after generation, had been indoctrinated by their bosses about the dangers of Rome rule.</P>
    <P>It is because that situation existed, kept alive by the Ascendancy for its own purposes so that it could continue to exploit those workers, that Partition came into being.  It came into being because there existed in Northern Ireland this intransigent minority of people, an industrial proletariat exploited by their bosses who knew well how to use effectively Marx's dictum that &ldquo;religion is the opium of the people&rdquo;&mdash; certainly there have never been any better people at doling out the opium than the bigots of the Unionist Party during the last century in Northern Ireland.  Partition is the result of this situation in Northern Ireland.  It is the cause of other evils that fall from it but it is not the prime cause of all these evils.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach says, as he did on the 29th August, that the unnatural and unjustifiable partition of our country is basic to the present situation and when Deputy Boland says something similar, it shows a continuing incomprehension of the real problem. <Col N="1502" /> Partition is a solution that was found to a problem although it was the wrong solution; it is a solution that must be changed.  When we sought our independence, Britain decided not to give independence to the whole of Ireland but in deference to the prejudices inflamed by the bosses of the Unionist Party of that area since 1912 in particular, to permit part of the country to remain in the United Kingdom.  That is why we are in the situation in which we find ourselves today.</P>
    <P>To say that Partition is the cause of the trouble is to fail to understand what the whole thing is about.  Partition is there because of fear &mdash; fear induced by people who know better and who know quite well what they are doing. It is our job to get rid of that fear because when it goes, Partition will disappear. As we all know, and on this I think we are all united in this House, it is natural that Ireland should be one country, so natural that it cannot conceivably exist indefinitely as a divided country.  It can only be divided if, for a period, people are misled and have fears instilled in them in this way, and if we can get rid of these fears, the natural unity of Ireland will be restored.</P>
    <P>We must have unity not only because of geography but also because of history, because we have shared the history of this island.  We understand about the Siege of Derry.  Our sympathies may happen to be on one side but we know what it is about; we know what happened there, but what does the Siege of Derry mean to people in Britain?  They regard it as mere Irish eccentricity to be interested in something that happened more than 300 years ago.  The fact is that we can understand the Protestant people of Northern Ireland and if we can but show that understanding, though I know it may not be easy after some of the events of the past few months, we will provide the basis for the ultimate unity of this country.</P>
    <P>The extreme Unionists in Northern Ireland are now discovering for the first time that people in England do not understand the first thing about them, that they have no sympathy whatever with them and that what the Unionist regard as their history of <Col N="1503" /> great loyalty to Britain is regarded by the British as something totally alien to them.  These people in the North of Ireland have shared our history with us and in the long run it will not be geographical factors that will unite our country but, rather, it will be the facts of history.  The bringing about of this unity began some weeks ago when the Unionists realised for the first time that Britain does not really care and does not understand.  Once that is understood, the two parts of Ireland can come together in mutual comprehension and mutual understanding and we can remove this fear, a fear that has been artificially induced and artificially kept alive for so long.  It is a fear that has been kept alive by our blunders, for during the past 50 years we have made mistakes in this context &mdash; two kinds of mistakes, perhaps, mistakes within our own country which make it singularly unattractive to people in Northern Ireland and which have enabled the Unionist bosses in Northern Ireland to ask the people of the Shankill area if they would like to be in a country where such-and-such happens. In the light of some of the things that we have done here, it has not been difficult to persuade these people that this is not the kind of country for them.</P>
    <P>I will give some examples of the kinds of mistakes that we have made without going into the merits of them one way or the other.  We had the mother and child scheme controversy which has been so abused and misunderstood in Northern Ireland and we had the Fethard-on-Sea business back in the 1950's; in fact, we have not always been free from bigotry here. Since the foundation of the State there has been bigotry on the Catholic side too; and we must not forget that we have had the censorship system &mdash; I do not mean the existence of it but the way in which it operates.  I think that the Northern Ireland system of police prosecutions is superior but I think the police on the whole are not really qualified for detecting works of literary merit or, for that matter, for detecting pornography.</P>

      <P>What is wrong is the way in which the Censorship Board has been run.  It has discredited us in the eyes of the world and it has enabled the people in Northern Ireland to talk about our censorship as if we were censoring the Protestant bible or something like that.</P>
      <P>Again, with regard to our Irish language, we have operated in such a way as to show a total incomprehension and a total lack of interest of the feelings of the people of Northern Ireland.  Because of the requirement that a person must know Irish before he can obtain a job in the public service here, we are enabling the bosses of the Unionist Party to tell the people of Northern Ireland that if Ireland were to be re-united, they would not have any chance whatsoever of obtaining a job in the public service here without knowing Irish. They are being put on notice that they would be discriminated against.</P>
      <P>There are many other examples that one could give.  The policies we have pursued in this part of the country have been partitionist policies, they have been partition-minded policies&mdash; they may have been appropriate for our own area; in some cases perhaps they were.  There are policies which may be appropriate to an area which is predominantly of one religion which would not be suitable in other areas. Maybe some of the policies were correct. Correct or not, they were policies which were designed and operated in the context of a Twenty-Six County State and later a Twenty-Six County Republic which showed no interest in, understanding of, or care for the whole question of Northern Ireland. They showed that all we said about Partition was clap-trap.</P>
      <P>We made blunders also in our relationship with the north as well as in our own affairs here, in relation to opinion in Northern Ireland.  At official level we pursued over a period of years a number of conflicting policies. One or other of them might be justified intellectually even though I might feel that such policies might be wrong but if mutually self-defeating policies are pursued, none of them is likely to succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had the policy of raising <Col N="1505" /> Partition at every international assembly. This policy was operative until we joined the United Nations.  We fell into this trap again in August of this year in the form of the intervention of the Minister for External Affairs at the United Nations. It is a policy we have pursued, dropped and started again at different periods, a policy of trying to create international pressure on Britain to persuade her to hand over the north and to put her in a position of ignominy so that she would feel obliged to hand it over.  I regarded that policy as doomed to failure from the outset.</P>
    <P>We had another policy of pursuing good relations with Britain to persuade her that it would be a good thing to hand over the north, but this policy was undermined when we attacked Britain at any international assembly.</P>
    <P>We had another policy which was possibly a good policy, of improving relations with the Northern Ireland Government with a view to reducing the tensions which perpetuated the division of Ireland.  That policy was undermined when we put pressure on Britain to try to persuade her to hand over the north.</P>
    <P>Others outside this Parliament pursued a policy of physical force against the north.  Such a policy was not only bound to fail but has tended to strengthen Partition and perpetuate it by giving to the Unionist bosses material with which to keep the poor dupes on the Shankill Road loyal to them.  This is the way to copperfasten Partition.</P>
    <P>By our policies for the past 50 years, we have ensured that Partition would be here with us in 1969 and perhaps for a long while still. We are only now starting to pursue intelligent policies which will lead to the end of Partition by agreement within a period of decades ahead. That is the kind of fear which we have fed the Protestants as if we were the feedman feeding the comic.  We have been feeding the Unionist bosses with the lines for them to hand out in order to ensure that they can maintain their position there.</P>
    <P>The Catholic minority in Northern Ireland fear attack.  We have not shown <Col N="1506" /> much understanding or concern for their feelings in this regard until quite recently.  I have heard some of the condemnations on the use of British troops and I have been amazed at how extraordinarily detached one can be about other people's affairs 100 miles away.  It is surprising to hear it being said that British troops are unacceptable when their non-use would lead to our own co-religionists being murdered. It shows a degree of detachment about a problem I would not have thought anybody was so detached about.</P>
    <P>The fear of the Catholic community was illustrated to me forcibly when I travelled one Easter Tuesday from Belfast to Bangor to address a meeting.  I got into an empty compartment when the train was not full.  It was a double compartment with no top on the dividing wall between the compartments.  A short time after I got in some youngsters entered behind me and talked to each other.  By their discussion on the Pope and the Queen, and by the expletives they used it was possible to determine that they were Protestants.  Shortly afterwards, before the train moved the door burst open and into my part of the compartment came another similar group of, what one might describe as, roughly speaking, &ldquo;teddy boys&rdquo;.  From the way they spoke of the Queen and the Pope and by the expletives they used I gathered that they were Catholics.</P>
    <P>If I were a man from outer space and knew nothing about Northern Ireland I would have noted the total similarity between the two people except in one respect, which was that I would have known which was the dominant group and which was not.  One group were afraid and were plucking up courage to retaliate after the dominant group spoke.  The other group were sure of themselves.  Even in their voices one could notice which group were the more confident.  At Hollywood, the Protestant group left.  They have a holiday on the Easter Tuesday because, for religious reasons, they cannot have it on Good Friday.  Immediately the Catholic group hung out the window and hurled abuse at all the Orangemen along the coastline as they passed.  It was an impressive and depressing experience. <Col N="1507" /> It taught me the realities of life in Northern Ireland for Catholics.</P>
    <P>Anyone who says that British troops should not be used in Northern Ireland is someone who has not been in any real situation in Northern Ireland or who has not encountered the problem.</P>
    <P>I come now to the mistakes made by the Government during the events of this summer in Northern Ireland. Any Government is likely to make mistakes in a situation arising as suddenly as that which occurred in Northern Ireland and on which decisions had to be made.  So much depended on the decisions, and people can make mistakes in such a situation. But if the Government had had a policy and had attempted to understand what was happening in Northern Ireland for the past ten years there would not have been so many mistakes.</P>
    <P>Firstly, it was a mistake to have moved troops to the Border first and to have explained afterwards.  Even if the explanation had been a convincing one, this was the wrong way around.  It was unwise and unfortunate in its effect.  I recognise there was an argument that, by moving troops and by appearing to threaten, the British Government might be encouraged to take vital decisions rapidly.  That might have been the motive.  If that was a genuine motive, then the mistake was a genuine mistake made in good faith but it must be recognised that such a move was bound to be seen as a threat by the Protestants and likely to lead to a pogrom.  Nevertheless the decision could have been made in good faith.  The explanation given by the Minister for External Affairs in a desperate attempt to extricate the Government from the position it was in, that they were being sent up because he was convinced that the British would accept them as part of a peace-keeping force, is one which I do not think impresses anyone, either here, in the north, or in Britain.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Taoiseach's statement &mdash; hastily drafted, I understand, because he had very little time that evening before going on the air &mdash; that the present situation cannot be allowed to continue and that the Irish Government could no longer stand by and see <Col N="1508" /> innocent people injured and, perhaps, worse, must have been read by people in Northern Ireland as meaning more, perhaps, than the Taoiseach intended it to mean.  It must have appeared &mdash; it did appear, we know, in fact, to the Catholics in the North, from the reports coming back &mdash; as some kind of assurance that Irish troops would be used to protect them, and that must have been some kind of incitement to the feelings of some of the Protestants in the Shankill Road area.</P>
    <P>Again, and I have said this before, it was a mistake to criticise the use of British troops.  Deputy O'Leary and Deputy Corish are right in what they said.  In his statement on the night of the 13th the Taoiseach said that &ldquo;the employment of British troops is not acceptable.  Nor would it be likely to restore peaceful conditions, certainly not in the long term.&rdquo; Nevertheless, despite the last few words the statement stands, even if the qualification saves the position a bit, and it has to date proved incorrect.</P>
    <P>On the next day the Government Information Bureau reiterated the view expressed by the Taoiseach that the use of British troops in the Six Counties was not acceptable.  On the 20th, the Minister for External Affairs said at the Security Council of the United Nations that the use of British troops was not acceptable and their use constituted a major factor in the perpetuation of Partition and that: &ldquo;This position can be sustained only through military support from outside and this can only be settled without interference from our nearest neighbour&rdquo;.  That was taken out of a drawer somewhere; it has nothing to do with current reality.  It is the traditional viewpoint. It has something to do with Policy No. 1 &mdash; No. 1 or No. 2, I am not sure which, but it implies that this is something we can settle if only the British would keep out and we could take over.</P>
    <P>How, I wonder, did the people in the United Nations, and elsewhere, regard that?  Let us ponder the words again: the use of British troops is unacceptable; they constitute a major factor in the perpetuation of Partition: if they went away Partition would end; the present position could only be sustained through military support from <Col N="1509" /> outside; if it went Partition would end and the situation could be settled if there were no interference from our nearest neighbour.</P>
    <P>If I were a detached observer at the United Nations, knowing nothing about Ireland, I would read that as meaning &ldquo;if only the referee would go away the match would finish very quickly, with the bigger man winning&rdquo;.  That comes out of policies Nos. 1 and 2 which, I thought, had been ditched a long time ago and how it got into a speech at the United Nations I do not quite understand and I think it was quite inappropriate there.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary to deal with the speech of the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Boland, because the least harmful thing the Minister said was to repeat the Taoiseach's remarks that the presence of British troops was wholly unacceptable to the people of Ireland.  The people of the Falls Road are not, of course, part of the people of Ireland.  They accepted the British troops and are therefore ruled out.  In the Minister's eyes, they are traitors and guilty of treason, I suppose; it is vital that you allow yourself to be martyred and massacred&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister never mentioned the long term in the quotation I have.  Later on, in relation to another point in his speech you have &ldquo;long term&rdquo; coming in, but not in relation to that particular quotation.</P>
      <P>Next, I think the Taoiseach made a mistake in raising the constitutional position at the time he did.  I cannot think of a worse time to raise the constitutional position than in a statement about sending troops to the Border and in a statement saying &ldquo;British troops are completely unacceptable&rdquo;, when the position was as tense as it was and people were in danger of their lives. To ask the British at that early moment to initiate negotiations to review the present constitutional position of the Six Counties of Northern Ireland was to make sure, if other efforts failed, that the people of the Shankill would be thoroughly aroused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the moving of troops to the <Col N="1510" /> Border could be a genuine error of judgment.  I do not know.  It may be that it was the right thing to do, though I have a personal view about it.  I could be wrong and it is possible it did have a good effect.  I may be wrong in thinking it had a bad effect, but I cannot be wrong, I think, in saying that to combine that manoeuvre with raising the constitutional position was quite inappropriate.  There could be no benefit to be got for the poor people of Derry and Belfast by talking about the Constitution in that speech.  God knows, it has been mentioned in enough speeches; to raise it again at that moment of time was to exacerbate the position.</P>
    <P>I think then the United Nations effort was a mistake.  It is one thing to have asked the British Government for a UN peacekeeping force, it was doomed to failure, but it was a permissible tactic to force the British Government to intervene with British troops and from that point of view it is something with which I will not quarrel.  But to go to the Security Council and humiliate this country with the kind of effort put up there was something which should not have been done just for domestic political reasons.  I am not blaming the Minister for External Affairs; he did the job as well as he could within the limits imposed by having his speech written for him and the limits imposed by the instructions he got.</P>

However, the Taoiseach knows more about that and he will no doubt enlighten us fully in his reply; I should be glad to hear which paragraph was written by whom. <Col N="1511" /> What concerned me was the fact that in this situation, a situation in which we should have been trying to establish a good diplomatic position with the British and to influence them as much as possible, while maintaining our dignity, at least, in the face of the world, we were rigging up this kind of &ldquo;non-debate&rdquo; in the Security Council and relying on the goodwill of the British with Lord Caradon more or less saying: &ldquo;All right.  If it will satisfy the Irish fellows to make a speech and then we will abandon the whole thing, that is all right&rdquo;.  I am not now quoting, but this kind of speech for domestic political purposes is, to me at any rate, distasteful and undignified.</P>

      <P>That would have been very embarrassing, but they are not members of the Security Council at present, fortunately for the Government. I do not understand how the Taoiseach could tell us today that this distasteful episode was &ldquo;most satisfactory and effective&rdquo; and that all the addresses, talks and information were worth it since the facts are now better known than ever before.  I do not follow at all.  I had to write down what he said fairly quickly and it may be that I telescoped sentences, but the first part was definitely about UN intervention and it seemed as if the second part was too.  I think he was going on there to talk about the general public relations campaign. <Col N="1512" /> How could he say this intervention was satisfactory and effective?  In achieving what?  That our position would be better known?  Has the Taoiseach seen any foreign newspapers?  When all this started I was on holiday in France.  I have seen, too, many of the papers of other countries and for days one could read about nothing else.  Nobody on the Continent could read anything else for days.  I should, indeed, have brought in some of the papers.  The headlines were very dramatic: La Chasse aux Catholiques &mdash; The Hunt of the Catholics.  That was the main headline in a Sunday paper.  What put all this on the world mat was not the efforts of the Government at the United Nations, which got one or two paragraphs, but what actually happened in Northern Ireland, something that brought every journalist of renown in the world to the North, something which had every television and radio network in Europe broadcasting hour by hour what was happening in the North, something which had every paper in Europe for ten whole days giving its main headlines to Ireland. How did the Government contribute to that unless they are claiming that their neglect in some way produced the explosion in the North?  Otherwise, I cannot see what contribution they made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public relations is scarcely necessary now.  You could argue that we could have spent the last 50 years, instead of mouthing about Partition, dealing effectively with the problem of discrimination in the north and putting out factual material to get across the truth.  That might have been a good thing, but there is one occasion on which public relations is not needed and that is when every newspaper is writing about the north anyway I suppose.  It might have been useful to have issued a correction to French newspapers which referred to Belfast as the capital of the Republic, or it might be useful to send a correction to <i>Le Figaro</i> which said that Montrose was blown up despite the protection of British troops but apart from minor factual corrections of this kind public relations is never less required than in a crisis of this kind. <Col N="1513" /> The public relations effort has been ill conceived and counterproductive. Some of the productions seem to me to be inept.  I have before me this document in which the headline is &ldquo;British Troops &mdash; Irish Soil&rdquo;&mdash; pursuing this idea that there is something to be objected to in the fact that British troops moved in to protect people in the Falls Road.  That is inept and inappropriate. It must be said, from what I have heard, that this was a mistake, that the people carrying out this campaign and endeavouring to do something useful, despite the guidance and line they got from the Government, have in fact realised it is a mistake and I believe they have been doing a useful job largely by not following the instructions they are getting from the Government. They are skilled public relations people who know that the one way to damage a good cause is to produce propaganda about it.</P>

    <P>I also think that the Government made a mistake in not recalling the Dáil.

We suffered a good deal from the fact that we had speeches from people like the Minister for Local Government and this was really what the country was hearing.  If there had been a debate, and if the kind of things said here today by people like Deputy O'Leary for example, and the Taoiseach, who made a very constructive and excellent speech, had been said, perhaps passions would have been calmed and it would have been beneficial.  Of course, it is possible to argue the opposite.  If the Taoiseach's fear was that he did not wish his Minister for Local Government <Col N="1514" /> or Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to have a platform from which to speak in the Dáil, and it has been suggested that this was why the Government did not want to have a separate debate and wanted to combine it with the debate on the Vote for External Affairs, if that was his fear perhaps there was a case for not recalling the Dáil, but he certainly had nothing to fear from this side of the House in the way of irresponsibility.</P>

I would have thought that the Taoiseach, in the line he was pursuing after the immediate crisis, would hardly have wanted to supply a further platform for Ministers to make speeches diviating so far from his own line.</P>

      <P>The point I am making is that it is clear that the Opposition has been responsible and the Taoiseach, in the course of his speech today, paid tribute generously <Col N="1515" /> and justly to that.  I do not think that if there had been a debate there would have been any danger of irresponsibility from this side of the House, and perhaps there would have been no danger from the other side either, but that is a matter for the Taoiseach to decide.</P>
      <P>We are now facing the facts at last. We are facing the fact that the three policies, the sore thumb policy to intimidate Britain into handing over the North, the policy of persuading Britain to hand over the North and the policy of shooting our way into the North, are dead.  I think we are now all agreed, certainly on this side of the House, I cannot speak for the Government side, that we must join with the people of Northern Ireland in trying to normalise the situation in doing everything we can to reduce tension. Once these fears have been set at rest one can see a normal situation emerging at some point out of which we can see an eventual reunification of the country because the workers of the Shankill Road area will at some point see that they have much more in common with the workers in Dublin and the workers in Cork than they have with the bosses who have been exploiting them for so long.</P>
      <P>First and foremost, then, we are all agreed not only on the proposition that force must never be used but on the different, and as Deputy O'Leary pointed out, the new proposition so far as the Government side is concerned that Partition must be ended and the country reunified only with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.  That was said in the Fine Gael policy statement.  It is the view of the Labour Party and it has received endorsement from the Taoiseach.  It received instant endorsement from him in the endorsement he gave the Fine Gael policy statement in the evening papers of that day and it received endorsement in his Tralee speech and in what he said here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now reached a point quite different from where we were before, where all the political parties are on record as saying not only that they abhor the use of force but saying to <Col N="1516" /> the people of Northern Ireland &ldquo;You have nothing to fear from us, we shall not force you to join us or persuade your British bosses to force you to join us.  We invite you to join us.  When you are ready to do that, and when a majority of your people wish to join us, then and then only will we enter into such an arrangement with you.&rdquo; All three Parties have said this.  This to my mind is a revolution in the whole situation in this part of the country.  It is a revolution for which the Fine Gael Party can claim a good deal of credit in having come out initially with this statement and having thus encouraged the Government to give their backing to this statement.</P>
    <P>I may be unfair to the Government and it may be that at some point in the past the Government have not alone said that force was out but that Partition can only end with the consent of the people of Northern Ireland.  If so, the Taoiseach can give us the quotation and show that this has been Fianna Fáil policy all along.  If he does not give such a quotation and simply talks generally about that being the traditional policy of the Government, without telling us when it was said, we can fairly say that it was the Fine Gael Party who gave the lead in the first great breakthrough in the struggle to re-unify the country.  I should like to read from the editorial of <i>The Times</i> of London for September 18th, as follows:</P>
    <P>Fine Gael, the main opposition party, put out last week a ten-point statement on the North.  Most of the points concerned internal changes in the province of a kind Westminster and Stormont have already agreed upon.</P>
    <P>They did not pick up the point about the Coalition Government, by the way, and neither has our Government here. The editorial continues:</P>
    <P>The only proposals for unilateral action by the Irish Government were a formal assertion of the rejection of force to abolish the border, and policies within the Republic directed towards removing social and economic obstacles to unification.  The statement ended by saying that it is the duty of political parties within <Col N="1517" /> the Republic to recognise that the only way the divided state of the island could or should be modified is with the consent of the majority of people in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;that is a misquotation because we said &ldquo;a majority of the people&rdquo; which is slightly different&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>In reply to this Mr. Lynch said that the main proposals were a reiteration of government policy.</P>
    <P>It is just conceivable that on the basis of this good sense there could eventually be negotiated a tripartite agreement between London, Dublin and Belfast...</P>
    <P>There is there the beginning of a breakthrough. We are at the point where, if we pursue the kind of line that has emerged in this debate, we can now genuinely for the first time in 50 years look forward with some kind of reasonable confidence, with some kind of model or programme in our minds as to how it might happen, to a time when Partition will end with the consent of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this should not merely be something said in debate by different parties, by different spokesmen, but should be formally said.  I will come back at the end to the question of an all-party committee.  Whether or not there is an all-party-committee, I think the parties should get together and should formally draft a statement in these terms and endorse it formally as the policy of all the parties, of all the people of this part of Ireland and on that basis, begin to set at rest for the first time, the fears of the Protestant people of Northern Ireland and provide the basis for the progress we hope to make over the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Against that background, if we had such a formal statement, anything would be possible.  The ideas the Taoiseach has thrown out in this debate are useful; they are criticised by Deputy O'Leary and I see some point in his criticism but, nevertheless, the Taoiseach's ideas are useful and the fact that he has expressed such an open mind on the various ways in which we could move gradually towards closer association with the north is encouraging.  He has not only spoken of a federal solution, he has spoken also of interim <Col N="1518" /> stages during which the north would retain its link with Britain and retain the financial assistance it gets from Britain and we would harmonise our social benefits and so on upwards towards the British level.  That is a constructive suggestion and one which could be pursued perhaps when the immediate tension dies down and constructively pursued in the kind of tripartite talks to which <i>The Times</i> of London has looked forward on the basis of the Fine Gael policy statement.</P>
    <P>I would make the point here that all this would be much easier within the European Economic Community, for two reasons, one a technical one and one a broader one.  The technical one is, of course, that the common agricultural policy of the European Economic Community will remove one of the two major economic obstacles to the ending of Partition.  Under that common agricultural policy, with the same price system for the whole area and the abolition of the system of deficiency payments, the present situation in which farmers in Northern Ireland get a much better price than farmers in the Republic would no longer apply. Our farmers and Northern Ireland farmers would be paid the same price and we would not be forced to look for a vast sum of agricultural subsidies to subsidise Northern Ireland in the event of reunion.</P>
    <P>But, apart from that rather technical though, nevertheless, important point, in view of the scale of the funds involved, there is also the fact that within the European Economic Community there will be a gradual tendency for power to be divided as far as Northern Ireland is concerned between the local government looking after its own internal affairs and the European Parliament and eventually government in Brussels concerned with matters of high and general economic and social policy.  One can see a time when, in fact, the functions of the Parliament in Westminster will be greatly diminished.  While retaining this technical thing called sovereignty, the power to take vital decisions affecting the life of the people of Northern Ireland might rest with Belfast or in Brussels but not to that <Col N="1519" /> extent with London.  When that time comes, the question of whether this thing called sovereignty &mdash; which might not be all that important in practical terms &mdash; rested in Dublin or London, might no longer be the source of such tension as it is today.  So that, from that point of view too, one could look forward within a European federal community towards the stage when the tension aroused by this question of whether sovereignty is technically held over Northern Ireland in London or Dublin would cease to be so important. In that way one could look towards the solution to the Partition problem perhaps in terms different from any we have hitherto conceived.</P>
    <P>I think we must also now set about restoring our position <i>vis-à-vis</i> Britain which we have damaged to some degree by our propaganda exercises.  I think, in fact, we have not lost as much as we might have here, because British public opinion has been so aroused by the situation in Northern Ireland that the mistakes we have made tend to be overshadowed.  There has been momentary irritation of British public opinion at some of our blunders but I do not think it has been very deep-rooted and it is going to be fairly easy for us to restore our diplomatic fences with Britain, to restore our position, so as to enable us to resume discussion with the British Government about our legitimate interest &mdash; and they accept that, I think, informally and perhaps even formally &mdash; a legitimate interest in Northern Ireland, a legitimate concern for peace in that part of the country, a legitimate concern for the protection of people with whom we have so much in common, who are part of our own people in any real sense, if we get away from silly things like political boundaries, a legitimate concern for them and for their interests, a concern that they should be treated justly.  That, I think, the British Government recognises and we want to be able to pursue that and want to be in a position where we can go in a friendly way to the British Government &mdash; I would like to think that the Taoiseach was doing so at the moment and was getting a response &mdash; and say, &ldquo;Look, we have a fair understanding <Col N="1520" /> of the problems in Northern Ireland and although you may purchase a little bit of extra peace <i>vis-à-vis</i> extreme Unionists by climbing down on the Hunt Committee recommendations, we can tell you that this will, in fact, not pay off in the long run.  Do not be tempted at this point.&rdquo; I would like to feel that we were engaged in that type of friendly diplomatic exercise, that we were using the influence which we have and have not entirely lost even by our recent UN antics, using that influence constructively at this point to ensure that Britain does not make mistakes as she could so easily make at this point by climbing down in response to the type of pressures which exist at the moment and which the British Government is coming under.</P>
    <P>There is also the gerrymander issue.  There seems to be some shift on this because of the new system of centralising all power over housing at a higher level and Faulkner's willingness to look at something other than the 17 areas.  The question of gerrymandering is something we should press.  I accept that our Government here may be somewhat inhibited on this point.  It is certainly something that Fine Gael and Labour could press with more chance than the present Government have, in view of the gerrymander earlier this year, of having it taken seriously.  Nevertheless, the Government should not be too inhibited by that in its approach to the British Government and should try to forget &mdash;we find it hard to forget after the election results &mdash; our five lost seats that were gerrymandered away from us&mdash; naturally a sore point&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This was one of the factors affecting the result.  We have got to run this part of the country in such a way that the Unionists in the north cannot point down here and say: &ldquo;Why should we not gerrymander? The Government in the Republic have gerrymandered every damn seat it could get in the election.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another matter which I think should be pressed <Col N="1521" />&mdash;and here once again the Government may suffer some inhibitions.  It seems to me there will never be a normal situation in Northern Ireland, there will never be peace, there will never be justice, until in the Government of that part of the country Catholics as well as Protestants are represented.  I, indeed, have been puzzled by the unwillingness of people even to consider this possibility.  We have heard repeatedly from the north, and indeed, from Britain, in the last couple of months that, of course, if Chichester-Clark falls, Britain must take over, that unless he continues there has to be direct British rule.  They seem to have forgotten that there is such a thing as parliamentary democracy.  Parliament rules.  A reminder from down here where we have an effective parliament and democratic parliament might not come amiss in this respect.  If, in fact, Chichester-Clark falls and is overturned by the extremists in his Party there will remain a majority in the Northern Ireland Parliament, I believe, of moderate people seeking peace.  It would be an appalling thing if the rigidities of the party system up there, if the accident of history which has combined in one party moderate and fairminded people like Richard Ferguson and Phelim O'Neill on the one hand, and Bill Craig on the other hand, the accident of history which has brought these two together in one thing called a political party with a common name, should prevent Parliament from operating effectively.  I would hope that at that point, if Chichester-Clark is overturned, the Northern Ireland Parliament will assert itself and that the moderate people in that Parliament on all sides will join together to form a government, a government representing 80 per cent or more of the people of Northern Ireland who want peace and will not allow themselves to be jockeyed out of existence, jockeyed into a fatal error of UDI, jockeyed into a fatal confrontation with the British Government, jockeyed into a pogrom, by extremists abusing the party system that exists there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are times of great crisis when the party system, instead of serving the interests of the public &mdash; as it does&mdash; can, in fact, be a fatal inhibition to <Col N="1522" /> doing the right thing.  It is vital in Northern Ireland, if Chichester-Clark is overturned, that the Unionist Party should split and that a moderate government should be formed.</P>
    <P>We should not be remiss in putting this forward.  We should not readily accept the idea that, if that government goes, Britain must take over.  Our government here, for its own internal political reasons, would like to make the word &ldquo;Coalition&rdquo; a bad word but it should not be afraid to say that, whatever the circumstances down here, in Northern Ireland things are different and, therefore, the right solution is a Coalition government.  I hope our Government will not be inhibited, by reason of consideration in this part of the country, from making that point forcibly.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should press the British Government, through diplomatic channels, to remove the Special Powers Act.  We have a Special Powers Act and a pending Criminal Justice Bill.  I hope, again, our Government, because it has got itself into this position, will not be inhibited and will make the best case it can to the British Government as to why we have to have a Special Powers Bill here while they must get rid of it in Northern Ireland. We cannot indefinitely run our country in such a way that a coalition government is unthinkable, gerrymandering is all right but Coalitions are out, when, in fact, in Northern Ireland we ought to be saying these are the things that need to be dealt with.  This is one country, not two.  We cannot go on having these partitionist attitudes and policies. We must see everything we do in the context of the whole of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Coming now to the reforms we need to undertake here, I must make the point that it is not a question of how we see ourselves: no doubt we see ourselves objectively: that is not the point. We should be concerned, even if objectively we are satisfied with the way we are doing things here, that, if from the point of view of the people in Northern Ireland, the things we do here seem to them so unattractive as to make them not want to join us, and, therefore, to frustrate us in our policy of seeking a voluntary reunion, then we must be prepared to make changes <Col N="1523" /> even if we do not see them necessary for what we like to call &ldquo;domestic reasons&rdquo;, as if domesticity is confined to the Republic and as if the word &ldquo;domestic&rdquo; should not apply to the whole island of Ireland.  Now, what are these reforms?  I mentioned constitutional reforms already.  Everybody is suddenly agreed, from the Cardinal down, that we should get rid of the section about the special position of the Roman Catholic Church although that is not at issue.  For some reason that is not clear from Question Time today or from the Taoiseach's speech, the Government do not seem to be pushing ahead with this as actively as one would like, I think the recommendation of the Constitution Committee with regard to the section dealing with the re-integration of the national territory should be looked at also.  They put forward a good case, on rather different grounds admittedly, for changing the wording.  It has to do with making sure we will get oil out of the Irish Sea, or something like that.  Whatever the reason, anything to get rid of the particularly offensive terminology without abating one whit our aim and our desire and our intention to ensure that Ireland is re-united eventually, would be helpful and we should look again at the Constitution Committee's recommendation on this particular Article, Article 3.</P>
    <P>Also &mdash; this is more controversial but I think it needs to be said &mdash; we should look at the Article in the Constitution with regard to divorce.  Again, the Constitutional Committee grasped this nettle but grasped it badly.  They recognise that this is something that should not be in the Constitution, that its wording creates all kinds of legal difficulties. In fact, it creates an impossible situation legally and they recommend that it should be changed.  But I do not approve of the particular recommendation because it involves setting up a caste system as in India: if a person is born a Catholic, there is one divorce law and if one is born a Protestant there is another divorce law.  I do not think under this proposal one is allowed to change one's religion for the purpose of divorce.</P>
    <P>That kind of caste system is something <Col N="1524" /> which the Indians are trying to get rid of; do not try to let us introduce it here.  We are all equal before the law.  I think it is a bad solution. Nevertheless, I think we should look again at this.  Personally, I am unconvinced that divorce is beneficial. The arguments I have heard have heard have not convinced me of this. I have an open mind as to whether people who believe in it should be allowed to have it.  What I am quite sure of is that whether or not we change our law here &mdash; and I am not convinced by any means that we should change the law in this part of the country at this time &mdash; anyway, it should not be in the Constitution.  It is one thing for the people in this part of Ireland to say that, as far as the people in this part of the eventual Federal State is concerned, we do not want to have this divorce arrangement here.  It is quite different to say, in effect: &ldquo;We have a Constitution which you will have to accept under which your divorce arrangements will have to go.&rdquo; Divorce should never have been mentioned in the Constitution.  It is an appropriate matter for legislation.  I believe that we were right and have been right not to have divorce although I am prepared to consider arguments to the contrary.  But I see no case whatever for having it in the Constitution as distinct from having it part of our domestic law which, at some stage, if public opinion wishes it to be done in the interests of the minority, could be changed.  I would suggest, therefore, that, instead of doing what the Constitutional Committee recommend, we should eliminate that clause from the Constitution while leaving it part of our law in this part of Ireland.</P>
    <P>There are legal reforms, too, to consider. The reform of the law with regard to contraception is a subject much talked about.  I do not see that it is the function of the State to enforce something of this kind, which is a matter of such division even amongst theologians. The weight of opinion amongst theologians, though not amongst bishops, at this point in time, is, I think, in favour of permitting contraception. I do not think it is the job of the State to come down in favour of <Col N="1525" /> the bishops against theologians or to get involved in this kind of abstract and difficult question which is an intensely personal question.  Although the Taoiseach at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis is alleged to have said that there is no problem at all, I am not convinced of this by any means and I think the law here should be changed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Be accurate again now.  I said that our law was confined to the importation and exposure for sale of contraceptives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It was a loose interpretation.  I accept the Taoiseach's correction.  The point I am making is that the Taoiseach felt that individuals could get over this by importing themselves and, therefore, nobody was at a serious disadvantage.  I do not accept that that is an adequate statement of the position.  I do not think this is an appropriate matter for legislation in view of the conflict of view within one church and the very clear objection from other churches.</P>
      <P>I think we have done a lot to put our censorship right but I was a bit taken aback yesterday when I was approached to put my name to an appeal as one of five Parliamentarians to get <i>The Borstal Boy</i> unbanned.  I had forgotten that this book was still banned.  At the time of the censorship legislation, I went carefully through the list of banned books to discover what was being left banned under the ten-year rule but I must have missed this.  I think we have a little bit more to do in this direction although we have done a very good job, on the whole, in regard to reforming the censorship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also other matters which do not concern Parliament where we need to reconsider our position.  I speak now, if I may do so for a moment, as a Roman Catholic rather than a Parliamentarian.  I think that the rigidity of the attitude of the Irish church in regard to the question of the division of people for educational purposes on a religious basis is something that should be looked at.  I appreciate the arguments in favour of it.  I have always thought them strong.  I would be very reluctant to depart from them myself in my own personal affairs <Col N="1526" /> although I think my mind could change eventually on that but certainly, up to now, I have been clear on it.  I think, however, that, when you get a position like that which exists in Northern Ireland, the greater good demands a change.  I do not suggest that they should suddenly, overnight, integrate all the schools.  This is not practical. Indeed, the Protestants would be the first to object in many cases.  However, the complete rigidity of the present attitude should be modified.  There should be an open mind on this.  We should not be in the position, as Catholics, of saying that we are all for civil rights and integration in the community, and getting rid of all bigotry, but you will not have our children and your children in the same school under any circumstances.  There should be an open mind and a willingness to experiment. It will continue in that way, fair enough, for a long time to come because people want it that way but it should not be made a matter of principle.</P>
    <P>I was interested to find recently, at a convention of my party in County Westmeath a motion down to this effect that religious apartheid in Irish education should be abolished. It was passed by an overwhelming majority of seven votes to one.  There does exist a volume of opinion on this question because of the situation in Northern Ireland: I think we should have a more open mind on this.  I say this not as a Parliamentarian: it does not conern us directly although because of the way Parliament administers the educational system it does, in fact, go a long way towards backing up the system.  I think, as Catholics, we need to re-think our position here in the particular cirumstances of Northern Ireland.  Already, indeed, the Cardinal has agreed that, at the level of sixth form there cold be such integration. I think the matter is now open for further discussion.</P>

    <P>* Capital shown consists of Exchequer loan and share capital.  On the 11th December, 1967, the status of the Dairy Disposal Co. Ltd., was changed from that of a company with three associated companies to that of a holding company and the combined share capital of the associated companies (£20,015) was transferred to the Consolidated Balance Sheet as part of a capital reserve on a consolidation.  The capital position shown for 1967 and 1968, therefore represents Exchequer loan £584,603 and £7 issued capital of the Dairy Disposal Co. itself.</P>

    <P>NOTES (i) Single shares are held by each of the Directors of the Company and by the Secretaries of the Departments of Transport and Power, Finance and Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P> (ii)  Up to the reorganisation in 1966, Aer Rianta had received no return on its shareholding in Aer Lingus and Aer Línte and in turn had made no payment to the Minister for Finance in respect of his ownership of the shares of Aer Rianta.  The only return made by Aer Rianta was under an arrangement whereby it has, before and since 1966, surrendered to the Minister for Industry and Commerce/Transport and Power the surplus earned on the management of Dublin Airport.  This is an operating surplus and is not related to the Capital asset represented by Dublin Airport which is owned by the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>(iii)  These figures represent interest on capital from the private sector.</P>
    <P>(iv)  No ordinary capital has been repaid.  The outstanding loan from the private sector was repaid in 1961 with the money received from an increase in the shareholding of the Minister for Finance in Aer Rianta.  The loans from the private sector outstanding in 1966 were taken over by Aer Lingus as part of the reorganisation.</P>

    <P>NOTE: (i)  The rate of return reflects the large proportion of the Board's capital requirements financed from internal resources.  It also reflects the effects of the rural electrification subsidy, the varying rates of interest payable and the amortisation out of Revenue of loan capital during the duration of the loan.  The overriding consideration is that, by statute, the Board's revenue in each year must be sufficient and only sufficient (as nearly as may be) to pay all outgoings, including interest and sinking fund payments.</P>

    <P>Níl aon scairchaipiteal ag Gaeltarra. Nuair a bunaíodh an bord ar 1 Aibreán 1968 aistríodh luach £700,000 de mhaoin agus de charta chuige: níl an tsuim sin inaisíochta.  Íoctar airleacain le Gaeltarra as an bPríomh-Chiste le haghaidh chaiteachas caipitil ar shócmhainní dochta.  Ó 1961 go dtí 1965 aisíocadh £16,717 de na hairleacain sin mar aon le £38,485 ús orthu.  Bhí glan-airleacan £338,283 fágtha ar 1 Aibreán 1965 agus níl sé sin inaisíochta.  Na hairleacain a tugadh do Ghaeltarra ó 1 Aibreán 1965 go dtí 31 Márta 1969&mdash;£211,826 san iomlán&mdash;níl siad inaisíochta&mdash;ná ús orthu iníoctha&mdash;go dtí cibé dáta a chinnfidh an tAire Airgeadais tar éis dó dul i gcomhairle le hAire na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Ní raibh brabach ar na tionscail: is amhlaidh a íocadh deontas-i-gcabhair le Gaeltarra gach bliain as Vóta Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>B'é £173,114 an glan-díluachadh suas go dtí 31 Mátra 1969.  Nuair a chuirtear an glan-díluachadh sin, an glan-airleacan roimh 1 Aibreán 1965 agus na hairleacain ina dhiaidh sin le chéile faightear £723,223 san iomlán <Col N="1393" /> agus is mó luach na sócmhainní ná an t-iomlán sin.</P>
