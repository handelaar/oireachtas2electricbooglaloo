      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if in view of the special problems of emigrant welfare in the two largest centres of population in Great Britain, London and Birmingham, he will now consider making financial assistance available to the Irish Centre at Camden, London and to the Irish Information Centre at Birmingham.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the special circumstances of these two centres, of the tremendous work they do on a voluntary basis on a very slim budget and would he not consider making assistance available to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the valuable work they are doing.  The other part of the Deputy's supplementary question has been answered very many times already.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that the authorities in the Irish Centre in Camden Town were informed last year that the Minister for Finance had, in the special circumstances, considered making funds available to them and can the Minister now say if special <Col N="1686" /> consideration will be given to the unusual circumstances surrounding this centre which is in urgent need of assistance from the Government because of the volume of work there and their expenditure, for which they are depending on voluntary effort?  Surely the Minister realises that&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to have a debate; I merely want to elicit information.  Having regard to the fact that they were told that moneys would be available last year, and which did not materialise, would the Minister now give an assurance that money will be forthcoming?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is from whom the money is to come for that purpose and how it will be spent.  The Government and the Minister for Finance gave me authority to take back from Britain people who were in need of care and protection and we have taken them back during the past couple of years.  This has relieved a lot of the burden on some of the Irish organisations over there.  The wider question as to whether these people can be helped in their work by further voluntary subscriptions is still open but here we have difficulty raising money which is required to create the necessary development to keep our people at home and to the extent we spend money abroad on other matters <Col N="1687" /> it reduces our ability to develop our resources in order to give employment at home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if there is any control over the standard of staff amenities in hotels to which Bord Fáilte grants are given; and, if not, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by Bord Fáilte that the standard of staff amenities is one of the factors taken into account in the registration of hotels, and when considering applications for grant assistance for hotel development. It is the policy of the board to encourage the raising of amenity standards for hotel employees and the board provide grants at the rate of 20 per cent of the cost of staff accommodation.</P>
      <P>In general, staff conditions have much improved because among other reasons trained staff demand proper conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a condition of giving the grant that there should be certain minimum standards for staff accommodation in the hotels which receive the grants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say it was an absolute condition but Bord Fáilte make every effort, in registering the hotels or in selecting extensions to hotels, to take into account the staff accommodation.  The registration regulations with regard to hotels will be amended and among the suggested amendments is a specific provision relating to adequate staff accommodation. As the Deputy knows, the provision of training for hotels through CERT has done a great deal to raise <Col N="1688" /> the human standards and demands for proper conditions by the people who accept training.  The Deputy also knows there are regulations in regard to minimum pay and conditions of employment as a result of a joint committee that operated for the whole of the country with the exception of Dublin county and Dublin County Borough where the regulations are prescribed by the trade union in direct negotiation with the employers.  So, we are making progress with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say why we have not tackled this serious question up to now or what exactly was the difficulty in making it a condition of public grants to hotels that there would be decent conditions for the staff working in these hotels? Would the Minister agree that it was a serious omission on the part of Bord Fáilte?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not.  Bord Fáilte's main function is to promote tourism and the extent to which Bord Fáilte can enter into this matter has at all times been somewhat limited. I think part of the responsibility should lie with the Minister for Labour.  All I can say is that a general improvement is taking place which I think is satisfactory under the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there is a contradiction between the opulent quarters for foreign guests and tourists in these hotels and, in many cases, the very poor, pigsty conditions for the Irish nationals working in these hotels?  I consider it a grave omission on the part of the Minister's Department and Bord Fáilte that they have not dealt with this before now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is a slander on a very large number of hotels.</P>

    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if there is any obligation, legal or otherwise, on the ESB to inspect the wiring systems of houses or other premises before installing electricity; and if the ESB have any service for carrying out periodic inspections of which consumers could avail themselves, if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Electricity Supply Board are under no obligation to inspect the wiring systems of houses or other premises. The board have no responsibility for testing a consumer's installation or for any loss or damage which may be occasioned by fire or by an accident arising from the state of the installation.  The responsibility for all wiring on the consumer's side of the board's main fuse rests solely between him and the electrical contractor who installs the wiring.  The board is not, and cannot in practice, be responsible for the safety of electrical work carried out by contractors or individuals.</P>
      <P>It will be appreciated that the board could not satisfy themselves that there would be no danger in relation to an installation unless they could also ensure that the installation would never be loaded beyond the capacity which it was designed to carry.  This would not, of course, be practicable.</P>
      <P>The board's general conditions relating to supply provide, however, that an installation will be passed before being connected.  The passing of an installation by the board simply means that it has complied with the required insulation tests and by no means implies that the work has been done in the best possible manner.  Apart from the required insulation tests, the board naturally ensure that installations which would obviously be unsafe for the use intended are not connected to their supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to factories and workshops, regulations are in force in regard <Col N="1690" /> to the use of electricity in those premises.  Inspectors of the Department of Labour carry out inspections for the enforcement of these regulations.</P>
    <P>With regard to premises other than factories and workshops, there is provision under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, for the making of regulations.  I understand that An Foras Forbartha have drafted regulations for electrical installations in such premises, which have been submitted to the Minister for Local Government.  I understand that these regulations cover all necessary safety precautions to be observed for new electrical installations in premises other than factories and workshops and that non-compliance with the regulations, when they come into force, will be an offence liable to prosecution.</P>
    <P>The Electricity Supply Board, if requested to do so, will inspect wiring installations at the consumer's expense.</P>

The council is also engaged in a wide range of other activities for the same purpose.  These include the encouragement of better presentation and more ready availability of dairy products in hotels, restaurants, licensed premises and catering establishments generally; provision of display material for retail establishments; the holding of seminars for the retail trade; and the supply of educational aids to schools. My Department is providing increased funds for the council during the coming months to enable it to expand its promotional work.</P>

      <P>There are, I understand, about 200 people employed by the co-operative societies while the Dairy Disposal Company's creameries and milk powder plant in the area provide employment for 87, of whom 36 are employed on a seasonal basis.  I am not in a position to say at this stage what overall numbers will be employed in the event of the creameries and the milk powder plant in the area being taken over by a single new co-operative society but one of the conditions I laid down for the opening of negotiations between the Dairy Disposal Company and the co-operative societies was in relation to safeguarding the interests of the staff.</P>

      <P>The management of the estate is a function of Dublin Corporation.

    <P>Actual figures for net receipt of tax under Schedule E are not available. For the years 1947-48 and 1957-58 the figures given represent the net produce of tax under Schedule E for those years.  (Net produce of tax is the estimated ultimate yield from tax assessed in the year, whether actually collected in that year or later, after deducting all discharges and remissions and setting off all repayments.)  For the year 1967-68 the figure given is a reasonably reliable estimate of the net receipt under Schedule E for that year, as it consists almost wholly of tax collected under PAYE and under Rule 5 of the Rules applicable to Schedule E. (Rule 5 relates to tax deducted from official salaries.)</P>

      <P>It has been agreed that the Mercy Convent will concentrate on primary education and that the Presentation Convent will concentrate on secondary education, these arrangements to come into effect as soon as the new Convent of Mercy primary school is built.  A suitable site has been secured and the schedule of accommodation is being worked out. The question of what additional accommodation will be required in the Presentation Convent is at present under consideration.  The Mercy Sisters who are qualified on the secondary side will then teach in the Presentation Convent and similarly the Presentation Sisters who are qualified on the primary side will teach in the Mercy Convent. My Department is carrying out a survey of the primary school facilities south of the town; in the meantime repairs have been carried out to the primary school attached to the Loreto Convent to render it suitable for school purposes.  The Presentation Monastery school will continue to provide for the primary education of the boys in the town.</P>

      <P>(a) It is proposed to teach in the regional technical college in Athlone subjects related to the following courses:</P>
      <P>(i)  Two- and three-year senior cycle post-primary courses leading to leaving certificate with a special bias towards commerce, science and technical subjects;</P>
      <P>(ii)  Junior and senior trade certificate courses in carpentry and joinery, mechanical engineering and automobile engineering;</P>

      <P>(iv)  Courses for apprentices in the distributive trade; and</P>
      <P>(v)  Courses related to agriculture.</P>
      <P>(b)  The college, when completed, will provide a total floor space of approximately 97,000 square feet and will have 58 teaching rooms.  It is being planned to accommodate 1,160 students.</P>
      <P>(c)  I expect that the college will open for classes next September, as scheduled.  The building operation is being phased over a number of years and it will not be fully operational until 1974-75.</P>
      <P>The main long-term function of the college is to educate for trade and industry including farming, over a broad spectrum of occupations, notably in engineering and science but also in commercial, linguistic, art and design and other specialities.  The short-term aim will be to provide courses for the purpose of filling gaps in the industrial manpower structure, particularly in the technician field.  Local needs will determine the necessity for specific courses and adult education courses.  Accordingly, no final rigid pattern of courses has been fixed.</P>

      <P>It is partly in it and partly out of it, because we have to set up separate university institutions and separate statutory provisions for each university.  This will take very detailed drafting.  The initial Bill will establish the higher education authority <Col N="1711" /> on a statutory basis and it will establish a conference of Irish universities, both of which recommendations are contained in the Report of the Commission on Higher Education.  It will also establish a council for awarding technicians' awards that will be universally recognised, and also a council for awarding statutory degrees where certain standards are reached in nonuniversity institutions that are comparable to and can be equated with university standards so far as degrees are concerned.  That will be the initial Bill.  We will then have a further Bill to set up the separate universities in Galway, Cork and Dublin.  So really this is a two-tiered operation and will require two separate statutes.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the statement I issued on Friday last, the 21st February, in relation to the closing of the college.  In that statement I referred to an interim <Col N="1713" /> advisory council which I had set up to assist the Director in the general government of the college.  This council has ten members, viz., the Director of the college, three staff representatives, three student representatives and three persons nominated by me, one of whom is an official of my Department, who are associated with art education outside the college.  Moreover, the Director has established in the college an academic council.  These two bodies provide, in my view, an adequate opportunity to both staff and students to participate in the running of the college.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of changes in the present curriculum, I have asked the interim council, specifically, to reconstruct the curriculum of the three schools of the college&mdash;the School of Painting, the School of Sculpture and the School of Design&mdash; and to make recommendations so as to allow greater flexibility in the choice of courses.  This council has been in existence only since the beginning of the present term and has already held three meetings.  I hope that I will have the council's recommendations as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>With regard to my closing of the college each student has been informed that on receipt of an assurance from him or her that he or she will attend normal classes and comply with the college regulations he or she will be readmitted to the college.</P>
      <P>I might add that if the Deputy studies the recent demand of the students he will see that conceding it would take away all authority from the Director and teachers of the college.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take questions Nos. 49, 51 and 50 together in that order.</P>
      <P>Under a decision by a statutory deciding officer on test claims for unemployment benefit on behalf of nearly 300 production employees at Clara of the firm in question, there was a refusal of benefit as from 5th February, 1969, when an official picket was placed on the premises by maintenance craftsmen in pursuance of a trade dispute. The disallowance of benefit from that date was made under the provisions of section 17 (2), as amended, of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, which precludes payment of unemployment benefit to a person who has lost employment by reason of a stoppage of work which was due to a trade dispute at his place of employment, except in certain defined circumstances.  It was held by the deciding officer that exception from the disqualification was not applicable in the cases in question as the workers concerned belonged to a grade or class, members of which had become involved in the dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A copy of a communication dated 20th February, 1969, from the firm in <Col N="1717" /> question was received but it did not in fact add anything to the information already before the deciding officer.  The facts available to that officer indicated that the comparison being made with the Waterford case is not a valid one.</P>
    <P>The decision in relation to the Clara cases is under appeal and will be the subject of a hearing by an appeals officer.  In the circumstances, any further statement by me on the issue under appeal would not be appropriate.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question regarding the deputation, the allegations made by the Deputy are not in accordance with the facts.  A sizeable group of at least 12 persons from the firm in question, who did not identify themselves as members of a trade union committee, arrived at the headquarters of my Department without prior notice on the date in question and were met with the minimum of delay by a senior official. It soon became quite evident that their purpose was not, as suggested, simply to hand in the letter referred to earlier. They made it quite clear that they also hoped by their presence to force an immediate reversal of the decision affecting the unemployment benefit position of a large number of workers at the firm concerned who had lost employment by reason of a trade dispute. Even though the correct statutory procedure for contesting the decision on appeal was fully explained to them they indicated that they were not prepared to leave without a favourable decision.  The statement regarding the presence of a large Garda Síochána force is, I need hardly say, quite incorrect. It should not be necessary for me to add that attempts to influence decisions in this manner outside the normal statutory channels are entirely futile and must, of course, be thoroughly deplored.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that these workers have been paid off by the firm in question because of a breakdown in machinery?  Is he aware that there is no question whatever of the workers who have made this claim being involved in any trade dispute, that they were actually paid off by the management and that on the following day, after being paid off by the management because of the breakdown <Col N="1718" /> in machinery, they made their claims for unemployment benefit?  Is the Minister further aware that already some hundreds of workers in Clara cannot qualify for payment of home assistance by the local authority because the local authority feel that the Department of Social Welfare should be paying them unemployment benefit? Further, is the Minister aware of the serious situation that exists in the town where there are almost 400 people with no income whatever, all of whom have large families depending on them?  In view of these circumstances will the Minister now authorise the payment of unemployment benefit to the unemployed persons concerned?</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy is well aware that this has gone to an appeals officer, who is a statutory deciding officer, and it would be quite wrong, particularly at this stage, for me to make any suggestions as regards what I think the outcome of the appeal will be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that this is a case in which, in the first instance, unemployment benefit should have been granted when the firm certified that these people were unemployed, paid off because of a breakdown in machinery?  Was that certificate not sufficient to warrant the payment of unemployment benefit, without any further question or investigation? Does the Minister not agree that this is a case in which, without having to go to an appeal, the Department, in accordance with existing regulations, could have made the decision on the certificate from the management that these workers were being paid off and that there was no work for them because of a breakdown in machinery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the deciding officer has already had a test case under consideration in respect of these employees, and has decided against payment from a particular date, and the matter is now on appeal to an appeals officer.  I would not say it is sufficient just to get a statement from the manager that they were laid off, or particular groups were laid off, at particular times.  In the case with which it is being compared or <Col N="1719" /> equated in Waterford the exact same procedure was adopted.  I will not say that the same circumstances pertain.  In fact, if the Deputy listened to the reply, in Waterford all the workers were paid off before a picket ever went on the works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather from the Minister's reply that he now agrees that unemployment benefit should have been paid in the first instance without question to these workers. There was no question of a picket being placed on the industry when they were paid off by the management.  It is clearly a case in which the workers immediately on being paid off, qualified for unemployment benefit.  May I ask the Minister seriously how does he consider that almost 400 workers in the town of Clara can exist without one penny piece income from anyone?  Is the Minister aware that the merchants and the grocers in Clara will not advance the necessaries of life to these people because most of them dealt in supermarkets in local towns on a cash basis?  They now have no cash and there are many families without food in the town of Clara today.  Will the Minister, in view of this urgency, consult with the senior officers of his Department and have the arrears of unemployment benefit paid this week if possible?</P>

Is this customary? This is a very serious matter.  These are law-abiding citizens, who came up with a copy of a communication from the management of the firm.  The reason they came was to leave it with the Department so that the case could be disposed of with the least possible delay.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, some people take the view and one recognised authority said bluntly that you cannot rely on the central registration to protect your trade mark.  It would create quite a number of administrative difficulties.  The basic law on which we base our trade marks here is different from the concept in some other countries.  Translation would be necessary.  About 84 per cent of the applications that we receive here for trade marks are from foreigners, not Irish people.  These are just some of the factors.  On balance, it does not appear that we would gain, but, as I said, we <Col N="1722" /> do keep it under review to see if the balance may later.</P>

      <P>I understand that, at present, loans are being provided by the building societies to existing members only.  The information so far available in relation to the present financial year, however, indicates that advances were greater than in the previous year.  As regards the last part of the question, the amount of credit available from these sources is, of course, determined by the extent to which the public invest money in them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the amount of money provided was greater and the demand was spectacularly greater, surely there is a need unfulfilled? Would the Minister consider taking steps to direct money towards these building societies, or talk to the Minister for Finance to see if anything could be done in the Budget to encourage investment in these societies rather than spending large amounts of money on other projects.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hogan is concluding on the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I was dealing yesterday with the amendments referable to the western counties, having dealt in the earlier part of the day with eight amendments referable to the eastern counties which culminated in a vote.  The Chair had directed that those amendments would be grouped, that the eight amendments applicable to the eastern section be discussed together and the eight amendments applicable to the western section be discussed together also.  The Chair has also ruled that the amendments referable to the southern part of the country, South Tipperary, Waterford and Cork would be out of order in so far as they were already substantially dealt with and voted on. Therefore, from my point of view this terminates my contribution on this Electoral Bill.</P>
      <P>I am not clear as to whether I am now entitled, having completed my points about the western counties, to make a summary of the electoral complex as a whole.  The position was that yesterday, when dealing with the eastern counties, I summarised the position there which would arise if the Minister accepted the amendments.  I put to the House <i>vis-à-vis</i> what applies under the Minister's proposals.  Here again, as regards the western complex, the proposition which I am putting to him can be summarised very clearly and one gets a clearer picture of what would arise than one may have readily obtained by reading the rather dry bones of the amendments.</P>
      <P>Briefly, the position is this.  The eight amendments which are before the House would comprise three breaches of constituency boundaries and a comparatively limited amount of population transfer.  The three breaches would occur first, as between Galway and Roscommon, where by the transfer of the two district electoral divisions of Taghboy and Ahascragh, 953 persons would be moved into Roscommon to make that county a threeseater. The other breach of constituency boundary would be the transfer from Leitrim of 5,642 persons into South Donegal to provide for two three-seaters, one in North Donegal and the other in South Donegal; and the transfer of approximately 2,800 persons from Galway to Clare.  The particular district electoral divisions which I have given to the House would supply a population of 2,805.  In other words, the total population transfer would be 9,400.</P>
      <P>That would give that area west of the Shannon from Clare to Donegal six three-seat constituencies and three four-seat constituencies and it would preserve intact practically all the existing counties.  There would be a slight breaching of Galway county and a slight breaching in Leitrim.  It would leave in Leitrim a community of 25,000 persons to be joined up with Sligo to form a four-seater and this would allow a degree of political viability to Leitrim which could not be obtained under the system envisaged by the Minister in his proposal to divide that county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, on the other hand, endeavours to provide us with ten three-seat constituencies.  He has carried out wholesale transfers of population <Col N="1735" /> irrespective of either sentiments or of the welfare of the local people.  He proposes to transfer 8,997 persons from North Leitrim to Donegal, 10,503 persons from mid-Leitrim to Sligo and 11,072 persons from South Leitrim to Roscommon.  His total transfer of population is 59,274 and that will entail breaches of eight constituency boundaries in that western area so as to have ten three-seat constituencies. The amendments which I have suggested would allow for a transfer of 9,400 persons with three breaches of constituency boundaries, giving six three-seaters and three four-seaters.</P>
    <P>Any reasonable person will be shocked at the difference in population transfer&mdash;59,000 odd as against 9,000 odd.  The Minister can offer no defence that I can imagine which would overcome that and, as a consequence, he has not even risen to reply.

There is no reply to the eight amendments which I have given to the House.  The only reply we will get will be from the Division Lobbies.  The Minister sat there contentedly completely disregarding the fact that he is doing wholesale gerrymandering of the western complex of constituencies, of the eastern complex of constituencies and of the country as a whole and completely disregarding the message the Irish people gave him at the last referendum that they wish to set their faces against gerrymandering. Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour were against gerrymandering.  The Minister is gerrymandering in this Bill in so far as the constitutional position and the interpretation of the Constitution will allow him.  He is now doing that without even standing up to refute a single amendment.  He had placed before him today and yesterday 16 <Col N="1737" /> amendments and he has not attempted to refute a single syllable of these amendments.  He has not even replied to them.  He pretends he is operating in a democratic fashion but he is taking no notice of the wishes of the electorate. He is prepared to steamroll this Bill through the House.  His only complaint is that we have had the temerity to talk a little too long about it.  We proceeded without much verbal embroidery whatever. We dealt with figures and facts.

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 11, in the second column of the entry relating to North Kerry, to delete &ldquo;Kilquane,&rdquo;; and after &ldquo;Clogherbrien,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Cordal,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is quite simple.  It deals only with the small number of voters, perhaps, some hundreds, in the constituency of North Kerry and South Kerry.  The proposal is to undo an amendment or to reverse an amendment carried by the Minister on Committee Stage.  On Committee Stage the Minister moved and carried an amendment which, in fact, transferred the polling area of Kilquane back into North Kerry.  Apparently, that amendment went through unnoticed or without regard or due consideration to a mountain range known as Mount Brandon which very materially affects the position.  I understand there is no road connection whatever between the electoral area of Kilquane and North Kerry.  A constituent living in Kilquane would have to travel 20 miles through the constituency of South Kerry before he would arrive in the constituency of North Kerry.  A North Kerry Deputy would have to travel 40 miles through South Kerry constituency to meet his new constituents. I understand that on maps, if one were to disregard mountain ranges, the alterations made by the Minister on Committee Stage look reasonable enough, but if one takes into account the fact that Mount Brandon has to be negotiated in getting from the polling area of Kilquane in North Kerry it alters the whole situation.  There are Kerry Deputies here who will be able to bear me out in what I am told that the mountain range means a detour of some 30 miles.  I am further told that the Kerry Gaeltacht which is the largest in Munster has been divided in two by the Minister's original proposal contained in the Bill before the amendment was carried on Committee Stage. If this stands as amended on Committee it would mean that this Gaeltacht would be further divided again between the constituencies.  It is not necessary for me to say anything more about this.  I do not wish to be accused of trying to delay the matter.  It was <Col N="1739" /> said on Committee Stage that only about 182 electors were involved. Admittedly, this figure was given after a quick calculation by Deputy Sweetman.  I am told there are more people than that involved but it does not very materially affect the situation. On the other hand, it would be much more convenient for these people to remain in South Kerry.  That is all I have to say.  I trust the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimSnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">

      <P>Amendment No. 9 refers to a revision of the constituencies of North and South Kerry.  As a Kerry Deputy, I feel it is my duty to give my views on this matter.  It is proposed by the Minister to transfer the electoral division of Cordal from North Kerry into the constituency of South Kerry and at the same time to transfer Kilquane from South Kerry to the constituency of North Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This change serves no great purpose and would be resented very much by the people of both North Kerry and South Kerry.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment because, as I have said, there does not seem to be any good reason for the proposed change.  We have in North Kerry the required population for a three-seat constituency.  The electoral division of Cordal is just outside the town of Castleisland which is in North Kerry.  They do their business in Castleisland.  They have no connection with South Kerry.  Castleisland is their shopping centre.  It is proposed to have Kilquane transferred to North Kerry.  It is situated west of Dingle town, being only two miles from it, and the people of that district do their business in Dingle.  They have no connection with North Kerry.  Here, again, there is no good reason why the district of Kilquane should be transferred to North Kerry, an area with which they have no natural connection.  There is a mountain range between the electoral division of Kilquane and North Kerry, with the result that a Deputy, to meet those of his constituents in that area, would have to travel over that mountain range, a distance of 35 miles.  It is my view that the boundaries <Col N="1740" /> in Kerry should be left without this change and I again appeal strongly to the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I was waiting to see whether this was part of the delaying operation.

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It was said, when the Bill was introduced, that the district electoral division of Kilquane should be in the constituency of South Kerry and that Cordal should be in the constituency of North Kerry.  Subsequently it was represented to me that a better arrangement would be to put Cordal into South Kerry instead of Kilquane, and that this would, in fact, result in a straightening of the line on the map. Cordal appeared as a bulge, stretching into the constituency of South Kerry, and to take in Kilquane would merely result in a lengthening of the east-west line between the two constituencies.</P>
      <P>However, apparently this is just another example of how difficult it is for anybody to interpret exactly what Fine Gael want on any matter under the sun.  It was Deputy O'Connor of Fine Gael who represented this to me and, appreciating the fact that Deputy O'Connor who, as far as I know, is a decent man, is a Kerry Deputy, and because the matter seemed to be of such small importance&mdash;the number of people involved is so small&mdash;and the effect of this would be a straightening of the line on the map, it appeared to me this was a case in which I could accede to the request of a person who anybody would assume to be the official Fine Gael spokesman for that area. I was not aware that in acceding to Deputy O'Connor's request I was walking into an internal Fine Gael wrangle.</P>

I really feel this is a matter we could well leave to Fine Gael to settle among themselves, if they are capable of doing so.  I am prepared to accept the amendment and to restore the position to that which I had originally proposed.  If, in that, I am doing wrong to Deputy O'Connor, I can only say I regret it.  It was not I who decided to change this while Deputy O'Connor was sick in bed.</P>

One thing struck me following his acceptance of this amendment, small as it is, and that is that it demonstrates the necessity for a proper Report Stage. If the Minister had got his way in his proposal to take the Report Stage of this Bill on the same day as the conclusion of Committee Stage, this amendment, which the Minister now concedes to be reasonable and which Deputy McEllistrim, one of the Fianna Fáil Deputies for Kerry approves of, would not have been possible.</P>

      <P>This proposes the transfer of two townlands with a population of 54 from the proposed constituency of Meath to Kildare.  Both townlands are situated in the electoral division of Cloncurry.  The only thing about this is that the effect will reduce the population of the Meath constituency from 20,393 per Member to 20,375 per Member and increase the population of the Kildare constituency from 20,587 per Member to 20,605 per Member and that in that respect it appears to be going in the opposite direction to that indicated in the Constitution which requires every effort to be made to have as near as possible equality of population per Member. <Col N="1743" /> It does, however, result in something of an improvement in the boundary line between the constituencies and in somewhat more logical polling arrangements for the two townlands concerned.  So that, from that point of view, I suppose it is acceptable although it is not quite in the spirit of what is intended by the constitutional provision but I am prepared to accept it as an improvement from the point of view of practical constituencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> On this Stage I should like to make a few general remarks about the Bill.  In the first place, I should like to say that we consider the Bill as it now stands, as it is leaving this House, to be a bad bit of legislation.  We consider that, instead of presenting the best possible scheme of constituencies, the Minister has done his best, and has succeeded to a very large extent, to produce the worst and most absurd scheme of constituencies that it is possible to produce.</P>
      <P>We had here last year a very long debate on electoral reform in which one of the major arguments put forward by the Minister for Local Government and the other Government spokesmen was that it was undesirable to breach county boundaries, that, as a matter of fact, it was fundamentally wrong to breach county boundaries and that in order to avoid unnecessary breaching of county boundaries we should change our entire method of election to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party in the House during that debate made the case that under the Constitution as it then stood and as it still stands the breaching of county boundaries on any large scale <Col N="1744" /> was unnecessary in order to implement the provisions of the Constitution.  I said then and I still say that while I do not regard county boundaries as sacred or as something that cannot under any circumstances be interfered with, it is a matter of commonsense that they should not be unnecessarily interfered with.</P>
    <P>One would have thought, therefore, that the Minister in drafting this Bill would have done so in a way that would disturb the least possible number of county boundaries and that would necessitate the transference of the minimum number of people from one county to another.  What do we find? We find that the Minister has transferred 17 portions of counties out of their existing county boundaries into others and in doing that has interfered with nine counties and has transferred approximately 100,000 people.  It has been demonstrated to him that that was quite unnecessary, that it was necessary to interfere with only six counties, to breach six county boundaries and in the process of doing that he would have to move only 41,000 people, approximately one per cent.</P>
    <P>Why did the Minister do as he has done?  Why did he move 100,000 people when the transference of 40,000 would do?  If he were acting in pursuance of the principles enunciated by him in the debate on the proposal to change the Constitution he certainly would have moved the minimum number of people.  We find that he did not do that, that he went to the other extreme and transferred as many people as he could or, at least, many more people than he might have.</P>
    <P>One can only come to the conclusion that the Minister had an ulterior motive for that and that that ulterior motive was to gain political advantage, or to try to gain political advantage, for his own Party.  I deplore the effort of the Minister in the Bill as it now stands to gain political advantage for his own Party.  It is immaterial whether he succeeds or not&mdash;I do not believe he will and I have made that clear all along &mdash;but in setting out on his campaign he has inconvenienced a great number of people; he has, indeed, inconvenienced a great number of Deputies both of his own Party and of other <Col N="1745" /> Parties, for what he believes to be the political advantage of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>The next thing that is obvious here is that there is not a uniform pattern throughout the Bill.  One would have thought that it should be possible on reading the Bill to determine what the Minister had in mind when he set out to draft the constituencies.  Did he believe in large multi-member constituencies or did he believe in the smallest possible constituency?  We will find that he did not proceed on recognised principles in this respect.  We simply find that where he thought it suited himself and his Party to have three-member constituencies, for example, he has them.  In any part of the country where he thinks that his Party in the past did fairly well, and might expect to get 50 per cent or more of the votes, he goes all out for three-member constituencies.</P>
    <P>That is quite apparent in the new three constituencies of Galway where before there was a five-member constituency. The Minister has abolished the five-member constituency and the three-member constituency, and of course if he was to treat the County of Galway on its merits he would have in the Bill seven Deputies for the county, a four-member constituency and a three-member constituency, because the population has fallen considerably in Galway over the last 30 years.  In round figures it has fallen by nearly 20,000 yet we find a glaring example of an effort by the Minister to gain an unfair advantage for his Party because although the County Galway as a unit should suffer a loss of a seat because of a fall in population, and because of that fall in population the representation should fall from eight to seven Members, the natural thing would be to have a three-member and a four-member constituency but instead the Minister injects a bit of Clare into Galway and provides three three-member constituencies.</P>
    <P>That is a classic example of what the Minister set out to do.  We have the same in Donegal.  Donegal is not now entitled to six Deputies as it was for the Minister unnecessarily grabs a bit <Col N="1746" /> of Leitrim and puts it into Donegal which he regards as a safe constituency although the referendum results really presented it as a marginal constituency. However, the Minister is a man of hope; he hopes that things might be the same again in the next election and he provides for all three-member constituencies, hoping that in each of the Galway constituencies he will get two out of three, which he will not, and hoping the same will happen in Donegal.  Next we have Clare, which was a four-member constituency and which the Minister could have retained as a four-member constituency, but instead he sends a bit of it to Galway and then we have the three-member constituency again.  Roscommon he reduces to a three-member constituency and brings in a bit of Westmeath, surrounding the Minister for Education, to provide a three-member constituency there.</P>
    <P>That is the pattern all over the West where the Minister thinks he will benefit by the three-member constituencies. That would be understandable if that pattern projected itself throughout the entire country.  We could say: &ldquo;Well, because the Minister did not get away with abolishing proportional representation and he still believes that PR is not a good system, he wants to neutralise it as much as he can and reduce its effectiveness as much as he can.&rdquo;  We would be justified in saying that and the Minister would have an argument although we might not believe it.  We come then to the populous areas of the city of Dublin, and in and around it, where the Minister knows that he is on the run, if he has not actually departed, and he opts there for four-member constituencies where before we had three-member constituencies and some five-member constituencies. It is well known that in an area where the Minister can get 51 per cent or near it in a three-member constituency, he thinks he will get two out of three seats.  It is also known that it is very difficult for any Party to get more than two out of four seats in a four-member constituency and that it takes much fewer votes for the weaker Party to get two out of four in a four-member constituency under PR.  Of <Col N="1747" /> course, the Minister knows that because he has made more than a study of this matter.  As I say, all around Dublin we have had the constituencies carved up in order to suit the Minister and his Party.</P>
    <P>This is a bad Bill, a Bill which has set out to provide not a fair scheme of constituencies but a scheme which is unfair, unjust and calculated to give advantage to one political Party.  That is what the Minister set out to do but I do not think he will succeed.  He is not a good judge.  However, it is our business to expose this effort, and I only regard it as an effort.  It simply will not work because I would not regard the Minister as being an authority on how the people are thinking. In the very recent past he has been proved to be completely out of touch with public opinion and public thought on matters of importance.  That was very definitely demonstrated in the referendum.  This is a type of Bill that would never have been recommended by any sort of impartial or independent advisory body.  There can be no doubt about that.  All on this side of the House are against it while the Minister's Party are in favour of it.  As far as we can interpret public opinion through leading articles in newspapers, it is regarded by independent thought as an absurd piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>This is a measure that affects every Party and most Deputies in the House and, indeed, all the people of the country in a personal way.  Yet the Minister blames us, abuses and ballyrags us for daring to debate, or trying to get him to debate, it in a reasonable way.  It is a measure which should be capable of substantial amendment, a type of measure that should be brought into the House, if fair play is to prevail and democracy to succeed, as a sort of skeleton.  The Minister should be prepared to discuss it within reason but we have had no worthwhile amendment accepted by the Minister.  The Minister wanted to block any amendment. He tried to prevent the Report Stage and so ensure that no amendments would be put down.  I emphasise that we used Committee Stage, as we are entitled to use it, to get the Minister's <Col N="1748" /> views and thoughts on the Schedule, constituency by constituency. Having done that, we intimated that we wanted to put down amendments and substantial amendments and we had to have a battle royal to get a Report Stage that would be worth-while. When we did get it, yesterday and today, the Minister simply refused to take part in it.  He said&mdash;he will not disagree with me or be offended if I use his own words&mdash;that he was not going to take part in this farce.  He stood up and left the House, I think. I do not know what he was at, but my opinion is that he was arranging constituencies in a more personal way. That is how this measure was treated in the House.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that some constituencies had to suffer; at least some of them needed altering.  Everybody takes County Leitrim because it is a county that has received the most amazing treatment.  The population of Leitrim fell between 1936&mdash;I am giving the Minister the benefit of the doubt by taking 1936&mdash;and 1966 by 20,336. Therefore, it was obvious that it had to get support in order to be entitled to representation.  The case was made here by every Deputy interested in the constituencies, other than the Fianna Fáil Deputies, that Leitrim should have been amalgamated with Sligo.  The only Deputy who spoke against that was Deputy Gallagher and, fair play to him, the strongest case he put up was to say that the Minister's scheme was as good as any other.  It was not as reasonable as any other scheme.  It should go on record, too, that between 1936 and 1966 the population of Roscommon dropped by 21,338.  In the same period the population of Cavan which is affected by this Bill dropped by 22,640.  In the same period the population of Monaghan dropped by 15,557.</P>
    <P>The population of Mayo fell between 1936 and 1966 by 45,802.  Those are only a few constituencies taken at random. They demonstrate the failure of Fianna Fáil policy during those years. I could&mdash;and the Minister well knows this&mdash;go through the Schedule to this Bill section by section and item by item and county by county and remain within the Rules of Order and talk <Col N="1749" /> here until 10.30 tonight if my object was, as the Minister alleges, simply to delay the passage of the measure through the House and to obstruct. When I sat down, several of my colleagues could get up and discuss the Schedule item by item from their own angles and remain within the Rules of Order if our object was to obstruct and delay.</P>
    <P>I consider that we in this Party have discharged our obligations and duties to the House and to the country in regard to this Bill on Second Stage&mdash; during which it got a reasonable discussion &mdash; on Committee Stage and on Report Stage which we had to extract from the Minister and his Party.  We have demonstrated that the Minister introduced the Bill in bad faith; that he was committed before that to introducing an electoral monstrosity and absurdity.  He has succeeded.  I am satisfied the people of the country who have followed the debate are by now satisfied that is what the Minister set have followed the debate are by now satisfied that is what the Minister set out to do and what he succeeded in doing I do not think that is an unreasonable assertion by me because I know, and the House knows, that during the debate on the Third and Fourth Amendments of the Constitution the Minister went on record <i>ad nauseam</i> as saying that no one could prepare reasonable constituencies under the Constitution as it stood without the tolerance he sought, a tolerance which would give him the right to decree that, while as few as 16,000 would qualify for a Deputy in one area, it would take 24,000 to qualify in another.  The Minister committed himself and his Party to the proposition that the Constitution needed amendment and that, if it were not amended, he could not produce a reasonable scheme of constituencies.</P>
    <P>On the Second Stage of this Bill I posed a question to the Minister.  I posed that question again on the Committee Stage and now I shall pose it once more: why did the Minister for Local Government, committed to the proposition I have just outlined, take on himself the task he had already said was impossible?  One would have thought that in such circumstances the Minister would have said to his Taoiseach: &ldquo;Look, I am too much <Col N="1750" /> involved in the controversy which has gone on over this.  My views are too well known.  I have already committed myself by saying that the present system is unworkable.  Please do not ask me to do the impossible because, even if I were to do my best, what I did would not be accepted by the people as an honest effort.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The result of the referendum was hardly known when the Minister for Local Government rolled up his sleeves and went baldheaded for this task.  I remember on a debate here&mdash; it was, I think, on a motion of no confidence&mdash;the Minister tore himself away from his office to come down here and make a contribution.  I remember that he started off by saying that, unfortunately, he had not been in the House during the debate because he was concerning himself in his office with such important matters&mdash; that is how he described them in his own sarcastic way&mdash;as the number of babies born in the maternity hospitals in Dublin on 14th September&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He was, he said, concerning himself with the number of babies born in maternity hospitals in Dublin, the number of criminals in prison, the number of sailors in the port of Dublin and the number of guests in the various hotels throughout the country.  Now, that was the frame of mind in which the Minister sat down to draft this measure and that is why it is such a bad measure.  The Minister sat down to ridicule the Constitution, to make fun of the task given to him and to demonstrate to the people&mdash; in particular, to the Opposition in this House&mdash;that he was right and we and they were wrong.  The sovereign people were wrong to the tune of 250,000 votes on 16th October, 1968.  That is why we have got this bad Bill.  The Minister had a double-edged, ulterior motive in drafting it.  He wanted, first of all, to belittle proportional representation and that wise provision in the Constitution which says that, by and large, allowing for mountains and <Col N="1751" /> lakes and rivers and county boundaries, and so on, the same number of persons will qualify for a TD in one part of the country as will qualify in another part of the country.

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> In submitting I think it was 19 amendments <Col N="1753" /> to this Electoral Bill, I was actuated by certain ideas and principles which appear to have been completely foreign to the Minister's mind.  I was at pains to draft amendments which would improve, in my opinion at any rate, the Bill presented to the House by the Minister.  I was actuated primarily by a desire to ensure that population transfers outside county boundaries would be kept as low as possible.  I now find that the Minister still agrees with me that this is a desirable objective.  He still holds the opinion in that regard which he held before the referendum.  I find it hard to reconcile his opinion in that respect with what he has done in this Bill.</P>
      <P>My personal belief is that counties should not be fragmented and that each county should stand on its own, or at least be joined completely or almost completely to another county.  The transfer of areas with populations of the dimensions of 10,000, 11,000, 12,000 or 13,000 is not desirable.  Such transfers are not large enough to provide political viability, but they are large enough to cause considerable distress to the people who are transferred. If a population area of that size is joined to another county, particularly if it is to a large unit, a four- or five-seater, it cannot be expected to provide any measure of broad spectrum representation for the people transferred. Such a transferred area is likely to become a mere annexe to the main constituency certainly so far as Fine Gael and Labour are concerned.  The fact that such a transferred area, either fortuitously or by deliberate tailoring, may occasionally elect a Fianna Fáil Deputy, may satisfy the Minister or Fianna Fáil, but it is not democratic representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, therefore, take the view that when these transfers outside county boundaries are being made&mdash;as they have to be made under our constitutional position&mdash;one should endeavour to transfer at most only four or five district electoral divisions.  It will occasionally arise that a whole county may have to be transferred, where you get a constituency consisting of two counties.  In that case where a whole county, or 90 per cent of a county, is transferred that transferred county may be expected <Col N="1754" /> to provide a degree of political viability on its own, and the amount of stress arising from the transfer is not great.  There have been examples of that throughout the years.  For instance, we have Laois-Offaly and Carlow-Kilkenny and there do not appear to have been many complaints arising as a result.</P>
    <P>The amendments which I submitted dealt with three different groups: the eastern group, the western group and the southern group.  They were discussed on that basis.  So far as Report Stage is concerned, the amendments dealing with the southern group were ruled out of order as they had already been discussed at an earlier stage, and the Ceann Comhairle decided that the amendments submitted for Report Stage were not substantially different from those discussed earlier.  At any rate, they were adequately discussed and voted on.  We have had a vote on the amendments that referred to the eastern complex of constituencies.  We have discussed the western areas.</P>
    <P>To summarise, as regards the eastern areas embracing the counties of Cavan, Monaghan, Louth, Kildare and Kilkenny, the amendments which I submitted proposed that there would be two three-seaters, one four-seater and two five-seaters, giving 20 seats in all.  The Minister proposes for this area five three-seaters and one five-seater, again, 20 seats in all.  The proposals which I offered envisaged Cavan-Monaghan as a five-seater, Meath as a three-seater, Louth as a four-seater, Carlow-Kildare as a five-seater and Kilkenny as a three-seater.  The Minister's proposal is to make them all three-seaters with the exception of Carlow-Kilkenny which he proposes should be a five-seater.</P>
    <P>Under the amendments submitted by me, the transfer of population would be much smaller than under the system envisaged by the Minister.  If the amendments I submitted were adopted, there would be a transfer of 6,640 persons from Meath to Louth.  There would be no further breach of any county boundary.  That would be the total transfer of population, consisting of the transfer of five district electoral divisions from Meath to Louth.  On the other hand, the Minister's proposal <Col N="1755" /> envisages the butchering of several counties.  In fact, there will be five breaches of county boundaries under the Minister's system in this Bill, involving a transfer of 29,053 persons. That is a figure of 6,640 as against 29,053.  That is a summary of the position as regards the eastern counties.</P>
    <P>When we come to the western counties, the position here is even worse. I have submitted eight amendments which, if adopted, would mean three breaches of county boundaries.  Tagh-boy-Ahascragh: 953 persons to be transferred from there to Roscommon; 5,642 persons to be transferred from Leitrim to South Donegal and 2,805 persons to be transferred from Galway to Clare.  That is a total transfer of 9,400 persons.  The Minister's proposals involve eight breaches of constituency boundaries and a total transfer of 59,274 persons.  The Minister's proposals would give us ten three-seat constituencies.</P>
    <P>The proposals I have submitted would mean six three-seat constituencies and three four-seat constituencies. It would leave Donegal intact.  It would leave Mayo intact.  It would leave Roscommon intact.  It would leave Clare intact.  There would be two breaches of Galway county.  It is a big county.  The population transfer there would be small.  Furthermore, there would be no interference with West Athlone Urban.  Most important of all. it would leave the greater part of Leitrim intact as a political unit&mdash;admittedly, joined with Sligo, it represents a small movement of population.  With a little over 5,000 persons transferred to Donegal and the remainder joined with Sligo, 25,000 persons in Leitrim would give them some measure of political viability as compared with what will arise now with the division of Leitrim in three parts&mdash;an unnecessarily large part going to Donegal, another middle section going to Sligo and a southern section going to Roscommon. These constituencies, thus divided, would mean: Donegal North, three seats; Donegal South, three seats; Sligo/Leitrim, four seats; Roscommon, three seats; Clare, four seats; Galway East, four seats; Galway West, three seats and Mayo two three-seaters.  That <Col N="1756" /> is the same number of seats&mdash;30 seats &mdash;and instead of giving the Minister's proposal of ten three-seaters it means six three-seaters and three four-seaters. It would provide a far better population distribution.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in respect of the southern part of the country, the proposals which I submitted to the House were: 3,136 persons would be transferred from South Tipperary and East Cork to Waterford; 2,413 persons would be transferred from South Tipperary and 723 persons would be transferred from East Cork so as to provide, in Waterford, a four-seat constituency and allow the return of the 10,749 persons from West Waterford back to Waterford. The total transfer of population under that scheme, and taking in, now, and accepting the Minister's transfer from Cork to Kerry, would, under my amendment, be 5,260 and, under the Minister's scheme, 12,773.  There would be three breaches of county boundaries in what I propose to do.  There would be two breaches in county boundaries in what the Minister has in his Bill. Therefore, from every aspect, whether we tot up the breaching of county boundaries or whether we take it as population transfers, all the amendments I have submitted would give a better picture and would give a fairer and more equitable distribution of population than what is provided for in the Minister's Bill.</P>
    <P>Clearly, what I submitted here is entirely objective.  It has no political overtones.  It has been devised merely with a view to preserving, as far as possible, a fair and equitable distribution of population; to preserving, as far as possible, local authority boundaries and to providing, as far as possible, that it would be coterminous with Dáil representation, which is an important matter from an administrative point of view and from the point of view of a public representative who, so often, particularly in rural Ireland, is also a local county councillor.</P>
    <P>Taking the position of the three areas covered by my amendments, the eastern part, the western part and the southern part, the total transfer of population by the Minister in this Bill outside the county boundaries is 101,100 persons. The amendments I have submitted and <Col N="1757" /> which the Minister has rejected would provide for a transfer of only 21,200 persons for the entire country: his figure is 101,100.  The amendments I have submitted would provide for a transfer of people outside their boundaries of 21,200.</P>

      <P>This was to enable them to attend to their Dáil duties.  We had this whole session, on this Bill and other Bills, a few Fine Gael Deputies keeping business artificially going until such time as Deputy L'Estrange could succeed in getting a reasonably respectable number of his Deputies to come here so that he could have a division. Today he failed.  He could not get enough to keep it going until after 6 o'clock and so we could not have any more divisions on Report Stage. Deputy Hogan got his instructions from Deputy Fitzpatrick to conduct this delaying operation on the Fifth Stage instead.</P>
      <P>That, of course, is one of the reasons for the delay.  The other is the obvious one that Fine Gael feel that they require more time to solve their own differences before facing the electorate and believing that the election cannot be held until this Electoral Bill eventually gets through the two Houses of the Oireachtas and apparently not having as much confidence as they normally have in the delaying potentiality of the Seanad the idea was to delay it as long as possible here.</P>
      <P>This Bill arises not from any desire, as has been alleged, on the part of me or anybody else in the Fianna Fáil Party to rearrange constituencies and to butcher counties for the benefit of Fianna Fáil or this other motive that has been imputed of demonstrating to the people the absurdity of the present constitutional position, but arises because of the existing constitutional position which was established as a result of an appeal by the Fine Gael Party to the courts.  A decision was reached as a result of this action taken by the Fine Gael Party in the courts and the decision was endorsed by the people in the recent referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is completely wrong to suggest, as Deputy Fitzpatrick has suggested, that the Fianna Fáil Party thought this question of the desirability of avoiding the breaching of county boundaries so important that we proposed to change the electoral system in order to avoid it.  Deputy Fitzpatrick knows that that <Col N="1762" /> is not so at all, that there were two distinct and separate proposals put to the people, again at the request of the Fine Gael Party, and that the proposal to change the electoral system was in no way involved with the question of avoiding the breaching of county boundaries.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, and more satisfied than ever after having heard the debate on this Bill, that the proposals put forward in the Bill are the most reasonable ones that could be put forward in the circumstances.  I do not claim to have examined every one of the very many possible alternative schemes that could be produced, but I am satisfied that nobody else has produced a scheme of constituencies that would involve less disturbance of the people from their traditional patterns of representation and less disturbance of the existing lay-outs of constituencies than the proposals I have put forward in this Bill.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann welcomes the statements of the Minister for Local Government that land buying and high profits had put burdens on the home-seeker; that the private sector must not unduly exploit the social needs and that while reasonable returns to landowners are acceptable it is inequitable that house prices should be unnecessarily inflated through individuals making exorbitant and totally unearned profits from the community's investment; and calls upon the Government to take steps, if necessary, by the introduction of amending legislation to enable immediate effect to be given to the principles contained in these statements.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy M. O'Leary.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>While nobody in the House will disagree with the broad statements in the motion, one must examine the arguments put forward in support of it.  I listened here last night <Col N="1763" /> to Deputy O'Leary of the Labour Party talking about this issue, and he seemed to imply that the urban housing drive was held up because of the scarcity of land.  The supply of land anywhere is limited, but even under existing legislation a worth-while local authority can take steps which will curb the activities of the speculators and, at the same time, give adequate but not exorbitant compensation to the <i>bona fide</i> owner of land, the man of good intention.</P>
      <P>We who believe in free enterprise and free negotiation will uphold the principle that we should pay a just price for land or any other commodity. Of course, people are attracted to buy land in order to make quick money, but they do the same with other commodities as well.  I am glad to say that the Dublin city manager has acted in such a manner that he has been able to build up a pool of land which will enable the Dublin Corporation and, indeed, the county council, to provide in an ordered way and at an accelerated rate dwellings for those people in the city and county who need them.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary seemed to think this scarcity of land was a great barrier to the progress of the housing drive.  This is not so.  I saw a communication from a person in Moscow about two years ago.  The man who wrote it was not a critic of the regime, and I am not being critical of that regime, but he said: &ldquo;They will never overtake the housing problem here.&rdquo;  Do not forget that the Moscow equivalent of our city council has confiscated land, nationalised banks and regimented workers; yet they have a housing problem.  In any living city there will be a housing problem, because nobody has yet invented instant housing.  Until such time as somebody does invent instant housing the provision of housing will be a matter of toil, tears and sweat.  When we face the housing problem in that light and realise the difficulties which are there, we shall get round to solving it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Never before in the history of the country, or of the city, anyway, have we made such progress as under the present Minister and his immediate predecessor. <Col N="1764" /> Even today if we had another 500,000 acres of land we could not build one extra house because, in the words of the Dublin city manager, we are taking all the dwellings the building trade can give us at the moment.</P>
    <P>Thank God, we are not short of money nor are we short of land, but I do agree with the mover of the motion that we must be vigilant in the matter of land and we must also be fair.  Not so long ago a Labour member of Dublin Corporation had an article published in which he advocated the confiscating of land for building.  He was probably playing to the gallery. We do not stand for the confiscation of land; we believe that adequate compensation should be paid for land.  Nor do we believe in anybody making exorbitant profits on it.  The point I am trying to make is that under existing legislation a local authority can acquire for itself all the land it needs for its housing drive.  It is very easy for a local authority, if it requires land for housing or any other purposes, to apply a compulsory purchase order to that land.  It is a democratic way of doing things.  We cannot afford to let people live in hovels because somebody owns the land, but, at the same time there must be compensation for the person who owns the land.  In their wisdom the Government have set up a procedure whereby a local authority can apply a compulsory purchase order to land which is required for housing.  It goes to arbitration and in all cases the owners get fair compensation, and this is as it should be.  If the Minister thinks they are not getting fair compensation he has the solution in his hands.</P>
    <P>For every one of the many people who are on the housing waiting lists, whether it is in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Waterford or Limerick, the problem is much the same.  The price of land will influence the price of the housing, just the same as the price of labour, bricks, mortar or slates will influence it; they all enter into the price of the house.  But the local authorities can again help.  Dublin Corporation, of which I am a member, have given to young couples who want to provide their own houses, free fully-serviced sites which have cost the rate-paying public about £700.  We <Col N="1765" /> have package deals with two of the large builders in the city, which will give us immediately about 2,000 houses.</P>
    <P>When the former Minister, Deputy Blaney, wanted to get the Ballymun housing project under way, he was faced with all kinds of problems.  He was faced with people saying the land could not be acquired, could not be drained and so on.  But he pushed very hard, and this year will see the completion of the original Ballymun project. Now we are going to extend it, despite all the handicaps we had to overcome.  We will have 3,000 families living there in very good conditions because the Minister at the time was not afraid to face difficulties and to use the powers which still exist to acquire the land to get this great project, one of the biggest single housing projects in Europe, under way.</P>
    <P>When looking at this motion here I read into it a searching for an excuse as to why we are not building more houses.  I am disappointed we are not building more dwellings, but the point is we have to find the people to build them.  We are faced with the fact that neither land scarcity nor lack of finance is holding up house-building. The building trade is working to full capacity.  If they were able to work at a higher capacity we could produce more houses.  If we could produce 100,000 acres and £1 billion in the morning it would not give us one more dwelling than we are getting at the moment.  At the same time, I share with the movers of the motion that little bit of uneasiness as to what might happen unless we are vigilant.  On the other hand, you have got this guarantee against exploiters in the various Housing Acts and Local Government Acts, which prevents them acquiring some land, but you cannot control the price.</P>
    <P>Some years ago there were speculators who used to buy land in the next field to a Dublin Corporation housing scheme.  They got drainage at very low prices.  The fact that Dublin Corporation had built there increased the price of their land, but since that time we have taken steps to curb the activities of those gentlemen.  Some of them have got their fingers burnt.  In Dublin Corporation we stand for fair <Col N="1766" /> compensation for land.  We will ensure this and there should be no such thing as confiscation of land.</P>
    <P>It is not very easy to acquire land for housing, particularly in the older parts of an area where there is house clearance.  There are people who claim rights over many years and who hold up the acquisition of that land. In Sarah Place, Islandbridge, we were faced not alone with landlords but with disruptive elements who sought to prevent Dublin Corporation taking over this area.  This was a place which the British Army built to house their horses.  The disruptive elements came along and threw themselves on the ground outside those houses to prevent the corporation taking them over. Despite all this the corporation went ahead and the flats are now under construction on that site.  We decry the fact that there are unscrupulous landlords who hold on to land and impede the housing programme, but there are those disruptive people who are quite vicious and who deprive people of housing as much as they can.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that in the city council all Parties are determined to overcome all obstacles to the housing problem.  In conclusion, I should like to say that land scarcity, although it is a factor is not the overriding one in the housing shortage in the city.  We will make every endeavour to acquire as much land as we can and to complete our housing programme as soon as we can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> In so far as the subject matter of this motion affects the price of houses and makes it more difficult for married couples to house themselves at a reasonable cost, we regard the motion as very important.  There is no doubt but that the provision of building sites affects in a very material way the cost of building.  It even decides, in certain cases, whether a person seeking a house can build one or not.  It certainly decides where the person is going to build a house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government is quoted here as stating that land buying and high profits have put burdens <Col N="1767" /> on the home seeker, that the private sector must not unduly exploit the social needs and that, while reasonable returns to landowners are acceptable, it is inequitable that house prices should unnecessarily be inflated through individuals making exorbitant and totally unearned profits from the community's investment.  Those words are attributed to the Minister for Local Government and I believe he made that statement.  I also believe he made it a considerable time ago.  I should like to know what he has done to implement those sentiments since.</P>
    <P>My own opinion is that the racket in the speculation of land went on up to ten years ago and that any steps or any talk on the part of the Minister for Local Government is now ten years too late.  The problem here, of course, is not just land.  It is a particular type of land; it is serviced land.  A person cannot build a house on any plot of land.  That land must have water and sewerage facilities laid on and that is where the racket has been going on in the past.  Everybody knows in and around the City of Dublin certain well informed, perhaps improperly informed, speculators anticipated the servicing of land, got in on the ground floor and made fantastic fortunes.  That cannot be denied.  It is well known it happened in and around this city.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Fine Gael Party are concerned, we believe in private ownership and we believe in private enterprise. At the same time, we believe an essential commodity like building land should be available to those who want to build houses, but that fair, reasonable compensation should be paid for it. I had better clarify what I mean by fair, reasonable compensation.  I mean the agricultural value of the land plus what I will describe as a reasonable location profit.  I leave out reasonable location value.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore has spoken and he seemed to confine his remarks almost entirely to the needs of the public housing authority.  I believe that those needs are very important and must be met but, by and large, I believe that there is adequate machinery at the disposal of housing authorities to acquire <Col N="1768" /> land and to compensate the owners for it if they go about it in the right way and if the machinery of the Planning Act is operated in a fair way.  The local authority have compulsory acquisition powers and the arbitration fixes a reasonable price.  If the local authorities acquire land before it is serviced, as I think they should, there is no danger of an unreasonable price being charged but the section that, to my mind, needs protection is the private sector.</P>
    <P>These are the people in the modest income group who want to build their own houses and who are very often held up to ransom in more ways than one.  Either they cannot get a site because it is not serviced or they are compelled to deal with one or two builders who have acquired the building land in the locality and they must deal with those builders at the builder's prices.  That is what is wrong.</P>
    <P>A lot of this abuse could be eliminated if enough land in and around cities and, indeed, in and around towns of modest size, was properly serviced by the local authorities under the direction of the Minister for Local Government. If there was an adequate amount of land serviced, the prices would not be so high.  I would also go a long way with the proposition that housing authorities or local authorities should buy by voluntary agreement or, if necessary, acquire suitable building land adjacent to towns before it is serviced, that they should then service it and that they, in turn, should make these sites available to prospective purchasers or builders at a reasonable price.  That is not an unreasonable proposition.</P>
    <P>I find that the person who has the most difficulty in getting a site is the private individual who wants to build his house.  The simple reason for this is, as I say, the fact of the land not being serviced.  I know that it will be said by the Parliamentary Secretary that local authorities have been notified and authorised to buy land in anticipation of their housing requirements and even to lease it out but I find that these small local authorities do not get the necessary financial assistance from the Department of Local Government or from the Department of Finance.  It is a <Col N="1769" /> fact that if a local authority acts on that advice and buys the land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Yes, I have had such experience.  As I was saying, if a small local authority buy a few acres of land and come back to the Department of Local Government to obtain sanction for a loan they will be told that they cannot get a loan from the Local Loans Fund until such time as the building has actually been started.  If a person buys land in anticipation of his housing needs he will have to finance the purchase himself on a short-term loan from the bank or some such place at a high rate of interest and at a quick repayment rate which means that the cost of the loan is pretty high.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary seems to disagree with that but I think that that is so.  I understand that it is only possible to get Local Loan Fund accommodation after the building has been started.  I believe this to be a major problem around every small town in Ireland and I can speak of that from personal experience.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The lack of sites.  I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating the private sector, those in the modest income group&mdash;the white-collar workers and so on &mdash; who are willing and anxious to buy their own houses if they are given proper facilities and, indeed, if I had my way I should be inclined to go further in subsidising interest for them because it would be money well spent.  It would encourage people who are living in local authority houses to buy their own houses; it would relieve local authorities of the cost of repairing houses and, generally, it would lead to a quicker solution of the housing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I mention the private sector I do not mean the wealthy private sector who build palatial houses in the <Col N="1770" /> £10,000 to £12,000 class.  I mean those people who are buying houses at between £3,000 and £4,000 and buying them at a pinch.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> It is about the purchasers I am talking. I am talking about the man of modest means who buys a house in which he himself will live.  The Parliamentary Secretary is well aware that were it not for the sacrifices made by these people, the housing situation in this country, bad and all as it is, would be infinitely worse; it would be unthinkable.</P>
      <P>As I have said, this is a major problem in and around the city of Dublin. This problem is created, first of all, because land is not serviced and because some people seem to be inspired when land will be serviced and they buy it up and charge excessive prices for it.  That practice should be stopped and I would go a long way with anybody who says that if a local authority want to acquire that land&mdash; Deputy Moore spoke about confiscation; one does not accuse the Land Commission of confiscating land and one does not accuse local authorities of confiscating land; one only confiscates land when one takes it from people and does not give them a fair return for it&mdash;let it be a housing body or a board, they should be given power to purchase land at a reasonable price and if they cannot get it at a reasonable price and it is needed for housing, to acquire it at reasonable prices, service it and sell it to those genuinely requiring land to provide them with houses.  That is a reasonable proposition.  The Labour Party put down this motion.  I do not think Deputy O'Leary suggested any tangible solution.  He deplored racketeering but he did not provide any solution.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> They can purchase for their own needs <Col N="1771" /> but they cannot avail of the Local Loans Fund.  Another thing which I think has led to unjust profits for lands in and around the city of Dublin is the operation of the Planning Act and the system of planning appeals.  If a person knows that he has sufficient influence to get planning authority he can buy land and then make a fantastic profit on it.  If the Fine Gael suggestion for handling planning appeals under an independent board had been accepted that is one part of the racket which would have been removed. The Minister for Local Government has, somewhere on this Order Paper, a measure to amend the planning machinery and the planning appeals but he has not yet circulated the Bill.  It is like a number of other Bills that have gone on the Order Paper and have not even got a First Reading.  Some of them had a First Reading but we have not seen them. There is the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1969.  The Second Stage is fixed.  The Bill has not been circulated.  I wonder is it really an acceptance of the Planning Appeals Bill which I put down and which the Government refused to accept and which I put down for a second time?  It has not come up.</P>
      <P>I believe that if there was a proper system of planning appeals and an adequate amount of land serviced much of the abuse could be avoided and eliminated.  Furthermore, if that does not eliminate the abuses I am quite agreeable to proper machinery being in existence.  Deputy Tully says such machinery is in existence.  Certainly, if it is in existence it is like the machinery that has broken down through the maintenance strike and is not in operation.  If it is not in operation it should be put into operation to provide land for the private sector.  So far as rural Ireland is concerned I do not mind providing land in job lots for 100, 50 or 60 houses.  I would even provide land for smaller numbers of houses.  If a person wanted a site to build his own house it should be available to him at a reasonable price.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Moore has had to leave <Col N="1772" /> because he said one or two things with which I join issue.  He made an allegation to the effect that a member of the Labour group of the Corporation of Dublin had advocated the confiscation of land.  To be clear as to what those words mean, I would take it that he meant that if somebody had land and if a particular member of the corporation wanted this land it could be taken from him and no compensation whatever paid.  I take leave to doubt whether any member of the corporation made that statement.  I feel that Deputy Moore has been put under a misapprehension or he is doing something I am loath to believe he would do, which is to misrepresent the facts.  I believe other members of the Party are quite capable of misrepresentation of facts but I do not think Deputy Moore would do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not referring to my esteemed colleague on the council at all.  We feel there should be fair compensation for land acquired by the local authority.  Much of the discussion on this matter seems to me to avoid the point which the movers of the motion are driving at.  So far as I can recollect, this motion was put down almost two years ago.  It was put down shortly after the arrival of the present incumbent in the Custom House and shortly after a public statement made by him and made, I believe, with a purpose, that people who owned land and held out for extraordinarily high prices were acting in an anti-social fashion and that the local authorities should purchase land and build up reserves of land for future use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was putting the blame for high prices on landowners.  He was putting the blame upon people who were large farmers or something approaching farmers.  That is not where the responsibility for the high prices of serviced land lies.  The people responsible for the high cost of land in and around Dublin are the speculative builders.  These people have been competing with each other and have driven <Col N="1773" /> the price of land up to such an extent that it is like handfuls of gold now in certain areas around the city with the result that some can build estates where they advertise in the evening papers gracious living at £7,000 and £8,000 per house.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the Minister was dissembling on that occasion and it was an effort on his part to conceal where the real problem lies in regard to the high price of land.  It was caused by the activities of these <i>entrepreneurs</i>, these middlemen, who have been acquiring land at extraordinarily high prices.  In one instance £27,000 was paid for an acre of land on Rochestown Avenue.  That land was for building development.  It was previously used for some horticultural or agricultural purpose.  The high cost of land inevitably shows itself in the high price of houses because the speculative builder is not worried by the price of the land. All he has to do is to pay for the land and he has no worry at all.  There is a vast sellers' market with people on their knees for housing and he can get what price he likes to charge from these unfortunate people so he passes along the cost, the exorbitant and robbing cost of land, to the eventual purchaser who is such a person as has been referred to by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  This class mainly consists of young people about to get married or who are recently married, people who have made every sacrifice they possibly could in order to save&mdash;who have done without entertainments, without cigarettes, without pictures, who have saved every available halfpenny in order to amass the deposit to put down on a house, very often a substandard quality house in so far as building is concerned, in order to put down the deposit on a home of their own.</P>
    <P>They are the real victims, and very worthy people they are for having made the effort, but they are being exploited, have been exploited.  Indeed, what has gone on in this connection and what is going on is there for all to see.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation decided they would provide houses for purchase and it is in the process of this that houses are being built by the corporation in the Tallaght district.  Houses have <Col N="1774" /> already been provided on the other side of the city, at Artane.  Dublin Corporation have found it economically possible to offer these houses to prospective purchasers for a deposit of £150.  What is the position in relation to the deposit demanded by the speculative builder, the merchant who is responsible for the high price of land? As a rule, the deposit is something in the region of £500 to £700.  Dublin Corporation can do it at £150.  The repayments that have to be made by these young couples, the house purchasers, when they move in usually range, in the speculative type house, in the neighbourhood of £5, £6 and £7 a week for the ordinary five-roomed house.  The corporation can provide that kind of house, or perhaps, something better, at approximately four guineas a week, including a sum for rates.  Does this not show clearly that there is profiteering on a vast scale in this industry?</P>
    <P>Fine Gael are at one with the Government, naturally.  Why would they not be?  They are the two conservative Parties and why would they not be together in this?  They say: &ldquo;We must not interfere, we cannot interfere with free competition.  We cannot interfere with profits.  We express a pious hope that there should not be undue profits&rdquo;.  However, when asked to do something concrete to make it possible for people to live, to make it possible for people to purchase houses within their income limits, this is waved to one side and all kinds of arguments are found to avoid doing it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore said&mdash;I could hardly believe my ears when I heard him say it&mdash;that never was such progress made in housing as under the administration of the present and the previous Ministers for Local Government.  This is a ridiculous statement.  I shall begin with the previous Minister.  Deputy Moore, perhaps, was not in the House at the time but I recall asking literally dozens of questions as to the prolonged and agonising delays at Ballymun in the provision of flats there.  It went on for years and years before we saw a single dwelling.  It went on interminably until we, the people of the city &mdash;I myself was in close contact day in <Col N="1775" /> day out with the housing situation in Dublin&mdash;had despaired of ever seeing any results at Ballymun.  How could that be termed progress by anybody?</P>
    <P>As far as the present Minister is concerned, his record is said by Deputy Moore to be greater than that of his predecessor.  The present Minister was not in the House, neither was Deputy Dowling, and I do not see anybody present in the Chamber who was in the House, when 30,000 dwellings were needed in the city of Dublin&mdash;not 10,000, not 5,000 or any of these now argued about figures, but 30,000&mdash;and when 23,000 houses were built in a period of nine to ten years it was under the much-abused first inter-Party administration.</P>
    <P>We had the good fortune to have in the Custom House a man now long gone to his reward who was dedicated to two things, the solution of the housing problem and total opposition to the Custom House and all its works and pomps.  He was a man who went into the Custom House, who took his seat in the Minister's chair and who was the Minister.  We have not had many such people.  As time goes on my observation has been that they become creatures of the machine.  The result is that the public suffer because the innate conservatism of the machine results in the slowing down of activity and brings things to a halt.</P>
    <P>Does anybody remember the inglorious administration of Deputy Smith as Minister for Local Government when, if you talked about housing, you were sneered at?  Let me say that the present Dublin Corporation, elected nearly two years ago, came into an inheritance of years of accumulated backlog which had not been attended to but which, we were told, was the result of credit squeezes and things like that.  The point is that the present corporation, the minute they came in, had to face a situation of bottleneck in housing, had to grapple with that bottleneck, and they have made some progress in all directions.  At least they have got a movement under way towards the provision of houses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore also spoke of a growing city, a living city and said that a <Col N="1776" /> growing city, a living city will never solve its housing problem.  I do not believe that.  I think it is the height of nonsense.  It will never solve it at the rate we have been going up to now because there has not been any coherent long-term housing plan as there should have been.  The provision of local authority housing in this country heretofore has been based on an examination from time to time of the situation as it existed on a particular day.  Then, there has been a long drawn out effort to meet the situation that existed on that day, ending with the provision of houses, perhaps, two or three years after that day and when the problem has multiplied itself.  What we need in the matter of housing is planning of such a kind as will meet future demand.  A living city needs, in order to get a solution, not just to meet the current demand but to meet the future demand.  We should always be building houses even though there may not be people in dire and urgent distress.  We hope to see that day and if Dublin Corporation has its way that day will not be long distant.  We should plan housing not only to meet any apparent housing problem but in order to meet the needs of the new generations, of the people who will be getting married in the future and the new families who will be coming into existence.  This is where governments and local authorities have fallen down.  Their approach has been limited.  The question needs to be re-examined and dealt with in the most energetic fashion.</P>
    <P>There was and there is a racket in house building.  The members of the Labour Party who put down this motion were concerned about that racket in so far as land prices are a factor in the price that must eventually be paid by the only people who pay anything, the working people.  Whether they work by their hand or by their brain, it is they who have to foot the bill for everything in this country in the heel of the hunt.  The Labour Party are concerned about this racket of land as handled by the speculative builder.</P>
    <P>Let us not be blinded by the suggestions made by the Minister that this was something solely attributable to the anti-social landowners as such. <Col N="1777" /> They were in the thing, too, but the speculative builder was the archcriminal in driving up the price of land and, therefore, the price of houses and in putting his hand deep into the pocket of the eventual house purchaser.</P>
    <P>How are these principles going to be put into effect?  Is it sufficient that a motion should be passed in the Dáil and nothing further done about it?  I do not think it is.  Why should we not control the price of land?  Why should we not say that some tribunal shall be set up which would determine the price of land, some authority which would say that £20,000 per acre will not be paid for land?  Surely it is time that we had sufficient social courage to do that?  Legislation should be introduced but I doubt that it will be introduced by this Minister.  I doubt that it will be introduced between now and the general election.  I am certain that we will not see it from this Minister after the general election because he will not then be a Minister.</P>
    <P>It is as well for us to air our views, I suppose, and we seem to be doing no more than that at this juncture in relation to the housing situation.  In the City Hall in Dublin there is a fine statue of, I think, Dargan, underneath which are the words: &ldquo;Property has its responsibilities as well as its rights.&rdquo; Of course, that is a Victorian concept because right up to our own day property has been the paramount consideration in the minds of certain persons and people only secondary.  Property is the primary and most important influence in life to many people in this Dáil also.  They may talk about people and about the nation and so on but they do not really mean it.  Many of them have no appreciation of the problems that face the ordinary people, particularly in this matter of housing.</P>
    <P>I am not really surprised that there has been agitation of the kind we have seen in regard to housing because, inevitably, people who are deprived of a home feel utterly frustrated.  The recent agitation, of course, was used for political purposes by people who have little or no interest whatever in the actual problem but I am not surprised that there has been agitation, the seeds of which are always there <Col N="1778" /> where houses are in short supply.  We have seen the same malaise not only in this country but throughout the world.  People are at last coming to accept that a fundamental need in life is to have somewhere to live.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have been saying that since James Connolly proposed the formation of the Labour Party in 1911, seconded by James Larkin.  We have been saying that year in and year out.  While others were indulging in luxurious and poetic dreams, the Labour Party were devoting their attentions and energies to the solution of the housing problem.  When other people were at each other's throats for things which are now seen not to have mattered one little bit, the Labour Party were concerned about the number of houses that would be provided, not about what phrases would be inserted here or there as to the number of houses that would be provided by the State and the number of people who were in need of houses and when the slums could be abolished, and so on.  The Labour Party always have been conscious of this problem which others are only now discovering.</P>
    <P>There have been in the Labour Party men who devoted their whole lives to finding a solution to this problem.  One of them died the other day&mdash;James Larkin, Junior, a former Member of this House.  Every day of his life was devoted to the problem of housing the working class, as was the case with his father before him who put the suit on every one of you and on every one of us and who gave us self-respect&mdash;those of us who come from the working class; I do not speak for anyone else&mdash;and who reared men up and taught them to stand erect.</P>
    <P>We have been talking about the problem of housing for a long, long time and will continue to do so.  To come back to the actual wording of the motion, the price of land is a matter that must and that would concern a responsible Government.  I do not say that it would concern this Government because this Government do not enter very much into that category and will not live much longer because it is riven, as we know, by the ambitions of petty individuals just as much as the Unionist Party in the <Col N="1779" /> North of Ireland is riven, and it has its Paisleys and weak O'Neills.</P>

      <P>However, I should not be misled into following others into the gutter.  I will leave that your sole occupation because it is a mistake to try to share the environment of others and that is what I would be doing.  I want to address myself constructively to this motion and to say to the Minister, although possibly I am wasting my time, that there is an unquestionable case for the establishment of legal machinery for the control of land prices and that his odd speech made here and there, made between referenda and elections, has no effect on the situation.  The only thing that will effectively deal with it will be legislation.  We are not just asking that, we are demanding that in the name of thousands of people who inevitably are going to be victimised by exorbitantly high house prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I would mention this fact, that as well as affecting the price of houses, the price of land acquired by Dublin Corporation of necessity also affects the level of rates paid by house occupiers throughout the city.  The rates must be found by way of money which is borrowed and interest must be paid on that money; the money must be repaid and the only method <Col N="1780" /> which we, as a corporation, have so far discovered of raising money is by means of rates.  Everybody knows the rates impost in Dublin city has reached alarming proportions; it is something that will be receiving the attention of corporation members within the next few days.  Therefore, in view of all the facts the one obvious step for the Minister to take is to impose, by legal means, a rigid control of the price of land so that there will be removed from the scene this furtive and sinister figure called the speculator who, as I said before, is doing down in every way he can the unfortunate house purchaser in this city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I need hardly say that since this motion really does little more than welcome my statements on this matter I do not intend to oppose it.  The general thinking behind the motion, that speculation in scarce serviced land should be discouraged, is merely a reflection of what I myself have said on a number of occasions.  This matter has been causing concern both to me and to the Government for some time past.  I do admit that the type of approach suggested by the movers of the motion seems at first sight to be the obvious one and certainly it was something on those lines that immediately suggested itself to me.  It appears to me that land normally has an agricultural use and agricultural land becomes building land because of the provision of services, such as water and sewerage mainly, by the community.  These services are provided as a result of a substantial investment made by the whole community in order to make it possible for the people to be housed and to allow of industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The individual landowners whose land undergoes this transformation make no individual contribution to this transformation except in so far as they are members of the community as a whole; they make no exceptional contribution to the increase in value of the land and in many cases the speculators who make money out of the people's investment have not even contributed in this way.  Therefore, it seemed to me to be obviously wrong that individuals, through no effort of their own, should <Col N="1781" /> make large fortunes from the investment made by the community for the purposes of making it possible to solve a social problem and particularly since the result of these unjustifiable and exorbitant profits is to make the solution of the social problem for which the investment was made, more difficult and even more expensive on the rest of the community.  This appeared to me to be so obviously wrong that I admit to being a little disconcerted when I find that the obvious way of dealing with the problem is just not possible constitutionally.</P>
    <P>However, the Government have been doing everything possible to relieve the situation.  The motion before the House is couched in somewhat extravagant language but this cannot obscure the fact that there would not be any problem at all if the economic progress that has been achieved in recent years had not taken place.  This progress has manifested itself in a marked and increased demand for more land for houses, for industrial, commercial and other forms of development in many areas, increased employment opportunities, the trend that is there towards more urbanisation, increased family formation, the rising demand for better living conditions, increasing car ownership.  All these factors have contributed towards the increased pressure on the resources of land that are immediately available for development. In those circumstances it was really inevitable that the law of supply and demand should operate so as to force prices upwards.</P>
    <P>The problem has been particularly acute in the Dublin area but it is not confined to that area.  It is undeniable that speculation in land suitable for development, or likely to be designated suitable for development, by planning authorities, has taken place.  This sort of activity is possible only when the resource which is being exploited is in short supply.  It has to be recognised that the only real, long-term solution of the problem is to ensure the provision of so much serviced land that it will lose its scarcity value so that the price will be what would be considered a more normal market level.  Within the limits of the resources available sanitary authorities are being pressed to go <Col N="1782" /> on with the planning and execution of schemes for the provision of water supplies and sewerage schemes in areas in which there is a demand for more land for residential, industrial and other development.</P>
    <P>Over the past year, the authorities, at my request, have carried out comprehensive reviews of water and sewerage schemes prepared by them, with a view to identifying the most urgent schemes or sections of schemes. Most authorities have worked out priority programmes, the main priorities being given to schemes designed to ensure the provision of social and industrial development and to meet urgent needs for the improvement of existing services.</P>
    <P>It has emerged, as Deputies know, from this review that major schemes to the value of £20 million are urgently needed.  Almost £5 million worth of these schemes have been released in the current financial year for early commencement.  The work of finalising the remaining schemes is proceeding and, as planning is completed, these schemes will be released for commencement in accordance with the resources available at the time.  I have to emphasise that the allocation of resources for sanitary services work has to complete with all the other demands for capital on the public purse and there is no use in Deputies talking as if there were unlimited amounts of money available. The amount of capital which can be provided for these purposes every year must be related to the level of production in the country at the time.  The most inadvisable thing a government could do would be to starve economic undertakings of the capital necessary for the further expansion that is needed to continue financing a programme such as this.  The best that can be done at any time by any government is to ensure that the funds are allocated on a sensible priority basis so that the most pressing needs are met first.</P>
    <P>Because of the situation that exists in Dublin particular attention has, in fact, already been given to the Dublin area.  A number of sewerage schemes in the area have been approved over the past 12 months and these schemes were undertaken at my request in order <Col N="1783" /> to increase the supply of serviced land at the earliest possible time to meet the short-term needs of house builders. Work is now in progress on these schemes and the authorities are being pressed to have them completed at an early date.  In the meantime, the planning and execution of the longer term programme, which will ensure an ample supply of serviced land in the Dublin area, are proceeding reasonably satisfactorily. In addition to the attention given and being given to the provision of sanitary services, a number of other steps have been taken to ameliorate the position.  Local authorities are being constantly urged to acquire land for development in advance of need, particularly where services are to be provided, in order to ensure that, as far as practicable, the increase in the value of land attributable to the provision of these services accrues, as it should, to the community that provided the services.</P>
    <P>All the major housing authorities have now acquired considerable areas of land.  In many cases the land on hands should be sufficient to meet their needs for some years to come. Other authorities are pushing ahead with further acquisition proposals.  A special capital allocation of £1 million was made available in 1967-68 and a similar amount was made available this year to meet an urgent programme of land acquisition in the Dublin area. The latest report from the Dublin authorities shows that, between city and county, they have acquired and are in the process of acquiring a pool of sites for approximately 12,000 private dwellings.  Some of these sites have already been made available to private builders and it is expected that over 2,300 more sites may be ready for builders in Dublin city and county and Dún Laoghaire in the future.</P>
    <P>In addition, as Deputies know or should know, I have introduced a special subsidy under the Housing Act of 1966 of £150 per site for private houses in order to encourage local authorities to acquire and develop land on a scale sufficiently large to bring with it the economies of size and the benefits of good overall design for <Col N="1784" /> the particular neighbourhood.  Authorities are beginning to avail themselves of this subsidy to an increasing extent in order to meet the need for private housing sites at reasonable cost.  Also, planning authorities have been empowered under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, to require developers to contribute towards the cost of provision of services such as water supply and sewerage.  If this power is judiciously used it should ensure that at least part of the increased value of land attributable to the provision of services at the public expense should accrue to the community.</P>
    <P>The Government have also decided that local authorities should be empowered to refuse permission for the use of public water and sewerage services for development and should be encouraged to levy a charge on the development of land in respect of any increase in the value of the land attributable to the provision of these services. These proposals should make it possible for local authorities to frustrate the activities of anti-social speculators in this vital commodity.  It should assist them to inhibit excessively expensive developments and ensure that priority will be given to housing developments that are designed to solve the social problems for which these services were provided.</P>
    <P>These various proposals have already begun to have their effect and they should have more effect in the future.  I have raised this question initially of the effect that the cost of sites has on the ultimate cost of the house.  I do not want to exaggerate it.  It is not the major factor in the cost of the house, but certainly it is the least justifiable one and the one it is most desirable to tackle.  I am satisfied that the way in which it is being tackled will be reasonably effective.  If, as a result of these proposals, people who have been speculating, paying unjustifiably high prices for scarce building land in the hope of making profits without doing any work, burn their fingers when these factors begin to operate fully they have nobody but themselves to blame.  I assure Deputies nobody on this side of the House will worry about them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1785" /> This motion has been availed of by speakers from the Labour Party benches to refer to their own proposals in regard to this matter.  There is no time for me to go into these proposals in any detail.  In any case, they are too nebulous and too badly thought out to be discussed in any detail, but we cannot complain in general of a lack of documentation by the Labour Party in regard to what they describe as their policy in this matter.  The flood of fanciful literature under this heading has, I think, served a very useful purpose. It has shown the people the true nature of those who control the Party. It has shown the people the dangers that are involved in voting for the Party and it has also shown the unrealistic nature of their approach to all aspects of Government.  A clear indication is provided for the general public that the disaster of the two Coalition Governments would be nothing to what would result if this type of madness were to influence Government policy in the future.</P>
    <P>But, in all the documentation that has been produced in regard to these proposals, there is one very obvious and fundamental omission: the proposals for constitutional amendments have not yet been published.  I think it must be clear even to them that these policies cannot be implemented under the present Constitution, which specifies a different type of State and lays down principles which are not reconcilable with the proposals they are putting forward.</P>

But the Labour Party, because of the fact that they are not faced with responsibility for dealing with this position and because they know that there is no prospect of their having to deal with it, are able to ignore all this.  Now, before they can expect their policies for many different aspects of Government to be taken seriously, they must first of all put forward <Col N="1786" /> their proposals for the amendment of the Constitution to permit of all the things they suggest being done.</P>

      <P>The only other matter I want to deal with is my colleague's, Deputy Dunne's, contention that no progress has been made in regard to the provision of houses under this Government. He referred in particular, strange as it may seem, to the Ballymun scheme.  I thought Deputy Dunne and his colleagues were only too anxious now to forget all about the Ballymun scheme.  I remember the flood of questions in which the Deputy referred to the initial delays in the Ballymun scheme.  Deputy Dunne was ably assisted by his colleagues and there was high glee on the part of him and his colleagues at the prospect they thought they saw when it seemed to them the Ballymun scheme would not achieve its target and these 3,000 odd additional dwellings, additional to the maximum output of the Dublin Corporation, would not be provided within the specified time.  As soon as it became apparent, however, that despite all the setbacks, despite the abnormal weather conditions and all the other delays, the target would be achieved, fewer and fewer questions were asked about that scheme.  These dwellings in Ballymun were provided for the first time in this country by direct Government action, direct action by a Fianna Fáil Government, and they are additional to the <Col N="1788" /> maximum possible output of the Dublin Corporation.  The present Fianna Fáil Government, as Deputy Moore stated, have an outstanding record in regard to the provision of houses and the Ballymun scheme is responsible for the improvement that is so apparent now in the housing situation in Dublin.</P>

We appreciate that, in order to build houses and deal with the problem of housing, one must take into account the capacity of the economy to finance such an activity.  It is because Fianna Fáil approached the matter in that realistic way that we have not had the disastrous collapse of the building industry that marked the efforts of the Coalition Government.  The targets set out in the White Paper have been achieved and the time has come to prepare a new White Paper for the coming five years.  That will be published shortly. An assessment will be made of the need for housing, the accumulated need and the prospective need, the capacity of the country to finance such a programme <Col N="1789" /> and the physical capacity of the building industry to execute it. New targets will be set.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1968:    Fifth Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to repeat all the arguments it was necessary for me to repeat on the Committee Stage.  All the charges made by the Opposition have been effectively dealt with.  It has been clearly established that this Bill is introduced because of the figures published in the report of the 1966 Census of Population.  These figures disclosed that the majority of the present constituencies are no longer in conformity with the constitutional requirement as defined by the courts at the express request of the Fine Gael Party, and as endorsed by the people in the recent referendum.</P>
      <P>The necessity to bring the constituencies into conformity with the Constitution at this stage&mdash;although there is another provision in the Constitution specifying a longer period for revision &mdash;now arises because of pressure by the Opposition Parties to do it.  It is clear that the Constitution does, in fact, require the Government to accede to the demands of the Opposition in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never made any secret of the fact that neither I nor anyone else on the Government benches feel in any way enthusiastic about undertaking this task.  We have been consistent all along in adhering to our viewpoint that this thing that is required of us, this breaching of county boundaries, this continuous uprooting of people from constituencies in which they have always voted, is objectionable.  We asked to have this requirement removed. The Opposition did not agree, and the people did not agree.  Because of that, this Bill now has to be introduced and these objectionable things have to be done.  It is certainly not being done because of any desire on our part to do it, but because it is <Col N="1790" /> required by the Constitution.  As I say, we believe this is undesirable and we believe that there is no democratic principle that requires it to be done. It is merely the interpretation of the words used in the Constitution that requires it to be done.</P>
    <P>For example, we have the five counties of Cavan, Monaghan, Louth, Meath and Kildare that have always, or almost always at any rate, been those five constituencies.  We believe there should still be those five constituencies and, under the Bill, there will be a Cavan constituency, a Monaghan constituency, a Louth constituency, a Meath constituency and a Kildare constituency, involving the populations of those five counties, and those five counties only.  We believe it would be preferable and quite democratic to leave those five counties intact, and have those five constituencies that have always been there but, as I said, we asked permission in the recent referendum to leave these five counties intact, and to retain those five constituencies without these unnecessary and undesirable transfers of population from one of these counties to another, but we were refused that permission. Now we have to go ahead and do what is being done.</P>
    <P>I have agreed on a number of occasions throughout this debate that many different alternative solutions to this problem were possible.  I expressed the opinion that the proposal put forward in the Bill was as good a solution as it was possible to achieve. Certainly I have no reason to change my mind having listened to the debate. I never claimed that every possible permutation and combination of constituencies had been examined, but that a reasonably detailed study of the constituencies had been made and I was personally satisfied that the least possible amount of disturbance consistent with having reasonably feasible constituencies would result.  But, having seen the efforts produced by the Opposition, I am now more convinced than ever that what is being proposed is the most reasonable possible solution.</P>
    <P>The main accusation made was the predictable one that the whole approach here is to try to gerrymander, <Col N="1791" /> but even on that the Opposition cannot be consistent.  They should make up their minds whether this has been, as they allege, a skilful gerrymander. Gerrymandering, to my mind, appears to imply that the Party carrying out the gerrymandering will gain some electoral advantage from it.  On the one hand, we are told that this has been a highly skilful gerrymander and, on the other hand, it is claimed that Fianna Fáil will be the losers by it. The fact is, as one Opposition Deputy happened to say before he realised what he was saying, that the information on which to base gerrymandering just is not available in this country. No one can say with any degree of certainty where the areas are which support the different Parties.  No one knows exactly how the people in different district electoral divisions and townlands voted in the past, and certainly no one knows how they will continue to vote in the future.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from any objective examination of what is being done in this Bill that the whole approach has been to disturb the present pattern of the constituencies as little as possible, consistent with having feasible areas of representation, and, at the same time, complying with the constitutional requirements.  It has been said that there was no clear pattern of approach on the part of the Government.  I think our approach has been quite clear.  As I said, it was to have as little disturbance as possible both of people from one county to another, and of the present constituency arrangements, and, secondly, there has been a tendency towards the creation of more three-seat constituencies.  That is a tendency that has been developing over the years.  This type of arrangement of the constituencies will, as Deputy O'Donnell of the Fine Gael Party said, make it more feasible for some Party to obtain sufficient seats at an election to form a Government.  After all, at least one of the purposes of elections is to enable the people to choose a Government.</P>
    <P>Throughout this debate the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party when they took part in the debate have interpreted this as meaning that the <Col N="1792" /> creation of three-seat constituencies must always be to the benefit of Fianna Fáil.  We are hardly likely to argue against the proposition that the people are more likely to continue to give majority support to Fianna Fáil than to either of the Opposition Parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The approach here was to interfere with present constituencies as little as possible.  Take the eastern area of Cavan, Monaghan, Louth, Meath, Kildare and Carlow-Kilkenny. There are six constituencies there at present&mdash;a Cavan constituency, a Monaghan constituency, a Louth constituency, a Meath constituency, a Kildare constituency and a Carlow-Kilkenny constituency.  We propose to retain these six constituencies in the most feasible way possible.  Eventually, after two or three weeks in this session, between Second Stage and Committee Stage, Fine Gael apparently finally came to a decision with regard to this part of the country: they proposed to retain only two of these constituencies. Under the partial scheme that they put forward here, by way of amendment, there would still be a Meath constituency and a Louth constituency but they proposed to do away with the traditional constituencies of Cavan and Monaghan and they proposed to do away with the traditional Kildare constituency and the established constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick claims there is no pattern to be seen in the Bill.  The position under the Bill is that there are 26 three-seat constituencies proposed, 14 four-seat constituencies and two five-seat constituencies.  Fine Gael put forward, as I said, a partial scheme in opposition to that.  They did not put forward any definite proposals with regard to Dublin: the proposals for the Dublin area were accepted.  In trying to compare the Government's proposals with the Fine Gael proposals, I have to assume that they accept the situation that we proposed in Dublin.  On that basis, the Fine Gael <Col N="1794" /> proposals were for 19 three-seat constituencies, 18 four-seat constituencies and three five-seat constituencies.  I think it is quite clear that the tendency in the Bill before the House is to opt for as many three-seat constituencies as are feasible.  Outside the Dublin area, there are only eight constituencies which are not three-seat constituencies under this Bill.  There are two five-seat constituencies remaining and that is because, in these two cases of Laois-Offaly and Carlow-Kilkenny, these two constituencies comply with the present requirements of the Constitution and it is possible for them to remain as they are.  The other constituencies around them can be adjusted without interfering with them and, so, it was decided to leave these two constituencies as they are even though this does involve such straggling and difficulty to represent five-seat constituencies.</P>
    <P>There are six four-seat constituencies outside the Dublin area.  One of these is North-East Cork which is at present a five-seat constituency but which is being reduced to a four-seat constituency because of the extension of the borough boundary and the return of population to the city of Cork which is at present incorporated in the constituency of North-East Cork.  The other five four-seat constituencies outside the Dublin area are in areas that are already four-seat constituencies and where there are only minor changes, if any.  There are minor changes in them all, except one.  These constituencies are: Longford-Westmeath; East Limerick; Mid-Cork; Wexford and South Tipperary.</P>
    <P>With regard to Dublin, the peculiar thing is that&mdash;having complained about the creation of three-seat constituencies in general&mdash;apparently, if I understand the Fine Gael case properly, they want more three-seat constituencies in Dublin.  They have not stated how many of them they want&mdash;whether they want a division in Dublin of 11 three-seat constituencies and one five-seat constituency or ten three-seat constituencies and two four-seat constituencies. Under the Bill, there will be ten separate constituencies in the small Dublin area; I should think that that is enough.  Apparently Fine Gael do not <Col N="1795" /> think so&mdash;but they have not gone into any detail.  They have not put forward any alternative suggestion except the suggestion made by the two Deputies Belton to the effect that an extra seat should be allocated to the Dublin area &mdash;at the expense of the rural part of the country&mdash;but, of course, they did not specify where this extra seat was to come from.  Despite requests made by me, Fine Gael refused to state whether or not this was Fine Gael policy.</P>
    <P>In so far as Dublin city is concerned, in view of the distribution of population, I think the proposed arrangement of constituencies is the best and is, in fact, nearest to the present arrangement.  We have at present three constituencies on the north side of Dublin city and three in the south side. The Bill proposes three north side constituencies and three south side constituencies and one central city constituency.  I pointed out on Committee Stage that, because of the population distribution in the city and because of constitutional requirements, it is inevitable that there will be one constituency at least crossing the River Liffey because the population is roughly equal on the two sides of the Liffey.  The number of seats available is 27.  Obviously, then, we must have one constituency crossing the River Liffey.  I think, then, it is quite clear, despite the fact that Deputy Fitzpatrick maintains there is no clear tendency in the Bill towards large or small constituencies, that, where changes had to be made, the Government opted for the smaller three-seat constituency.</P>
    <P>The whole debate here has been a laboured effort to make the Bill appear to be excessively controversial.  I think it has, in fact, shown that there are at least as many of the Opposition Deputies satisfied with the proposals as there are Fianna Fáil Deputies&mdash; and there are certainly as many Fianna Fáil Deputies dissatisfied with the proposals as there are Opposition Deputies.  That, in itself, is an indication that the revision was made purely in order to comply with the constitutional requirements and without any effort being made to suit one particular Party.  In fact, as I have said, I would not know how to go about <Col N="1796" /> doing that.  The alternatives that were put forward by the Fine Gael Party&mdash; and they were innumerable&mdash;were, all of them, more objectionable than the proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not know if we can take the last series of amendments put down by Deputy Hogan as representing official Fine Gael policy but he himself put forward a number of different alternatives during the debate and as far as I could see every Fine Gael Deputy who spoke had his own particular solution for the problem in so far as it affected his own area at least. The Fine Gael theory appears to be that the percentage of the total population that is required to vote outside of their own county is the only important thing.  Of course, that is typical of the Fine Gael approach, that individuals do not matter so long as the total numbers affected are small, that the sense of frustration and almost of disfranchisement felt by the individuals concerned is a matter of no importance. I do not accept that proposition. In fact, I think that many people would agree that when a transfer has to be made from one county into another the people concerned will feel less frustration if there is a sizeable number, a significant number, transferred into the new constituency so that they will form a significant factor in the new constituency and form a community whose interests cannot, with impunity, be ignored.</P>

      <P>I think there is a reasonable number transferred and in any case the problem was that there were these five counties which could still remain each of them a three-seat constituency but had to have this unnecessary adjustment and I think it was desirable to retain a Cavan constituency, <Col N="1797" /> a Monaghan constituency, a Louth constituency, a Meath constituency and a Kildare constituency.</P>

      <P>What was done was the only way in which that objective could be achieved.  The only other thing I want to say about this latest partial solution put forward by Deputy Hogan on behalf of Fine Gael is that the figures he gave for disruptions of people and disruption of constituencies were, of course, completely incorrect.  For instance, in so far as the eastern region, as he described it, is concerned his proposal involves a disruption for that area alone of 104,453 people as against the 21,920 people who are proposed to be transferred in the Bill.</P>
      <P>In addition to that, of course, his proposals also involve a much greater deviation from the national average of population per Deputy and a much greater deviation in this respect as between one of these constituencies and another.  In fact, even the amendments that I accepted during the passage of this Bill, all of these resulted in departing further from the constitutional requirement of trying to achieve equality of population per Deputy as between one constituency and another. Deputy Hogan's proposals involve the creation of new five-seat constituencies and new alignments of whole counties with one another, the creation of long, straggling, irrational new five-seat and two county constituencies.  The whole approach was obviously, as it has been by Fine Gael all along, on the basis that people do not count, that they are looked on as mere digits and if the total percentage can, by any faking of the figures, be shown to be small that the solution is an acceptable one.  The question is in my opinion whether or not when you have to transfer people like this you should transfer a significant number or a number that will be so small as to make them a community of no significance in their new constituency.</P>

      <P>With regard to the position as between Donegal and Leitrim Fine Gael had different proposals but the one that was most often put forward was to transfer a comparatively insignificant number of Donegal people into a constituency either of Sligo-Leitrim or of Roscommon-Leitrim. Our proposals are to put a substantial number of Leitrim people into that constituency where they will form a significant element in the constituency.</P>
      <P>Similarly with regard to the Water-ford-South Tipperary area where the existing situation is that there is a substantial number of Waterford people associated with South Tipperary and where there is, in fact, a Waterford man elected as Deputy for the constituency the Fine Gael proposal is to disrupt this position, to transfer these people back to Waterford and, in addition, to get rid of certain areas in Tipperary and transfer them into Waterford also.</P>
      <P>Another example that I have just been reminded of is the one that kept cropping up all along.  Deputy Hogan seemed to be obsessed with the desirability of transferring Taghboy and Ahascragh to Roscommon.  I do not know whether it was Deputy Donnellan's suggestion or Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins's suggestion but that seemed to be one thing that was agreed anyway, that it was more desirable to transfer Taghboy and Ahascragh to Roscommon than to transfer the hinterland of Ballinasloe &mdash; Creagh, Culliagh, Cloonburren, Moore, and Ballydangan&mdash;and to let that area go with Ballinasloe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that the proposal we put forward is the most reasonable one in the circumstances.  I do not look upon it as a desirable solution at all.  I think that the things we are required to do are not required by any democratic principle.  I think it is, <Col N="1799" /> as the former Taoiseach described, a constitutional infirmity but the people have decided that this position should remain and that after every census apparently that discloses any significant movement of population in future <Col N="1800" /> we should have to go through this undesirable type of operation.  That is the position.  It has to be done and the new scheme of constituencies that is proposed is, I think, the best that can be put forward in the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>While one is discussing this Bill it is impossible not to be aware of the situation in the city and in the country in labour/employer relations.  May I take this opportunity now of making a plea to both sides in this strike to come together tomorrow morning and, without sacrificing principles, to think of the great suffering which is being inflicted on a large section of our people and to remember that the strike must be fixed some time, so why not now?  People have said, of course, that the Minister should do something about this strike. I think the Minister has done everything possible, in by far the best way to establish a plan for proper human relations in the industrial and commercial field.  The FUE suggested there should be another body of arbitration. But, while the Labour Court is there, we appeal to the parties at this late stage, when this strike is almost a month on, to fix it and then go on talking after that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is entitled the Trade Union Bill, 1966, and through no fault I suppose of any side&mdash;the Minister's or the trade unions'&mdash;it has been delayed for three years.  During that time critics of the Government and of the establishment in general have said that of course the Minister was preparing repressive, restrictive and reactionary legislation.  I wonder what their feelings were when they saw the context of his actual Bill here?  It is certainly not restrictive, there is certainly no repression in it and it certainly is not reactionary.  I welcome this Bill because I see in it the recognition of the precept that this is a democratic State. The Constitution does not provide that democracy should be confined to the principle of adult suffrage in Parliamentary or local election.  It surely intends that the State should insist by legislation on the exercise of democratic control in other institutions, such <Col N="1802" /> as trade unions established on a democratic basis.</P>
    <P>Nobody will disagree with Deputy O'Leary's theory that the worker desires a feeling of belonging to his organisation.  That is a very human feeling.  The worker should not be just a cog in the trade union movement. He must be established as a human being having dignity and intelligence. Therefore, I do not think that workers will ever care a hoot whether such things as a bank overdraft should be financed by a mortgage debenture or by any other means but what he does care about is that he shall have a voice as to whether he goes on strike.</P>
    <P>We must face the fact that in the city today thousands are affected by the strike who were not even given the opportunity of expressing an opinion as to whether they should or should not strike but because of our history of trade unionism and because most of us were taught in our younger days that one should not pass a picket, there are people who are abusing this loyalty and who believe that a picket is sacrosanct and should not be passed.</P>
    <P>The president of the Congress of Trade Unions said recently that we must examine our attitude towards pickets.  It may seem just coincidental that in England where there is a socialist government with all that means they are having the same trouble in introducing what they believe is the proper trade union legislation.  Our legislation here is quite mild because the Minister in his wisdom&mdash;and I am sure we all agree with him&mdash;recognises the fact that any kind of legislation, especially trade union legislation, must have the consent of the workers and of the employers.</P>
    <P>If we are to have the society that we wish to have here, we shall not have it by the implementation of harsh measures for either workers or employers. With regard to England, the Minister in charge there has published a White Paper called &ldquo;In Place of Strife&rdquo;.  This very able lady has accused somebody of leaking the details of the Bill to the people concerned and she has also accused them of leaking the restrictive parts of her Bill.  I merely mention this to show that, while some <Col N="1803" /> people are saying that Fianna Fáil are neglecting the workers here, a socialist Minister in England admits that restrictive legislation is being brought in there to curb the unions.  That illustrates that while we are having our trouble, most other places are having their troubles too.</P>
    <P>One may ask: &ldquo;Why do we need a Trade Union Bill?&rdquo; Anyone who has read the newspapers during the past month can see clearly that we have reached an almost chaotic situation. In last evening's issue of the <i>Evening Herald</i> under the banner headline &ldquo;General Workers Rebelling&rdquo; we read:</P>
    <P>A rebellion by the general workers in industry because of their treatment by the craft workers, was how Mr. James Dunne, president of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, described the situation which exists today in the big strike.</P>
    <P>We, on this side of the House, believe that if we are to have progress, if we are to have full employment and if we are to help the lower paid workers, we must have a very strong trade union movement and the Minister has sought, in his Bill, to create the atmosphere and the conditions for a strong and a responsible trade union movement. However, I do not think it is the Minister's job to do this.  I should like to see a state of affairs where the Trade Union Congress and the FUE would draft their own legislation and say: &ldquo;This is our charter for the workers and for the employers&rdquo;.  This would make for proper human relations in the industrial field and it would prevent thousands of people from being turned out of employment.  I recall a former Taoiseach, Deputy Seán Lemass, saying to the trade unions: &ldquo;Draft your own legislation and we will implement it&rdquo;.  This would prevent a situation such as we witnessed recently when the women of Dublin had to fight in the bread shops for bread for their children because of the strike.</P>
    <P>We hope, therefore, that this Bill will help to remove the doubts and clear the obstacles bedevilling us at the moment and which are throwing thousands <Col N="1804" /> of men and women out of employment. I do not believe we will secure the ideal of a perfect society but if we have responsible Government, responsible employers, responsible trade unions, responsible workers and a sense of responsibility in the other spheres of our society, we can achieve something very close to it.</P>
    <P>During the past fortnight we lost two outstanding trade union leaders, Lord rest them.  Those men worked very hard to uplift the trade union movement and it is rather crazy that we find at the time of their deaths a situation as ugly as any that has existed since 1913.  I cannot diagnose the cause of the trouble.  There are probably many aspects of this problem. One possibly is caused by the fact that a section of our society treats the word &ldquo;profit&rdquo; as a dirty word and says that profit should not be made out of anything.  If this were to be believed by the majority of our people it would bring malaise to our society: it would affect national progress and our whole outlook.  In countries like Sweden and West Germany where there is free enterprise, there is certainly a very high standard of living.</P>
    <P>If we were to give our lower paid workers an increase of, say, £2 or £3 a week, other workers would seek a <i>pro rata</i> increase and the old merrygo-round would begin all over again. It is my opinion, however, that a man below a certain weekly wage should not have to make social welfare payments. His wages are too low for these. If we were to say to him that he would no longer have to make these payments but that, at the same time, he would be guaranteed the benefits to which he is now entitled under social welfare, it would, at least, give him something extra on which to live.</P>
    <P>Talking about the lower paid worker, it has been said by many people that the increase in Oireachtas salaries was one cause of the present unrest.  If that is so we must examine our consciences on this matter.  We know very well, as Deputies, that, first of all, the increase given was illusory in many ways because a Member of the Dáil or Seanad is not a free agent in respect of his salary.  He is merely handling it for <Col N="1805" /> the time being.  The point I want to make is that, in future, if we are going to have any kind of proper progress in wage negotiations, we should have some tribunal or some adjunct of the Labour Court which would deal with the salaries of the judiciary and the Oireachtas to show people that we are prepared to stand with them in this matter of salaries.  I fully supported the increase given and I do not wish to suggest that I did not.</P>
    <P>Of the various strikes, apart from the one I mentioned, the craftsman strike at the moment is very important. Even last week we had the secondary teachers strike.  It ended very quickly. We are reaching a stage in this country when we feel that no settlement is possible unless we have had at least a token strike.  This is a tragic thing for our country.  If we cannot resolve our differences without this tremendous loss of employment every time, it is bad.  I often wonder who actually gains by the wage increase which follows a strike?  In the present strike one union is paying £120,000 in strike pay per week.  The strike pay is only a fraction of the wage a man would earn.  He has not affluent living on strike pay and the union is being beggared.  All this could be prevented if we had an injection of commonsense into the trade unions and the employers' organisations, and into ourselves generally, in order that we might see there is a problem here which is not being faced.  We should face it in a civilised way.  We can prevent a lot of misery in our community by being civilised about these things.</P>
    <P>In this Bill there is provision for one very democratic thing: that is, that there should be a ballot on a strike if the strikers want to get the full protection of the law for their strike.  There is one point here which I should like the Minister to deal with when he is replying.  It is laid down in section 14 that we would have a secret ballot on a strike issue.  Most people agree with that.  It has been put to me by one of the bodies concerned that it could happen this way: if union members decided to claim say £1 per week and instructed their executive to claim it, they might also say that they would hold a strike ballot <Col N="1806" /> to strengthen the hands of negotiators at the table.  That would not be a good thing.  They might take a long time to resolve the wage claim and they might then go for strike action. They might not get the full demand and they might have a second ballot. The men might say that they got a fairly good offer and there would be some embarrassment if they had to  the previous decision to strike. I am sure the Minister will deal with that on the section.  I am sure there is some explanation for it.  It may be a drafting defect in the Bill.  If the Congress of Trade Unions were to bring some drafting mistake to the notice of the Minister, knowing the Minister as I do I feel he would be glad to meet them so far as possible and to remove any defects from the Bill.  This is a simple Bill which is not going to change the whole structure of society.  It is part of a whole series of legislation.  We have found out that you cannot just legislate for what is an attitude.  You must have full co-operation of all the sectors of our economy in order that the Bill, when it becomes an Act, may be worked well.</P>
    <P>It has been said that we have too many trade unions.  This is generally agreed.  We could do with re-grouping. The Bill provides for this, so that unions may be organised into various groups.  An ex-member of the Trade Union Congress told me some time ago that, back in the 1930s, the then Congress met on this question of union grouping.  He states that a recommendation was made that there should be ten trade unions.  Ten is the number that they have in Federal Germany, where they have many more workers than we have.  If we were to have ten, that would be a huge reduction on the number we have at the moment. With ten, each union could have proper, full-time staff.  At the moment unions have not got proper full-time staff and, no matter what the ability of the secretary, it is hard for him to carry on his normal day's work and then look after the trade union members during his leisure hours.</P>
    <P>Another point which has come to the fore in recent times is the matter of the British-based unions here.  I <Col N="1807" /> know this is a thorny point.  Without being fully versed in all the historic roots of these unions, I feel that the British-based unions, if they operate here, should at least give the Irish workers local autonomy.</P>

      <P>We may well be asked: &ldquo;Do you not realise there are plenty of people in the Six Counties who would not agree with you?&rdquo; I do not care whether the headquarters is in Dublin or Belfast, but it should be in this island.  The British trade union movement has influenced us tremendously. Some of that influence has been good and some not so good.  The British are not as emotional as we are supposed to be, but they boast of their martyrs also.  They often talk about the 12 men of Dorset.  They speak about Robert Owen, Keir Hardie and George Lansbury.  They were probably very good men, but even the British must realise now that they are in the 20th century and that they have got to face a Europe which has little emotion in it.</P>
      <P>I refer to West Germany, Holland and Denmark, whose economies are booming at a time when the British economy is declining and while in Ireland we are not having the growth we should.  Having had a look at continental trade unionism, we must get down to examining things here.  I appreciate that the men in the trade unions, even in the craft unions, have their difficulties.  I appreciate that the employers have difficulties.  I appreciate that we are going through a period of expansion and that when the economy is expanding there are likely to be more troubles than when it is contracting, but at the moment we are inflicting tremendous suffering on ourselves by not using more commonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Bill is enacted we know <Col N="1808" /> it will not be the panacea for all our ills but it is an honest attempt by the Minister to mend a situation which is fraught with danger.  There are men in the trade union movement who are striving to bring about a proper system of free negotiation.  If we were to speak from the employers' side, for many years we have had the experience that one of the biggest causes of strikes was delay in dealing with even an ordinary, simple claim.  Consequently, often the worker was convinced that the only way to finalise his claim in an expeditious way was by unofficial strike.  Often, after workers had spent months trying to get their claims remedied, there were unofficial strikes and then there was a rush to the corridors of power to have the strikes fixed up quickly.  The lesson of that was not lost and people began to say that this is the only way to get things done.  But it is not the right way.  Such unofficial strikes nearly invariably affect workers in some other sphere of industry.</P>
    <P>On the Industrial Relations Bill, which is an extension of the other, the Minister has introduced some original and worthwhile proposals.  Section 10 is to enable an employer or a trade union affected by an employment agreement registered with the Labour Court to complain to the court that an employer affected by the agreement has failed or neglected to comply with the agreement.  If the court is satisfied that the complaint is well founded, it can direct the employer to comply with the agreement under penalties.  There is some ambiguity here because there is no indication in the section that where an employer wishes to give more favourable terms than those provided in the agreement he can do so. It scarcely happens that an employer betters an award given by the Labour Court but we can assume that an agreement reached in the Labour Court will be for the minimum benefit and there may be employers who make such vast profits that they can afford to give more.  If they decide to do so there should not be any impediment.</P>
    <P>Some years ago in Holland, unions and employers were so united that <Col N="1809" /> when one employer ratted on an agreement, the employers went to the trade unions and said: &ldquo;We will help you to fight this fellow&rdquo;.  During the war in that country, labour and capital became so integrated in the face of the common enemy that when the war was over they decided they should not go back to the old days of <i>laissez faire</i>.  The position is excellent there now.  They have not as many strikes as we have, though I am not suggesting they do not have any strikes.  I do not wish to model this country on West Germany or any other country but these countries have got certain good points which we might accept as an example.  We must say to ourselves: &ldquo;We are serious about the lower paid worker, about the person who cannot get a job and who has to emigrate&rdquo;.  How serious are some of us?  It looks as if we could not care less about those who have to emigrate to Birmingham, London or elsewhere, who have to try to rear families on their subsistence wages.  We shall have emigration, unemployment and lower paid workers until we realise we have here a country and that each one of us must make sacrifices so that we shall build an economy which will give employment to every person who wishes to live in his own country&mdash; which will give a proper living to the people who are prepared to work for it. However, we must stop this insane situation in which thousands of our people are on strike today and in which thousands of other men and women are out because of loyalty to a principle.</P>
    <P>I spoke recently to a man who had done business with a Polish firm.  The man wanted to import coal and after they had haggled about the price the Irishman said: &ldquo;Are you willing to stick to this price?&rdquo; The Polish representative said: &ldquo;We are, but are you, with your capitalist trade unions and your strikes?&rdquo; This is the comment of a representative of a totalitarian country.  In fairness to the trade unions here, I prefer it the way it is instead of the way it is in Poland, but at the same time we must think.  Here the Minister is providing a lead, a blueprint to help us to get back on the path of sanity.  My final plea to the craftsmen and to the FUE is to end the present strike tomorrow morning and <Col N="1810" /> to take this first step back to sanity and reality.</P>

      <P>Not because he happens to be a friend of mine, I wish to congratulate Deputy Moore for the contribution he has made.  It appears to me that he speaks not alone from conviction but from a certain amount of experience in the trade union movement. However, I would not be as optimistic as Deputy Moore with regard to the end result of the two Bills now before the House, as introduced by the Minister for Labour.  I believe the motive of the Minister in introducing the Bills is laudable.  He has the best intentions in the world, but I do not believe, apart altogether from the dispute we have at the present time, that these Bills will go any distance in the matter of solving the problems we have and which are recognised by the employers and the employees.</P>
      <P>One remark I should like to make at this point refers to the time for discussing these Bills.  We always appear to discuss trade union and industrial relations questions at times when we have industrial strikes.  This is the wrong atmosphere in which to discuss the type of measure we have been discussing during the past week or so. It is not the first time I have mentioned this not only to the present Minister for Labour but to various Ministers for Industry and Commerce.  The time to tackle these problems is when there is peace or, if the Minister likes, relative peace.</P>

That is not so, even though we have a pretty bad record as far as days lost in strikes are concerned.  I do not know whether I am correct in saying this or not but, as far as I can gather, the last discussions the Minister had with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on industrial legislation was two years ago, or maybe more, on these two measures, in any case, because the House will note that one Bill here is described as the Trade Union Bill, 1966, and the other is described <Col N="1811" /> as the Industrial Relations Bill, 1966. I do not know and I do not know whether my colleague knows of any real discussions that went on with regard to the publication of these two measures.</P>

      <P>Now, now, now.  I am not talking about the Minister's Department in particular but there have been Bills which have, in fact, been circulated to other people with legitimate interests in the measures before they came to be delivered to Members of this House.  In any case, the Minister will have noted a statement issued by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in <Col N="1812" /> the last 24 hours when they asked for the withdrawal of the Trade Union Bill, mark you&mdash;not the Industrial Relations Bill&mdash;the Trade Union Bill and I would suggest&mdash;and this seems to be a negative or a foot-dragging proposal &mdash;that the Minister should not proceed with the Trade Union Bill until he has had further serious consultation with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that the Government have thought out for themselves the future of industrial relations.  Every time we talk about industrial relations in this House and ask what is the attitude of the Government Party or members of the Government, we are blandly told that they believe in collective bargaining.  As I said, we have not a good record.  I think we are blackguarded a little too often about industrial strife in this country but let me say as far as our record of days lost in strike is concerned it is not good, to say the least about it.</P>
      <P>I do not want to talk about the present dispute.  I know there are people in the country who are saying of me and my colleagues in the Labour Party and of the Minister for Labour: &ldquo;Why does he not do something about it?&rdquo; or: &ldquo;Why do they not do something about it?&rdquo; I cannot say what the Minister's activities have been in the last few weeks but I know what the activities of my Party have been and the vital interest in this dispute that the Labour Party have.  We have been in constant consultation with people in the trade union movement and have offered our services, if required.  I say, tonight, as far as this dispute is concerned, whether it is the FUE or any other band of employers or any of the trade unions, I and members of my Party are available to do what we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Court is an institution for which we all have respect and they have discussed this matter with the two sides over a period of 230 hours.  I say this in all modesty: I, frankly, do not know what I could do at the present time that the Labour Court could not do with the two parties present over a period of 230 hours.  I know the situation may change tomorrow morning; it may change for the better or worse tomorrow evening &mdash;this is the sort of dispute it is&mdash;but <Col N="1813" /> as far as we are concerned everybody who knows our association with the trade union movement knows that everything possible will be done.  It is not that we want publicity for it because I think the Minister would be the first to acknowledge the help the Labour Party and I to some extent gave in a dispute we had last year in which workers in the Electricity Supply Board were involved.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody in this present dispute should try to gain kudos, particularly political kudos.  I suppose if we wanted to do this we could do so by lambasting one side or the other or even by lambasting the Minister.  In that way we could get a certain amount of political kudos. But we are in this particular position: if a trade union do well for the country or any member of their own organisation we do not seem to get any credit for it.  As a matter of fact, they appear to give credit to the Government.  But if, as in the present dispute, there is a certain amount of industrial disruption, the Labour Party gets the blame.  We are prepared to take it.  I suppose we have to take it from some ignorant people who comment in the newspapers or those who would be our critics.  I realise and they realise, I am sure, the seriousness for the economy and, indeed, for workers of a dispute of this kind but there must be a reason for all this.  There must be a reason as there is for every strike.  I do not think the workers in this country are any different from workers in any country in the world.  It may be&mdash;and this is a situation we are trying to correct&mdash;our trade union law and our law in respect of industrial relations is wrong but as far as our legitimate demands are concerned and as far as the behaviour of the workers is concerned, as compared with workers in Europe, they are no different and I do not think we should castigate or blackguard them or attribute to them base ulterior motives merely because they withdrew their labour.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Moore has said, in this present strike there is an overflow and many workers are suffering because there is this particular dispute.  We have not yet in our industrial relations legislation or in our trade union <Col N="1814" /> law devised a legal system to ensure that such a number of workers will not be affected as are affected in the present dispute.  We must look upon this whole problem from the social and economic standpoint.</P>
    <P>People have been critical of the Labour Party in recent times.  Mainly, may I say, our critics are those who have not read our policy document but are merely trying to interpret what must of necessity be abbreviated reports that appear in the newspaper or are told over television or radio. At least, we have done this: we have got people talking about industrial democracy; we have got people talking about the involvement of workers in the affairs of an industry as they affect the workers.  I was gratified to listen to members of an employers' association treating with respect the proposals that were put forward by the Labour Party as far as a workers' democracy is concerned.  Some people, of course, by their sneers and by their smears would describe it as some sort of system foreign to our country.  Let me quote this document very briefly:</P>
    <P>The aim of workers' democracy is to make the decision takers in the place of work and in the control of the enterprise responsible to those who work in it.</P>
    <P>Again, there are our political opponents who would suggest that we of the Labour Party want to see the workers take over management, to nationalise everything.  That is not so. We merely want to see industrial democracy operate as, indeed, political democracy operates in this country and in most civilised countries of the world.</P>
    <P>People thought it unusual some hundreds of years ago that ordinary people should decide who should be their rulers.  I shall relate this, in case the Ceann Comhairle is getting anxious, to the matter that is under discussion here.  The root of our problems goes very much further than 6d an hour, or 9d an hour or anything else you care to mention.  Some hundreds of years ago people resented the idea that there should be political democracy and believed in the sovereignty of the king <Col N="1815" /> or prince or other ruler but we came to a situation over that period in which Deputy Hillery, a dispensary doctor from County Clare, is now a Minister for Labour and he now decides what trade union legislation should be introduced here.  He is a man who within the Cabinet will decide what new taxes will be imposed in the next Budget, what financial provisions will be made for the economic development of the country and for the running of the country as a whole.  However, all we propose as far as workers' democracy is concerned is that that should be imitated in industry.</P>
    <P>That is not unreasonable.  That is the kernel of the proposals we have in our policy statement.  Do not run away with the idea that this is a &ldquo;phoney&rdquo;, this is something which is practised, not as some would say, in Red China, Cuba or Russia, but in civilised countries in Europe.  It is practised in Sweden, for example.  People may say that it is impracticable now, that it is away out, but I guarantee that there will come, even in our time, a situation in which workers, who are the most important ingredient in industry, will have a right, as they should, to determine how the capital resources of their industry will be spent.</P>
    <P>We do not claim that this is a perfect document or that it will solve all our problems as far as industrial relations are concerned; we regard this as the first experiment.  Our proposals will be the first experiment to ensure that there will be these happy relations between workers and employers in industry.  At present the situation is that it is a case of &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo;, whether one is an employer or an employee, and there always has been that division.  The appointment of a few workers on a board, whether it is semi-State or State, or a private industry, is a bit of a sop but it does not solve the real problems.  However, I am not going to weary the House with our particular policy as far as this is concerned in the field of industrial democracy.  It is sufficient to say there must be an improvement and the improvement must be the participation of workers with their directors or management in determining how the <Col N="1816" /> capital resources of the firm should be spent.  We do not want to do all the things that it is alleged sometimes by the Taoiseach, sometimes by the Minister for Local Government and very often by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries we want to do.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister approached this whole business in the wrong way. Deputy Moore quoted the example of Britain where Mrs. Barbara Castle produced a White Paper.  There would have been much more thought given by the public, by trade unions and by employers to a White Paper containing the Minister's proposals with regard to industrial relations and trade union law.  The White Paper should have been one in which the Government laid down their philosophy on industrial relations, the organisation of trade unions and procedures as far as industrial relations are concerned.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it is not enough for Deputy Hillery, the Minister for Labour, nor was it enough for Deputy Seán Lemass, nor for the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, to say: &ldquo;We believe in free, collective bargaining.&rdquo;  Everybody believes in that but the machinery to be employed is the important thing, and the end result is the important thing, and so far we have had no clear statement from the Government so far as that is concerned.  One of the Bills, the Trade Union Bill, is too committed and apart altogether from that it is expressed in language that is too technical, language that is not easy to understand by those who will have to operate this machinery.  I am not talking only about the members of the Congress of Trade Unions, or members of trade unions but the ordinary people. I am sure that the Minister himself when he received the first draft of this Bill had to read it, perhaps, six times to understand what it meant and to understand its implications.  Indeed, no doubt this sort of criticism could be made of practically every piece of legislation that emanates from draftsmen in the offices of the various Ministers.</P>
    <P>We all believe that changes are necessary in industrial relations.  The trade unions unanimously admit that there is much room for improvement <Col N="1817" /> in trade union law and in fixing procedures for trade unions particularly when a strike is contemplated or when a strike is in operation.  The Minister should have issued a White Paper which did not commit him to anything but which laid down broad principles, a White Paper that would have evoked much more thought, comment and criticism from the trade unions, from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, from the various employers' associations and other people outside those groups.  As far as I can see, these measures are merely a tidying up process of the present machinery. I know that the Minister may say, when I suggest a White Paper that would evoke comment and criticism, that he has asked for people's advice already.  I am sure he did this. I am sure he may have done it on two or three occasions, but a White Paper is a different thing.  A White Paper is a document containing proposals that can be kicked around, a document that can be amended or added to and which in short will be the concern of all the people involved particularly and the general public as well.</P>
    <P>It is the business of the Minister for Labour to get comment.  It is not sufficient to say: &ldquo;I asked for it and did not get it.&rdquo;  He must go out and get it, particularly from those who are involved.  I reckon he did not get many suggestions when he asked for views on amending trade union laws and industrial relations.  I bet that the only real comment he got was from some of the employers' associations, maybe from the trade unions, and from Departments, but there was none of the widespread discussion on any of the proposals which is vitally necessary at present.  In my view these Bills will do nothing to prevent the sort of situation in which we find ourselves at present.  On the contrary, as I tried to demonstrate, and as I am sure some of my colleagues will more ably demonstrate, it is going to make the situation as far as industrial strife is concerned much more complicated and more frustrating, particularly for workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, now.  We have recognised this long ago.  The Minister would love us to suggest certain amendments and then he would have the halter around our necks.  He would do like he does at Question Time, ask us: &ldquo;Do you want me to take action in this?&rdquo; meaning: &ldquo;Do you want me to put workers in gaol again?&rdquo; No, we do not want that.  The Minister has a job to do and we have a job to do as well and we do not believe it is our job to give him a brand new Bill.  Our job is to amend it or if we see serious defects in a Bill to tell him to withdraw the Bill.  As I said, I believe that even if these Bills are passed into law they will not remove all the difficulties which we have in our negotiating machinery at present.  In any case, as far as industrial relations are concerned, our history has not been a very happy one.  Our system of negotiating for increases in wages has not been one with any great pattern of uniformity about it.  We have had various wage rounds conducted by different unions over different periods but I do not think anybody could say with certainty when the eighth round began or when the ninth, tenth or eleventh rounds began.</P>
      <P>The practice has been for unions to move on a certain date&mdash;perhaps, two or three go on a certain date.  There has been industrial strife, tension, hearings at the Labour Court in, say, February and March, and then in April and May you will have another bunch of unions going for an increase under the same round and so on for the whole 12 months.  All this gives the people the impression, when they hear or read reports of negotiation in the Labour Court, that there is more industrial strife in the country than, in fact, is the case.  Then, we always have the problem&mdash;it is not peculiar to the craft unions or the general unions&mdash;of leapfrogging. We have it particularly&mdash;I do not want to go into it&mdash;in some of the professional grades.  All these things, in my view, with the co-operation of the Minister, the employers and the trade union movement must be ironed out.  In short, they must be eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we have the difficulty of some firms&mdash;this is one of the big difficulties in the present dispute&mdash;which are not <Col N="1819" /> in the Federated Union of Employers. I am not suggesting now that the Minister should force every employer into the FUE.  I do not want to elaborate on this.  I am sure the Minister may know as much or more than I do about this.  We also have different systems of negotiation.  We have the difficulty of negotiation between the single union and the single firm and the groups with the single firm and the groups with, say, semi-State companies like Bord na Móna or CIE or the Sugar Company.  There is no really uniform pattern of industrial relations in a claim for wages or conditions or hours of employment.  In fact, there is no well-oiled machine for the trade unions or for the Labour Court for industrial relations generally.  There is nothing in this Bill that suggests that the Government have any idea of bringing in, with the agreement of those concerned, such a well-oiled machine that would eliminate much of the unnecessary strife and, should I say, much of the unnecessary publicity that even the smallest dispute commands in the news media today.</P>
    <P>I believe, therefore, that it should be possible to have contracts for an agreed period, contracts for wages and, if you like, contracts for hours of employment. Suppose there was a contract for wages for, say, two years.  If we could get agreement on this it would be known that in two years time, in 1971, the contract would come to an end. I should like to visualise a situation, and I hope we shall reach it, in which six months before the contract is terminated, the employers and trade unions get together to work out in advance some sort of general agreement as to what the wage increase should be, whether it would be a percentage or related to the cost of living.  I do not think the latter suggestion would be advantageous to certain workers because, as Deputy O'Leary pointed out, there are hundreds or thousands in the country who still have to reach a certain standard before they can be related to fluctuations in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>We have seen the complex situation in the present dispute where a long period of negotiation was needed.  If the contract idea were accepted, we <Col N="1820" /> need not be discussing the dispute when men are out of work.  Six months beforehand we could try to set down the guidelines as to what the pattern of wage increases should be and it could be operated before the current contracts ran out.  There must be negotiation but in most of our industrial disputes it appears that all the negotiations have been going on when men are out on strike.  This is not a very happy position.  It is very difficult for the trade union leaders; I am aware it is somewhat difficult for employers also to carry on negotiations such as we have had in the last few weeks when men are out of work.  It is because I believe that the time to talk about wages and conditions is when people are at work that I suggest the idea of a contract for one, two or three years.  Whether the Minister can reach that situation or not, I do not know. The Minister has not said a word about the ESB (Temporary Provisions) Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am not even putting it up as a bargaining point.</P>

      <P>Above all Ministers I do not want to be cross with the Minister for Labour but he is trying to sell this Trade Union Bill, as he said just now, <Col N="1822" /> for the repeal of the ESB (Temporary Provisions) Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy should have read my introductory speech.  I am trying to get a new approach which would put the ESB Act out of the line of my present thinking.  I should like to see that the new approach would be that the trade union establishes its authority.  This is what I want and I am really serious about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people have been saying that the trade unions should assert their authority.  That is all very well, but people should appreciate the difficulty which a trade union official has.  I am sure the Minister does.  In any case, I am now suggesting, despite what he said in this debate or in his opening speech, that the repeal of the ESB (Temporary Provisions) Act is something that the Minister should undertake as quickly as possible and I shall leave it at that.  I do not believe the trade union movement should be told by the Government that they will withdraw the ESB Act if the Trade Union Bill is accepted.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister mentioned this point in his speech.  I read his speech but it was about a fortnight ago and I hope he will forgive me if I cannot remember everything that was in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did give a firm promise to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions two or three years ago that, on the introduction of a Trade Union Bill, such as we have before us now, he would introduce the Trade Union Bill of 1963.  I understand Deputy James Tully has a question down about that tomorrow and the Minister will probably reserve his reply until then but, in any case, this promise has not yet been honoured&mdash; I do not know which Minister it is, but let me say by either the Minister for Labour or the Minister for Industry <Col N="1823" /> and Commerce.  That was a Bill the trade union movement regarded as vital to their activities and it was promised that it would be introduced when the 1966 Trade Union Bill was being introduced here.</P>
      <P>We have no serious objection to the Industrial Relations Bill and we do not intend to oppose it.  On the contrary, we see many improvements in the machinery for good industrial relations.  In section 4, however, we believe the Minister&mdash;I am sure he has got this comment already&mdash;should go further in the powers he takes to himself in appointing one deputy chairman to the Labour Court.  In order to ensure there will be no delay in hearing claims or disputes, and no queueing up, we believe that the Minister should have power to appoint a number of deputies. I cannot say how many.  The Minister's Department or the Labour Court will probably be able to suggest how many.</P>
      <P>I am sure, if asked, the trade union movement will be happy to oblige.  We do not believe the appointment of one deputy chairman will suffice to deal with the many claims that may come before the Labour Court in those years in which there will be wage rounds and demands for increases.</P>
      <P>I do not want to trespass on Deputy Tully's bailiwick because he will be able to comment much more profoundly on section 9 than I can, but section 9 provides that the various arbitration boards, wages boards or salary boards shall have included on the board one member of the Labour Court.  Why not the Agricultural Wages Board?  I assume the inclusion of such a member is to secure some sort of uniformity in wage and salary scales, conditions of employment, and so on.  But why not the Agricultural Wages Board?  There must be a particular reason for this but, no matter what the reason is, it will want to be a very good one to convince us that agricultural workers should not have the same sort of treatment as those listed here and the general workers who have ready access to the Labour Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will have to be clarification of the description &ldquo;industry&rdquo; in <Col N="1824" /> section 11.  I do not know whether or not this means manufacturing industry only.  In any case, it seems to be too narrow and too confined.  The word &ldquo;employments&rdquo; should be substituted because &ldquo;industry&rdquo; need not necessarily include all workers&mdash;road workers, forestry workers, workers employed in the Office of Public Works and manual workers generally in the Civil Service.  This is something at which the Minister should have a look before the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>We welcome section 13 in which the Minister takes power to appoint rights commissioners.  This is something that should alleviate a great deal of the dissatisfaction that there is now in industry, quite apart from the things which are included here&mdash;rates of pay, hours and times of work, annual holidays, and so on.  We applaud the improvements in the provisions contained in the Industrial Relations Bill and we will support the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Trade Union Bill is another kettle of fish.  Whether or not the Minister understands it, the trade union movement are anxious to have good trade union law.  I think the Minister appreciates their difficulties and the efforts they have been making in recent years.  I do not know whether he has seen the statement put out this evening by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in which they state they are contemplating changes in the trade union law, these changes to be put before a conference of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in the next three or four months when the annual conference takes place.  I know many people have been impatient, not alone with the Minister but with the trade union movement as well: I do not think critics understand the complex problems we have within the trade union movement itself and the really keen desire of the trade union movement to have, for example, a lesser number of unions, to provide for more amalgamations and for proper and democratic procedure as far as trade union law is concerned.</P>
    <P>In section 1 of the Bill the Minister gives certain definitions.  He gives the definition of a strike, but there is no <Col N="1825" /> definition of a lock-out.  If strike is defined, then lock-out should also be defined.  Dismissal should be defined. We may now have two definitions of strike, the definition in this Bill and the definition in the 1906 Act.  The Minister will need to convince us, too, that there is no real danger for trade unionists, particularly trade union officials, in section 4.  In that section we are told:</P>
    <P>No body of persons shall be granted or hold a group negotiation licence unless it is a body (in this Act referred to as an authorised group) which fulfills the following conditions...</P>
    <P>The conditions are set out.  If these conditions are transgressed legal action will be taken against somebody.  What does &ldquo;body of persons&rdquo; mean?  What the Minister may have in mind is a body of persons representing their trade unions.  I do not think I, or Deputy James Tully, or the Minister himself, would like to be named as one of the persons in that body.  The likelihood is that, when this comes to be interpreted by the courts I, in my personal capacity, as will Deputy James Tully, will be sued.</P>

We want it to be abundantly clear that it will be the unions, that it is they who will be sued as representatives of the unions rather than in their personal capacity.  I had a conversation with the Executive of Congress yesterday and I want to assure the Minister they are very chary and very doubtful about that particular description.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because it would be so simple, even by error, to transgress section 14.  There is a procedure laid down here.  I should like to read the first one.  Section 14 (1) provides:</P>
      <P>The following provisions shall apply in relation to the service of a strike notice:</P>
      <P>(a) the rules of a trade union shall be deemed to require that, before the service of a strike notice, a majority of the members of the trade union entitled to vote and voting in a secret ballot conducted by the trade union shall approve of such service;</P>
      <P>I should like to talk about this.  Maybe this needs a drafting amendment as well.  What does the Minister mean by &ldquo;a majority of the members of the trade union entitled to vote&rdquo;?  I can give a very simple example.  Suppose there is a small establishment that employs 100 members of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union and there is a dispute, and they want to go through the procedure in order to serve strike notice.  Can the Minister tell me what members of that union are entitled to vote?  In the trade union movement the definition of a person who is entitled to vote is a chap who has a clear card, a person who is in benefit, and has paid his weekly subscription to such and such a date.  He is entitled to vote.  The Minister says &ldquo;members of the trade union&rdquo;.  There are 160,000 members of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union. As it appears to me, a majority of those men would have to decide if they were going to go on strike.  There is nothing in this subsection to say &ldquo;the members of the union in that particular place of employment.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>I should like to question the Minister as to the mechanics of this.  A decision has been taken, say, in the afternoon in some place like Caherciveen.  The provision here is that a statement to <Col N="1830" /> the effect that strike notice has been served is to be deposited by the trade union concerned with the Labour Court on the date of such service.

I assume there will have to be an acknowledgement from the Labour Court to the effect that they have received it.  I do not know whether we can prevent the sort of situation which the Minister appears to be trying to prevent, where workers who have a legitimate grievance and feel very badly about it at the time it happens, will have to wait for three, four or five days before they can actually go on strike. That appears to be the intention of this section, because it would not be possible for them to take any sort of industrial action for about three or four days, because I assume the Labour Court will have to acknowledge receipt of the statement to the effect that they had served strike notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows what I said about good intentions. However, related again to section 14, suppose there is some slip up here, suppose there is some accident, suppose something is not done that should be done, and not through the fault of any official or anything like that, it can become an illegal strike in accordance with the provisions of this Bill.  These people would not have the protection of sections 2, 3 and 4 of the 1906 Act.  However, as I have said, we have been behaving in the past 20 minutes as if we were in Committee. It was not my intention.  I should prefer if the Minister would make his <Col N="1831" /> comprehensive statement when the debate concludes.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I just want to say, as far as the Industrial Relations Bill is concerned, that we applaud the improvements contained in it but, as far as the Trade Union Bill is concerned, we regard it as being loosely drafted&mdash; somewhat irresponsibly, I should say.  The Minister talked about his intentions in respect of some of the sections to which we take exception. Whether or not he can convince us in his final speech, I do not know.  From our examination of it, we believe it is a Bill that is not acceptable to the trade union movement or to the Labour Party.  I do not believe it is a major step in providing good trade union law. It does not appear to me to be a serious effort.  I still appeal to the Minister, at this stage&mdash;I say this to him seriously&mdash; to have another serious talk with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions between now and the Committee Stage. Believe you me, they would be much more critical than I have been, if they spoke to the Minister on the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the fact that we have been discussing these pieces of legislation in the midst of the present very grave situation is probably useful.  Indeed, I think it is completely unrealistic to suggest that it would be possible to get a time in the history of this country when there was absolute industrial peace.  The fact, however, that the country at present faces what can be regarded only as one of the most serious situations that has ever affected the economy highlights the problem and emphasises the urgency of getting a practical solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present situation is not merely serious but tragic.  We have seen now, for weeks, the spectacle of absolute chaos in industrial relations and a position in which the whole industrial situation&mdash;indeed, the trade union movement&mdash;appears to be chaotic and leaderless.  That situation has developed to such an extent that we have not merely the comments of people in the press but expressions of concern by the President of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Mr. Dunne, and his <Col N="1832" /> voice almost alone crying out in the wilderness and expressing his personal concern and anxiety for the situation which has developed.  I feel, therefore, that, in considering these measures tonight, it is important that we should look at them in as calm and dispassionate a manner as possible but that in no way lessens the sense of urgency or serious concern with which Deputies on all sides of the House should view the position.</P>
    <P>It is generally recognised that no form of legislation can assure industrial peace unless there is goodwill and co-operation on the part of all concerned. Our objective and aim in this House should be to frame our legislation so that these objectives may be facilitated.  If possible, the framing of such legislation should be after consultation with the different interests, when the terms, if not in absolute details but certainly in their general direction and heading, should be discussed and those concerned abide by the discussion.</P>
    <P>It is important that, in considering this matter, Deputies should shed themselves of prejudice.  Earlier in this debate, I listened to Deputy Michael O'Leary who gave the impression that everybody was prejudiced except himself and the Labour Party. That is completely unrealistic.  I believe there is genuine anxiety on the part of Deputies on all sides of the House to work out some form of practical solution.  But, leaving aside the question of what form the permanent legislation may have, the present situation is such&mdash;I think this should now be emphasised&mdash;that, whether the parties are invited to a conference by the Taoiseach or by the Minister for Labour on behalf of the Government, it is a matter of the very gravest urgency that either the Taoiseach or the Minister should call all parties together and arrange for a discussion &mdash;if you like without any agenda&mdash; to see what can be done to work out a procedure for the examination of the present dispute or, alternatively, agree to the establishment of an independent inquiry by some body, judicial or non-judicial if that is regarded as more acceptable, which would report and make recommendations. <Col N="1833" /> The present position, if it continues, will result in an extension of the very serious consequences which were referred to yesterday by one chairman of an exporting company&mdash; the United Distillers&mdash;and which, I understand, apply in many other cases as well.</P>
    <P>The port of Cork is in a most serious position.  The situation that has developed has shown, in the most glaring form, the inadequacies or deficiencies of our industrial relations system.  It has highlighted the urgency of considering this problem anew and of discussing the question in as detailed a manner as possible.  It is quite true that a matter of this sort is best discussed when there is industrial peace or certainly when there is less disruption due to some industrial dispute or other than is the case at the present time.  On the other hand, the gravity of the present situation, the consequences for the economy, the effect on the lives not merely of those directly employed but on the lives of defenceless people&mdash;the members of families and others not concerned with it but who are anxious for peace and order&mdash;make it imperative, and indeed probably strengthens the determination of those who are looking on at the situation, to try to achieve a <i>modus operandi</i> that will produce some order out of the present chaos.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Minister's speech and in the course of other speeches during this debate, there has been reference to strikes.  The Minister said: &ldquo;80 per cent of the man days lost are lost because of disputes about wages and hours of employment so that our main economic trouble and the main hardships imposed on workers in the community arise in the area of settlement of wages and incomes.&rdquo; That, I think, emphasises the urgency of a prices and incomes policy.  I know it will be argued&mdash;and it has been repeatedly said by the Ministers, by the previous Taoiseach, by commentators and others&mdash;that a prices and incomes policy will not work or has not worked.  Because it has not worked perfectly, because it has not been a complete success, is no reason why some effort should not be <Col N="1834" /> made, some serious effort, to make it effective.</P>
    <P>Over three years ago the NIEC in November, 1965, advocated and recommended it.  On that body there were representatives of employers and trade unions as well as those who had no responsibility for either of these bodies but who represented the State through particular Departments.  Those people signed a report dated 5th November, 1965, and a significant part of that report, I believe, was contained in paragraph 50 which read:</P>
    <P>By an incomes policy we mean a policy which is concerned with the behaviour of all money incomes, i.e. wages and salaries, incomes of farmers and self-employed persons, professional earnings, rents, profits and realised capital gains&mdash;rather than a policy which focuses attention on particular components of the total such as wages or profits.  Too often an incomes policy tends to be regarded as a wages policy.  We repudiate, as inadequate and inequitable, any incomes policy which does not embrace all categories of money income.</P>
    <P>I think that is a reasonable statement, a reasonable recommendation.  Recently tributes have been paid to trade union officials.  With the exception of Mr. Dunne, the only officials to whom tributes were paid were the late John Conroy and the late Jim Larkin.  Both of them signed this report.  If we want to pay some tribute to their memory and show some desire to accept whatever guidance or leadership they gave, we should start by at least making an effort to work a prices and incomes policy.</P>
    <P>I have said, and I want to repeat, that I believe the Government should approach this on the basis of consultation and discussion.  So far as the Minister is concerned, he has shown considerable evidence of his personal desire to get an agreement by consultation and discussion.  I think all of us, as Deputy Corish said, accept the Minister's actions as <i>bona fide</i> but there has been in this country, and there is no use denying it, an arrogant attitude on the part of the Government. That applied in two or three notable <Col N="1835" /> cases.  I do not want to-night to re-open discussions that have taken place, but the referendum was one example.  If the Minister or the Government had shown any desire to approach it in a reasonable fashion there might have been a different approach all round and a different result.  That was one example.  There has been an example in the case of the Criminal Justice Bill, in respect of sections 30 and 31.  There is a modified view now but that merely illustrates a different approach by different Ministers in different circumstances. There has been this attitude in respect of the university merger.  The approach laid down was: &ldquo;You accept this proposal.  That is our approach, no other&rdquo;.  Now I believe there is again a modification there under very great pressure.  I do not like using the word &ldquo;moderation&rdquo; because the words &ldquo;moderate approach&rdquo; have had a rough time recently in a part of this country, but I do recommend the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.  I believe that the majority of trade unionists, the majority of workers and the majority of employers are reasonable people.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy O'Leary who said here last week that their policy had been misrepresented.  Maybe that is true.  We have all had that experience. I think one reason why it was misrepresented was that there was a proposal announced somewhere by some Labour Party spokesman that they proposed to nationalise Guinness's and Waterford Glass.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We have advocated the participation of workers.  I spoke last year in the Television Club in Harcourt Street and I expressed what I believe is the general concern of a very large number of people in this country that there must be a far greater participation by workers in the running of business.  I expressed then, and I want to repeat now, that that does not mean that the concern should <Col N="1837" /> be nationalised.  I am all in favour of nationalising Potez, something that has failed.  If anyone suggests nationalising that, he will have my full support. Anything to resurrect a &ldquo;dead duck&rdquo; like that in any form will have my support.  But I think it is all wrong to suggest that the interests of this country or, above all, the interests of the workers can be helped, assisted, promoted or encouraged by nationalising concerns that have been established, not with State capital, not with capital provided from the taxpayer, but with the work and risk of Irish people putting their own money into it.</P>
      <P>We tried, and the late Deputy Norton tried as a member of the inter-Party Government&mdash;he went abroad and we went abroad with him as members of that Government or as representatives of it, jointly and severally&mdash; to get foreign capital in here.  We succeeded in cases like the Whitegate oil refinery because we were able to attract capital here, encouraging them and giving them the confidence that, not merely would they get a return on their money invested here, but that it would not be nationalised at the whim of political opportunists who suggested that it should be nationalised.  That is our policy and that was the policy that got in here the Whitegate oil refinery. I reject any suggestion of nationalisation as being against the workers' interests and against the interests of this country.  Not merely would it prevent capital coming in, but it might result in capital going out.  It might result, maybe, in capital moving out because of instability and insecurity and because of the fact that we may become some type of Cuban Republic in which any sort of political adventurer who secures office can wipe out the established sweat and work not merely of the managers but also of the workers and those who are employed in a business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is making the same speech as the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Blaney, made last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said last year, it will have to be increasingly recognised <Col N="1838" /> in the future that the worker has as much at stake in the business in which he works as the manager and the owner; perhaps more so, because the worker's whole livelihood may depend on his job whereas the shareholders may have other resources.  I believe we are well behind some of the other European countries in our recognition of this and in making the necessary arrangements to ensure, for example, that the worker is given not just the privilege but the right of full consultation with management on all matters which significantly affect his future.</P>
      <P>That does not mean that the workers should take over the boss's job.  Far from it.  In any organisation there has to be somebody responsible for taking decisions.  I agree with Deputy Corish when he said that there should be the same approach in industry as in political democracy, that those who are concerned in industry should take decisions in the same way as in political democracy.  I took down the words he said: &ldquo;...industrial democracy will work as political democracy operates&rdquo;. However, it means accepting responsibility as well as claiming rights. Responsibility means bringing it in here and if the electors vote in a particular way you cannot shrug it off by saying we will not accept responsibility.</P>
      <P>I want to repeat what I said last week in the Mansion House.  Nobody is interested in saving this country.  We must save it ourselves.  That calls for effort from all political Parties.  Nobody can save this country except the Irish people.  Let me continue with what I said last year.  It was this Party that established not merely the first but the most successful of State enterprises because we believed it was the right thing.  We are not people with theoretical prejudices about one form of operation or another.  We are prepared to operate a State enterprise that works, if it is necessary, if it is desirable, if it is the proper way to do it. We do not believe in taking over the outworn, theoretical socialist policies that have been tried in Britain and discarded because they failed.  That would be crazy politics and still crazier economics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the concept of industrial democracy <Col N="1839" /> that has been increasingly talked about it is important that we should realise the legitimate aspirations of the worker for increased participation and consultation in industry.  I do not believe in being bemused by cliches or catch-phrases.  We want a system that will work, a system that will ensure that the workers' rights are safeguarded and protected.  As I have said before, we have many advantages in this country.  There is no traditional difference here between capital and labour as in other countries.  There is no wide disparity of classes or groups in the community.  Undoubtedly some people are more prosperous than others.  Unfortunately there are many in very poor circumstances.</P>
    <P>They are the people about whom we should be really concerned.  I agree with the concern that was expressed by Deputy O'Leary about the number of people&mdash;I think it is 38 per cent&mdash; who are below £11 a week.  That includes not merely those gainfully employed but also retired persons, persons on fixed incomes, pensioners.  These are the categories that are adversely and seriously affected by the five per cent rise in the cost of living last year.  The consumer price index figure, which shows a figure of five per cent, does not really disclose the full facts of the situation.  Price rises have been, in many cases, far greater than five per cent.  Five per cent is the actual price increase reflected in the items included in the cost of living index figure, which is of limited application and of limited validity.  The rise in the cost of living in the broad sense, as it affects people and as they understand it in the ordinary human way, is far greater, far more serious.  The people that it is our responsibility as legislators and as public representatives to look after and whose burdens we must try to ease are the people to whom Deputy O'Leary referred, the people under £11 a week, people on fixed incomes, small farmers, small shopkeepers, retired persons, persons unable through some form of group action, through trade unions or otherwise, to make an effective claim for a larger share of the national cake.</P>
    <P>The importance of again endeavouring to have a prices and incomes policy <Col N="1840" /> has been highlighted by the present crisis.  The fact that it has not been done in the past is no reason why we should not make a real effort now. They have had a try at it in England. Their society is far more complex and they have far greater economic divergencies and a far bigger population to deal with.  It is true it has not been a remarkable success, but there have been some advances, and some improvements.  We have a much smaller economy, a much smaller population. There is no reason why we should not endeavour to operate on a broad front a prices and incomes policy.</P>
    <P>I want to endorse what has been said elsewhere, that that policy should embrace everyone.  I do not think any Deputy, and certainly any Deputy who has concern for the reputation of people in public life, likes a situation in which Ministers or Deputies or Senators fix their own salaries.  That situation has grown up, but we need not inquire how it developed; it has always been the position.  I never want to shirk responsibility, but I think we should all feel more satisfied that not merely was justice being done but that it was apparent that justice was being done if these decisions were taken by a tribunal or other body that would, after examination, make a recommendation.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the point that I believe an effort must be made to establish a more uniform system of wage and salary adjustment whether it is by means of arbitration or conciliation. I am satisfied and I think most people recognise that the Labour Court has done, in very difficult circumstances, a good job within its limitation in respect of both the numbers of the court and the staff and personnel available to it.  I believe the proposal to enlarge the Labour Court is good.  It is obvious that the number of cases that have to be discussed in modern times, with the very steep and continuous rise in the cost of living, means that the present system is not sufficient, that the court should be divided up.  I believe there is another aspect that should be considered.  The court should sit more frequently in provincial centres as well. It should make an effort to recruit&mdash; and this is no reflection because I think <Col N="1841" /> everybody recognises the immense contribution that the present and past conciliation officers and their staff have made but this is a job for trained industrial consultants&mdash;to recruit staff who have experience in those fields.  I have consistently expressed the view, both from inside and outside Government, that the Civil Service is not geared for commercial activities.</P>
    <P>We all found that out with State companies.  That is no reflection on the Civil Service.  It was never trained for that.  The training civil servants get does not fit them for commercial or industrial activity.  The validity of that fact is proved by the experience of the successes which individual civil servants have achieved when they devoted themselves to particular problems. There is no doubt that many of them have achieved eminence and success in individual spheres, such as the Labour Court, or in respect of industrial activity in some of the State or even nonstatutory bodies.  The broad picture is that the Civil Service is not trained, is not geared and was never intended to do the tasks it is now being asked to perform.  An effort should be made to recruit trained personnel and operate them in conjunction with the Labour Court and in association with the existing conciliation or arbitration officers.</P>
    <P>I believe that this problem must, as I said last year, be approached on the basis of a new look at the industrial situation here.  I believe there is a genuine desire on the part of most employers as well as most trade unions and workers, to operate some form of works committees that will ensure consultation. It does not matter what those are called.  We are all bemused here by cliches, catchcries and phrases which have some emotive effect but no practical effect in achieving harmony through reason and discussion.  I listened to President Nixon on the radio the other night when he said he hoped to have genuine consultation. That is the operative thing.  He was referring to discussions with the Soviet Union.  I think it was in that connection that he used the phrase &ldquo;genuine consultation&rdquo;.  That is the operative thing.</P>
    <P>The Minister expressed his desire to <Col N="1842" /> evolve from consultation with the trade union organisation and with the FUE legislation that will prove acceptable to both of them, if that is possible, or to frame some such form of legislation. In so far as we are concerned, we are anxious to get some form of workable legislation.  We are not wedded to any of the proposals in either of those Bills.  If there is a better alternative, we are prepared to support it; or if there are amendments which should be made to improve on the terms of those Bills, we will support them and we will endeavour to draft some improvements ourselves.</P>
    <P>Genuine consultation means discussing and being prepared to accept suggestions from the other side, whoever they are.  That is where I want again to emphasise the warning I gave initially. I believe the Minister is reasonable in his approach and is anxious for fair consultation, but we have seen evidence of too many Ministers on too many occasions, dealing with too many different matters showing an arrogance and an intolerance.  There is an improvement it is true, recently.  There has been a proposal, which we have not seen yet, to modify the sections of the Criminal Justice Bill.  There is some suggestion there will be further consultation with the universities.  This is a small country.  This is not the property of any one person.  It is not the property of any one political Party or any section of the community.  It is the property of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>We recently said a great deal in the course of celebrating the Fiftieth Anniversary of the First Dáil about the struggle, the fight and the sacrifices of the past.  We will be the first generation that proved unworthy of the trust reposed in us if we do not seek by rational and reasonable discussion to iron out the differences not to magnify them, not to push theory to the extremes, not to push individual Parties or individual policies to the utmost, but to consult together, to achieve our objectives by a reasoned approach.  We can do this before the world if we behave in a rational, reasonable and responsible manner.</P>
    <P>That imposes obligations on each and every one of us.  It imposes an obligation for politicians to sink Party <Col N="1843" /> or personal arrogance of a Party or personal viewpoint if we get a better viewpoint&mdash;a more progressive, a more advantageous, a more realistic viewpoint. I believe recent events in this country, in both parts of it, have shown that people do not want to adopt the attitude: that, and that alone, is the approach.  There is nothing easier.  We have seen it in this country.  We have not to look any further.  We have seen it in France and in the USA and in other places.  There is nothing easier than to create chaos or anarchy.  Anyone can do that, but it takes statesmen, it takes men and people of courage, people like James Dunne in the trade union movement, people who are prepared to stand up and to express their views, it takes reasonable and responsible men with a rational and a fair approach to evolve from all the discussion an arrangement and a system that may not give to any section of the community what they feel is their right, or what they are prepared to fight or argue for, but that will be made available for the community, for the people who really need it, for the lowly paid workers Deputy O'Leary rightly referred to, for the retired personnel, for the pensioners, for the sick and for those who have no trade union or no means of increasing their incomes by any action.  Those are the people we must be concerned about.</P>
    <P>A situation is developing in this country at the moment in which trade unions are taking action against each other in a way which, if it happened 50 years ago, 60 years ago or 100 years ago between the trade unions and employers, people might regard it as reasonable or rational or to be expected. But the situation developing in this country at the moment is a reflection on everyone.  It is a reflection on ourselves.  The challenge is there to be faced.  We are prepared to do our part and we do not mind standing up and saying we accept responsibility; but that means responsibility on all sides, on elected representatives, whether they are Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour.  It is not sufficient to say everyone else is prejudiced, that everyone else has a narrower view <Col N="1844" /> conceived out of past dissensions.  We want to see in this country a system under which all Irishmen can operate, can live up to what Tone described as the common name of Irishmen and we are prepared to work for that.</P>

      <P>I was going to use the phrase &ldquo;young pup&rdquo; but I shall refrain from using it.  I hope, Sir, that you will be able to keep Deputy O'Leary in control.  I went to some trouble to read Deputy O'Leary's speech which took him almost four hours to make and which contained nothing; there was nothing constructive in it.  This is a subject which is the concern of every person in this country today and people are looking to Dáil Éireann to see if we have a responsible attitude towards the problems that are besetting us at the present time.</P>
      <P>A lot of lip-service is paid to the lower paid sections of the community, the people who Deputy O'Leary says, earn £11 or less a week.  It is a well known fact that many of these people who are earning this kind of money are earning it principally because of the fact that many of the workers who are earning considerably more will not allow these lower paid workers to earn any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, for example, we were to say that we would have a minimum wage of £12 or £13 a week and that no one in this country should earn less than that, those workers who are earning £13, £14, £15 or £16 per week would look for a <i>pro rata</i> increase, so that there would always be this gap between the different categories of workers.  The ones who previously received £11 or £12 would then receive £14 or £15 and they would, therefore, be in the <Col N="1845" /> same position as they are at the moment.  Deputy O'Leary, in his speech, referred to the fact that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I want to point out to the Deputy how negative his speech was.  In Volume 238, No. 10, of the Dáil Debates he says, at column 1408:</P>
      <P>It is not sufficient to come along to the man who has worked at a job for 20 or 30 years and say: &ldquo;Technological change deprives you of your job.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I consider that to be an irresponsible statement because if we do not make technological changes in our factories we will not be employing anybody in our factories.  It is stupid and unthinking statements like this which cause a lot of confusion in the minds of the people.</P>
      <P>In this small country of ours, there are approximately 100 trade unions and it is an accepted fact that responsible trade union leaders would like to see this number reduced.  One of the things which we hope to achieve in this Trade Union Bill is to encourage unions to merge.  One of the steps which we have taken to encourage the amalgamation of the smaller unions is to provide financial assistance to meet any unusual expenses.  Recently, I spoke to a trade unionist in this country and I asked him for his views on trade unions.  I told him that a number of people had so far in this debate referred to foreign-based unions here; he was a member of a foreign-based union and when I asked him why he was not in an Irish union he asked me if I was mad.  He said that the Irish trade unions were in such a state of shambles that one would need to be mad to join them.  This is an unfortunate thing to say.  If anything, we have tried in this Bill to get unions to come together.</P>

    <P>In my view, it is an impossible situation when employers have to discuss new arrangements with 20 or more <Col N="1846" /> different unions in the one job and very often, as we can see in the present strike, people who have no voice in their union are out of work through the actions of a few people.  People in this country want to get back to work but they are being prevented from doing so by a minority of people.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Relations Bill, as we know, is providing for an expansion of the Labour Court and this is an excellent idea.  The trade unions belong to the workers and the position should not be <i>vice versa</i>.  It is sometimes the case that the workers are the property of the trade unions and God help anybody who tries to change that position or to intervene in it.  It is about time that the average trade unionist thought of looking more closely at what is going on within his union.</P>
    <P>Within the past couple of years I remember the Minister for Labour saying that the number of people in any trade union who actually came along to trade union meetings would average about three per cent of the workers.  That is a sad situation and the kind of trouble which we have today is a result of the workers not taking a more active line and of not getting to know what the policy of their union is.  Something which no one has mentioned is that a strike means a failure.  A strike should only be used as a last resort but instead of that, we have strikes first and negotiations afterwards. The seriousness of the present trouble has not yet sunk in with those people who are on strike but later, perhaps, when the result of all this strife is assessed, a very poor light indeed will be shown.</P>
    <P>We have here at present just one strike after another.  Each time a settlement is reached, a claim comes from another group of workers and if the claim is resisted, a close-down occurs again and so it goes on in a never ending series of strikes.  During the past few years and while this legislation was being drafted, I have been reading the Minister's speeches and I have kept many of them.  I have seen the efforts he made to bring about the amalgamation of unions; he has made efforts to get unions to come <Col N="1847" /> forward with suggestions as to how he might help them provide better machinery for settling disputes.</P>
    <P>In a speech which the Minister made to the workers on the 3rd January of this year, he said:</P>
    <P>You will, I trust, not take it amiss if I suggest that loyalty by the members to the idea of trade unions should be always supported by attention to the affairs of the union.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1848" /> This is what I should like to see happen more and more&mdash;that members of the trade unions would pay more attention to what is going on at executive level.  I wish to pay tribute to the courageous Jim Dunne.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 27th February, 1969.</P>
