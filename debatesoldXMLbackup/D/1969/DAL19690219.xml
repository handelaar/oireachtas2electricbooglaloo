      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power the extent to which the volume of applications for rural electrification has increased over the past 12 months; what steps have been taken to enable the ESB to deal expeditiously with this work; and when he expects that the present waiting list will be cleared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time of the introin <Col N="1203" /> duction of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill, 1968 it was estimated that about 26,000 houses would seek connection in the period from 1st April, 1967, to the completion of the rural electrification post development scheme in 1973.  Following the reductions in special service charges announced at that time the volume of acceptances of the ESB's terms increased far more than was expected. In the two year period to 31st March, 1969, it is estimated that a total of 16,000 additional houses will have been connected.  It is now estimated that in the four year period to 31st March, 1973, a further 35,000 new connections will be required making a total of 51,000 as against the original estimate of 26,000 connections.  A contributory factor to this growth in demand has been the large increase in the number of new houses being built in rural areas.</P>
      <P>The ESB are doing their utmost to cope with the new situation.  This involves increasing annual capital expenditure and training additional personnel. They have increased their budget for rural electrification and also their rate of connection.</P>
      <P>In carrying out the rural electrification post development scheme the ESB do not maintain a waiting list as such but canvass the country in a planned sequence of areas.</P>
      <P>In spite of the steps being taken by the ESB the progress of the scheme, in terms of areas completed, is now behind schedule.  It is expected that the scheme will be completed in most of the country by 1973 but there may be some areas where the completion of the scheme will take longer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by Dublin County Council that the number of housing estates in the Rathdown area which have not yet been taken in charge by the council is 36.  The primary reason for the delay in taking many of these estates in charge is the failure of developers to complete certain works to the satisfaction of the council.  I understand that it is hoped that 13 of the estates will be taken in charge by the council within the next six months.  Arrangements have been made for outstanding works to be undertaken, or work is in progress, in the case of four estates, while in ten more cases requests to the council from developers for the taking in charge of estates which are stated to be completed have only recently been received. In six cases, further negotiations with developers are necessary.  Finally there are three cases in the Rathdown <Col N="1210" /> area where estates appear to have been completed but to date no request has been received from the developers for the taking of the estates in charge.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the problem confronting the people in the Redesdale Estate in Stillorgan? This estate was completed in 1955 and it still remains to be taken in charge. Now, the blame lies at someone's doorstep.  As public representatives, we are continually pleaded with to have the problem dealt with.  It is representative of the type of problem that exists in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown.  Can the Minister give any indication as to when the Redesdale Estate, for instance, which was completed in 1955 will be taken in charge?  The Minister may be aware of this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Some legislative action has already been taken to provide improved powers for dealing with the problem to which the Deputy refers. Section 63 of the Road Traffic Act, 1968, substituted a new section for section 97 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and the new provision empowers me to make regulations authorising and providing for the removal, storage and disposal of vehicles which have been, or appear to have been, abandoned on public road or public car park or which have been parked illegally.  Regulations under the section are at present being prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the use of privatelyowned land for the dumping of old vehicles or parts of vehicles, it is expressly laid down in section 3 of the <Col N="1216" /> Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, that where land becomes used for such a purpose the use of the land is materially changed and planning permission for the new use is accordingly required.  If planning permission is not sought or obtained, the planning authority could have recourse to their enforcement powers under the Act to secure that the use is discontinued.  I appreciate that the powers contained in the 1963 Act may not be effective to deal with all cases of dumping of old vehicles on private land and particularly with the anti-social activity of people who dump old vehicles or parts of vehicles on private property without the consent of the owner or occupier of the land.  This problem is difficult to deal with by legislative means but the position will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>There is on every chassis <Col N="1218" /> a number.  Would the Minister not think it proper where a person discards a car on a street such as Merrion Road and removes all the plates and so forth, that an example of a case of that kind be made by getting the chassis number, following the history of the car and prosecuting the person who was last registered as owner?  I admit it is a cumbersome procedure but, if an example were made of that kind, I feel it might mitigate this abuse.</P>

      <P>I propose to undertake a major reorganisation and expansion of the placement and guidance functions of the Employment Service.  Over a period, these function will, as far as practicable, be separated from the benefit-paying work of employment exchanges and will be located in new offices with specially selected and trained staff.  The reorganisation work will be spread over a few years but I intend to make a start this year in some of the bigger centres of population.</P>

Furthermore, in junior classes it forms an integral part of the teaching of other subjects, instruction being given by means of singing simple rhymes.  For these reasons it is essential that a sufficient number of women national teachers be able to sing.

      <P>To get this thing into perspective, I want to say, first of all, only ten per cent of the women who qualify for the oral test fail singing. I am also concerned by the fact that this should be a compulsory sphere, as it were, in regard to teacher training.  I have set up a committee of inspectors in my Department who will go into the whole question of singing and its position in relation to training. I am awaiting a recommendation from this committee.  Having said that, and while I have an open mind in relation to the matter raised by Deputy Andrews, it is important that we should preserve some element of teacher training and singing is an important aspect of that.  I would like to see it preserved but I have views that would indicate, somewhat on the line of what Deputy Andrews recommends, that the obligatory aspect might be eliminated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand, however, that the institute is formulation a scheme for the development of the accountancy profession in Ireland.  This is part of a joint effort with the other major accountancy bodies.  The institute hopes thereby to establish closer links between all the bodies concerned and to standards training procedures and educational requirements.  In this context <Col N="1227" /> preliminary discussions have taken place between representatives of the institute and my Department regarding the entry and other educational requirements of the institute.</P>
    <P>I may add with regard to the results in Part 5 of the ACA examination held in December, 1968 that the institute is itself very concerned at the high failure rate at this examination and is endeavouring to ascertain the causes for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to declare, Sir, a qualified personal interest in that my own son was recently a successful candidate at the examination in question and so was not involved.  Does the Minister not agree with me that a professional course for a profession on which young Irishmen and young Irish-women are invited to embark must be a badly-administered course in the light of the following very approximate figures showing the percentage of passes in the different years of this five-year course?  The percentage of passes in the first year is 87; in the second year 63; in the third year 49; in the fourth year 32 and in the fifth year 13.  Surely those figures must make one wonder if it is a badly administered course, bearing in mind that it carries a young man or a woman into his or her 23rd or 24th year before they are confronted with an educational hurdle which, ultimately, may be insurmountable for them?  This is combined with the fact that there is paid employment for unqualified persons who have done their articles in this profession.  Will the Minister give this matter close consideration so as to provide that the educational course will be reformed in order to eliminate, at the early stages, unsuitable candidates and to direct them into other channels instead of keeping them until their 23rd or 24th year and then repeatedly ploughing them until, eventually, they go out into life without qualification of any kind?</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 49 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>Existing legislation empowers county borough councils, urban district councils and town commissioners to provide meals for children attending national schools within their areas.  Meals may also be provided for children attending national schools in prescribed Gaeltacht areas.  The nature of the meals provided is a matter for the local authorities who are recouped half the cost of the meals.</P>
      <P>Hot cooked meals are provided under the school meals scheme in 12 schools for about 1,070 pupils.  Information is not available in my Department as to the total number of young people attending school who are or are not receiving hot meals at midday.</P>
      <P>Any proposals from a local authority for the provision or extension of hot meals in its area under the school meals scheme will receive due consideration.</P>

      <Col N="1230" /> Surely the answer here is that&mdash;probably in co-operation with the Minister for Education&mdash;a directive would be issued asking the schools to instal equipment to provide a hot meal?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>A person who is employed for rehabilitation purposes under a contract of service, other than by a local or public authority, is insurable under the Social Welfare Acts. A person so employed by a local or public authority is insurable under the Acts for occupational injuries benefit but is specifically excluded from insurance for the other benefits by virtue of Part II of the First Schedule to the Social Welfare Act, 1952.</P>
      <P>I will have the matter re-examined but it must be borne in mind that a considerable number of the persons involved are already insured and, in certain cases, are in receipt of disability benefit while engaged in employment for rehabilitation purposes, thus maintaining the continuity of their insurance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to similar questions on 28th <Col N="1231" /> November, 1968, it has been decided by an appeals officer in a test case that the employment of contract or part-time meter readers by the ESB is not under a contract of service and thus is not insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.  An appeals officer is a statutory officer and I have no power to interfere with his decision.</P>
      <P>The decision is being applied to contract meter readers generally.  If any meter reader considers that the decision should not apply to his case it is open to him to apply to have his case dealt with separately by a deciding officer and to appeal against the latter's decision if dissatisfied.  If no such application is received from the three persons mentioned, arrangements will be made to refund them the contributions they have paid less the amount of any benefit paid to them on foot of those contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">

      <P>I feel sure the Minister appreciates that many of these meter readers employed by the ESB are people who, as a result of medical handicap or physical disability, are unable to pursue ordinary manual work and, therefore, by disallowing them social welfare benefit, a grievous hardship has been imposed on them.  Many of these people were insured all their lives.  Their lifetime of stamps and creditworthiness in respect of social welfare has been jeopardised by this particularly mean decision on the part of the ESB in respect of their employees&mdash;the meter readers&mdash;who are doing a very good job of work for them.  Would the Minister consult with the Department of Transport and Power in order to bring these people back under the social welfare code? Very great hardship has accured to them.  Many of them, to my knowledge, are now destitute and are dependent on home assistance as a result of this particularly harsh decision.</P>

The stamps affixed to his 1967 insurance card were in respect of employment as a contract meter reader but this employment is not insurable under the Social Welfare Acts and therefore the employment contributions were not properly payable in respect of that employment.

      <P>The management of the company have been considering additional products which might be introduced at the Labbadish factory, but there are a number of restricting factors, including the specialised nature of the plant.</P>

      <P>I agree.  As I have said, on the basis of the operations as they are at present there is really very little hope of continous employment.  The Deputy will appreciate that the operation of the factory depends largely on the supply of potatoes which, in turn, is governed by the market.  They want to get the surplus in the factory.  This is the reason they are considering additional products in order to ensure more continuous employment.</P>

I now understand that the Drogheda cement factory has resumed production.</P>

      <P>The form in which information regarding immunisation against poliomylitis has been furnished by health authorities to my Department does not permit the extraction of information in the precise form requested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>An intensive national immunisation against poliomyelitis was carried out in 1965.  In that year 237,637 children in the pre-school age group, representing approximately 88 per cent of all children under five years of age, were presented for immunisation.  By the close of the year 188,313 of these children had received the full course of immunisation (three separate feedings) which takes up to four months to complete. In 1966 and 1967 the numbers of pre-school children presented for immunisation were 38,816 and 48,765 respectively.  The numbers of children completing immunisation in these years were 38,282 and 44,362 respectively.</P>
      <P>The returns in respect of 1968 are not yet available from health authorities. When received, they will include particulars for children under two years of age.  Immunisation is not normally commenced before a child has reached the age of six months.</P>

      <P>I am not yet in a position to say what contribution, additional to the statutory grant at the rate of 50 per cent, will be made from the Central Fund towards the cost of health services in 1969-70.  In view of the very substantial increase in estimates of health expenditure I have asked the health authorities to reexamine their estimates and to try to achieve substantial reductions.  The amount of the contribution that can be provided from Central Funds will be determined when details of the reduced estimates are available.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware that the prospect of substantial reductions being made by the re-examination is not very hopeful and, in the circumstances, has the Minister any plans to provide additional relief?  In the Dublin Health Authority this year the increase due to health charges is about 5/- and, in fact, I think it is more than 50 per cent of the increase in certain areas of the Health Authority.  In those circumstances, therefore, would the Minister consider an extra grant in respect of the rates burden?</P>

However, since the result of the inquiries of the health authorities will have some bearing, I obviously cannot give a definite figure now.</P>

      <P>It is presumed that the question relates to a 32-acre holding in the townland of Barrahaurin which has been surrendered to the Land Commission in exchange for a new holding.  The Land Commission are anxious to secure additional land in this district which would enable them to prepare a more balanced scheme of land settlement than the 32-acre holding, by itself, would permit and, to this end, they are at present investigating an offer of another holding in the townland of Barrahaurin.</P>

    <Title>Curragh of Kildare Bill, 1968: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard) Michael Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to enable my Department to have more effective control of sheep grazing on the Curragh and to ensure that only those persons entitled to do so shall graze sheep on the Curragh and that legal proceedings instituted against persons contravening the law will be successful.</P>
      <P>I had already stated the objects of the Bill, but I think it well to reiterate them lest there be any misunderstanding in that regard.  There has been apparently a practice on the Curragh in connection with sheep grazing where the owners of the rights rented those rights to other people or allowed other people to use their rights for a given period of time.  It is not proposed to interfere with that practice.  We know that such a practice obtains, and in the future it will be a matter for the renter to satisfy the Maor on the Curragh that he has the authority or the permission of the legal owner of the right to put sheep on the Curragh. That makes the position perfectly clear to anybody who is interested in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many matters have been raised on this Bill that one could say had no real bearing on the Bill, but when one considers the general picture in regard to the user of lands on the Curragh, it is no harm whatsoever to have an open and full discussion on the matters that have been raised.  The primary interest which the Minister for Defence and his Department have in the Curragh is the military purpose for which the lands are used.  The history <Col N="1261" /> of the Curragh is well known in relation to the blue lands, the green lands and the brown lands, and the uses to which those lands are put.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman pointed out that the brown lands are, in fact, the military establishment and are in the exclusive use of the military authorities. There are certain rights that have come down from mediaeval times for sheep grazing on the blue lands and the green lands, and the military authorities have the right to manoeuvre and exercise and train troops on all the lands.  In so far as the military use of land is concerned it is the genral policy in respect of all lands occupied by the military to grant as far as possible, the use of the lands for other purposes.  Practically all our lands are let to local farmers for grazing.  In this case the lands are not let; the Department of Defence get no income, not even one sixpence, from the sheep owners who have rights that are attached to the lands they occupy or own.</P>

      <P>In so far as the use of military vehicles, tanks and so on, on the grazing lands of the Curragh is concerned the military authorities inform me that there is very little use of these vehicles on the grazing lands. They train their tank drivers on the brown lands and blue lands.  We would not consider it fair to abuse, by heavy vehicles, the grazing lands that are used for the sheep or the gallops that are used by the horse trainers on the Curragh.  The question of the development and rehabilitation of the land of the Curragh has been raised here by Deputy Sweetman, Deputy Crinion and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Deputy Farrelly, and this question has been examined previously.  Deputy Sweetman referred to the fact that an inter-departmental committee sat and examined it.  It is true that that committee was set up at the request of the Minister for Finance at that time, Deputy Sweetman.</P>
      <P>This committee sat for a length of time and produced a draft report.  It did not sign the report, and I do not know if I am at liberty to place a report of that nature on the Table of the House.  The purpose of the committee was to examine how improvement in the quality of the lands might be effected and financed without ultimate cost to the Exchequer.  The committee held a number of meetings and produced a draft report.  As I have said, that report was not signed by the members of the committee and the activities of the committee just phased out.  One of the principal recommendations made by the committee was that to do anything effective on the Curragh in relation to the rehabilitation and improvement of the lands one would need to extinguish the grazing rights that were on the Curragh either compulsorily or otherwise.</P>

I cannot give the Deputy any explanation whatever because I have not got one.  I assume from looking at the record that when the 1961 Act came, it altered the situation.  I have no other explanation to offer, and that is my own interpretation after having read the file.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>To develop further the question of rehabilitation of the lands on the Curragh, I want to point out that it would need considerable capital investment to rehabilitate the lands on the Curragh.  I entirely agree that it is in the best interests of our country that all lands should be put into firstclass production by the use of fertilisers and the employment of whatever knowledge can be obtained from the Department of Agriculture and local committees of agriculture.  Rehabilitation work is normally based on the principle that there would be a return for the investment made.  In this instance that would not happen in present circumstances.  If the sheep owners wish to increase the productivity of the grazing on the Curragh they should contribute towards the cost of rehabilitation. There is a difficulty that if the productivity of the Curragh is improved there is no power or authority to increase the number of rights for the grazing of sheep.  Neither have we authority to create new rights.  That is a point I wish to make.  The rights spring from a mediaeval system of grazing and have legal status under the 1870 Act and the Act of 1961.</P>
      <P>I would have no objection to proceeding with a scheme of rehabilitation and improvement of the lands on the Curragh but, as I have said, so far as the Department of Defence are concerned the primary use of the lands is for military purposes.  One could not, in any circumstances, involve the State in capital expenditure on the lands without the expeotation of a fair return from the lands towards the capital cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to deal with a number of other points.  So far as the Racing Board are concerned, it has been pointed out by Deputy Sweetman that under the 1961 Act the board are the people responsible for the Curragh racecourse and that they got possession from the State of a certain area of the Curragh, fenced it in, and have improved the lands.  There are no grazing rights on them.  Such work is a credit to the people concerned.  They are not responsible however, as we are, for public funds collected in taxation.  At the time of the enclosure, there were a certain <Col N="1264" /> number of gallops on the Curragh incorporated in the racecourse lands. So far as I and the Department of Defence are concerned, we have always shown that we were prepared to accommodate, so far as we possibly could, the horse racing interests because of the fact that they are part and parcel of the economy of the country.  They are part and parcel of it and are the people who are really developing racing in the country.  It is State policy to do everything possible to encourage horse breeding in all its aspects, whether thoroughbreds, showjumpers or hunters are involved.  I know it takes an expert to lay down a good gallop for horses and we must be careful not to damage the gallops. There are also ploughed gallops on the Curragh.  We as a Government and as a Party have always given whatever encouragement we could to the racing fraternity to build up a good horsebreeding industry in this country because of the value of the exports and of the prestige it gives us abroad.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman raised the question of a site on the Curragh for housing. It is a small matter but, nevertheless, I wish to refer to it.  In October, 1965, the Kildare County Council applied for a two-acre site on the Curragh for the purpose of erecting new, fully-serviced houses.  The site was alongside William's Corner.  The Department offered to sell the site to the council in July, 1966.  The council did not proceed with the matter and notified the Department in June, 1968, that they were no longer interested.  I am not able to say why; they did not give any reason.</P>
    <P>In that connection I should like to add that in October, 1964, Kildare County Council applied for a site of about half an acre on the brown lands, being an unused part of the Camp sewage farm, on which to construct their own small sewage works to deal with effluent from a new council housing scheme to be undertaken at Tully East in the Brownstown-Maddenstown district, i.e. on council land outside the Curragh but about one mile west of the Camp sewage farm.  In June, 1966, my Department offered the council a 99-year lease of the selected <Col N="1265" /> site of half an acre in the sewage farm grounds at a fine of £195 plus a rent of £1 per annum.  The council took over the site in September, 1967.  This enables the council to provide a sewerage service for up to 900 persons, including those in the ten to 30 new houses built or to be built at Tully East.  I say this as an indication of the Department's and my willingness to facilitate the public authorities as far as we possibly can in the provision of amenities and other public services.  I do not wish the Department to be regarded as an establishment which would keep unwanted property, provided it is satisfied that the property can be disposed of without any impingement on the military authorities' responsibility to maintain the armed forces.</P>
    <P>In that connection also, Deputy Crinion raised the question of water for sheep&mdash;the provision of troughts.  As I have already indicated, we do not get anything from the sheep owners but if they consider that they need to put down troughs for watering their stock, we are prepared to give them the facilities for wayleaves to enable them to do so.</P>
    <P>I wish now to deal with the penalties provided in this Bill.  Deputy Sweetman seemed to think that the penalties provided in section 6 are insufficient to deter persons from illegally grazing large numbers of sheep on the land.  I am advised that it would be contrary to established practice to provide for a fine in excess of £100 for an offence or offences to be dealt with in courts of summary jurisdiction. The maximum fine under section 6 of the Bill is £100 for a continuing offence. It would, I am told by the law officers, suffice to have evidence before a court that a person contravened the provisions of the legislation on five separate dates to establish a continuing offence rendering him liable to the maximum fine of £100.</P>
    <P>The penalties proposed in section 6 of the Bill are identical with those stipulated in section 16 (3) of the Curragh of Kildare Act, 1961, which will remain the operative penalties in respect of contraventions of such of the Curragh Bye-Laws, 1964, as are not <Col N="1266" /> affected by this Bill, e.g. removing sand, gravel or turf without permission. I think it desirable to maintain uniformity in these penalty provisions.  Apart from this, I consider the penalties in section 6 of the Bill adequate at present; the defendants would also have to pay costs.  No matter what maximum fine would be prescribed, it would not be mandatory on the district justice to impose the maximum.  In the proceedings heard at Droichead Nua District Court in 1965, for contraventions of the Curragh Bye-Laws, 1964, in regard to sheep grazing, the defendants were convicted and although the maximum fine was £20 in each case, the district justice imposed fines of only £3 on each defendant.  Accordingly, I propose to proceed with section 6 as introduced.</P>
    <P>Deputy James Tully referred to the use of the word &ldquo;Maor&rdquo; to designate the person employed to look after the sheep.  This is the Irish version which is used in the present bye-laws.  The Deputy mentioned section 3 (5) which provides for three days notice by an owner of his intention to remove his sheep.  This also is in the present bye-laws and it has never been the cause of any difficulty.  It would never be harshly applied in, for example, blizzard conditions when sheep might have to be removed quickly &mdash; in such cases of emergency there would be no question of enforcing the requirement. After consultation with the Department of Agriculture and Kildare County Council, who are responsible for the prevention of sheep diseases, I am satisfied that there is no possibility that section 3 (5) would be enforced in such a way as to cause grave inconvenience to sheep owners.  This provision has never been the cause of any complaint.</P>
    <P>I assume that the Maor will act in a reasonable way when this Bill becomes law.  I have no doubt that he will facilitate, as far as he can, the owners of sheep grazing on the Curragh.  I have no doubt that in exceptional or emergency circumstances, such as the blizzards mentioned by Deputy Tully, the Maor would act in a reasonable way.  He would know the people concerned and would appreciate that they <Col N="1267" /> were taking their sheep away to protect them from severe weather.</P>
    <P>This question of the giving of three days notice before taking sheep away was commented on in an unfavourable way by some Deputies.  The Maor, being responsible for a number of sheep and for their correct ownership, must be in a position to control the number of sheep and, therefore, I do not think it is unreasonable that he should be given three days notice as provided for in the Bill.  He will know the owners of sheep; he will know all of the people who live around the area and he will know the people he can trust.  In any business undertaking&mdash; and this is a business undertaking&mdash; people must be reasonable with each other in such matters.</P>
    <P>The question of fencing the main and by-roads was raised.  I shall have to approach that problem in the same way as I approached the problem of rehabilitation.  There would be no return from this work and I have not asked anybody to estimate the cost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be fantastic.  I had thought of writing to the Racing Board to inquire what their fencing had cost.  It was suggested here that we could put cattle grids along the by-roads.  That is doubtful.  There is also the problem that a person who has the right to graze even one sheep is entitled to let that roam through the whole Curragh and we have no authority to confine it to a particular part of the grazing lands.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The <Col N="1270" /> purpose of the Bill is to enable An Bord Gráin to provide a superannuation scheme for its whole time officers and servants.  The Bill also provides that the remuneration and allowances for expenses of the staff of the Board will be determined by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>An Bord Gráin was established in July, 1958, under the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) (Amendment) Act, 1958, to purchase and dispose of home-grown millable wheat surplus to milling requirements, the losses involved being met by a levy on growers of millable wheat.  The Act also empowered the Minister to assign additional functions to the board in regard to grain.  The board has not, in fact, exercised the original statutory function in regard to surplus millable wheat because a surplus of millable wheat was not produced in any year until 1968 when, however, as the House is aware, no levy was imposed and the cost of disposal of the surplus wheat has to be met by the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board has, however, carried out a variety of other functions in relation to the marketing of the wheat crop, such as the marketing of unmillable wheat and the payment of special bonuses to growers in 1962.  Additional important functions in regard to coarse grains have been statutorily assigned to the board over the years.  The principal of these has been the purchase and resale of home-grown barley.  The floor price guarantee for feeding barley is implemented by the board who purchase for resale such quantities of dried barley as are offered to them on 31st December each year.  The board purchases the dried barley at a price which enables merchants to pay the growers the floor price for green barley and to meet the cost of drying, handling, interest and storage.  The barley purchased by the board is resold to compounders and feeders on an exstore or delivered basis and the board's activities in this regard are self-supporting. The board also subsidises the cost of the transport of barley from the areas in which it is grown to the deficiency areas mainly in the west, and this is financed from the proceeds <Col N="1271" /> of a levy of £1 a ton on imported maize.  The board also operates a purchase and resale arrangement for home grown feed wheat and the new floor price arrangement introduced this year for oats.</P>
    <P>Additional functions also assigned to the board cover the purchase, importation, and distribution&mdash;subject to my approval&mdash;of maize, sorghums, imported feed wheat and feed barley. The board in the fulfilment of these functions generally operates through the established grain trade.</P>
    <P>The board employs such staff as are necessary from time to time for the performance of its functions.  At present there are 13 whole time persons on the staff of the board who would be eligible to participate in a contributory pension scheme.  The number of staff may vary according to the functions of the board.  The expenses of the board are met from income derived from its trading activities under the various functions statutorily assigned to it.</P>
    <P>An Bord Gráin has sought my approval to operate a superannuation scheme for its staff and I have given my approval in principle, subject to the enactment of the necessary legislation. The board's operations have proved very useful and of particular benefit to farmers and, so far as can be foreseen, it will remain a permanent and essential feature of the grain trade in this country.  The staff employed by the board should be regarded as on a permanent basis.  Provision of a pension scheme brings the board's staff into line with other statutory bodies.</P>
    <P>With the introduction of enabling legislation to operate a superannuation scheme, it appears to the Minister for Finance, and I agree, that the terms of remuneration and allowances for expenses to the staff which are now a matter for the board should for the future be determined by me with the consent of the Minister for Finance. This is already the case with the staff employed in the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards.</P>
    <P>The Bill follows generally the pattern of previous legislation relating <Col N="1272" /> to the operation of superannuation schemes by statutory bodies.  The provision for Ministerial control of the remuneration and allowances for expenses of the staff of the board is made by an amendment of section 13 (3) of the original Act (Agricultural Produce (Cereals) (Amendment) Act, 1958) under which the board was established. The Bill will not involve any cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister says, this is just enabling legislation for a desirable purpose which I think all of us in the House would be anxious to facilitate and support.  One wonders why, in fact, it has taken ten or 11 years to bring in such a scheme.  It is an extraordinary thing that a statutory board of this kind is in existence for ten years before there is any question of a pension scheme of this kind.  I am prompted to ask the Minister whether at any time during that ten or 11 years the board in fact submitted a scheme to the Department and, if they did, when they submitted it?  If they did not, is the Minister aware of any reason why they should not have done so, because to me it represents a fairly serious neglect of responsibility?  I think it must be without precedent in the country to have a board of this kind in operation for ten years with no superannuation scheme.</P>
      <P>If and when a scheme is formulated and submitted, will it have retrospective application?  I am quite sure there were at least some members of the staff in continuous employment over the past ten years, or whatever number of years they have been employed.  Will the scheme envisaged have retrospective application over this period?  It is important that it should have.  It would be all wrong that employees of a semi-State organisation like this should not have this type of pension scheme when in all other boards they have such a scheme.</P>
      <P>It also occurs to me to question the change that is proposed in section 2:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 13 (3) of the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) (Amendment) Act, 1958 is hereby amended by the substitution of &ldquo;Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;<Col N="1273" /> for &ldquo;Board&rdquo; where that word secondly occurs.</P>
    <P>That is a significant change in that it appears to me that in return for organising a pension scheme for this Board the Minister is exacting a <i>quid pro quo</i>.  He wants the board to surrender their right to fix the salaries and wages and general remuneration of the staff.  I question whether this is a good thing and whether it is general practice. The Minister has said there is a precedent for this in the Dublin District Milk Board and in the Cork Milk Board.  I suggest to him that the record of industrial relations in both organisations has not been so good as to justify taking this step in this case, mainly because when there is an application for an increase in wages or salary or an improvement in conditions there is far too prolonged a time lag before the application can be dealt with and before the subject-matter of the discontent can be dealt with.  It is simply because State bodies move slowly and it is not possible to have the same speed in reaching the kernel of the problem in dealing with it.  We would have far better industrial relations generally between staff and management of these boards if they were allowed to fix the rates of pay and salary for their own workers. I do not know why the Minister considers that in this Bill it is important that this should be changed.  It is obviously a condition of the Bill going through that section 2 should give the Minister this particular power.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the type of work being done by the board and the importance of it and the fact that it is pretty obvious that the board will be in existence for a considerable time, that it will become a permanent feature. He mentioned that the board was operating a purchase and resale arrangement for homegrown feed wheat and a new floor price arrangement introduced this year for oats.  Perhaps, when the Minister is replying, he might tell us whether in fact the board have purchased any oats in the present year and, if so, what quantity.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that this is an important board.  In fact, it would be much more important if the recommendations in the Provender Milling <Col N="1274" /> Report of 1963 were followed, because in that Report there were very strong recommendations for broadening the functions of this board and giving it wider control over the whole grain and feeding-stuffs industry.  It has always surprised me that you had part of this responsibility spread over the Grain Board and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  Personally, I think it is a job for either one group or the other and that it does not and cannot work properly when you have a Grain Board responsible for home-grown grains and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries dealing with the import of things like pollard and maize. I am sure it is very difficult to have a proper balance between home-grown feeding stuffs and imported feeding stuffs unless they have control and responsibility for the entire feeding-stuffs and provender industry.</P>
    <P>To draw the Minister's attention to the recommendation for broadening the control and power of this board, in paragraph 114 on page 42 of that Report, the members have this to say:</P>
    <P>National considerations require that native feeding grains be used in this country to the greatest extent. It is a logical conclusion that to ensure this the availability of imported feeding grain and wheat offals must depend upon overall supplies of native feeding grain.  <i>Ad hoc</i> arrangements which separate the marketing of native barley and feed wheat and which provide for importation of maize and wheat offals prior to determination of the overall supply position of native grain from a harvest are incorrect in the face of the increase in feeding barley crops and the probability of supplies of feed wheat being available. In the opinion of the team the only method by which overall control could be achieved would be the establishment of a central grain authority.</P>
    <P>They go on to say, in paragraph 150:</P>
    <P>The team recommends that control over marketing and distribution of all home produced feeding grain and over importation and distribution of maize and wheat offals <Col N="1275" /> should be vested in An Bord Gráin.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether serious consideration has been given to this question of extending the power and authority of An Bord Gráin to control the whole grain industry and the whole feeding-stuffs industry. Division of control has certainly operated very much against the general interest of the producers. I do not want to go too deeply into this matter because it is probably outside the scope of the Bill.  I just draw attention to it only because the Minister has referred to the powers and responsibilities of this board in endeavouring to justify the legislation he has brought before us today.  As I have said, it is desirable legislation; it is legislation to which the House would like to give a quick passage, unlike some of the legislation about which we had discussion and argument the other night which we were not prepared to have steamrolled through the House.  The scheme outlined in the Bill is something we are all anxious to see in operation as soon as possible.  If the Minister wants all Stages today, we will be prepared to give them to him.</P>
    <P>Subsection (7) of section 1 of the Bill is as follows:</P>
    <P>Every scheme submitted and approved under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is approved and if either House, within the next twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the scheme is laid before it, passes a resolution annulling the scheme, the scheme shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    <P>I take it that what would have to happen is that either the Government or the Opposition would be so dissatisfied with the scheme as to move a Motion in the House to annul it.  Otherwise, the matter would not come before the Dáil.  There does not appear to be any power provided in the Bill to amend the scheme or to recommend amendment <Col N="1276" /> of the scheme.  There is power to annul.</P>
    <P>I should like to express the hope that the Minister, when replying to the debate, will give an assurance that this scheme will be retrospective to cover members of the staff who have been employed by An Bord Gráin since 1958 or for some years past and that they will get credit for that service in any pension scheme and, also, that the Minister will comment on the reasons why he considers it a good thing to have State control in dealing with the salaries and wages applicable in this organisation.  I should like him also to deal with the other points I have raised, namely, why this has not come up sooner or, if it has come up, why nothing was done about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  The purpose of the Bill, according to the Minister's brief, is to enable An Bord Gráin to provide a superannuation scheme for its wholetime officers and servants and also to provide that the remuneration and allowances for expenses of the staff of the board will be determined by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that it has been decided to introduce a superannuation scheme for these people.  I hope the superannuation scheme will give credit not only for service with the board since July, 1958, but for service in other semi-State bodies before becoming employees of the board.  This is a matter which occasionally gets fouled up. There is a tendency to forget that people may have been in employment which would entitle them to a decent pension on retirement.  The Bill refers to &ldquo;officers and servants&rdquo;.  I hope this will not be the usual case that those above the line will be looked after while those below the line must look after themselves.  Trade unions, particularly the union I represent, have been pressing the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and many other Departments for a number of years in an effort to get them to bring in a superannuation scheme for employees of their Departments who are at the bottom of the line as far as wages are concerned.  We find the greatest reluctance <Col N="1277" /> on the part of Department to bring in such a scheme.  I notice that only a small number of employees are affected in this case.</P>
    <P>Is there any possibility that the Minister will decide, when he is introducing this type of scheme in this case, to review the situation with regard to employees on State farms and other employees of his Department whose service is not pensionable?  It is rather a scandal that in 1969 there should be this anomaly.  However, the Bill is for the purpose of providing a pension scheme for wholetime officers and servants of An Bord Gráin and, therefore, we welcome it but I should like to know from the Minister when he is replying what exactly is meant by &ldquo;wholetime&rdquo; because we do find occasionally that there is a little twist put on these things and certain people who may appear to be on the same conditions of employment as others are ruled out because it is decided that some employees are wholetime and others are not wholetime.  I should like this matter to be cleared up.</P>
    <P>With regard to the determination of remuneration and allowances for expenses, I notice that the Department have decided that they should be responsible for that in future.  Does this mean that the staff will come under the conciliation and arbitration schemes affecting the Civil Service or does this in any way reduce their chances of being paid a decent wage or salary?  Perhaps the Minister would give us that information when he is replying to the debate?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I also intended to ask the Minister if there was any term other than &ldquo;servant&rdquo; that he could apply to the wage-earning class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with the previous speakers that this scheme is long overdue, and that those servants who are wholetime should be pensionable and should be fully looked after.  I would be very much in favour of An Bord Gráin and the functions it carries out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter which puzzles me in relation to the Bill.  Is it not possible for a statutory body such as An Bord Gráin to create a pension scheme without recourse to the Minister? <Col N="1278" /> I know that according to the Schedule of the 1958 Act under which the board was set up the Minister appoints the board and the chairman, but I notice that today the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The expenses of the board are met from income derived from its trading activities under the various functions statutorily assigned to it.</P>
    <P>I take it from that that what the Minister meant is that the board is completely solvent and self-supporting, that it does not receive any contribution or subvention from the State.  The Minister also said that the Bill will not involve any cost to the Exchequer.  In other words, here is a statutory body which, in my opinion, is a great success and which has been of considerable benefit to farmers who grow grain&mdash;a matter in which I am particularly interested as I come from a very strong grain-growing constituency &mdash; that functions perfectly and is completely solvent.  Yet, we have legislation introduced here which seems to me to impose a greater burden on this board. For what purpose is this necessary? After all, if there is a board and it is functioning satisfactorily as a liaison between the Department of Agriculture and the grain growers, why has there to be further State control?  The board acts in the capacity of a middleman; it provides an outlet for surplus grain and it encourages merchants to buy since they know they will be recouped any losses sustained.  The board performs a useful function from the point of view of tillage.  If the Minister tells me this legislation is necessary to enable the board to provide a superannuation and pension fund I shall be quite satisfied.  The Schedule to the 1958 Act provides that:</P>
    <P>The Board shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession and power to sue in its corporate name and to hold land.</P>
    <P>Would it not be better to leave the board as such?  The Minister said that this proposed contributory scheme will be subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  With all due respect, I see no reason why it should have anything to do with either the Minister <Col N="1279" /> for Agriculture and Fisheries or the Minister for Finance.  The body is solvent and could surely make its own arrangements for its employees.  The Minister for Finance will not contribute any money.  If this legislation were merely to give these employees that to which they are entitled I would be quite satisfied.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us there are 13 members.  The chairman and members are nominated by the Minister.  There is not outside nomination.  Would the Minister not consider liberalising the position a little, by way of amendment on Committee Stage, and opening wider the ranks from which appointments may be made to the board?  For instance, there could be appointments by agricultural organisations.  I am not advocating now that the NFA should have a nomination to the board, in case the Minister jumps too hastily to that conclusion; it is not for me to fight the battles of the NFA.  I merely suggest it would be wise to open out nomination to this board.  Most semi-State organisations favour a wider coverage with regard to membership as against nomination by the Minister.  I do not suggest the Minister's nominations have not been suitable.  I know for a fact that they are.  I know one member from Wexford.  I am not referring to a late member.  This man was on the board at one time but I have a strong suspicion he was removed from the board fairly recently.</P>
    <P>There is a new floor price arrangement introduced for oats.  The Minister may have made quite an extensive statement on this at some stage, but I am not aware that he did.  If he did not, perhaps, when he is replying, he will give us some idea as to what this floor price is and tell us also who the buyers will be.  It is pretty well-known who the buyers are in the case of barley. It is more than likely, with an innovation like this, that there will be a new group with a special licence.  Because of the trade agreement with Britain we are limited to buying seed oats from Britain.  There are parts of Europe&mdash; the Scandinavian countries, for instance &mdash;in which it is possible to procure <Col N="1280" /> more suitable oats for our purposes. We seem to get all our seed barley and seed oats from Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal reason for the introduction of this Bill is that no provision was made in the 1958 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say why this provision was not included in the original Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should imagine that it might not have seemed necessary at that stage.  That may be the reason why, too, no such effort was made by the board before 1963 and no suggestion was made as to the need for such a measure as this.  That was probably due to the circumstances of the time. It was not clear that this was likely to be a permanent feature of the operations of the grain business.  It has, however, now become quite apparent that this type of board is necessary both from the point of view of the utilisation of home-produced grain and the importation of foreign grain to meet requirements.</P>
      <P>All three speakers have queried why this legislation should be subject to Ministerial approval, whether by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries or the Minister for Finance.  Over the years a disparity has emerged in the pattern of remuneration, superannuation and benefits of one kind and another where these boards are concerned. Since all of them are created by this House to serve this State and, since our responsibility is thereby tied up with them, it seems absolutely essential that there should be a method of bringing about uniformity of approach, both as to their remuneration and such things as superannuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for that reason that in this measure here we are now putting it into the legislation that this tie-up, as it were, this effort to have a uniform approach to remuneration and superannuation in our State bodies should be channelled into some centre. Whereas the board in question is under my Department, other boards are under various other Department, and we still might not have the uniformity which I think is desirable from every point of <Col N="1281" /> view unless there was a co-ordinating head amongst us all.  Therefore, you will find in other boards where matters such as these come forward in the future, there will be this channelling through by the consent mechanism to one Minister, namely the Minister for Finance.  That is pretty useful.  It is desirable, and it is for that reason we are proposing to do it in this way.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested that the functions of the board might be widened.  This, of course, we have the power to do.  It might be true to say that its job today is very different from what it was when it was first projected and formed in 1958.  At that time it was set up to deal with wheat really.  Wisely at that time we included the power to allow the board to do other jobs if, as and when they arose.  Other jobs are, perhaps, the bigger element of its business now.  That is as it should be. Under the 1958 Act the rôle it plays can be widened and changed and expanded or contracted in the circumstances of the day.  I am quite well aware that we have this opportunity to do these things, and I am not unmindful of certain aspects where greater participation by the board in grain trade and grain policy could be of considerable benefit and concern to the producer.</P>
    <P>With regard to its effectiveness in relation to oats, up to the 31st December which was the date we set this year initially for the purchase of oats, the Board has purchased somewhere under 5,000 tons.  We will be arranging for the board to have another purchase date to allow for the late threshing which is still in the traditional oatsgrowing areas by far the bigger end of the crop.  So, while we would have got 5,000 tons covered by this floor price arrangement up to 31st December, it is likely that there will be a further date after which the board will purchases further oats when they come on the market and we expect there will be further oats on the market as threshings take place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the floor price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The price which the board will take it up at is identical <Col N="1282" /> with the barley price.  Around £27 14s a ton would be the take up price.  This would be for a dry ton.  In addition to that, there is an arrangement for a premium price for quality oats above and beyond that.  It can very but basically&mdash;this is the floor price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will they sell this oats back for feeding or milling?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The quantity taken up so far this year up to 31st March was about 1,500 tons of quality oats.  This may be used and, perhaps, is being used for horse feeding or bloodstock feeding.  I am not sure what use it has gone to.  It has been bought in two lots, so to speak: 1,500 tons of quality oats, as it is described, and somewhere over 3,000 tons of feeding oats which could go back into compounds and ordinary general animal feeding stuffs.  The quality oats can be used in oatmeal milling and can possibly be made use of for the higher grade requirements of horse feeding, although I understand that new oats&mdash;oats from the harvest just past&mdash;is usually not looked upon with any favour by those people so it may not be used for that purpose as yet.  Presumably the quality oats content would be suitable.  I should imagine that oatmeal milling would be the likely end to which the quality content has been put and the other would have gone into animal feeding stuffs of various kinds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if there is any truth in the rumour that these oats are being resold with the aid of a subsidy against people who have assembled oats without a subsidy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The point here is that this scheme relates to the western counties and maybe&mdash;although it is not so to my knowledge&mdash;there is some basis for what the Deputy says, perhaps not in the same way as he put it.  I should not like to be flat-footed about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if it is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not heard it so I should not like to comment absolutely on it.  These are taken up under this scheme from the western counties and <Col N="1283" /> it is possible that there may be some disparities emerging as between what is taken up by the ordinary trade in the ordinary traditional way in the rest of the country, and the oats taken up in this way from the western counties.  I do not know that that is so.  It is possible that there may be some little grinding going on in that regard of which I am not aware.</P>
      <P>So far as the need for this Bill is concerned, I think the House fully accepts it is something we should do. Perhaps another reason why it was not done earlier would also be the fact that there was in the earlier stages naturally a lesser job to be done or assigned to the Board.  Therefore, there were fewer staff.  There was a very small staff initially.  It is only in the past five or six years that the staff has grown to the permanent number we now have and confirmed as the number of permanent staff needed, occasionally supplemented by temporary staff of various kinds.</P>
      <P>All in all the scheme is necessary.  It is desirable that it should be channelled back through the Minister concerned with the board itself, namely, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and, in turn, that there should be the consent of the Minister for Finance in order that there would be uniformity in practice in regard to superannuation and allowances to the staffs in all of our State boards and to get away from the danger which has made itself evident of staffs competing with each other, as it were.  That is something that should be avoided.  This is a step in that direction so far as this board is concerned, to bring it into line, to conform with this new outlook of having uniformity where possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other thing I should like to say to those who make the point that, perhaps, this type of procedure could have damaging repercussions in that if the claim has to be considered by the board, then further to be recommended to the Minister who, in turn, must get the consent of the Minister for Finance, this could create a prolonged and, perhaps, aggravating procedure, is that this should not happen, but undoubtedly the point made is one <Col N="1284" /> that is well taken.  I can only assure the House that in so far as we can, we will try to avoid time-lags that would give rise to difficulty in regard to claims and settlements due to this three level operation which has to take place.  We can try to avoid that where possible and try to make it work as smoothly as possible.</P>

I feel they must be happy about it as otherwise they would not have allowed this measure be put on.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister has dealt with the question of retrospection, whether, in fact, the scheme envisaged will cover the people who have been in employment for some period prior to the introduction of the Bill.  They might not be for the full period back to 1958 but I am sure <Col N="1285" /> there are members of the staff who are there for some years and they should be covered by any scheme brought in now.  I know Deputy James Tully raised the additional point that their service with other similar State organisations should rank for inclusion as well.  That is a thing which, perhaps, the Minister might comment on.  I am not making the point but certainly I feel they should be covered for the full period of their employment in An Bord Gráin.  Again, I would ask the Minister if a more wholesome description than &ldquo;servants&rdquo; could be found?  &ldquo;Officers and servants&rdquo; is an ugly description which I do not like.  I know it is a description which has been used always but it is something which, if we can, we should change.  We should have &ldquo;other employees&rdquo; or something of that sort instead.</P>

      <P>In so far as the manner in which this would be applied is concerned this is, as rightly termed here, by and large, an enabling bit of legislation and the procedure which is laid down is that the board would in their best knowledge be recommending a scheme of a certain kind.  I would have to have a look at this consideration and maybe have a word with them about it, or maybe not, and also have a talk, based on that, with the Minister for Finance for his assent to my recommendations in all probability. What comes up in so far as the details of the scheme are concerned I could not foreshadow at this particular time and, therefore, I cannot say those things will be included.  All I can positively say is that there is nothing in this enactment here which prevents them being included if this should be what is ultimately desired and agreed.  In other words, so far as the legislation is concerned, we do not exclude any of those things and, therefore, I take it they could possibly all be taken in but I cannot say definitely that they can.</P>

      <P>As I said in the course of my speech on Second Stage, I have still a certain amount of doubt about this section with regard to the need for the Minister taking power to make all the decisions in relation to remuneration, conditions of employment and all that sort of thing.  I can see the Minister's point that there is a case to be made for a certain amount of standardisation as between one board and another and for that reason I am inclined to withdraw the objection I have to this.  The Minister says that he will find ways and means of overcoming the delays which take place.  They certainly do not make for good staff relations. The history of the staff relations in boards which were cited for us here where this power is vested in the Minister <Col N="1287" /> already has not been the best, as we all know.  It has not made a case for the Minister taking this power to himself in this particular Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I might add a little to that.  When dealing with the overall point about the uniformity, we have to look at it another way as well.  The whole purpose of this board and the jobs that may be assigned to it were created by legislation in this House at the insistence of the Department, of which I am now Minister.  Any assignments additional to its present function which it may be requested to undertake will again be made by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries of the day.  The jobs generally that it may and will be asked to take on are jobs peculiarly in relation to the business of agriculture and this board could be regarded as a commercial extension of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to do certain things particularly in the trading sense.</P>
      <P>It is very logical, indeed, in this sense, that the remuneration, the conditions of employment, the superannuation, expenses and emoluments should very much be under the jurisdiction of the Minister of the Department whose creation this board is and for whom this board in the first instance works as a sort of extra arm. There is also the point which may have been slightly confused in that I said at the end of my introductory speech that no cost would fall on the Exchequer as a result of the Bill.  This does not mean, in fact, that costs indirectly may not be incurred by the State in various ways.  Indeed, this is absolutely inherent in the whole existence of this board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take, for instance, the question of oats.  To allay the fears of the Deputy that there might be something in what the Deputy heard about the oats being taken up by the board, and sold with the aid of subsidy to the detriment of other traders, let me first say that no sales have so far taken place.  No question of subsidy need arise unless, in the disposal of these oats, a loss is made in which event a subsidy will have to be made up to the board.  It is <Col N="1288" /> on the cards that we may make a loss: this is our first year.  This in itself, would belie what would appear to have been said by me that this Bill would not cost the Exchequer anything. Strictly tied to itself, it would not cost us anything because it should be a contributory pension scheme, as envisaged here.  The whole exercise of the board, in which these people are employed, may cost us money.  We are expecting that we may have to subsidise the oats scheme element of their business this year.  These are the reasons why I say, in a particular way, we should have this control. There is good reason to try for uniformity of allowances and to stop the leap-frogging which we are all aware has been a very notably outstanding and damaging feature of some of our State boards which did and do enjoy and, perhaps, abuse the very sort of freedom that has been given them but is not being given in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister said the Bill would not involve any cost to the Exchequer, I think he meant what he said in so far as the pensions will not involve the Exchequer, in any case.  It is mentioned somewhere in the Bill that it will be paid out of the fund&mdash;a fund set up under the 1958 Act and that has come into existence probably through levies.  I do not know whether at any stage there was an Exchequer contribution.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the present health services do <Col N="1289" /> not meet the needs of the people, and that the method of financing them is unfair in the unjust burden which it imposes on ratepayers without regard to their ability to pay, and that as a matter of urgency existing services should be replaced by a comprehensive health service based upon insurance principles and which will provide without charge, and as of right, for all people within the scheme, full medical services with choice of doctor and free hospital, specialist and diagnostic services.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Ryan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to put this debate in proper perspective I think I should state shortly what our present health services are, what they mean to people and how they are financed.</P>
      <P>Health services at the moment are financed 50/50 by the Central Fund and by local rates.  Medical services outside hospital are given only to those who can establish that they are poor within the definition in the Health Act. Hospital and specialist services are only given on charges to insured people, to persons whose means do not exceed the statutory figure and to farmers up to £50 valuation.  This, in effect, means that thousands of taxpayers and thousands of ratepayers who pay for present health services are excluded from all benefit.</P>
      <P>It is against that background that the Fine Gael motion must be considered. The Fine Gael motion and Fine Gael policy have been based on a very simple, clear belief.  They are based on a belief in community organised effort, tempered by the principle that the community should supplement but should never supplant individual effort.  We have always rejected the idea of a scheme financed exclusively from taxation.  Such a State scheme&mdash; because that is what it would be&mdash; would be inimical to human dignity and would, in any event, be unworkable. Indeed, I do not believe that any responsible person or group of people in this country today would advocate such a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael views were put forward in <Col N="1290" /> this House in some detail on a motion tabled in 1961, debated in this House some months later, in April, 1961.  That is eight years ago.  At that time, in absolute complete detail, a workable scheme was put forward from these Benches.  The Government tabled an amendment to the Fine Gael Health Motion of eight years ago.  Their amendment was designed to set up a Select Committee.  This Committee, I have no doubt, had as its object to commit the whole question of health reform into the political Limbo of forgotten things.  I served on that Committee as did other Deputies in the present House.  I think it is not unfair for me to say that years were wasted in an absolutely disgraceful manner by the then Minister for Health in an effort to establish that there was no public demand for a reform of our health services.</P>
    <P>After three wasted years of service on that Committee I, on behalf of my Party, eventually circulated a document indicating our proposals for a reform in general medical services in this country.  It was a detailed proposal. Every facet of what we were suggesting was carefully worked out.  It was circulated to the members of the Select Committee.  It was based on the principles of social insurance and that, a Cheann Comhairle, was the end of the Select Committee because they dissolved. But before they dissolved the then Taoiseach came into this House and he announced that a Fianna Fáil Government would never introduce a health scheme based on social insurance. It is an extraordinary thing that the many minutes of that Select Committee, which interviewed so many people, took evidence from so many organisations, have never been published and that the Committee ended its very useless life in 1965 without ever reporting and without ever considering the detailed memorandum submitted in my name on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>After the collapse of that Committee we were back where we had been before. Deputy Seán MacEntee, who was Minister for Health, ceased to be Minister and he was succeeded by the late Deputy Donogh O'Malley.  In 1966 <Col N="1291" /> a White Paper on the Health Services was circulated.  It is a poor document. It contains some of our ideas but it clings to the poor law mentality of the Health Act of 1953.  However, it represented some slight measure of reform. It was welcomed by us in that sense, not as showing any real step forward but as indicating at least some change of attitude by the Government.  There it was in 1966, published, and we were promised this legislation in the autumn of 1966.  We did not get it.  Then we were promised legislation in the spring of 1967.  We did not get it.  Then we were promised legislation in 1968.  We did not get it.  Then, when the Dáil was meeting in the Mansion House to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the First Dáil, the Government with such a disgraceful record in relation to this urgent matter of social reform made a gimmick of health services by introducing the First Stage of new health legislation.  We were promised that at the first meeting of this Session of the Dáil in this House the legislation would be available to us.  We have not got it.  Fianna Fáil have made health a political issue for so long in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I would prove that those words are rubbish coming from the Minister.  On every possible occasion health is used for political purposes.  The only reason we are getting some proposals now from this mountain that has been in labour, this mouse that is going to be produced in 1969, is that this is an election year.  That is the only reason. In the intervening wasted years poor, indigent, helpless people have had to suffer on trying to prove that they are paupers within the Victorian definition of the Poor Relief Act of over 100 years ago, trying to get medical cards, <Col N="1292" /> queuing up in hospital clinics, where they are treated like so many members of a herd of cattle, having no dignity because of the way in which our community organises health services&mdash;all because the Fianna Fáil Government have not regarded health as being sufficiently important, except in an election year, to do anything about it.  I say shame on the lot of them for what they have not done.  Indeed, I will reserve whatever adjective I will apply to what they now propose, depending on the faith they keep with those who have been seeking so much for so long.</P>
      <P>The plain fact is that progressive and acceptable standards in relation to health services in a Christian country can only be obtained through a scheme based on the principles of social insurance. That is as plain as a pikestaff. There is no alternative.  Fianna Fáil know it and others know it also.  There is no alternative to social insurance; to try to provide otherwise is to have health standards for our small community based on and dependent on the yearly Budget and on the exigencies of local rates.  At this time each year there are headlines such as &ldquo;Rates increase of 8s 11d, 9/- and 10/-&rdquo;. There is pruning going on.  The one advance that will never be tolerated, apparently, is an advance in the way we care for those who are sick and in need.  People say there are hospitals for them; let them go into hospital. But they do not have regard to the fact that many sick people can be, and should be, treated in their own homes and have proper medical care in their own surroundings.  That is not provided because of the manner in which our present health legislation is financed and because of the policies behind it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our views are clear.  They are as clear now as they were when we first raised this matter in Dáil Éireann eight years ago.  There is no other course for this country to embark on. I notice that the Labour Party have tabled an amendment to the Fine Gael motion.  I have read this amendment but I have not heard it explained.  It appears to me to be either unnecessary or an effort to provide in this country something of which we could never be <Col N="1293" /> proud&mdash;a sectional approach in relation to health services.</P>
    <P>The Labour amendment says that they want a comprehensive health service financed by the State from taxation and graded social welfare contributions from all earning members of the community.  What do these words mean?  If they mean a scheme financed by contributions from the State, from employers, from employees and from the self-employed that means social insurance and that means the Fine Gael policy.  If that is what the Labour Party amendment means it would have been much better for them to have said that in this instance they stand squarely and honestly behind the Fine Gael motion and policy.  If it does not mean that; if the insurance contributions should come from all earning members of the community and if that means merely those who are at the present moment paying social welfare contributions, then I ask where are the Labour Party going.</P>
    <P>Are they seeking a difference from Fine Gael in so far as they are now advocating a proposal in which a privileged community is to be set up and in which it is not proposed to include the independent small shopkeeper, the small farmer, the pensioner, the widow, the widower and people who pay no social welfare contributions but who are still members of our community?  I want to know where Labour stand.  It would be much better if their motion means, as I think it was intended to mean &mdash; I know what the views of Deputy Kyne are&mdash;that they are agreeing with our proposals in relation to social insurance but, if that be so, let them be men enough to say it instead of wrapping up in a mass of verbiage some difference which means nothing. Our policy is clear.  It is the clearest policy in relation to this matter in this country.</P>

If the Minister does not do it, I have little doubt that, very shortly, a Fine Gael Minister for Health will have the honour of doing <Col N="1294" /> it.  We have raised this matter here again in an effort to focus public attention on this urgent social need which has, in my view, become a grave political wrong.  I should like to see a social insurance scheme.  I believe that by establishing it we would remove health out of national controversy.  That is the way it should be.  We will be doing far more for the 50 years of the existence of this Dáil and this Parliament by doing something worthwhile in establishing an Irish policy in relation to health and solving the grave problems which affect our society.</P>

    <P>Much of the motion moved by Fine Gael, and which is now before the House, is welcomed by the Labour <Col N="1295" /> Party.  Indeed, any motion to improve the health services at any time during my time in Dáil Éireann has received the support of the Labour Party.  I might mention for the benefit of Fine Gael that in 1953, when the present Health Services Act&mdash;the one that we work under&mdash;was before the House as a Bill, I had the honour to represent the Party and to welcome that as an improvement upon the existing Poor Law System.</P>
    <P>It was there, even though it covered perhaps only 30 per cent of the people. If my memory serves me right&mdash;I will leave this to the Minister as I am sure he has read up the debates&mdash;Fine Gael were not in any way enamoured with the limited improvement then being made.  I agree, it was limited, it is still limited, but I am glad to see the conversion of both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to the Labour Party's proposal.</P>

      <P>I have.  I am talking only on the motion and on what the mover of the motion said.  The Labour Party, crazy and all as we are supposed to be, know that this insurance system on its own can never finance the health scheme.  I think the Labour Party are much more honourable, straightforward and knowledgeable about health problems.  We realise, having gained by experience, having seen the scheme working in Great Britain, that social welfare must be dealt with first; otherwise, it is like saying illness is caused by the effect of the failure of social welfare&mdash;trying to remove the effect of something without removing the cause. For instance, if a man is ill and feels he should go on sick benefit, because of the fact that under the present social welfare system he cannot afford to go sick, he remains at work until such time as his illness forces him out of employment, which means now a prolonged illness, very often a chronic illness, that forces him into hospital for the rest of his life.  We must deal with social welfare first.  In the outline of <Col N="1297" /> health policy which the Labour Party have published we recognise this.  We agree with the first part of the motion and then we suggest the deletion of all words after &ldquo;comprehensive health service&rdquo; and the substitution of &ldquo;financed by the State from taxation and graded social welfare contributions from all earning members of the community&rdquo;. Many people not covered by social welfare contributions are earning members of the community and should be made contribute.  All farmers should also be made contribute, and so should everyone else, except widows and orphans receiving State benefits or people in institutions.  We want to bring anyone who earns, irrespective of who he is, within the ambit of this scheme.</P>

If I were simply transferring it from the ratepayers to the workers, I certainly would not sponsor that.

      <P>Perhaps in reply some Fine Gael Deputy will tell me what is meant by &ldquo;within the scheme&rdquo;.  Does it cover all the people or does it not? We do not believe it covers all the people.  If there is any group, even ten per cent in the upper income group, outside the scheme, then there must be a means test and there will be inquisitions. In our amendment we would catch everyone, and we would enable all the people to contribute, not only those who want to take benefit.  If these people in the higher income group do not want the health services and are prepared to provide special services for themselves, that is their business. In Great Britain the Queen is as much entitled to health services as the ordinary worker.  I should like to see everyone in this country who earns an income or receives payment in any way contributing on an equal basis.  However, we want to go further, and I should like to know whether in Deputy O'Higgins's document there is provision for a flat contribution.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party policy has already been published except for the fact that the health services cannot be taken separately from social welfare. It is cause and effect.  The effect is sickness or illness; the cause is the failure of the State to provide individual wage earners or families with sufficient money to keep them in decent <Col N="1300" /> health.  This is the cause of the illness. This motion does not in any way deal with social welfare.  In our Labour Party outline of a health policy we realised this.  Perhaps we did not do so years ago, but things have progressed and people have improved.  We certainly feel this can and will be done if and when a Labour Party Government comes.  I cannot see how Fine Gael can implement their scheme even if they become the Government after the next election.  Perhaps, they will form a Government that will implement and finance such a scheme, but I have grave doubts whether the scheme will be financed like that.  If there is anyone outside the scheme in the country who is not eligible then we must have a means test and there is discrimination.</P>

      <P>Quoting from an <i>Irish Times</i> report I see that Deputy Ryan says that Fine Gael would oppose any proposal that retained objectionable features &ldquo;such as a means test and class distinction&rdquo;.  If 90 per cent of the people were fully cared for, there is ten per cent somewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the difference between the Fine Gael and the Labour policies.  You say they can come in.  We say they must come in.  If that group of ten per cent refused to come in, that is their own business.  They refuse to avail of the services.  That is all right so long as they pay for the services. That is the difference between Fine Gael and ourselves on this particular policy.  This effect of poor social welfare benefits which is allied to health services very closely causes more mental illness in this country than anything I know of.  Mental diseases are not always hereditary.  This has been <Col N="1301" /> proved by some of the leading psychologists in this country.  The worry of a woman because her husband is unemployed, the worry of a man because he cannot get work, the worry on him because he cannot go into hospital and such things are the causes of the overcrowding of the mental hospitals in this country.  Mental illness is caused by stress and strain due to uncertainty of employment, and the knowledge of the fact that if unemployed one gets very little, just enough to keep on the bread line, just enough for bread and butter to keep one alive.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party combine their health and social welfare policies and this is the only thing I can see as a means of ending this awful position. Like Fine Gael, we believe if this is done much of the sickness which causes hospitalisation in this country can be treated in the home.  We have been laughed at for saying that medicine, drugs and prescriptions should be free. They are free in hospital so why should they not be free at home?  People could be kept at home on medical prescriptions. We do not believe there should be any contribution for drugs.  There is no contribution in hospital beyond the 10/- at the maximum, which varies down to very little.  I heard from the Minister in a Parliamentary reply that the amount of money health authorities get in from the health services is trivial compared with the total health bill.  I hope, with Deputy O'Higgins, that the long promised Health Services Bill will come in very shortly.  I do not feel in any way aggrieved that the first stage of the Bill was introduced at the 50th Anniversary of the Dáil.  It was very appropriate that this particular service which all support should have been mentioned there.  If the Government are sincere and intend to carry it out, I feel that it is a tribute to the men of 1916 who fought for this to see that the Government are prepared to come along with this.  I will await eagerly the White Paper on this.  I give every man the benefit of believing he has the best intentions until proved otherwise.</P>
      <P>I suggest to Fine Gael that we will be putting down a motion.  The Ceann Comhairle was perfectly within his rights; we should have had our amendment in last week.</P>

      <P>I respect Deputy Kyne as I respect few Members of this House.  It pains and amuses me in a tragic sort of way when I find the Labour Party coming in here trying to excuse themselves for not voting for this motion.  Let us read it.  Let Deputy Kyne and Deputy O'Connell read it. What one line of this motion is objectionable? We ask Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Kyne to subscribe to this. We and they are of the opinion that the health services do not meet the needs of the people.  The motion reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the present health services do not meet the needs of the people, and that the method of financing them is unfair in the unjust burden which it imposes on ratepayers without regard to their ability to pay, and that as a matter of urgency existing services should be replaced by a comprehensive health service based upon insurance principles and which will provide without charge, and as of right, for all people within the scheme, full medical services with choice of doctor and free hospital, specialist and diagnostic services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite certain that the Labour Party were fully in favour of this motion until a recent change came over the spirit of their dreams.  This motion&mdash;Deputy Kyne should read it &mdash;has been on the Order Paper of this House since January, 1968.  Any Party who came along at 4 o'clock today to put in an amendment to this venerable motion is, therefore, at least under obligation to tell the House why, during the past 12 months, they were happy to sit there without raising their voices, without putting in an alternative motion, without putting in an <Col N="1303" /> amendment.  They are under obligation to explain this sudden spurt of activity by the Labour Party.  Does it mean that Labour, even at the cost of the people on whose behalf we are pleading, are ready to indicate their absolute independence of all other Parties in the House?</P>
    <P>Does it matter to the Labour Party whether this comprehensive health service should be implemented?  We are simply asking them, as they had not the wit or the wisdom to put in an amendment or an alternative motion to the one to which we subscribe, in the name of the Irish people, on behalf of the deserving classes in the country, to vote for this motion.</P>
    <P>If they do not do so they will be impugned at the bar of public opinion to which they have access at the moment&mdash;the opinion of the very people for whom we are pleading.  I can tell Deputy Kyne that as a result of recent developments in his Party, the support of these people is dwindling&mdash; the people who subscribed to them at the polls.  I say to Deputy Kyne that if his Party go on record as voting against this motion or abstaining from voting, they will suffer at the polls, and rightly so.  I hope and devoutly wish that they will.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Deputy Kyne and to those who sit with him to subscribe to the motion.  There is nothing else they can do.  There are two clear courses they can follow&mdash;to vote against the motion or to vote for it.</P>

      <P>I should be glad if Deputy Kyne on behalf of Labour would give one good reason, not to this House but to those who put them in Dáil Éireann, why they should abstain from voting for this motion.  I should be glad if he would explain why they were apparently satisfied with this motion until 4 o'clock this afternoon; if he would explain why, up to that time today, the motion was quite satisfactory from the point of view of Labour.  The motion states that the present health services do not meet the needs of the people.  Nobody outside <Col N="1304" /> Fianna Fáil could disagree with that. The Labour Party agreed with it.  The motion states that the method of financing the health services is unfair in the unjust burden which it imposes on the ratepayers.  Though Deputy Kyne may be happy that the present rating system is fair and equitable, I do not subscribe to it.  I say that it is the most unfair and inequitable thing we have at the moment.  It is not based on a person's earnings, his income, or anything else of that kind.  It is based on a purely unimaginative system of putting a poor law valuation on a house, and whether the occupant of that house is a millionaire or a broken-down widow, the rates have to be paid no matter what the status is of the occupant.  I do not know why Deputy Kyne should consider that the present rating system&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In case Deputy Kyne is in any doubt whatsoever about it, implicit in the motion is that the fund for the health services will be met in the proportion of one-third from the employer, one-third from the employee and one-third from the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Kyne were to show the interest he should show in the reasonable proposals now being put by the main Opposition Party in the Oireachtas in regard to health, he would reaslise&mdash;he should, and I am quite sure he does&mdash;that that is implicit in our proposals, that that undertaking is given unequivocally on behalf of our <Col N="1305" /> Party.  I challenge Deputy Kyne, I challenge the Labour Party not to vote for the motion.  I challenge them to sit there and to say that it is not worth voting for, that it is wrong and should not be subscribed to.  If they do so, in my submission&mdash;it is difficult to say what I want to say&mdash;it is indicative of the depth of weakness to which Labour have sunk in their new policy of dissociating themselves from any other Party in the State in the hope that some day they will become the Government. They will not become the Government by opposing decent, sensible motions like this.  For these reasons they should change their minds.  They know there is no sense in their amendment, which is useless subterfuge.  Let them therefore do the decent, gentlemanly and generous thing and vote for the motion.</P>

I had a rapid glance back to the debate of 1962 during Deputy O'Higgins' speech and for one thing he mentioned that a total of 800,000 people would have to be excluded from the ambit of the insurance scheme, being farmers under £15 valuation and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The figure he gave was 800,000, although he made it clear that this was not necessarily the full total of people who would have to be excluded from any contribution to the insurance scheme.  He said tonight, and I believe that this is in line with what he said previously, that the method of financing would be as to one part, anyway, from the taxpayer, but last night Deputy Ryan said that there should be created a social fund free of competition with any other money being found by the Minister for Finance.  I hope that this accurately represents what Deputy Ryan did say, that this in effect should be an inviolate social fund devoted to health service only and that it should not be in competition with the other demands on the taxpayer.  This is the note of what Deputy Ryan said.  If that is the case it is a different thing from the scheme envisaged by Deputy O'Higgins.  Tonight Deputy O'Higgins said that it would be a graduated contribution, whereas in his submission to the Health Council some time ago, he said it should be a flat-rate contribution.</P>

All I want to say about this is, while I have to sit here listening to abuse of Fianna Fáil because Fianna Fáil are still operating what is regarded as an unjust system that makes paupers of the people, that is all very well until Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Ryan are in a position to make up their minds as to who is going to be involved in their scheme; whether or not, as Deputy Kyne asks, there is to be a means test and is it going to be a means test to distinguish the jet set from anybody else.  If the jet set are to be included there has to be a means test.  Would Fine Gael tell us now, would they accept the opportunity of their right to reply on this debate to say clearly, who is going to be excluded from the range of their scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Obviously we have found out that a minimum of 800,000 of the poor and other classes will be excluded from any contribution towards the scheme.  I am not against the insurance principle and I have made this clear before and if Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Ryan say that this is not in line with what Deputy MacEntee said when he was Minister for Health that is all right with me; like Deputies in the Labour Party we <Col N="1308" /> do not necessarily have the same attitude, each of us, and we do not have to have.

      <P>I had the question of insurance examined in recent months by an inter-departmenttal committee and, unfortunately, insurance as such, within the real meaning of that word, simply does not present an easy, comprehensive solution to the problems with which we are presented in financing health services.  To turn insurance in the comprehensive way suggested would involve a fundamental departure from the principle on which our health services are based&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which may be summarised that those who can afford to pay the taxation needed to finance the health services do so, and those who need to use the different services have entitlement to do so without regard to their taxability.  However, neither Deputy Ryan nor Deputy O'Higgins, nor for that matter any other member of the Fine Gael Party, has ever gone deeply into the question of what insurance, within the real meaning of that word implies.  Insurance, for one thing, implies that where the risk insured against matures the benefits contracted for are available to those who have paid the required premiums but people&mdash;and this is very important&mdash;who have not paid the premiums must themselves bear all the cost if the risk matures for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal concept of insurance in most cases also involves a limit to the liability of the insurer.  Again, the premium paid, would, under a genuine insurance <Col N="1309" /> scheme, have to be, at least in a general way, related to the risk, so that a person with dependents would have to pay higher contributions than a single person.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this so or is it not so?  I merely wish the members of the Fine Gael Party to let us know what proportion of people they envisage as being included in their insurance scheme; what proportion of people they envisage as excluded from it and what proportion of people they envisage as excluded from contributing to the scheme.  Finally, would they say how much they think it would cost the contributor per week, and when they refer to periodic payments, do they mean a week or a month, or what do they mean?  What system of collection do Fine Gael envisage for farmers?  What system of collection do they envisage for the self-employed?  Do they know what the yield of, say, one per cent on the income of people contributing will be?  I can tell them that one per cent of income in the middle income group would yield a total of £5 million a year.</P>
      <P>If one is to assume that the people Fine Gael would not have contribute to the scheme, although they would be entitled to benefit from it, would be roughly on a par with the people now described as the lower income group, then do they envisage a ten per cent levy on all income in order to finance the health services at their present level, having regard to the fact that they apparently do not wish any part of the burden to remain on the back of the ratepayer?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;your motion says that &ldquo;the method of financing them is unfair in the unjust burden which it imposes on ratepayers without <Col N="1310" /> regard to their ability to pay&rdquo;.  Let us know from Fine Gael how much of the burden you are prepared to put on the backs of the ratepayers and of how much you propose to relieve them.  The people are entitled to know.  If you ask for their votes on the basis of a policy on health they are entitled to the answers to all these questions which I claim are relevant.  I also claim that it is wrong for a political party to ask for votes from the people without expounding their policy and how it is to be financed. It is one thing to cash in on the outcry against rates but, in fact, in real terms the ratepayer even now is not contributing 45 per cent of the cost of the present health service because further steps in general relief of rates by way of the agricultural grant have been taken in recent years so that, at present, every holding under £20 valuation is totally derated.  As the House knows, the first £20 of holdings of higher valuation is also not rateable, so that the net effect of this increase in State assistance to the cost of the health services is that, over the country as a whole, three-quarters of the total cost of the service is now met in real terms from State funds and only 25 per cent of the cost in real terms is met by the ratepayer.</P>
      <P>I do not say that the burden of the rates falls equally on everybody.  I should be the last to say so because nobody appreciates better than I do the fact that what one ratepayer may have to find can vary very much from what his neighbour may have to find.  But, taking the situation as a whole, when I say that in real terms the contribution of the rates to the total cost of the health services is only 25 per cent I think I can stand over that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan said that at present 70 per cent of the people must pay for everything themselves.  This is highly misleading, to say the least, because apart from the 32 per cent of people who are in the so-called lower income group and who are entitled to a comprehensive free health service, though not yet, admittedly, with choice of doctor, the House well knows that people in the middle-income group have to pay only a very small amount <Col N="1311" /> of money for hospital or specialist services at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is doing me an injustice.  I said 70 per cent outside of hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right. I accept that is so.  I withdraw what I said: I misunderstood the Deputy in regard to this matter.  I have figures from the Household Budget Survey carried out in 1965-66 in regard to average household expenditure on a number of items.  For instance, while expenditure on tobacco, cigars and cigarettes came to 26/- and a fraction of a penny, entertainment to 8.60 shillings, drink to 15/-, the total of fees to doctors, dentists, opticians, medicines, drugs, hospitals and other medical expenses came to only 7.24 shillings. When you have regard to the fact that the hardship clause operates for people who have to pay too much for drugs it is, I think, clear that no person in the middle income group need suffer hardship. As Deputy Kyne pointed out, the actual overall figure for the amount collected from, say, the parents of mentally handicapped people going to hospital&mdash;this alleged 10/- per day&mdash; comes to something very tiny.  Where drugs are concerned the hardship clause is being progressively operated more and more for those concerned so that to suggest that the middle income group under the present system is not getting a fair deal is incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan also mentioned the matter of payment of doctors.  Here, again, there is a distinct difference between the view put forward by Deputy O'Higgins and that put forward by Deputy Ryan.  Both were speaking on behalf of the Fine Gael Party. Deputy O'Higgins is on record as having said that &ldquo;payment per item of service would probably be the most acceptable method to the medical profession. It has been adopted in both Australia and New Zealand but even in these countries it has its critics.  In my view such a system of payment would require a large administrative machine to check abuses, would suffer from the grave defect that it would <Col N="1312" /> provide no incentive to practise preventive medicine&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was some years ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was some years ago.  On the other hand, Deputy Ryan is now clearly on the side of the fee per item of service.  May I say on this that basically I agree with Deputy O'Higgins's approach and I believe it would not be in the long-term interests of doctors to have to consult a long list of agreed charges?  In other words, a fee per item of service would not be in the long-term interests of the doctors because they would be swamped by secretarial work and paper, not to mention that in any State where a fee per item of service operated without any contribution from the patient you would obviously need some system of administrative control.  If there is anything professional people generally dislike, apart from too much paper work, it is too much administrative control.</P>
      <P>In that connection Deputy Ryan said that in his opinion a fee per item of service would offer an incentive &mdash; human nature being what it is&mdash;to doctors to keep patients at home and to treat them there rather than have them sent to hospital, whereas a capitation service would be an inducement to them to send their patients away. May I put it this way?  I hope that human nature is such that those who have taken the Hippocratic oath would be better and would have more integrity than to fail to treat at home a patient who could be treated there adequately by them instead of sending that patient to hospital.  I hope this is so and that is a view I have expressed directly to representatives of the medical profession already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other thing I wish to add in regard to this matter is that wherever the form of payment is on the fee per service basis as, for example, in New Zealand there is always some amount paid by the patient himself.  There is no scheme of which I am aware in operation anywhere of a fee per item where there is not a direct charge on the patient, or some similar control.  I think that in operating such a scheme <Col N="1313" /> Deputy Ryan, if he were my successor, would find himself in serious difficulty.</P>
    <P>There are a few other matters not relevant really to anything that has been said earlier in the debate which I should like to deal with.</P>
    <P>Over the past few months, as the House probably knows, consultations have been taking place with representatives of the various hospitals and hospital groups in this city and elsewhere arising out of the recommendations of the Fitzgerald Report.  May I take this opportunity of publicly thanking Professor Fitzgerald and each member of the council for all the work that they put into it and, indeed, for the progress that has been made since last July in laying the groundwork for the implementation in due course of the recommendations they made?  I refer, obviously, mainly to the city of Dublin where these consultations have been going on continuously.</P>
    <P>There are a few things I want to say.  The impression has got abroad that it is my intention or the intention of my Department to take over the voluntary hospitals and convert them into State institutions.  There is also the impression abroad that, aside from the voluntary hospitals, the Department of Health or myself is interested in exercising progressively greater control over hospitals generally.</P>
    <P>With regard to voluntary hospitals I wish to say categorically, clearly and finally that there is no question whatsoever of the Department of Health or myself attempting to take over the voluntary hospitals and, indeed, there is no change so far as I am concerned in the basic policy laid down in the White Paper in 1966 in their regard. Any impression to the contrary that has got abroad is the result of some sort of misunderstanding but certainly does not reflect my situation or that of my Department.  I hope that by saying what I have said I will put an end to speculation and rumour in this regard.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the implementation of the Report recommendations will involve a radical change in the structure of hospital services generally in the city of Dublin.  You cannot reduce the number of acute hospitals from the <Col N="1314" /> present number finally to four without having considerable structural alterations in the process.  All I can say is that, again, all these changes will have to be worked out only in consultation with the representatives of the hospitals and the various groups of hospitals and that no doctrinaire approach on my part or on the part of my Department will prevent that consultation from being completely successful.</P>
    <P>With regard to the country, may I say that I am not prepared to have the recommendations of that report treated as political issues in regard to any hospital, no matter where it is and, if people try to make it a political issue, then the report will simply be, so far as the country is concerned, still another pious expression of hope?</P>
    <P>I was interested that Deputy Ryan was so keen on the preventive aspect of medicine and I thoroughly agree with him and, indeed, would draw his attention to the fact that this has been more and more the policy of my Department in recent years and would say that, as far as we are concerned, interest in the preventive aspect of medicine will be intensified.</P>
    <P>Whether this or, indeed, the Fine Gael scheme as suggested by Deputy Ryan would have the result of reducing very substantially the enormous number of working days&mdash;14 million, he says&mdash;which are lost through illness annually in this country is something I cannot say, although I would point out that where illness has to be certified for social welfare benefits, obviously, the patient concerned is already under medical care if the illness has to be certified.</P>
    <P>There is one final matter.  As I said at the beginning, I was thankful to Deputy Kyne for having taken a certain line in this debate, and, indeed, as far as I am concerned, my only interest and concern is that this enormous bill be met in the best possible way.  Frankly, I do not believe that the present system is one which people themselves regard as putting them in the pauper class.  So far as choice of doctor is concerned, this is obviously desirable, not merely from the patient's point of view but from a strictly social and human aspect; but <Col N="1315" /> I do not think the average person in the country who applies for a medical card regards himself as being a pauper and Members of the House who receive letters from those who have been turned down for medical cards would, I think, agree with me that they get no such impression from their constituents.</P>
    <P>Finally, in regard to the Labour Party health policy, I would obviously much prefer the Labour Party approach to either the Fianna Fáil or the Fine Gael appoach.  When I say that I say it with this reservation, that in the present state of our economy it is unrealistic to try to have a comprehensive health service which &mdash; I hope I am not misrepresenting the Labour viewpoint &mdash;would remove entirely the ratepayers' contribution and put it all on the taxpayer to expand to 100 per cent the people entitled, as in Great Britain, to a free comprehensive service.  As Deputy Kyne mentioned, the Queen is just as entitled as any of her subjects. To try to do it in the present state of our economy is, I believe, unrealistic. I believe that it will be unrealistic in the foreseeable future if only because of the fantastic direct cost on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Realising this situation, we have felt all down the years and have said in the White Paper that, not merely from the point of view of realism but from other points of view, the elderly, the poor, the unemployed, people suffering from chronic illness, people living on small farms and so forth must be looked after and that the others must pay.</P>
    <P>If only Fine Gael would have accurately articulated for the benefit of the House how their scheme would operate, then this motion would have served a considerable purpose.  In the meantime, I can only say that I believe that our approach is right.  I believe that, while the service is not perfect, it is good and improving and that we intend to continue to improve it under the Health Bill which will be introduced very soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to indulge in semantics over this motion but, of course, we were right in the <Col N="1316" /> amendment that we proposed in so far as we were in doubt as to what Fine Gael meant when they said &ldquo;a comprehensive health service based upon insurance principles&rdquo;.  This was very vague and ambiguous.  It did not include additional funds from central taxation and we know that a comprehensive health service operating upon insurance alone would be impracticable. We are a little dubious about the phrase &ldquo;which will provide without charge, and as of right, for all people within the scheme...&rdquo;.  To us that is very ambiguous, implying a health service which was merely an extension of the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme.  That would be utterly unacceptable to us.  We want a comprehensive health service paid for from central taxation and an insurance scheme which will operate by means of graded contributions under a combined social welfare scheme.</P>
      <P>We should not haggle over words. The main thing is that the Minister has dragged his feet for two years and has done nothing about introducing this new health scheme.  This scheme, of course, merely offers a choice of doctor to 30 per cent, and only 30 per cent, of the people.  It offers nothing else. The Minister has not said when this scheme will be put into operation. He promised it last year and the year before.  He promised recently that the Second Stage would be taken on 18th February and he now says it will be taken in another two weeks.  I believe he has no intention of bringing this scheme into operation but he wants to dangle the scheme as bait in the forthcoming election.</P>

      <P>The Minister carried on negotiations with the medical profession for months, fruitless negotiations. He asked that discussions be held in private.  What was the reason?  He never gave any proper reason why the discussions had to be held in private. These matters concern the public and they should be discussed in public.  The Minister tries to give the impression that the position in relation to the present health scheme is quite rosy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1317" /> I can tell him it is anything but rosy. The position is really bad for those who are deprived of medical cards. One man received an increase of 8/3d and he had his medical card withdrawn. He asked, if he returned the 8/3d, could he have the medical card renewed.  We all know the humiliation of people who must sit in queues in cold dispensaries.  The Minister has given no indication when these dispensaries will be abolished.  I think the people are wise to the position; they know Fianna Fáil will not introduce this health scheme in the foreseeable future.  When will it be implemented?</P>

      <P>It is humiliating. It should be abolished without delay. The Minister thinks the capitation rate operates successfully in Britain. He forgets that the capitation rate operates there for the entire population. A recent study in Britain has shown that the application of the capitation rate to the equivalent group here would require a capitation rate payable in this country of five times the British rate.  The Minister is trying to compare the system in Britain, which operates for the entire population, with his own system, which will operate for no more than 30 per cent of the population.  He has stated it will not operate for more than 30 per cent. I think the capitation rate will encourage more and more hospitalisation since it will not be possible for doctors to operate good medicine because of the enormous demands that will be made on their time.  The Minister would be well advised to make proposals which will permit of good medicine operated in ideal conditions.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will implement the Fitzgerald Report in full since he is so keen to praise it.  We will give every support to a comprehensive health service, financed from central funds in conjunction with graded contributions under the social welfare system from all earners in the community. This will exclude pensioners and those who have no means.  We believe such a system could operate most successfully.  We had doubts about the feasibility of the Fine Gael motion and the means suggested by them.  If they excluded the jet set we would not approve the system.  They should be included; they should pay their contribution.  What they do after that is their own business.  If they do not want to avail of the scheme that is their affair, but they should make their contribution like everyone else.</P>

      <P>There is an everincreasing demand and need for better services.  Systems become out of date and need careful attention and examination in order to bring them up to date and give equality to all sections of our community and, in particular, do justice to the weaker sections.  In my opinion, this motion is a cleansing <Col N="1319" /> of conscience on the part of the Fine Gael Party.  As a member of Dublin Health Authority and of Dublin Corporation I have seen the activities of the Fine Gael group.  It is not so long ago since members of the Fine Gael Party on the Dublin Corporation sought a reduction in the health estimate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>What I would like to see achieved by this legislation, and by further legislation which may be developed in understanding with the people involved over the next few years, would be rules of behaviour to protect and preserve the worker's power to achieve and hold his due place in the community and at the same time to provide the framework within which the power of the workers in our system of industrial relations is kept safely in the hands of the workers themselves by giving them the capacity to vote on its use or its restraint by majority rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a convenience in dividing disputes into two broad categories. There are rights disputes developing from a worker's belief that there is interference <Col N="1320" /> with a right which he claims to have, being a right stemming from an agreement, a custom, a law or a practice.  The other main body of disputes, interest disputes, are those arising out of claims for increased pay or better working conditions.  In each case, the danger exists that the disputes can be brought to a test of strength. The State's concern is to provide machinery so that disputes can be resolved before developing into great tests of strength.  This implies first of all an expectation by the State that the employer and worker would do their level best to find a solution before turning for outside help and then, when turning for outside help, would approach it on the basis of seeking a peaceful solution rather than winning a battle.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that if somebody decides from the beginning to have a test of strength, whatever the machinery, there is little we can do about it in a free country, but be dragged along by such a person. Equally well if people set their expectations too high, and if the machinery does not give them what they want, they may, so to speak, reject the referee and then decide to go on to a test of strength even if they had not started out with that intention.  Again our freedoms allow that to happen.</P>
    <P>Apart from these considerations, I would say that in the case of rights in which discipline or dismissal may be involved, I believe that a quick examination by an independent person would prevent escalation and avoid many of the sudden stoppages to which such disputes may lead.  Perhaps the House would be interested to know that while strikes due to rights disputes are quite numerous, about 80 per cent of the man days lost are lost because of disputes about wages and hours of employment, so that our main economic trouble and the main hardships imposed on workers in the community arise in the area of settlement of wages and incomes.  There is an occasional suggestion that the removal of wages and incomes decisions from the area of dispute would be a solution. This would mean having a tight-knit system in which every wage, income, dividend, rent, professional fees, profits <Col N="1321" /> and so on, would be determined by some authority, as distinct from the present free system where wages and salaries are fixed by negotiation.</P>
    <P>However, I should like to point out that such an authority would have to have extraordinary powers if it did not receive the support of a massive consensus and as well as that the individual acceptance in each case of the decisions it hands down as to what wage levels should be.  We have experience already of recommendations of the Labour Court being rejected and I have no reason to believe that any other authority would have its decisions accepted.  In the case of their nonacceptance, the freedom to strike and to place pickets and all the hardships and days lost and the economic setbacks would be the same as if an award at the free negotiating table were in dispute.</P>
    <P>I do not, however, exclude the setting up of an independent body which would lay down firm guidelines and so support the negotiators and Labour Court as to make more acceptable to workers and management recommendations in wage and salary related to our economic potential.  I accept what trade unionists have told me that in such a situation all incomes, not just wages alone, should be subject to the same scrutiny.  I would add that there is nothing in my experience so far to suggest that decisions of such a body would be accepted in individual instances even if agreed to in principle by the trade union movement generally. However, we must be prepared to give every possible help in making wages and salaries less the subject of dispute than they are at present.  For that reason, as I say, I do not exclude the setting up of an independent body.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, we have to accept this fact: whatever method of determining wages and salaries we have&mdash; the strike weapon must be left with the worker so that he will not be in any way hindered in seeking his share. What we must attempt to do is to protect and preserve this strength of the worker and place it, if we can, more solidly within his power and out of the reach of haphazard pressure groups who would act without the authority of <Col N="1322" /> the majority of the workers.  I would also propose to avoid any radical unacceptable change in procedures for industrial relations and I present now what I think are acceptable amendments to improve the procedures, to reduce delays and to suggest to those involved to get down to real meaningful negotiations before moving on to seek the help of the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>I propose in the Industrial Relations Bill to introduce a new type of machinery for the settlement of certain kinds of disputes which should be of considerable benefit to workers.  Quite a number of disputes develop about such things as discipline and dismissals and often these find their way to the Labour Court.  I do not think that, even though at times there may be some matters of principle involved, the Labour Court is the right place for dealing with individual cases, but something else is needed to give a quick and authoritative opinion on this type of dispute.  It is proposed to take power, therefore, to appoint one or more rights commissioners.</P>
    <P>A commissioner will investigate privately and quickly a dispute which arises out of a right which a worker claims to have, being, as I say, a right stemming from an agreement, a custom or a practice.  The commissioner can make this investigation at the request of either party to the dispute, unless the other party objects. If the other party does object, then the dispute would have to be dealt with in the way such disputes would be dealt with today.  The parties to a dispute before the rights commissioner will be free to accept or reject the recommendation made by the commissioner. Either party may appeal the commissioner's recommendation to the Labour Court but only on the basis that the Court's decision on the appeal will be binding on the parties.  The rights commissioner cannot hear a case which has been before the Labour Court and the Labour Court cannot hear a case which had been before a commissioner save, of course, by way of appeal.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to the proposal in section 6 of the Industrial Relations Bill which envisages an exsal <Col N="1323" /> tension of the scope of the duties of the conciliation officers, who will in future be known as industrial relations officers.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the part played by these officers in preventing and settling disputes.  The conciliation service was set up under the 1946 Act for the purpose of mediating in disputes. The officers of the service have succeeded in averting many stoppages of work; they have also succeeded, in certain cases, in getting the parties to negotiate better working arrangements and to establish long-term negotiating machinery through the operation of such bodies as joint industrial councils.</P>
    <P>The service has had to be expanded considerably over the past few years and conferences are now being organised at the rate of nearly 1,000 conferences a year.</P>
    <P>In the course of their work the officers of the service amass much valuable information.  They see where good relations operate; and conversely they see the defects in procedures and practices which cause tensions and breakdowns in communications and which sometimes lead to stoppages of work.</P>
    <P>I believe that the fund of experience accumulated by these officers, and the confidence and goodwill they enjoy among employers, managers, personnel officers and trade unions, should be used more extensively for the improvement of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>I propose accordingly to ask the Labour Court to examine means by which the members of the service might make their knowledge and advice available to managements and trade unions in the interest of bringing about improved procedures in industries and services.  It is on management that the main responsibility for establishing and maintaining satisfactory procedures rests and I would like to encourage managements to take advantage of this knowledge and advice, particularly in cases where defects are known to exist.</P>
    <P>In 1966 draft proposals suggested that, in relation to the various conciliation and arbitration schemes which exist at present for employees in the <Col N="1324" /> Civil Service, the Local Government service and so on instead of having a number of different arbitrators for the different bodies, claims which could not be resolved by conciliation should be referred for determination by the Labour Court, the court, for this purpose, to be augmented by individuals drawn from a panel of persons with economic, social or other appropriate qualifications.  This was proposed because of the multiplicity of arbitrators involved, who by applying different considerations to the cases brought before them, were handing down decisions which were producing discontent among other groups in the public service and generating an undesirable amount of leapfrogging as well.  I felt that the Labour Court, with its fulltime and continuing responsibility in the field of industrial relations, could bring to bear upon these issues its much broader knowledge of the whole scene; and, while not necessarily aiming at uniformity in pay and conditions, I had hoped that, under such an arrangement, they could bring about a better relationship between the different groups in the public sector and between public and private employment.</P>
    <P>I must say that I was disappointed that the unions and staff associations in the public sector objected so strongly to this proposal.  Their objection, I think, was based mainly on the ground that they had no say in the selection of the chairman of the Labour Court, whereas, under the terms of their existing agreements, they had a say in the nomination of the chairman of their particular arbitration body.  While I was disappointed at failing to get broad acceptance of this arrangement or of some variant of it, I have not entirely lost hope that, before the Bill is finally passed, we will be able to get the agreement of the staffs to an improvement on the compromise provision now included in section 9 of the Industrial Relations Bill.  This compromise provision is to provide that two members of the Labour Court, one a workers' member and one an employers' member, will become members of each of the various arbitration bodies, and thereby let the body have the benefit of their experience from the Labour Court point of view.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1325" /> I am providing in section 21 of the Industrial Relations Bill for the dissolution of the Electricity Supply Board manual workers and general employees tribunals.  However successful these tribunals may have been in the beginning, it is clear now that they no longer serve their original intention which was, to use the words of the Act, to make a determination of a dispute.  Being statutory tribunals they have introduced an element of rigidity which is not suitable to conditions today and by abolishing them I will be leaving the way open for the ESB to negotiate with its employees for whatever system of industrial relations procedures suits their particular conditions. I hope that the ESB and the unions will develop satisfactory procedures to solve the most of their problems.  I would hope that the system would make it necessary for the parties to have really deep negotiations before bringing any problems forward for formal investigation by the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>As I have said, in 1966 draft proposals for legislation were widely circulated among interested parties and I discussed them with employer and labour representatives, notably the Federated Union of Employers (FUE) and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU).  Some of the most important features of the 1966 proposals were severely criticised by the ICTU, whose spokesmen went so far as to say that, if certain of the proposals were proceeded with, trade unions would refuse to co-operate in the working of the legislation.  Whatever about the merits of those particular proposals, it was clear that it would have been futile to go ahead with them in the light of the trade union reaction.  As the need for some improvements were apparent, and in an anxiety to secure the widest possible degree of agreement between employer and worker interests, I set up two working parties, one with the FUE and one with the ICTU to examine the causes of industrial unrest and propose solutions.</P>
    <P>A 1966 proposal was that the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, should be amended whereby the Labour Court would not investigate a trade dispute unless both or all parties asked it to <Col N="1326" /> act and undertook to accept the Court's decision, the penalties for refusal to accept to be, in the case of workers, withdrawal of the protection of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, for three months, and, in the case of an employer, an appropriate fine.</P>
    <P>The ICTU vehemently opposed this proposal which they described as &ldquo;a move to abolish the Labour Court and establish an arbitration body in its place&rdquo;.  As they saw it, the proposal would mean that workers who wanted their case heard could not get a hearing from the Court unless they bound themselves beforehand, under penalty, to accept the Court's decision.  The Congress have firmly stated that workers in unions affiliated to the Congress are not prepared to submit to this condition.</P>
    <P>The formal reaction of the FUE was that the Labour Court should play, in the sphere of industrial relations, the role which the civil courts play in relation to civil affairs.  The employers, while adhering to this viewpoint, indicated in subsequent consultations that if it could not be brought about the Court should continue to operate as at present.</P>
    <P>The concept behind the proposal was to encourage the settlement of disputes as early on in the line of procedures as possible, and to enhance the status of the Labour Court by making it more remote and by exacting, so to speak, a &ldquo;price&rdquo; for its services. If the parties to a dispute knew that the ultimate piece of machinery would be available to them only on the condition that they would undertake to accept the findings, it was hoped that the parties would make greater efforts to resolve the dispute between themselves or, failing that, by invoking the concilation service of the Labour Court.  What could not be envisaged was the extent, if any, to which the parties would use the court on the basis proposed in 1966; indeed the possibility that the court would not be used at all could not be ruled out. If, as foreshadowed by the Congress reaction, parties to industrial disputes simply refused to use the Labour Court, the situation would then be that the State had provided a court which <Col N="1327" /> would rarely, if ever, be &ldquo;in session&rdquo; and the members of which could do no more than stand by while public representatives and other prominent citizens tried to settle disputes which were unresolved at conciliation level.</P>
    <P>Although the FUE adhere to the view that the Labour Court should play a similar role to that of a civil court the present position is that both workers and employers want the Labour Court to be freely available to help them resolve their disputes. Essentially the parties themselves want to continue to be free to settle their own disputes, with, if they wish to ask for it, the help of the conciliation service of the Labour Court, or of the court itself.  They do not want imposed settlements and, in any event, this procedure could not be forced on them.</P>
    <P>Experience suggests that State-sponsored procedures aimed at prompting harmony in industrial relations cannot be successfully operated if they have built into them the opposition of the parties concerned; and no good would be achieved by giving the parties machinery which they do not want and would not use.  It is not proposed, therefore, to make any fundamental change in the role of the court, but rather to make such changes as will make the court as it is a more effective instrument in promoting industrial peace.  Power is being taken to appoint, if necessary, extra members to the Labour Court so that it can operate in three divisions instead of two as at present, and to have available a fulltime as well as a part-time deputy chairman.  Pensions will be provided for members of the Labour Court. I feel, however, that although I now propose to leave the court as it is there should be, at least, some moral commitment on the parties who want a hearing and I propose that normally the court will not investigate a dispute unless, following failure to settle at conciliation level, there is a request for an investigation from the parties. Too frequently, unions at present let the employer ask for the hearing&mdash;or let the court itself take the initiative&mdash; and then, if complaint is made later <Col N="1328" /> about rejection of the court's award, they say, in defence, that they did not ask for a hearing but were &ldquo;brought&rdquo; or &ldquo;dragged&rdquo; before the court.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Relations Act, 1946, provides that, when the Labour Court investigates a dispute, is shall make a recommendation as to how it thinks the dispute should be settled.  From time to time the court finds itself in the position where it considers that the parties should continue or resume discussions among themselves and it does not make a formal recommendation as to how the disputes should be settled. While it may be argued that such a step by the court could be considered as the making of a statutory recommendation that the dispute could best be settled by further talks, I consider that the matter should be removed from the realm of doubt.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I propose that the 1946 Act should be amended to provide that the court may make a recommendation instead of that it shall do so.  It will be provided, however, that (a) if workers or a trade union ask the court to investigate a dispute and agree beforehand&mdash;as a moral commitment&mdash;to accept the recommendation, or (b) if the parties to a conciliation conference agree upon a limited issue on which they wish to have the court's recommendation, and agree in advance to accept the court's ruling, there will be an obligation on the court to investigate&mdash;in private session&mdash;on a priority basis, and make a recommendation.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Relations Act, 1946, provides that the Labour Court may hold any sitting or part of a sitting in private.  I had proposed in 1966 that in future the proceedings of the court would normally be in private unless the court was of opinion that, in the public interest, a particular case should be heard in public.  Arguments can be advanced for and against both public and private hearings.  In the case of public hearings there is a tendency for the parties to start afresh and cover ground already covered at conciliation level.  There is also a temptation for spokesmen at public hearings to strike &ldquo;party line&rdquo; attitudes for publicity purposes.  Against private hearings, it <Col N="1329" /> can be argued that the public should know what is going on and that industrial disputes which affect the public should not be resolved behind closed doors.</P>
    <P>I would like to give the parties themselves a say in this matter and I now propose that the investigation of a trade dispute by the court will be in private but that the court may, if a party to a dispute requests, decide to hold a hearing in public.  Even in that case the court may hold any part of a sitting in private in order to meet the situation in which information was being submitted which the court considered was confidential to the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 68 (1) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, imposes on the Labour Court, when making a recommendation, the obligation to take into account a number of considerations which can contradict one another.  I propose, therefore, that section 68 (1) should be amended to read as follows:</P>
    <P>The court, having investigated a trade dispute, may make a recommendation setting forth its opinion on the terms on which it should be settled.</P>
    <P>The court will be given a new function in relation to rules of fair employment. It is intended that the Labour Court should encourage representative groups of workers and employers in various industries to work out and agree upon the basic conditions of good employment for workers covering such things as notice, discipline, dismissals, etc.  Where these are agreed upon, they would be converted into statutory rules by the Labour Court and can then be legally enforced.  It is hoped by this method to afford to workers some better certainty and clarity as to their rights in this area, that is those facets of employment not immediately concerned with the direct wage element.</P>
    <P>There are some tidying up features such as making it clear that the Labour Court can give an interpretation of an employment agreement if asked to do so by the parties to the agreement; giving employers the right to complain to the court about noncompliance <Col N="1330" /> with the terms of a registered employment agreement; giving the Minister's inspectors power to check on compliance with registered agreement in the same way as they check on agreement in employment regulation orders and reducing from 30 to 21 days the period for making representations about the terms of proposed employment regulation orders.</P>
    <P>At present, workers employed by or under the State have not access to the Labour Court.  Many of the persons in this category are, of course, included in the various public service arbitration boards but there are some like forestry workers who have neither the arbitration boards nor access to the Labour Court.  It is proposed to correct this by giving the State employees access to the Labour Court if they are not covered by conciliation and arbitration schemes.</P>
    <P>Moving on to my proposed amendments to the trade union law, I should like to say again that this evolved out of four years of consideration, including over a year of discussions with the trade union movement representatives and the representatives of employers. The purpose is to put into the hands of the majority of workers in any one situation the decision to use the weapons of strike and picketing.  There is no attempt whatever to impose control on this from outside the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>Since my approach to this legislation has been to avoid taking powers for the Government which I feel should normally rest with a healthy trade union movement, I would like to ask individual members and Congress to take this opportunity of working for the success of this approach.</P>
    <P>If I found them committed to work and drive for the success of legislation which leaves the power with the unions then I would undertake to move in this House for the repeal of the Electricity (Special Provisions) Act, 1966, the provisions of which are not in accord with such an approach.</P>
    <P>I think first of all we will have to accept that every individual cannot get everything he wants out of every situation. Therefore, the proposals in this legislation are proposals which will give the majority in any one situation <Col N="1331" /> the decisive voice in the action to be taken.  At the same time, there is nothing in the proposals to damage the rights of smaller groups.  It merely gives the authority to the majority, in cases where the whole group is to be made participate in any particular dispute or battle.</P>
    <P>I would stress from the beginning the desirability of comprehensive agreements and while we cannot demand these by law, we can make it easier for them to be negotiated.</P>
    <P>An important feature of the Trade Union Bill is that relating to group negotiation licences.  This proposal has already had a fair amount of publicity in trade union circles and may have met with some opposition.  There is nothing compulsory whatsoever in it. It is entirely up to the workers concerned to decide if they want it.</P>
    <P>Clearly the aim of both workers and employers is to secure progress with stability.  It must be in the interests of both to know that for a period ahead, there will be no unrest, but at the same time agreed progression according as productivity increases. This kind of situation can best come about by the negotiation of comprehensive agreements covering a fixed period of time.  Fully comprehensive agreements are difficult to negotiate at any time, but they are made extraordinarily difficult where there are a number of unions catering for the same workers in the same trade or industry. We have all seen the effects of interunion rivalry and how one union may want to hold out and demonstrate its militancy and prevent the working out of a settlement which is acceptable to the majority.  The group negotiation licence is designed to cope with that situation, that is if, and I repeat if, the workers want to use the group facilities.  Here I must emphasise that the majority of the workers in an industry must want to operate a group system before the provisions of the Bill relating to the group have any effect. The workers cannot be compelled by anybody to form a group if they do not want to do so.  If a group is formed and it represents a majority of the <Col N="1332" /> workers in an industry, and if it has known rules for its conduct, for its method of negotiation, for holding ballots and for the interpretation of ballot results, an element of certainty that is missing at present would be brought into the picture and an employer would be encouraged in such circumstances to negotiate firm progressive agreements with his employees and to work out long-term commitments and reduce to writing the employees' rights in such matters as discipline and dismissal etc., things which today are often left vague.</P>
    <P>Today, the worker in good employment, who has entered into many commitments, can find himself on strike on an issue with which he has no concern and, indeed, no voice.  He is looking for protection against the liability of being thrown out of employment by other people's rash actions.  He would have some measure of protection through a properly constituted group negotiating procedure, since through his union he would have a voice in the decision taken whether to go on strike or not.  This is not an antistrike provision: if there is a decision of the group to go on strike, then the strike takes place with all the protection of the law.</P>
    <P>This is essentially an enabling provision. It is put there in the hope that the workers can see for themselves the advantages for them in such a system, and in the hope that they will embrace it and use it.</P>
    <P>I know that today under the encouragement of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions many unions have come together and formed groups for the better conduct of their negotiations with their employer.  These groups work unevenly and are effective only for as long as all unions concerned remain together.  In particular these groups have no way of protecting themselves against a union which wants to break out of the group and go it alone, often against the wishes and interests of the others still in the group.  I would hope that the unions who wish to work in groups, who see the advantages for their future employment in operating through groups, would see the proposal in the Bill for what it is, namely, a method being offered to them whereby <Col N="1333" /> they can have that little bit of authority which they lack at present to see that their proceedings are orderly, have some greater certainty than they have at present about such things as balloting, announcing results of ballot and deciding upon the interpretation of the ballot.  Trade unions try to operate under democratic principles.  This scheme would give them a better opportunity of seeing that democracy can work.</P>
    <P>There could be a tie in here too between the group negotiating licences and the rights commissioners.  One of my main hopes for the group negotiating licence idea, if it took on, would be the negotiation of really comprehensive agreements, long standing agreements relating to the various facets of an employee's status within the industry. Too many of the agreements which we have today are open-ended affairs designed merely to patch up a dispute arising out of a wage claim.  I could picture that there would be a clause in these negotiated agreements that disputes on rights issues or the interpretation of the agreement itself would be determined by a rights commissioner. Indeed, there are already in existence a number of agreements where provision is made for interpretation by the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>For years there has been debate on the principles which ought to govern the issue of negotiating licences generally. Where can you draw the line between the rights of persons to form associations on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the disruptive effects which can be caused by giving recognition to each and every splinter group that wants to break away from the main stream.  There is general agreement that we already have too many separate unions in this country and many voices are heard deploring attempts at further splintering.  What is to be done about it?  The trade unions do not want to give to a Minister or other public authority the power of deciding who should get a licence, nor are they prepared to take upon themselves the responsibility for such a decision.  Therefore, what I propose is that in future, before a negotiation licence is granted, it must be demonstrated that there is reasonable <Col N="1334" /> stability in the new group, that it is a sizeable group, and that it has a serious interest and is not just a group formed out of temporary annoyance with an existing association.  To get a licence in future, a newly formed union must have not fewer than 500 members.  It must maintain a minimum deposit of £5,000 with the High Court, and it must maintain both these provisions for at least 18 months before it will be entitled to the negotiating licence.</P>
    <P>To me it is extraordinary that there can still be occasions with some unions where the serious decision to call a strike can be determined by a show of hands in the hall.  It is expecting too much of human nature to say that the not so articulate in such circumstances should have the courage to outface the bullying few at a gathering like that.  I believe that the majority of workers do not want the continuation of that system.  They do want, and demand the right, to have a voice in the decision on whether or not to go on strike.  They should be able to express this opinion under conditions which do not amount to intimidation.  I am, therefore, providing that, whether it is in the rule book of a union at present or not, it shall be deemed to be a rule of every union in future, that before a strike notice is served, the majority of the members in the union entitled to vote, must by secret ballot approve of serving the strike notice; but that, notwithstanding such approval, the executive committee or other controlling authority of a trade union may, at its discretion, decide not to serve the strike notice.  If a union should serve a strike notice without holding a proper secret ballot, then it would be breaking union rules and it is up to the members of the union who are aggrieved by this action to apply the remedies which they have under union rules.</P>
    <P>It has been law since 1941, under section 11 of the Trade Union Act, 1941, that the protections afforded to trade unions by the Trade Disputes Act of 1906 are reserved to registered trade unions who are holding negotiating licences.  It could be read into that section that the protection extends not only to the trade union but also to any of its members whether or not <Col N="1335" /> they are acting under union authority or unofficially.  It is proposed to remove this ambiguity and make it clear that the protection of the 1906 Act is intended to extend only to the trade union and its members when they are acting under the trade union authority and within the union rules.  In any event it would seem to me to be entirely illogical that a right which by the 1941 Act was intended to be reserved to a trade union acting under its full authority should be extended to members of that union who are acting contrary to the wishes and rules of their union.</P>
    <P>I am proposing another small change in relation to the law on picketing. The Trade Disputes Act, 1906 as at present worded would allow pickets to be placed on an employer's private dwelling house.  Whatever may have been the need for such a provision in 1906 I think that it has no place in today's scene and I am providing that the protection of picketing will no longer extend to an employer's private house unless it is quite clear that he is attempting to transfer his business to his house and carry it on from there.</P>
    <P>It has been held in the courts that the Trade Disputes Act protection is confined to persons employed in what is described as &ldquo;trade or industry&rdquo;. This artificial distinction has operated to the disadvantage of certain categories of workers and it is being made clear in the Trade Union Bill that the protection extends to employed persons generally who are members of trade unions with negotiating licences.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a more positive move towards the amalgamation of unions and I am not alone in this wish. I know that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for many years has been trying its best to encourage a move along these lines but with very, very limited success.  The move must come from the unions themselves, but I am anxious to give what help I can.  In this Bill I am seeking authority to give financial assistance to the trade unions which decide to amalgamate; to help towards defraying the exceptional expenses of the process of amalgamation. That, in itself, may not be enough and, <Col N="1336" /> indeed, it may be desirable to contemplate help from the legislature as a separate issue.  What I have in mind would be such legislation as the unions would find necessary to ease them over the present legal obstacles to amalgamation. Reverting for a moment to the group negotiating licences one incidental benefit from that idea, if it is taken up, could be that from their association together in working groups the unions might be encouraged to form some types of more permanent federation leading ultimately to amalgamation.</P>
    <P>I call on the members of the trade unions to solve this problem although I appreciate how difficult it is for any body of people with a tradition and an identity to lose this identity.  Indeed, I have evidence that it is no easier for employers' bodies to do it or for political parties for that matter.  The way our economy shapes in the future could depend to a large extent on a reduction in the number of unions or on an amalgamation or rationalisation of their activities.</P>
    <P>The review of the law on trade unions and on industrial relations has been going on for a long time and a great variety of ideas and propositions have been examined.  There is an extraordinary sensitiveness and suspicion about Government action in these areas.  I have, indeed, been accused of preparing anti-trade union law.  This simply is not correct.  Nearly everybody will say that our system of industrial relations is not good and will urge the Government &ldquo;to do something about it.&rdquo; The Government want to do something about it but do not want to transfer to themselves all the responsibilities and anxieties for good industrial relations which must rest primarily with employers and workers.</P>
    <P>The search has been, therefore, to identify what is wrong at present and to see if agreement can be reached on the remedies.  Some union spokesmen will say as they have often said before: &ldquo;We know what is wrong with industrial relations.  We know where the trouble lies, we are in the best position to know what to do.  Leave it to us and we will cure it in our own way.&rdquo;  I would, indeed, be happy to <Col N="1337" /> leave it to them to find a cure if I thought that by their own unaided efforts they could produce results but recent happenings do not encourage one to believe that the results which not only the trade union movement but the community as a whole desire can come without the aid of legislation.  I would emphasise that I do not claim that legislation alone can produce an answer.  The answer must come from the disposition of those concerned in industrial relations to improve them but I do think that legislation has a part to play here.  I believe that the majority of trade unionists, while wanting to retain their basic freedoms, want as well to live in a stable society where they have for their support a strong trade union movement which will assure them of orderly progression.</P>
    <P>There are, however, a number in a small minority who are living in the past and who are relying upon trade union ideas and attitudes which may have been appropriate for an age which is now past.  They are fearful of change and see in every suggestion which is put to them &ldquo;the thin edge of the wedge&rdquo; by which the Government will gradually take over control of the unions or take away their authority.  I do not know how they can be reassured that that is not the intention or anybody's intention.  Maybe they can be reassured by their more forward thinking brethren and encouraged to give a fair trial to the ideas being advanced.</P>
    <P>It is because of these fears that I suggest we should hasten slowly but I do not think that we should wait another 20 years before suggesting further changes.  I think we should contemplate making changes as they occur to us and as they can be agreed and accepted as good ideas, and I for one would be happy to see the Minister for Labour coming to this House, even rather frequently, with Bills taking a step at a time along the road to progress and reform.</P>
    <P>I have outlined my proposals for improving the situation in this complex field of industrial relations and trade union organisation.  It is clear, I think, to all Deputies that in this area real <Col N="1338" /> and lasting improvements cannot be effected by legislation.  Rather is the purpose of legislation to facilitate those directly concerned to work the system that has been evolved here in the smoothest way practicable.</P>
    <P>However, I must ask the House to endorse my view that, unless the freedom given to employers and trade unions is matched with a sense of responsibility, that freedom is in danger of being abused&mdash;as, indeed, it has been in the past&mdash;with damaging, and sometimes cruel, consequences for many of our people and for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Much thought, time and effort has gone into the building up of institutions and procedures and these have been made freely available to those wishing to use them.</P>
    <P>While there could never be a legal compulsion on any party to use any or all of these procedures, I feel strongly that there ought to be a very strong moral obligation to use the disputesettling machinery before thought is given to ordering strikes, lockouts or pickets.</P>
    <P>During the past few weeks many people have asked me why these procedures were not used before action to precipitate a massive shut down of industry was taken.  No convincing answer can be given.</P>
    <P>Further, I should like to put it to employers and workers alike that, having used all the available machinery for negotiation and conciliation and being still unable to resolve their differences, they should put their case to the Labour Court&mdash;a body equally representative of employers and workers with an independent chairman &mdash;and they should accept the advice of that body for the settlement of the particular dispute.</P>
    <P>To me and to many who have been in touch with me in recent weeks, this sounds a fair and reasonable proposition.</P>
    <P>I now put it publicly, in Dáil Éireann, to the employers and workers of Ireland and I invite them to say whether it is acceptable or not.</P>
    <P>If any interest cannot accept this, unconditionally, I would like to know <Col N="1339" /> what changes in our arrangements would make it acceptable to them, even for a trial period of, say, two or three years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to agree with the Minister in so far as we on this side of the House would like to allow the workers to retain their power and freedom.  We, in Fine Gael, do not advocate repressive trade union legislation but trade unions, as well as management, will have to put their house in order and not involve innocent workers as has been the case during the past couple of years, where a small group of workers keep out many others who have nothing to do with the dispute. We want responsible management and we want responsible trade unionists. Management should establish good relations with trade unions, particularly when they start in business.  We had an incident down in Shannon where an American company came in and did not know the set-up of the trade unions in Ireland.  They did not agree with our way of working, but when it was all fixed up they were quite happy.  When management start a business or industry they should straight away approach the trade unions to get a working agreement with them and not wait until they are coerced after they have got away with a few small things.  The kernel of the trouble is probably in the Government, but it is also definitely in management.  Eighty per cent of management in this country, submanagers and managers right up at the top, put personnel relations at the bottom of the agenda, and at every meeting it is still at the bottom of the agenda and it is put off and put off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know many trade unionists who feel it is put off to a stage where they have to bring in the strike weapon. Management consider that the making of savings or certain cut-backs is very important, when, in actual fact, a strike or industrial unrest in a firm can create a very bad relationship between management and employees.  This should be given priority and legislation should be brought in that a company with a certain number of employees <Col N="1340" /> should have a personnel manager or a personnel group.  One thing the Minister has mentioned which I shall refer to later is that he would allow trade unions, including British or foreign based unions, of 500 members to have a negotiating licence.  I believe the trade unions in this country should be all Irish.  One does not see any British unions in France, or German or French unions in Ireland.  When you have Irish-based trade unions you have officials who know the people and the workers, whereas if you have Britishbased trade unions you have officials over in Britain who are probably acting on behalf of 30,000 workers and suddenly a small thing crops up in Ireland; they send across five or six officials who probably have a good time when they arrive in the country.  They say: &ldquo;It is only a couple of thousand a week we have to pay out and we do not mind if the workers go on strike. We will pay&rdquo;.  I do not think it is a good thing for any Government to allow a foreign union to have a big control in the country.  It could harm us economically&mdash;I am not talking about any particular trade&mdash;if they had a big number of people employed, say in the rag trade in England.  They could certainly start a strike here and upset the Irish industry.  This should not be allowed.  All the unions should be Irish-based.  The cause of most of this unrest has been the inflation we have had in the last number of years. This is becoming worse, as far as I can see.  We have got into a habit here of having a percentage increase of wages. This may apply all right to the lower paid or the medium paid worker. However, if the lower paid worker gets ten per cent of £10 it gives him an increase of only £1 per week or £52 a year, whereas the person who gets ten per cent of £5,000 gets an increase of £500 a year.</P>
    <P>What we are doing is widening the gap and keeping the lower-paid workers away down.  This percentage arrangement, to which the Government and various people have agreed, is a bad thing for the country.  We are going back to the old English system of master and servant.  We have a tremendous tendency to appoint union officials to boards of public companies. <Col N="1341" /> Some of these officials know very little about the actual working of these firms except what they hear at various union meetings or through conversation with various members of the staff.  A worker would have a greater interest in it because his future would be involved.  The appointment of a worker to such boards could be tried out particularly in State-sponsored bodies in order to see how it could be brought into the private sector or if it should ever be brought into the private sector.</P>
    <P>Where a trade union has a dispute with Congress or there is an interunion dispute there should be some machinery either brought in by the Government or agreed by Congress that an outside body would adjudicate and make a recommendation.  The same applies to an individual who may have a dispute with a particular union.  At the moment he can go to the courts but that is a long-drawn-out and costly procedure and he may not have a job in the meantime.  The worker is afraid to risk this because it will cost a tremendous amount of money.  There should be some body or tribunal set up to deal with these problems speedily, something like the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>In case I forget it, there should be laid down a period inside which the Labour Court should give their recommendations. In Germany and Sweden there is a certain period provided within which recommendations must be made.  It cannot go on for a fortnight or three weeks or a month. There should be a limited time for the making of a recommendation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a very good job of improving the Labour Court. This has come about, as he said in his statement, as a result of the efforts of the various people who have worked on it.  They have seen various faults in the old system and some very good points in it.  They have brought in a rights commissioner, and are adding another committee and another deputy chairman.  These people know their job.  They have worked at it and I am sure the Minister has got most of his recommendations from these people. They have seen the need for improvement in the areas of strikes and balloting. <Col N="1342" /> I would agree with this, too, but if all these things had been brought in would they have solved today's problems? From what I can read into them, I do not think they would.  It is not getting at the causes of the trouble.  The country is like a big business, and it should be run as a business.  The Government can take credit, if credit is due, but the blame for the various troubles at the moment must be placed on the Government. As in a business, the Government are the directors of the country.  If the business fails or is in trouble financially or goes into bankruptcy, the directors must take the blame.  The present difficulties have been caused by Government policy over the last number of years.</P>
    <P>The Department of Labour is the personnel department of the Government, similar to a personnel office or committee in a big business.  I feel that to date, even though the Department of Labour has been there for four years, the Government, similar to business, have put the question of labour relations down to the end of their priorities.  They fixed up everything else in every other Department and then came to Labour relations.  When a personnel officer is engaged on staff relations a director cannot come up and sack three or four men because he would be undermining that personnel officer.  I feel the same thing applies to the Government.  While they were doing certain things which I will enumerate afterwards they were giving no chance to the Department of Labour.  I have sympathy with the Department on this.  I cannot see how any personnel job can be done if you have other sections of the Government upsetting it.</P>
    <P>We have had many strikes since 1964 and the present one is the biggest. The whole country could be involved in it.  Since 1957 we have complete inflation in this country.  All you have to do is to find out by how much the pound has depreciated.  We have had the Minister for Finance on inflation. Inflation causes the higher costs which demand rounds of wages.  Since 1963 we have had turnover tax, which put up the price of commodities to all the workers, and we have had the wholecultie <Col N="1343" /> sale tax, which again put up the costs indirectly.  The rates are increasing all the time.  They are going up astronomically every year now.  The Government have given the workers no chance to save in the Post Office or wherever they wish.  The rates of interest in the Post Office are disgraceful.  The workers are not willing to save.  They spend their money.  They feel that if they had put their money in the bank in 1960 it would be worth nothing today, even with the interest.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we have the Government spending more and taking a greater slice of the national cake all the time.  You have the various Ministers going round the country asking people to save.  The Government want extra production.  Suddenly, in a State company one sees political supporters getting the jobs at the top while the others have to work for promotion.  Sometimes there is a man at the top who may, or may not, have ability and he is put in charge of the company.  We have had a &ldquo;go&rdquo; economy before an election and a &ldquo;stop&rdquo; economy afterwards.  In many jobs where there is employment on daily rates one might work at a top wage one day and have no job at all tomorrow.  The workers are going to look for more money.</P>
    <P>The Government should get all the Departments working together and not have them working against each other. We have the Department of Education, where the Minister is trying to make more vocational training available for people.  We want more training for farming.  More thought should be given to the occupations boys are going to go into later.  In the big cities we should have engineering training, yet we spend 50 per cent of the boys' time up to the age of 14 or 15 years teaching them Irish.  We are not looking at this from the point of view of the total economy at all.  One of the most disgraceful things is that the Department of Local Government have no serviced land available in the city of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am relating the cost of all these items to the differential in wages.  If three men get £15 a week, these costs can hit them in different ways.  One person might be paying £5 per week in repayments on a house. If he bought a house in 1961 he would be paying £2 10s a week.  This man, when he goes into a trade union meeting, is forced to vote for a strike. He has no choice.  That is really the cause of the strike, rather than the &ldquo;fixing-up&rdquo; in the end.  Take, for example, three people earning £15 or £16 per week.  One might pay £1 per week in rent; one might pay £2 10s per week in repayments and the third £5 per week.  They might all be getting the same wage but some have less net in their pockets.  The people with the least are looking for a strike, and they are entitled to look for it.  But some people are paying a large amount in repayments on a house.  There is also the question of children's allowances. If a person is getting £16 or £20 a week and is feeding a large family, he may be in poverty while another with the same wage is in comfort.  This man with the large family again looks for a high wage increase which, if given, will leave us uncompetitive in the world market. The bad example given by the Government and the bad direction of the various Departments has a lot to do with the trouble.</P>
      <P>We come now to the provision concerning the group negotiating licence. This is not compulsory and unless there is tremendous goodwill from the trade unions you will not get it to work. When you examine it you find there is to be a secret ballot in relation to a proposed strike.  The Minister is leaving this to the trade unions.  A person might be frightened and might not vote freely. He might be swayed one way or another.  The secret ballot is the best way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister expect the unions, in a case where six unions are involved, to give one vote per union or to give a vote per number of members?  In Aer Lingus there are 4,000 employees. There are 14 unions but one union has 2,000 members.  In one case if there was a vote per person the 2,000 could be outvoted.  In another case the 2,000 <Col N="1345" /> workers could outvote the other 13 unions.  You could have the clerical workers outvoting everybody.</P>
    <P>To get down now to the individual system, how is it going to be worked? Is the Minister going to leave it to the trade unions?  I do not know how they are going to get something concrete out of it.  Section 4 (b) reads:</P>
    <P>(b) that the group has in membership trade unions affiliated to the body known as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions which have as members not less than 60 per cent of the total number of workers catered for by the group.</P>
    <P>What happens to the other 40 per cent? Are they entitled to negotiate separately? Is this cutting down on the present number of unions?</P>
    <P>There is one part of section 9 on which I am not clear.  Is a union to be debarred from following up a person who has delivered goods or who has traded with a house whose employees are on strike?  Is that person to be blacklegged for that reason? It is not quite clear whether he would be free or not.</P>
    <P>The debarring of unofficial strikes is one thing with which I agree but sometimes, not very often, unofficial strikes occur because some trade union official has not done his job at the negotiating table.  In that instance, is there some way in which the dispute could be negotiated quickly?  Overall, I should much prefer if there were no unofficial strikes but is there a danger that this might mean that all strikes might become unofficial?  Unofficial strikes are not covered by the 1906 Act.  Now, that this situation is to develop, if it happens that strikes may become unofficial, are we not weakening the powers of the trade union executive?  It might become a case of the tail wagging the dog.</P>
    <P>In reference to section 14, the Explanatory Memorandum states:</P>
    <P>This section provides that the rules of a trade union will be deemed to require that before a strike notice is served, a majority of the members of the trade union, entitled to vote, must, by secret ballot, approve of serving the strike notice.  Notwithstanding <Col N="1346" /> such approval, however, the executive committee or other controlling authority of a trade union may, at its discretion decide not to serve the strike notice.</P>
    <P>It refers to the majority of members present.  Does it mean the majority of the members of a trade union?  If it is the majority of members of a union it could involve fewer than 50 per cent because only that number might be present at a meeting.  How are trade unions to say who is a member?  Is it to be a paid up member or is a member who is two months behind in payment to be covered by this?  How will the Minister accept the unions' decision in this matter?  I submit there will have to be some provision to the effect that if a member is three months or six months in arrears he should not be regarded as a member for the purposes of this Bill&mdash;that is, he should not be a member subject to the Minister's approval.</P>
    <P>The other Bill, the Industrial Relations Bill, is, as I said at the beginning, more straightforward.  The Minister may, I presume, follow the advice of the various people attached to the Labour Court.  The only thing which I think is not clear is the qualifications of the chairman.  I presume members of this body will be picked by the Minister, having been nominated by the trade unions and the employers' organisations.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 7, I should like some explanation on the question of the interpretation of agreements.  The section refers to the application of the agreement to a particular person and it also mentions employers and trade unions.  Is the decision of the court here to be final and binding or can somebody refuse to accept it?  In this matter, if this is to be binding, it should be binding on all&mdash;there should not be one law for one and another for another. I wish to emphasise at this stage that the Labour Court have succeeded very well during the past 23 years and I suggest that all persons in the State should come under the Labour Court.  We may not agree all the time with the Minister's selection of members of the Court but I do not think, on the other hand, that any <Col N="1347" /> worker in the country, or any person, should not come under the Court's jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>Section 10 deals with a registered employment agreement and says that, if an employer or a trade union representative complains to the Court that an employer affected by the agreement has failed or neglected to comply with it, certain named provisions shall have effect.  It seems to me that it is only an employer who can object to a registered agreement. It is not clear that a trade union can complain or object.  The section provides for a penalty of £100 or a continuing fine of £10 per day.  The penalty appears to apply to an employer, to a trade union or to an individual employee because subsection (3) states that, if a person affected by such an agreement fails or neglects to comply with it, the person shall be guilty of an offence.  How will you get£100 from a worker?  If he cannot pay it, is he to spend the rest of his life in jail?</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that there is a right of appeal in cases where a rights commissioner has investigated the matter.  Both parties can go before the Court at this stage and the Court's decision should be binding because quite often it is pride on both sides that keeps employers and trade unions from fixing the dispute earlier.  The Court's decision should be by way of recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, we have not really got down to tackling the causes of disputes.  There is the suggestion that a personnel officer should be put into a firm and I suggest that workers should be told what the future holds for them in a firm.  I am not for a moment suggesting that workers should be told the business secrets of the firms but they should be capable of knowing if staying in this firm would be the best way in which they could provide for their families.  If such information were available to them they would be enabled to decide whether to stay on in the firm or go to another job.  Quite often when an employer gets a certain <Col N="1348" /> income from his business he decides to sit back and enjoy it.  The workers must decide whether staying on in such a firm is to their better advantage, by way of promotion and otherwise, or whether they should leave and get better jobs elsewhere.  Where capital is involved, shareholders are entitled to a share of the profits and the worker is also entitled to more consideration in this sphere.</P>
    <P>A lot of the trouble in industrial relations is caused by workers believing that the employer is taking too much out of the business and putting too little back.  There should be more consultation between employers and workers.  If the workers were consulted more often and were made part of a business, with their views being considered, then I think you would get rid of a lot of friction between the two.</P>
    <P>Three or four years ago the NIEC Report No. 11 was published and in it they dealt with an incomes policy. The Minister mentioned this in passing and said that there was no way of doing this.  I feel that if there is not an incomes policy for the wealthy, the shareholder and the non-employee, if you like, right down the line, then you are going to get the person who is probably drawing out too much and spending it and he leads the way for another person to become annoyed at the amount of money being spent and then that person looks for an increase. The report also referred to the control of profits.  That can be done afterwards by taxation.  This report was signed by the Federated Union of Employers, the Federation of Irish Industries as well as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  One section referred to company profits and to the fact that something similar to the American idea could be introduced here. Workers could be shown the company's accounts under the supervision of an accountant.  Too much need not be given away but enough could be shown to the workers so that they would know that they are not just numbers working in a business and that they are part of the company.  In most cases, I think, about 50 per cent, if not more of the outgoings of a business, go in wages.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1349" /> I should like to say generally that the Minister in comparison with his predecessors, who were in Industry and Commerce, has made very good efforts.  As he mentioned himself, he believes in doing things gradually to see how they will go.  He has done a good job and I congratulate him.  The only thing I should like to say is that it has taken four years where it might have been done in two years.</P>

      <P>Our text for today should, I suppose, be &ldquo;Ní hé lá na gaoithe, lá na scolb&rdquo;.  The predicament we are in is that the Minister appears to have a liking for bringing in what he would regard as controversial legislation, legislation affecting our industrial life, only at times of industrial standstill.  The precedent for this statement would be on the occasion of his last essay in this area when the Minister introduced the ESB (Special Provisions) Bill, to which he referred in his speech, at a time when the ESB, our power industry, was at a standstill.  All sides of the House, as well as all responsible bodies, now admit that that was harmful legislation.  The report of the group investigating conditions in the ESB stated that the ESB (Special Provisions) Act in itself contributes to problems of bad relations in the ESB.  Let us be honest about it.  I do not believe that times like these are the most suitable for Members of this House to come to this complex and difficult subject in the right frame of mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Too many Deputies think that there is a kind of short-cut to industrial peace&mdash;I referred to this before&mdash;and that the way lies as much as possible in bringing our industrial relations code into line with the sanctions of law in our civil courts.  Too many Deputies at the back of their minds <Col N="1350" /> have this kind of approach to industrial relations.  Indeed, the monument to that kind of thinking among the majority of Deputies is the ESB (Special Provisions) Act, which was supported by the majority of Deputies. Both the Government Party and the principal Opposition Party, Fine Gael, accepted the idea that there is a short-cut to industrial peace by invoking legal sanctions.  That is not the best way to tackle this difficult problem. Some of us may now be starting to realise that these problems are not susceptible to short-cuts by way of invoking legal sanctions.  Mark you, the Minister in his opening speech practically says, on behalf of his previous error, which was the ESB (Special Provisions) Act, to the trade unionists that under certain conditions he will withdraw that mistaken piece of legislation. Therefore, in certain parts of his speech he gives an indication that he is aware that the problem is not as simple as merely bringing in easy legal formulae and in other portions of his speech he unhappily gives the impression that legal sanctions still form portion of the answer.</P>
    <P>Certainly I do not think it is good psychology to represent a previous error as something that will be withdrawn in return for guarantees of good behaviour in the future.  Let it be said that the record of the trade unions is a long and pretty honourable record of fighting for people on behalf of whom no other group was prepared to fight.  All of us today are prepared to concede the fact that a certain amount of justice should be given to the majority of the population but times were not always so.  There is tonight lying at rest in the church the body of a trade unionist, a former Deputy, who lived in times when that was not generally conceded by the majority of the community.  Indeed, up and down the country, despite what the Minister says in regard to changed times and different employer attitudes, there are many people who know that the reality of industrial life today is still one of bitter struggle.  If the President of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Mr. Jimmy Dunne, has said that the trade union movement has, in the conduct of the present <Col N="1351" /> dispute, earned a certain amount of public criticism, he, as President, has also referred to the areas of weakness and to the fact that they must order better their affairs, and to the situation in which a large number of people can seemingly take the brunt, or an inordinate share, in the struggle for a certain category in the trade unions, and that the trade union movement must themselves look for more intelligent use of the picket.  These are the words of the President of Congress himself and we all heartily agree with him.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to take the course of the present dispute and to say: &ldquo;There.  The events of the last few weeks show that this movement is incapable of throwing up the solutions to the organisational problems involved in relation to employees and employers. Look at the situation in the last few weeks.&rdquo;  The trade union movement can point to a very long record of a solitary fight for all its members and out of the present crisis will emerge strength, but it would be wrong to build on the present dispute and to say that because of the mistakes which have been made in the last few weeks they are interminably barred and incapable of bringing forward their own solutions.</P>
    <P>There are very few people who have views on this subject which one can term accurately as impartial.  There are very few impartial observers of the industrial scene in this country.  We all come from one background or another and we all have one political view or another of any economy.  Most observers of the Irish economy have views one way or the other.  That being the case, it is pretty important that when we talk of this area we strive to get the facts.</P>
    <P>One viewpoint that has been canvassed abroad over the last few weeks &mdash;during this debate we will hear it again&mdash;is that somehow there is not an economic cause to the present dispute. There would not be one picket outside the door of one employer in any part of this country at the present moment were it not for the fact that there is a <Col N="1352" /> disagreement about the wages which certain people feel they are entitled to but some people have put abroad the idea that there would be no dispute, practically, at present could the unions settle their own row.  The idea has been put abroad that the employers have nothing to do with the present dispute, that it is purely a row between a group of disgruntled nameless trade union officials, which nobody really can understand and that it has nothing to do with the wages which these men are struggling to bring home to their wives and families.  It would be a great tragedy if this House further disgraced itself&mdash;and this House has disgraced itself&mdash;in its discussions on matters relating to industrial relations because too few Deputies coming into the House bother to divest themselves of the prejudices they had before coming in here and discussing this subject.  We had it all throughout the ESB (Special Provisions) Bill and I have no doubt we will have our quota of that type of Deputy from all sides of the House during the present debate.</P>
    <P>It would be just as well to bear in mind the essential background material of this whole dispute or any other dispute that may occur in this year of grace, to realise and to ponder that 38 per cent of all industrial workers in this country have a wage of less than £11 per week.  Let that resound out from this House, that there are certain frictions in Irish industrial life.  Let us understand what part of that friction or disagreement is represented by that figure of 38 per cent of all industrial workers with a wage of less than £11 a week.  The most marvellous organised industrial relations system that the mind of man can devise, which may never yet have been seen in any country on the face of the earth, if brought into legislation by this Government of reality in this year of 1969, could do nothing to banish industrial discord while 38 per cent of all industrial workers have a wage of less than £11 a week and 52 per cent of all industrial workers earn less than £13 per week which, as we all know, with the present cost of living, is certainly no marvellous wage to be bringing home and which also must have an embittering <Col N="1353" /> effect on those in receipt of that magnificent weekly wage.</P>
    <P>While we are on it, let us remember that 75 per cent of the people whom James Connolly called the slaves of slaves, namely, Irishwomen who are at work, earn less than £9 a week. This is the reality as distinct from some of the speeches or some of the comments one hears from so-called experts on the Irish industrial scene.</P>
    <P>It is our job, as we conceive it in this debate, to represent the reality of the Irish industrial set-up in order to ensure that any legislation coming from this House has the impact of some connection with reality in its passage from this House to the people.</P>
    <P>A group have done a survey recently &mdash;I think the survey should be considered in other areas&mdash;on poverty in Britain.  Any man earning less than £11 a week in Ireland is not very much above the poverty line.  The figures show that 38 per cent of our fellow citizens who are at work are earning less than £11 a week.  I do not think these people are very much above the poverty line as costs are at present.  I do not have the figures of how many thousands of our citizens are earning less than £10 a week but there is no doubt that the man with less than £10 a week is, by any 1969 definition of poverty, most certainly on the poverty line.</P>
    <P>I have always held the view that the prime function of a Government is to see that the economy can so expand and gear itself and is so organised that wage rates are at a tolerable level, that we can say that the majority of our people have incomes above a certain figure.  I believe that that is the first job to be tackled in this matter of industrial relations.  I have always felt that we put the cart before the horse and that we have concerned ourselves with getting rules to keep one half of the industrial relations system in its place without really going after the major job of so altering the economy that a portion of the bitterness which undoubtedly exists in the Irish industrial scene would be removed by seeing that wages gave a modicum of comfort to all citizens.  We have brought out laws&mdash;they are suggested in both these <Col N="1354" /> Bills&mdash;for the regulation of trade unions.  We have not brought out laws for any regulation of employers.  Nobody says how the members of the FUE are to vote, whether it will be by show of hands, whether they must all be in benefit and so on.  Nobody asks any of these questions.  Possibly they are in benefit.  Certainly, they are not in Stubbs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly some were but there are ways out of that also.  We have such a biassed approach in this whole matter of industrial relations that it is possibly a good idea, before one makes any pronouncement on it, that one should examine one's conscience rigorously, especially if one is a member of the Government Party or the Opposition Party, because one would have much prejudice of which to divest oneself before delivering a speech in this rather difficult area.</P>
      <P>I recall two or three years ago in the days when Deputy Lemass was Taoiseach we were discussing the possibility that the answer to our industrial relations problems lay in the magic field of incomes.  Those were the words in those days.  We had several White Papers on this subject and several people delivered themselves of pieces of advice about how we would get to the happy land where incomes would be divided equitably between different sections of the community. Whenever we came in here to discuss incomes it turned out very quickly that every manjack of the Government Party who got up to talk on this problem talked only about the wages. He spoke only about the wages of the trade unionists.  That was their conception on incomes; when anybody in this Party was so näive as to talk about, possibly, profit or rent, dividends or things like that, they were told not to be naïve; to sit down; that this had nothing to do with incomes policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Likewise, when it comes to tidying up an area of industrial relations the only people who must be tidied up, according to the approach of many Deputies, are the trade unions, and if we can so tidy them up there will be no more trouble in the country.  That appears <Col N="1355" /> to me&mdash;I may be simplifying it&mdash;to represent much of the background thinking of many Government spokesmen on this subject.  Speak of incomes and they speak of wages.  Speak of industrial relations and their reordering and they talk about fixing up the trade unions.</P>
    <P>We are the very first to say that collective bargaining is not all it should be.  In fact, we look forward to the time when possibly we shall have a more efficient, more humane system. Of course, the Taoiseach regards it as an invasion of liberty to have a more humane system: he has nailed his colours to the mast on the present system.  But in the context of the present system, collective bargaining, unless somebody else can come up with a better substitute, is the only system that works.  To the majority of people working for a living, the idea of being a member of a union and that union negotiating on your behalf with your employer is about the only workable suggestion which we have. We agree that it is full of faults, as we can see in the present major dispute which is disrupting the economy at present.  We see that in the matter of negotiations one particular section may do better than another in this kind of bargaining.  In the context of an economy where so much economic power lies with a small group of people to so order economic justice as to give those who merely work for a living some justice, we do not have any better suggestion than that of unions negotiating with employers as at present.</P>
    <P>Added to the incomes bitterness are the low wages which a majority of Irish workers live on.  Of course, to read the newspapers one would find there are tales of dockers bringing home £50 a week.  There are millionaire pockets throughout the working population if you read some of our newspapers.  I know the minds of many people are haunted with the fear that people who work for a living may, in fact, be bringing home too much money.  I know there are Ministers who become Cassandras every weekend when they speak about the economy. The Minister's colleague, Deputy <Col N="1356" /> Childers, delivered himself of a speech on that theme last week.  Such people live in mortal fear that the majority of Irish workers may go somewhere above £13 a week because, if they did, this economy would grind to a halt, they say.</P>
    <P>Added to this incomes bitterness there is the insecurity which many work people feel throughout the country at present.  We have had cases&mdash; not simply in our imagination; they certainly occur&mdash;where people have been told on a Friday evening after 20 years in a job: &ldquo;There is no work for you on Monday morning&rdquo;.  That has been happening in the past year I do not see much difference between that approach in 1969 and the approach, now termed old fashioned, on the part of certain employers in the past.</P>
    <P>The man who died yesterday, the late Jim Larkin, had a saying that there was no such thing as a good employer.  He said that there were some employers better than others but that there was no such thing as a good employer.  I do not know that I would go totally along with that.  I have known some people whom I would regard as good employers but when you see people being laid off, given their cards on Friday afternoon after 20 years work it makes you wonder whether, in fact, the employers in this country have changed as fundamentally as some people would like to suggest. Do the State boards themselves set a very good example or do I recall some rather unhappy scenes in the B &amp; I's tidying up and rationalisation operations in the last year?  The Minister for Transport and Power said that they had not put out enough public relations material before they closed down.  I suppose that is one way of looking at it: your problems may disappear if you get a good public relations officer to put a proper colouring on them. Certainly, the reality for those who had worked in the B &amp; I for years was that they were told they had another two months to go before the operation wound up.  Potez, also, was closed pretty suddenly.  All of these events from the blue&mdash;thunderbolts one might say, for those working in these industries and firms&mdash;must have a pretty <Col N="1357" /> depressing effect when read in the newspapers by people who are, perhaps, in newly-established industries wondering: &ldquo;Has this place as much security as we are told it has?  Has it much of a future?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It must certainly incline many people to say that the only reality for us, if the security is in doubt, is to plough ahead on the wages front, not that they have been very successful as one can see from the figures for the number of people under £11 or £13 a week.  I certainly suggest that all who contribute to this debate should realise that they cannot discuss these items before us in isolation from the main background of the relations in general between employers and employees and that we all have a duty to consider what are the economic living conditions of those for whom we are legislating in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his opening statement, said that people go on strike on a show of hands.  I think this is very much exaggerated, exaggerated so much in my opinion, that it does not have much basis in reality.  The compulsory business of having a ballot is mentioned in the Trade Union Bill and the Minister referred in his opening speech to his surprise at seeing important decisions taken by a show of hands.  I think the majority of Irish trade unions provide for balloting by their members.  The position in Britain was certainly a bit different and it is interesting to note that the Donovan Commission there dismissed the idea of incorporating into law compulsory balloting in the course of industrial disputes. At page 114 of the report the following appears:</P>
    <P>A number of witnesses have suggested to us that a secret ballot should be required before a strike can lawfully take place.  This proposal is based on the belief that workers are likely to be less militant than their leaders and that, given the opportunity of such a ballot, they would often be likely to vote against strike action...</P>
    <P>It is clear that the scope of any legislation to this end, if it were to be effective, would have to be confined to major official strikes...</P>
    <P>There is little justification in the <Col N="1358" /> available evidence for the view that workers are less likely to vote for strike action than their leaders; and findings from our workshops relations survey already cited confirmed this.  Experience in the USA has been that strike ballots are overwhelmingly likely to go in favour of strike action.  This is also the experience of Canada, where strike ballots are compulsory, of Alberta and British Columbia.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to say that there are other objections to such ballots and they ask the question:</P>
    <P>Moreover, how is the question on which the vote is to be taken to be framed?</P>
    <P>They discussed incorporating into law the taking of a ballot before strike action is taken and they turned the idea down.  A great number of British trade unions do not include this clause in regard to strike action.  The situation would certainly be different here.  The Minister talks about a ballot before the strike to decide what action should be taken; he does not talk about taking a ballot to decide to end a strike.  The Minister gives discretion to the union executive to decide whether or not they will declare a strike.  It is interesting to note that some are of the opinion that strikes take place for trivial reasons. That is another fallacy.  There appears to be a feeling that, if workers are compelled to ballot before strike action is taken, the result will somehow be fewer strikes.  The Donovan Commission Report and the experience in other countries does not bear out that contention.  In fact, any such approach might lengthen a dispute because it might limit to some extent the initiative of the union executive in seeking a settlement.</P>
    <P>Before the Donovan Commission reported they released a great deal of pretty important documentation which was later embodied in the report.  The Minister says he will bring out a White Paper.  As I say, the Donovan Commission produced a great many documents on various aspects of industrial relations before ever reporting and an attempt was made to inform public opinion of the issues involved.  Nothing like that has been attempted here and <Col N="1359" /> it is regrettable that we should have to deal with this measure without informing public opinion before the Bill is introduced here.</P>
    <P>The Donovan Commission discussed contracts between employers and employees and whether or not such contracts should be made legally binding.  They turned down that idea altogether.  Again, their anxiety was to prevent the introduction of too much law into this particular area of agreement between employers and employees.</P>
    <P>There is a section in the Trade Union Bill in which the Minister talks about financial help to unions intent on amalgamating.  I suppose to some extent this has some far off relationship to the help the Government give many employers in the rationalisation of business and so on.</P>
    <P>The experience in this country has been that the main difficulty, the main expense, involved in amalgamating unions occurs on the way to the amalgamation.  In fact, we have had the unhappy experience of seeing a court decision being brought against two unions which attempted to amalgamate last year and the good work gone for nothing.  The Minister appears to tie his granting of money to the situation after the unions had amalgamated. If we want to help the unions to amalgamate it is not after the deed is done that we should be concerned about giving them money, but on their way to that position.  In other words, if we want to help in the matter of the amalgamation of unions, we would want to give them some money or some specialised help in the course of the amalgamation talks.  That is something the Minister might bear in mind.</P>
    <P>By the way, there are some good things in the Minister's speech.  There are many points with which I would agree, but he talked about 80 per cent of our wage disputes being concerned with incomes.  That would bear out what I was talking about earlier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that if 80 per cent of man days lost are gone on incomes that bears out some of our statements on the importance of the income factor in our industrial relations.</P>
      <P>Section 14 refers to the necessity of having a ballot.  It is extremely vague. One of the obligations on us, coming into this area of the relationship between employers and employees, is that if we are intruding into this area with legal clauses, we must ensure that those clauses do not themselves constitute a hindrance in the years ahead in that area.  If we go in there with legal clauses, if they are not properly worded to ensure that they do not become a hindrance, we may end up by penalising people who are honestly involved in an attempt to solve the problem between employers and employees.</P>
      <P>Section 14(a) provides:</P>
      <P>the rules of a trade union shall be deemed to require that, before the service of a strike notice, a majority of the members of the trade union entitled to vote and voting in a secret ballot conducted by the trade union shall approve of such service;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is very loosely put: &ldquo;...a majority of the trade union entitled to vote...&rdquo; Is it the people working in a factory, or is it the whole membership of the union or are we to find that if one person present disagreed with a holding of a ballot he can go to court and upset the whole situation?  We could find that because of legislation passed by this House such a person might, in fact, become more than an individual nuisance as at present, but a pretty large menace faced by the unions in the courts.  That has been part of the defence of those who have not welcomed the intrusion of the law into this area&mdash;law as we know it in the civil courts.  They recognise that, in this area of negotiation in which there would be so many circumstances changing from hour to hour and day to day, the more the initiative is left to those in the actual dispute, the <Col N="1361" /> better it will be in the long run for the community.</P>
    <P>The Minister has previously said that all the State can do to improve this area of industrial relations&mdash;apart from the overall job of ensuring that incomes are of a certain size&mdash;is to ensure that the organisational set-up for the settlement of disputes is the best we can obtain.  Nearly 40 per cent of our workers have less than £11 a week.  Disputes are unavoidable where people are living below the poverty line and there are many people with under £10 a week.  We have a duty to see that our institutional set-up is such that it give us the best guarantee that where disputes can be avoided they are, in fact, avoided by the machinery we set up.  Undoubtedly as was discovered in Britain, as Mrs. Barbara Castle's strife paper suggests, there are some disputes which can be avoided.</P>
    <P>We all endorse the proposals in relation to the change in the set-up of the Labour Court.  They appear to go along with the principle that the court should be strengthened.  The Minister had discussions with the trade unionists in this area.  The Minister learned a lesson after his first essay in this matter.  In certain areas the Minister has had the capacity to learn from his mistakes, and there is certainly a change in his attitude to the Labour Court from his attitude in 1966.  In 1966, he had the ingenious idea that all those who go to the Labour Court must prior to that agree that recommendations coming from the Labour Court are binding on those who went to the court in the first place.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentions this in his opening speech.  The trade unions had a very short term for this Labour Court.  They said it was an arbitration board and no longer a free institution. It was no longer a place to which one could go in furtherance of a dispute, have one's case heard and hope for a recommendation.  Their point really was that it was totally inaccessible. It is very interesting to note that the conception of the Labour Court as a body which handed down recommendations which must be accepted by the institutions that are driven to the <Col N="1362" /> court was accepted in toto by the FUE. It throws a rather interesting light on the organised employers of this country. It affords an interesting insight into their capacity for judging what would be improvements in the industrial relations system.</P>
    <P>The Minister at that time agreed with the FUE.  It was only the trade unions who said they would not accept this. The Trade Union Bill is brought back here today three years after and it is certainly an improvement.  I am sure the Minister would agree that he owes a lot to the criticism of the trade unions three years ago.  We are as pleased as anyone to see an institution such as the Labour Court such an apparent success.  The Labour Court has been one of the great successes in this country in an area in which there have been so many Wizards of Oz, easy formulae and global solutions to the whole problem.  They have struggled on from month to month and case to case and have struck a very high record of settlement and success especially at the conciliation level of the court hearings.</P>
    <P>I was glad the Minister followed the advice of the trade unions in relation to the position and status of the conciliation personnel by calling them industrial relations officers.  The court have also been given increased powers of initiative.  It was a ridiculous situation previously because the court were hogtied by the legislation of 1946 in their powers of invention.  We have now given the court a certain life of their own and also given them a chance to hear cases more speedily.  It was a pretty difficult job for the branch committee of a union in any part of the country to suggest going to the Labour Court when a case had gone up against a stone wall and then on contacting them one heard that the court might not be in a position to deal with one's case for quite some months.  It was very difficult to hold to the red line and say that one should go in a positive way in the implementation of one's demands when people said they wanted to get a more rapid solution.</P>
    <P>Now, with the divisions of the court, it should be possible for the court to be more easily available to <Col N="1363" /> a greater number of people.  There was a tendency also that the court could apparently more rapidly hear the case of important sections of working people and that the case of those unfortunate enough to be in an outlying factory, in a service industry or in some jobs which did not too greatly impinge on the public's convenience, was, in fact, very much given the go by by the Labour Court because of the pressures they were under at that time.  It should now be possible for them to live more up to the original conception, instead of playing the role of a fireman who is confronted with a crisis and that there is a necessity to issue a recommendation.  There should be no necessity to issue one.</P>
    <P>That might seem strange particularly when we ask ourselves what is the use of having a Labour Court if you do not make a recommendation.  I do not want to chalk up this as a mark against them but certain recommendations were made by them and in the past it would have been better for them if they had not made them.  If the court legally had been given an opportunity to preserve a Solomonlike silence it would have been better for all our institutions.  Unfortunately, up to now they were always faced with the necessity of putting a recommendation into print and some of the cases before the court were such that, due to the prevailing circumstances of the time, the court could not have rescued themselves from severe criticism in their recommendation.</P>
    <P>We have asked that conciliation officers be updated and their grading made more permanent.  There was a ridiculous situation in which one could meet that rare civil servant, the conciliation officer, who was born of that institution and just as he got to know his job he was taken away and the whole position of conciliation officers was made extremely difficult.  It is very difficult to know how one could train a person for this job.  When the present dispute, which has held up the country, is settled, I think Dermot McDermott should, in fact, receive very honourable mention because the country owes a very great deal to him.  He <Col N="1364" /> is in my opinion, speaking from my experience of conciliation meetings and talking to other people since, one of the best conciliation officers this court has ever had.  He is what I would call a creative conciliation officer.  There are some people who bring dead claims from one room to another but he is a man who has a creative function and is, I think, a person to whom this country is very greatly indebted for his work in this dispute.  I know that his work did not stop when the parties went home.  He has continued right on into the small hours.  We should see that the status of people such as Dermot McDermott is protected.</P>
    <P>I do not believe, of this Trade Union Bill, that people have said: &ldquo;This is the kind of thing we need&rdquo;.  I think it would be misunderstanding the nature of the subject&mdash;relations between employers and employees&mdash;to think that things will be different after the passing of this Bill.  It strives to tidy up certain things&mdash;not very successfully because put too vaguely.  The Trade Union Bill in its present form contributes to a worsening in the situation. Let me read, for example, section 9:</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Act of 1906 (which relates to peaceful picketing is hereby amended by the substitution of the following for subsections (1) and (2):</P>
    <P>(1) It shall be lawful for one or more persons (other than those referred to in subsection (2) of this section), acting on their own behalf or on behalf of a trade union or of an individual employer or firm in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute, to attend at or near a place where a person works, carries on business or (while he is so working or carrying on business) happens to be, if they so attend merely for the purpose of peacefully obtaining or communicating information or of peacefully persuading any person to work or abstain from work.</P>
    <P>(2)  It shall be lawful for one or more persons, who are acting on behalf of a trade union which is a member of an authorised group (within the meaning of the <Col N="1365" /> Trade Union Act, 1969) and who are so acting in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute in an employment catered for by that group, to attend at or near a place where a person works, carries on business or (while he is so working or carrying on business) happens to be, if they so attend merely for the purpose of peacefully obtaining or communicating information or of peacefully persuading any person to work or abstain from working and if their attendance has been authorised by that group in accordance with the constitution or rules thereof.</P>
    <P>Could one sustain the idea here, in relation to a union which did not subscribe to the rules of a particular group, that, in fact, the 1906 protection would still apply to their pickets?  Could one take that interpretation from it?</P>
    <P>It shall be lawful for one or more persons (other than those referred to in subsection (2) of this section)...</P>
    <P>I should like a little clarification of this when the Minister comes to talk on the matter.  To our reading, it appears a bit ambiguous.</P>
    <P>It is true, of course, that trade unions themselves must look very closely at the matter of co-operation between different unions.  Our whole point in at least being sceptical about the fruitful results of legal intervention in this area&mdash;our whole objection&mdash; is on the basis that we do not see it as necessarily being helpful in the economic conflict, in the interests conflict which goes on in any democratic society of our type between those who work for a living and the employers. we do not believe that that conflict between them must flare up, that they must be in a permanent state of war, but we do accept that a certain conflict is inevitable between these interests groups.  If we come, with the law, into those areas and legislate for one side in this conflict&mdash;settle the house of the trade unions for them; make sure they must conform to certain procedures&mdash; even if we do not tie up the employers in this kind of procedure, we do not ask whether the employer has a secret ballot, shows his hand or what he does.  If we do come with legal intervention, <Col N="1366" /> then our draftsmen have hte obligation and we, as legislators, have the obligation to see that that legislation will not be a source of worsening and intensifying the conflict.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that he has had a great deal of discussion with the trade unions.  Is the Minister quite happy that he has had the final consideration of the trade unions on the present Bill?  Are we to take it that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions saw this Bill in its present form? Possibly the Minister will be able to let us know that and will be able to tell us what their comments were.  As he says, there is no use in rushing into an area unless one has the co-operation, after full consultation, of the parties involved.  I presume this Bill has been examined by both sides in Irish industry&mdash;by both employers and unions.  Presumably the Minister is armed with the comments on both sides in industry on the contents of this Bill and will be able to answer any of the queries we have to put on this Bill because our queries will be based on its possible acceptance or otherwise by both sides in Irish industry.  There would not be much point in coming in here and producing legislation on sections of which one or other group in Irish industry has reservations.  It would be irresponsible and certainly it would not be helpful.  Therefore, when we question different elements in the Bill, the Minister will probably be able to say that that was roughly acceptable to both sides in industry. That would be part of the essential requirement in this particular exercise because the Bill suggests notable changes in the law and such full consultation would need to have taken place before we would come with such a Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he has been discussing the Bill with the unions so possibly we may presume that this Bill has been fully examined by both sides in Irish industry.  I do not go with the idea that the multiplicity of unions is another reason why we have so many strikes.  This is one of the oldest ones in the cupboard.  It seems a sort of attractive idea and does not need too much thought but it is superficial thinking.  It seems attractive on <Col N="1367" /> the surface but, like a lot of superficial thinking, when you look at it a bit more, it really does not sustain that great weight that apparently is given to it by certain people.  I certainly think we could tidy up our trade union structure.</P>
    <P>We must go ahead with the task of bringing about a larger general union, giving unity at the centre of the Irish trade union movement.  I do not believe it is possible to talk about&mdash;as the phrase has it&mdash;rationalisation unless we get a number of general unions in this country together and working together to the benefit of their own members and of the service they operate for their members.  To those who say that it is a problem of British versus Irish unions I would say that there are Irish unions with their head offices here in Dublin all situated within a few square miles which should be together.</P>
    <P>To be fair to the people involved, they have been engaged in discussion of their own initiative for quite some time and they have not needed any legislation to push them on to such a course.  That kind of discussion and negotiation between responsible unions is the most heartening thing we can look for.  Let us get rid of the idea that somehow on the union side of the table we have a body of people who are totally oblivious to the interests of their own country.  This is not the case.  They have been working at bringing about unity within the trade union movement in this particular area.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of commentators, ignoring the actual take-home wage of some of the Irish workers, would have us believe that it is the psychology of people who work for a living in this country to go on strike at the drop of a hat.  Yet, as I have had occasion to remark here before, the work people of any other country have not been fed as many solutions and promises as the work people here.  The devil and all was promised on incomes and for a period, between the 12 per cent and the next round, we were going to settle this matter for all time. Nothing was done about it.  It is possible that it will never be brought up again.  However, ordinary trade <Col N="1368" /> unions up and down the country, on their own initiative and working with employers themselves, brought in what they called productivity agreements.  I have remarked before that in my opinion these people are really the unsung heroes in the Irish economy, the people who responsibly drew up productivity agreements without any encouragement from the central authorities and despite the fact that a rising cost of living was bound to imperil the stability of such agreements.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if the unions are in need of change we do not need anybody on the legislative side to think that it is their task, because trade unions have realised for quite some time that they needed more of a group concept, that they needed greater unity.  Possibly they may be faulted by saying that the progress has been pretty slow.  It is part of human nature that people like their own organisations and are not necessarily attracted by being told they may have a better service by going into a larger organisation.  People may have a great affection for and may not be too interested in leaving the shelter of the organisations they belonged to in the past.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is anxious to improve the climate for the amalgamation of unions he should seriously give thought to the idea of specialised services, legal services.  The legal costs in amalgamation are heavy ones.  If, for example, we got two or three unions in a particular industry who were interested in amalgamation and who were dealing with roughly similar groups of workers, it would be necessary to ensure that they were given some financial help.  If they signed a declaration of intent and gave a certain minimum period within which they expected the amalgamation to be completed and if the financial aid they were given was contingent on that work being carried out, it would be a better and a more helpful way of meeting this situation than the manner in which it is put in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that this Bill will dramatically alter things for the better in the Irish industrial system.  I believe we would be doing a disservice to everyone concerned if we attempted to suggest that it will bring about a <Col N="1369" /> transformation in the Irish industrial set-up.  It is our view that the ineradicable cause, the underlying basis of contention, the underlying conflict in Irish industry has to do with the matter of wages, even though there are, as the Minister has said, certain rights&mdash; as he calls them&mdash;which are disputation, disagreement and interpretation. More needs to be done about obviating that kind of dispute, but the underlying conflict in Irish industry is concerned solely with this economic conflict between the price a man places upon his labour and that which he is given by his employer.  That is the underlying conflict.  The State's contribution to the resolution of that conflict, or at least to the lessening of the bitterness of that conflict, must be in the general improvement of the economy.</P>
    <P>At present discontent is undoubtedly sweeping the country.  One may understand that the basis of that discontent may be misunderstood by certain Ministers who may think that if they give week-end economics lectures to chambers of commerce or to meetings of bankers' institutes or insurance brokers, these lectures will be taken to heart by the wage-earners.  But one must see the problem from the workers' point of view.  They see a lot of people who apparently, whilst they are being continually lectured to and told that they cannot get this next increase, that the economy cannot bear it, yet day in day out, on television, in newspapers, in the social columns, they see another set in the very same country&mdash;flower people practically, certainly flower people as far as their incomes go&mdash; who apparently are subject to no restraint. Nobody lectures them.  In fact, if you talk about their sources of income a Minister gets up and says: &ldquo;Remember, we are an island in the Atlantic.  We cannot step outside a certain North European concept.&rdquo; That was the pronouncement of the Minister for Transport and Power on the matter, that such people must continue to go their happy way because they are essential to the buoyancy of our economy.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered what kind of people these Ministers think they are talking to when they get up and give <Col N="1370" /> these lectures about the kind of economy we have and the kind of restraint that will be necessary.  It is more than flesh and blood can tolerate especially in a modern society where the sight and sound of riches is no longer something that can be seen only in the Kildare Street Club or somewhere else like that but is something that is observable in newspaper photographs, on television and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The flaunting of such wealth must exasperate the feelings of people who are being continuously lectured to about the necessity for the tightening of their belts and so on.  We have, therefore, the over-all duty of looking at the problem in depth.  In fact, what the Bill invites us to do is to look at Irish society as it is.  The Minister, to give him his due, would have us look &mdash;in certain parts of his speech&mdash;at Irish society.  That is what we should do in the course of this debate and not merely think that this Bill provides an opportunity for looking into the imagined faults of trade unions.  It should not be regarded as a golden opportunity to comment from the privileged position of Parliament on the misdoings of people in the trade union movement.  Rather, it should provide an opportunity of looking at the whole situation in this month of February, 1969, to see how the vast majority of the Irish people stand in their places of work and as regards their income. When we did this some weeks ago, rockets went up all over the place.  It was said that our <i>Workers' Democracy</i> was a radical document.  The Taoiseach immediately saw freedom banished from the land.  The Minister for Transport and Power last Sunday night, placed the country in mid-Atlantic, but it is not known which gentlemen turned up to hear these lectures.  At any rate, it was pretty tough going, from what I have seen of the script.</P>

We are told <Col N="1371" /> that we are all on the Left, that we have a &ldquo;Just Society&rdquo; and &ldquo;Reality&rdquo; and that nobody is denied a fair crack of the whip.  However, when we brought out our policy document, something happened to our stomachs because they saw tyranny and dictatorship.  The sole concern of that document was for the dignity of people at work in Irish industry.  It was inspired by a desire to grant to such people the maximum freedom possible in the circumstances of Irish industry.  Yet, that document was pilloried up and down the country as the first instalment of some kind of dictatorship.</P>

      <P>The last time I saw the Deputy's name associated with a trade union was during the referendum debate.  I recall that he set out then, with a number of others, to wreck the trade union movement and attempt to grossly interfere with the democratic rights of trade unions.  However, I was on a more serious subject than that.  Our policy document examined the sources of tension in Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1372" /> Page 35, paragraph 32.3 of the Labour Party Outline Policy reads:</P>
    <P>Sociological studies suggest that many wage claims are motivated by rebellion against working conditions and against the frustration of being dehumanised as much as by a revolt against the economic burden of exploitation.</P>
    <P>Our whole examination, so to speak, about the specific organisation of Labour tends to dissociate the moment of decision from the moment of execution. We say:</P>
    <P>There is a contradiction between the potentially creative core of our work and the status to which the employee is reduced.  Responsible for his work, he is not the master of his working conditions nor indeed in many cases has he any influence over them.  It has been said that wage claims express a demand for as much money as possible to pay for the life wasted, the time lost, the freedom alienated in working under these conditions.  The worker insists on being paid as much as possible not because he puts wages above everything else but because, at present, the worker can fight the employer only for the price of his labour, not for the control of his conditions or for the management of his own work.  Whatever price the employee manages to extract from his employer in exchange for this freedom, the price cannot compensate him for the human depravation he suffers.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of document that brought forth such a reaction in this year of grace in which, we are told, so many things have changed for the better in this country.  We are being told continually that there is no more need for trade unions as we know them.  We are told they have too much power. Yet, the whole power of the trade union movement leaves us with a situation where 38 per cent of our industrial workers earn less than £11 per week.  Does that figure not seem to indicate just what is the power of the Irish trade union movement?  Does that not indicate who has the power and the glory in this country at present?</P>
    <P>The work situation needs far deeper <Col N="1373" /> analysis than underlies the suggestions incorporated in this Bill.  The first essential step is to improve the take-home pay of the majority of Irish workers.  The idea that 75 per cent of women workers should be earning less than £9 a week in 1969 leads one to ask: What the hell are they living on? Accepting that as the first objective, then there is the second objective: if we wish to remove the deep discontent in Irish industry, then we must begin creating a partnership in Irish industry. We must have a team spirit.  If we are to have a team spirit in Irish industry, if we are to win new exports, we must, at the place of work, create a real community, a community without conflict. That is outlined in our policy document and we would humbly invite the members of any other Party in the House to engage in a similar exercise and see what conclusions they reach on the work situation.  I might add, on this business of dictatorship, on the question of robbing the Irish people of their rights, that the inspiration of the whole document is to give the power and freedom of decision-making back to the majority of the people in Irish industry, in the hope that it would have the enthusiastic co-operation and consent of the majority of intelligent managements.</P>

      <P>We invite the other Parties to give us their ideas as to how industrial democracy could be achieved. I repeat that there is no conflict between management in industry and greater participation being given to the majority of people working in industry.  The science of management can easily be incorporated and, in our opinion, must be incorporated, in a system of industrial democracy.  We see it as an extension of political democracy as exercised in this House. It is ridiculous that in Irish industry decision-making is in the same situation in 1969 as it was in 1910.  It is a saddening <Col N="1374" /> thing that Government Ministers should have greeted the publication of our policy document as they did.  The most ridiculous accusation made against it was that it meant a curtailment of freedom, and when, in fact, the only valid criticism one could make of it is that it gave too much freedom to many people in industry.  Let us be called naive, but let it be because of our attachment to the idea of an extension of freedom and participation.  This communist-under-the-bed accusation which Fianna Fáil, when in danger, have raised to such good effect in other years, is not just good enough in 1969.</P>
      <P>There is a new thing, however, from the Fine Gael Party.  We had Deputy Cosgrave on Sunday talking about revolution.  I do not know what is Deputy Cosgrave's definition of &ldquo;revolution&rdquo;.  The only revolution the Labour Party are suggesting is a revolution at the ballot box.  The only revolution at the ballot box we want is the return of the Labour Party to Government.  If that is revolution, fair enough.  But do not let us get involved in a smear campaign, because there is no hope ever for industrial democracy or political democracy if we must smear our political opponents. I do not see any relevance in this Parliament if there is no place in it for a socialist party; we can pack up and go home, because Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, what have they left to talk about?  They have nothing to discuss. That is our claim for our future in this House, to be returned to those benches over there.  That is what we are aiming at.</P>
      <P>If there are to be attacks on the idea of a workers' democracy let us have our disagreements on what we have actually said.  Let us have our disagreements in accordance with the kind of political philosophy we have. Do not let us have what Deputy Corish called recently the politics of intimidation, the politics of smear, the politics of fear in which it is suggested there is something subversive or dangerous in what the Labour Party are proposing. Our proposals are there in black and white for everyone to examine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot see that this Trade Union <Col N="1375" /> Bill will alter for the better the existing situation in industry.  There are several deficiencies in the drafting of the Bill. The Minister nowhere in his opening speech permits himself a statement on what I believe this debate should lead to, a general discussion on Irish society, <Col N="1376" /> a general discussion on our proposals and solutions for the conflicts which are part of Irish society today.</P>
