      <P>When I moved the Adjournment of the debate last night, I was discussing the proposal and the suggestion surrounding the proposal that an incomes and prices board or an incomes policy as it is called would solve all our problems. I was doing it in the context of the priority which is put, in this country, on settling a dispute at any cost, not alone at any cost to the employer who can, perhaps, well afford it, but at any cost to the economy.  I was trying to make the House complete its thinking on this question of an incomes board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was introducing these measures I did say that I do not reject the idea of setting up a body which <Col N="2358" /> would examine the potential of the economy at any particular time, examine claims for increased salaries, wages, dividends, profits, professional fees and so on and hand down recommendations.  However, I do not think the House has finished its thinking if it accepts the Fine Gael idea of an incomes policy as preventing strikes for evermore.</P>
    <P>If the members of any section of the community are not satisfied with the decision given by a prices and incomes board, they will still be entitled to go on strike and if the priority for the community is the settlement of strikes at all costs, continuation of the strike would bring pressures on whoever is in charge, whoever is in government, to overthrow, to push aside the recommendations of a prices and incomes body and concede or else to try to uphold the prices and incomes recommendations and put up with the strike. It may be a good idea to have guidelines given by some independent body other than the politicians, the Government, or the Labour Court&mdash;what we have at the moment&mdash;but what I want to point out is that guidelines will not necessarily be acceptable and are unlikely to be accepted in view of our experience up to date on the question of salaries and wages.</P>
    <P>If Fine Gael continue the thinking on this question and if they can promise that we will have industrial peace with this new policy, they will have to have stronger measures than merely a body making recommendations and if they do their thinking to the full they will have to see that these measures will have to have legal sanctions and penalties, and if they are not prepared to have penalties they will have to think what they will do when such people have to be dealt with, whether they are going to have the extremes of the law operating to solve our incomes policy or whether they will leave that to some other type of government.  The thinking of Fine Gael if carried to full length must bring it to the extremes of the law.  I think it was Deputy Dillon who said that Hitler had solved the problem in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that they should do the full degree of their thinking when they are offering a solution which can only be successful in a set of circumstances and in a situation where totalitarian power is in the hands of someone unscrupulous enough to use it to its full degree.  What do they want the Minister to do, bring in the troops? That is the answer and the only answer to a successful prices and incomes policy.  Short of being successful by these methods a prices and incomes policy cannot have any success in settling disputes as long as people are not satisfied with the incomes they are offered.</P>

      <P>I do not object to the setting-up of, and I think we should consider it seriously, a prices and incomes consultative board but that is not the answer and it cannot be offered by Fine Gael as the answer to our problems unless they are prepared to follow it to the extreme and I do not think that this would work in a democracy.  It may offer guidelines but it is not the solution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it even goes half-way.  We have had guidelines in the past from both the Government and the Labour Court and they were cast aside.  Deputy T.F. O'Higgins made a speech in which he described these legislative proposals of mine as a mouse.  This is the mouse with which <Col N="2360" /> Fine Gael were frightening the wits out of the workers at the time of the referendum.  For a Party that a short time ago was offering themselves unconditionally to the socialist Party, it seems to me that Deputy O'Higgins's speech was a big rebound from what they alleged they wanted at that time. By saying that this legislation was a mouse Deputy O'Higgins implied that they would do something stronger. When everybody wants a strong man Fine Gael is prepared to be strong and when everybody wants a weak man Fine Gael will be weak.</P>
      <P>During the referendum campaign I had to deny allegations by Deputy Corish that we were preparing repressive legislation.  I published at that time the conditions of the proposed legislation and to give Deputy Corish and the Labour Party their due we heard no more about it but on television on the night before the voting the Leader of Fine Gael was again calling it repressive legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I will get away from that now but I would like to answer some of the points raised during the debate.  A lot was said by Deputy Michael O'Leary about the lower paid workers and he gave the impression that all our troubles are due to the lower paid workers.  They are not. All our strikes are not due to the lower paid workers and most of the suffering put up with during strikes is in fact being endured by the lower paid workers and their families.  It is not right or fair to these people to lay the blame at their doors for every discomfort the community has to suffer when people decide to go on strike and have disputes about wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may go back to the question of this legislation not being a cure for all our ills, I should like to say <Col N="2361" /> that it is only the beginning of a movement which, if taken up by all the people concerned, could lead in the end to a solution.  I am disappointed that I cannot offer at this time to the House a line of legislation which I could say would work.  In the present circumstances I am convinced that any legislation any man could think of which would solve the problem would get through the House but the result would be quite ineffective in operation. When I say I am disappointed I mean that I am not disappointed in the type of legislation that could be brought in here and passed but I am disappointed in the type of legislation that could be brought in here, passed, and operated effectively, a type of legislation that would be operated by the people concerned.</P>
    <P>I hope that the suspicions which exist at present will be removed so that we will be able to introduce further legislation to lead towards sanity in the field of industrial relations in this country.  That will take time and the time for the introduction of legislation to solve all our industrial problems is not now.  There have been attempts to place the blame for our problems on many people but if we are placing blame, some of the fault lies with the trade unions.  The structure of the trade union movement in Ireland, if one can call it a structure, is such as to make it almost impossible to have orderly procedures.  In introducing trade union law I was faced with the problem of dealing with the troubles of the employers but the first step towards improving our procedures will have to be an effort to bring order into the area of trade unionism. The number of trade unions is far beyond what is necessary.  Our trade union structure makes it almost impossible for those in trade union official posts to have any authority or to deal in an orderly fashion with the employers or with the State.</P>
    <P>The Congress of Trade Unions say to me they do not want any law, and I should be delighted if we did not need any law, but I am quite satisfied that, because of the structure of Congress and because of the amount of authority they are given by their constituent <Col N="2362" /> unions, Congress is quite incapable of putting the trade union situation right.  We are now in a situation where their only capacity is to carry out a paper war on anybody who tries to make changes from outside.</P>
    <P>I have had consultations with the Congress of Trade Unions in a attempt to identify what is wrong in this field. Having identified what is wrong we set about trying to find ways of putting it right.  When the Congress of Trade Unions walked out at the end of the discussions&mdash;at least they decided that the discussions were at an end&mdash;they did not say what it was they disagreed with.  They tell me now to withdraw the Bill because they question the drafting.  As I said last night, I have invited them to come and meet my officials and point out where they think the drafting is wrong and we can change that; or if they have any ideas as to how they themselves would solve what they think is wrong, I shall accept those.  I cannot accept what Deputy Tully says: &ldquo;Stay out of this.  They will fix it themselves.&rdquo;  We have been hearing that for too long now.  We see the possibilities for our country, possibilities of new employment and better education, better care of the weaker sections, better wages and all the growth that is feasible, almost within our grasp.  If there is danger of these things disappearing or if we are to be frustrated in achieving them because the trade union movement is incapable of putting itself right, then we must take up this task ourselves in this House&mdash;we were elected to protect the community&mdash;and try to put things right. I have explained it cannot be put right by repressive legislation.  We cannot vote it right or wish it right, but at least we can force the Congress of Trade Unions and those in the trade union movement who feel a responsibility wider than their trade union or even a long-term responsibility for the members of their union, to sit down and say what their solution is.  If they have no solution or if they want to let the matter lie there, then we are entitled to expect them to co-operate with any legislation we pass here which cannot function without their co-operation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2363" /> There are also faults in management. The glamorous things in management are markets, machines, packaging, design, seminars and so on.  However, the rate of progress of this country will be determined by the capacity of management to handle their workers. I have found with the most intellegent of people, even people who have some experience in politics and are in business, that they do not want to be bothered with dealing with any section of the workers.  They would rather have these problems solved by a national agreement so that they will not have to sit down and discuss them with the workers.  This is wrong.  As long as employers or managements keep shifting this question of wages and conditions of employment on to the FUE or on to a national basis and asking why the Government do not fix it, the problem will remain unsolved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will you abolish the FUE then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like management to use all the resources that can be offered to them by any national organisation which they support, and my Department will go as far as they can to supply any services the trade unions and management want to help them to do their own job.  However, I will not take on my shoulders the anxieties, responsibilities that properly belong to management.  It is not that I do not want anxieties&mdash;I have plenty of them&mdash;but as long as they are carried by the State, as long as people can ask &ldquo;why does the Minister not come in and settle the strike?&rdquo; management will shirk their responsibility.</P>
      <P>I do not know how strongly you must speak to management, how strongly you have to cajole or coax them to get down to this one fundamental problem which is the most difficult problem they have; to get them to use their national organisation as a consultative body and to use all the resources available to them to find the solution in their own plant, in their own industry; to get down to the problem and get away from the idea that it can be solved by some outside body while they get on with more pleasant matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spent over two years as Minister for Labour and some time before that as Minister for Industry and Commerce, and in the course of the day's work, 15 or 16 hours, I have heard every sort of opinion, but I have more than once wondered whether by setting up the Labour Court, by setting up the Department of Labour and by setting up, perhaps, the organisation to which the Deputy is referring, we are not tempting these people to shift their responsibility away from themselves.  I am making a last appeal to them that if they want their negotiating machinery to work they will have to make it work.  The primary responsibility is with management, and I would remind those of them who think that if it does not work it will be made to work for them that the situation in which the workers will be organised for management will be a system of government where they will not have the other freedoms either. Some people think this section can be hived away from them to be controlled by law or by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the top man in the business should be the personnel manager?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I agreed with that last night.  As the Irish Management Institute Survey showed, Irish business firms have an amazing attitude to the personnel function.  Perhaps we have not a tradition; perhaps, as I said last night, we have to go over the cliff into total destruction before they find out we have to work at this problem to get it right.  I think that the shifting of this question to national organisations or on to the Government or the Labour Court has led to national confrontations we need not have had. I will not go further than that except to say that in the middle of this strike when people are saying rough things about trade unions and rough things about hidden, perhaps arrogant, perhaps unofficial, groups, there are bloody-minded people on the other side, too.  To Deputy O'Higgins, who implied, without saying it, that the time <Col N="2365" /> has come for strong action, let me say that what we are witnessing now in the strike that is going on at the moment is the effect of strong men taking strong lines and making negotiation unreal.</P>
      <P>Many of the notes I made as this debate went on would have been more appropriate to a calmer situation, not because of the agitation at the moment but because almost anything that can be said in this field can influence the length of the present strike.  I am convinced that if anybody thought that the Government were going to come into the present strike it would go on for a long time.  I have met some people who expect the Government to pass legislation to make the workers' side come to heel, as they say.  I have met people who seem to live in the hope that the Government would come in and force the employers' side to yield. Both sides will keep going if they think the Government will come in on their side.</P>
      <P>Apart from what was raised in the House there is an article this morning in the <i>Irish Times.</i> Some years ago I decided that so long as the Taoiseach left me in this post my period of office would be devoted to establishing procedures, if this is possible, and that the procedures we would establish would be negotiation&mdash;and I have made a plea for the full use of the management function at the beginning of negotiation at plant level; the making of agreements at plant or industry level, the provision of conciliation officers to those who find they need outside help and the establishment of the Labour Court to make recommendations.  If we can get these procedures functioning I would happily leave my post feeling that I had contributed but if my time is to be occupied by jumping into the arena in each dispute I would consider my time wasted.</P>
      <P>I strongly urge the House and the newspapers who have such an influence in this matter to set about establishing an atmosphere for procedures that will be accepted and not to try to create a situation where the unofficial or the most stubborn will bring everyone screaming to their knees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I respect this article in the <i>Irish <Col N="2366" /> Times</i>.  Two or three years ago, before I embarked on this policy which I have outlined, this article would have appeared earlier and in situations of much less disruption.  It is something to say that we have now had five weeks of a strike of a most disruptive nature when anxieties have been raised by the almost anarchical behaviour of some people and it is only now and in a mild way, that the request comes for intervention by the Minister.  The article refers to previous interventions by Ministers.  It refers to Deputy Lemass.  I do not remember Deputy Lemass intervening in any strike since the establishment of the Labour Court. I would point out to the writer of this article&mdash;he has given thought to what he is saying and he has not tried to score points&mdash;that in each of these interventions before&mdash;and the word intervention is a nice way of not committing yourself to what you want the Minister to do&mdash;when a Minister went into a strike to force a settlement, all the procedures had been used.  The Labour Court had made a recommendations and it had been rejected. In some cases its second recommendation had been rejected.  All the procedures the State had supplied had been used and the strike was going on.  Then the Minister came in. There were differences of opinion at that time as to whether the Minister should have done it or not.  I would have justified it on the basis that all the State procedures had been used and that if the Minister had not gone in to seek some solution somebody else would have had to do it.</P>
    <P>But in this present dispute the Labour Court has been ignored as if it did not exist.  I know the anxiety people have for a settlement and perhaps they believe I could bring about a settlement by going into the dispute now but by so doing I should be undermining the Labour Court which has not been used; I should be justifying the people who ignore the Labour Court and I should be justifying the people who rejected their own officials.</P>
    <P>Nobody feels the pressure stronger than I do, the pressure that a politician feels to appear to be doing something. There is nothing more glorious than <Col N="2367" /> action when you are in the public eye and nothing as destructive of a politician's position as to have to work quietly behind the scenes to try to establish order so that those who come after us will have some order in their industrial life.  The pressures on me are much stronger than on anybody else asking me to intervene but I believe that my policy is what should be carried out.  We should establish procedures and we should restructure our trade unions and make our managements take on the anxieties that are properly theirs.  And we should do that under the heaviest of pressure just as we would all be willing to do it when no pressure is being exerted.</P>
    <P>Hope is not lost in this dispute. There has been great disruption and loss to the country, but at this stage, with all the loss behind us, we gain nothing if we undermine the procedures that are established.  We should establish might instead of right; if we establish that, the stubborn will win, and reason cannot prevail.  If we establish that now, having lost so much, then nobody could justify our not having interfered with the whole procedure several weeks ago.</P>
    <P>In any course in politics you will have people who disagree with you. At this point when the pressures are enormous and the losses great, people are anxious and angry&mdash;and I have met angry people&mdash;it would be all too easy to forget that there are others coming after us, that there is next year and five years and ten years ahead. Some day, somehow, this country will have to set up procedures and we shall have to behave as sane human beings. We shall not do it by giving in under the pressure and talking sensibly when the pressure is off.  I suppose there are other places for a politician to justify himself.  It is not the place in which I have to justify myself because, except for a few feather touches of suggestion as to what they would do if they had my task, all the speakers obviously understand that there is something bigger at stake here than just the settlement of a strike.  Deputy Kyne has been for many years a trade unionist and he knows the effect of politicians intervening in matters like this; he said <Col N="2368" /> that this is no task for the Minister and he posed the question to those who suggested strong action: &ldquo;Do you want the troops in?&rdquo;  We do not.  If we fail to make free negotiation work we will have another system but, while it is free negotiation, let us give that free negotiation its full chance of proving whether or not it can be worked by the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The article in the <i>Irish Times</i> points out the need for a national scapegoat. So long as we are willing to have scapegoats we will, I suppose, continue to have insoluble problems.  I believe, however, that if people want to bring the force of public opinion to bear on this strike, and this is the only sanction available to us in our freedom, then they should not behave like hens pecking at those who are easy to peck but should, rather, turn the full force of their limelight on the people who are responsible for making the machine work.  The very word &ldquo;scapegoat&rdquo; brings home to us how easy it is to turn from a difficult problem and find someone to blame.  We should, I think, be grateful to the writer of the article for making us think and showing us that we are at the stage when lesser mortals turn to look for a scapegoat instead of bringing the full force of their moral pressure, their publicity and their limelight to bear on those engaged in conflict and on those capable of finding a solution to that conflict.</P>
    <P>This legislation seems to have been accepted in the spirit in which it was hoped it would be accepted.  It has been on the stocks for some time.  It was not introduced to solve the present dispute. I pretend nothing for it except that it is the beginning of a solution to one aspect in the sphere of human relations in industry and commerce and the problems affecting our economy in that particular sphere.  The House must accept and, accepting, must try to make others accept that, while there is freedom, there will continue to be strikes. While there is freedom, freedom will continue to be abused and will be seen to be abused by either one side or the other.  As I said, the very existence of the Labour Court and, perhaps, of the Department of Labour, with a politician, <Col N="2369" /> perhaps, in a vulnerable position, may take the pressure off those people whose job it is to make free negotiation work.  The very fact that there is a Department of Labour with a Ministerial head means that that Ministerial head risks being a scapegoat. Apart from the unattractiveness personally of such a role there is the responsibility of being a scapegoat for those who should make the system work.  It is easy to turn away from a person who is difficult and take it out on someone who is more vulnerable.</P>
    <P>I want now to tell the House and the country that it will take years to change the attitudes of the Irish people in both business and trade unions.  It will take years to change their dispositions, to bring them into line with our hopes in regard to the way we should live by bringing those hopes into line with our ambitions for success in every sphere of activity and, until these years have passed, until dispositions have changed, until stubbornness ceases to be admired, we will have strikes and the hardships that workers have to endure in strikes, the losses that businessmen may suffer, together with the interference with the national endeavour.</P>
    <P>While these changes of attitude are being gradually brought about and suspicion, arrogance, false leadership and misunderstandings are being removed, whoever occupies the job of Minister for Labour will have to bear with assertions that it is not worth while having a Department of Labour.  I say it is worth while trying.  I cannot shrug off this job as others might do.  Others say they should not have to bother with these workers or with these problems. I will not shrug off responsibility. Even if the task seems to me to be enormous, difficult, intricate and unproductive of results, no matter how energetically one works, it is still worth while trying.  It is worth while trying apart altogether from the good the Department has done in the setting up of machinery and the financing of that machinery to train our workers, our skilled personnel, our managers.  To my mind this will be the greatest single contribution which will be made in the <Col N="2370" /> years to come towards the success of Irish industry, apart from that which we do not control, industrial relations. Apart from the benefits to be gained from training and protective legislation like the Redundancy Payments Act which is now operating successfully and has been much praised by workers who find themselves in need of its provisions, apart from the protection of workers in their places of employment, the extension of the inspectorate, the subsidising of organisations to help save the lives and protect the health of workers, apart from providing guidance in careers and stimulating thought in the guidance of both children and adults&mdash;adults who find themselves in jobs unsatisfactory to them&mdash;into employment, apart from setting up an entirely new concept of guidance and placement throughout the country, on which we have Government decisions and with which we are going ahead with offices and placement officers to whom employers will be tempted to go and of whose services school leavers will gladly avail, apart from all these functions, the Ministry of Labour is like any other Ministry in that one can get results by one's own work and one's own personal investment of time and energy; and I still think it is worth while having a Department of Labour even if the only thing these first patient, perhaps somewhat discouraging, steps do is to lead along the road to the point at which Irish people organised in trade unions and in management will come out into the light and leave suspicion behind them, unafraid to say what it is right to do and not afraid to do it.  Until such time all I can do and all this House can do is legislate.  I shall leave it to the Committee Stage to consider amendments or suggestions from trade unions or from any people who think they have any influence in the trade union movement.  All I can do is prepare legislation that will work provided people co-operate.  As I said earlier, this House may pass all the law it likes but the only law that will work is that in which trade unions co-operate.</P>

      <P>Before moving to report progress last week I had been talking about television and <Col N="2373" /> had said that, largely, I agreed with what the Minister had said in relation to the dissemination of news on Telefís Éireann, that they were concentrating too much&mdash;I think that was what the Minister intended to convey&mdash;on publicity stunts; that while I realised that Telefís Éireann want to exploit their news value to the greatest possible extent, it seemed to me that items that appeared to be detrimental to the country were being highlighted rather more than was justified and that sections of the community were getting publicity far in excess of the publicity given to other sections of the community who were doing a great deal to stimulate public opinion and helping humanity and charitable institutions.</P>
      <P>The only further comment I want to make on Telefís Éireann is that it would be desirable and necessary to have a sports programme similar to the Saturday afternoon BBC sports programme. Saturday afternoon is a time when people have time for viewing. Such a sports programme would provide a good service for the public. Admittedly, Telefís Éireann have sports programmes on Saturday afternoon but only very occasionally.  If it is not possible to have a Telefís Éireann production, there is no reason why there should not be co-operation with the BBC with a view to relaying BBC programmes. It must be borne in mind that there are many television licensees who can receive no other channel than Telefís Éireann.  These people, therefore, have no regular sports programme on Saturday afternoon.  That is a matter that might be considered.</P>
      <P>There has been a good deal of comment about the interviewing of parliamentarians, and so forth.  Any parliamentarian who goes on television should be prepared to take it.  Any public representative who is not able to take the knock should not go on television.  Every public representative should be able to answer criticism levelled at him.  I would have no sympathy for him if he were not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that some of the interviewers are somewhat rude to parliamentarians who go on television. I do not think it pays anybody to be rude.  I do not think that the person <Col N="2374" /> who is rude is successful.  His rudeness boomerangs.  It is, of course, undesirable that interviewers should be rude to public representatives or anybody else but the public representative ought to be able to give back all they give him and state his case fully. It would be of great advantage to the country if there were political discussion programmes on Telefís Éireann as there are in other countries.  Those participating in such discussions need not necessarily be public representatives. They could be persons interested in politics generally.  One of the things we suffer from in Ireland is a lack of interest in public life, political institutions, economic policies and politics as a whole.  Telefís Éireann would be well advised to follow the example of broadcasting services in other countries in the matter of the production of political discussion programmes.</P>
    <P>I wish Telefís Éireann good luck. The service is improving.  There are of course little difficulties and faults here and there which I am sure will be removed in the course of time.</P>
    <P>I now come to the telephone service. It is eminently desirable that we should have an up-to-date and efficient telephone service.  Is it too much to ask that telephone operators when asked for a number should repeat the number and indicate to the caller whether he will call him back, whether the number is engaged and so on?  In other words, if I am looking for Dalkey 59 or some number like that it is a simple thing for the operator to say: &ldquo;The number is engaged; I will call you back.&rdquo;  At the moment one rings a telephone exchange, they answer and then you have not the foggiest whether they are putting you through or not.  This is a simple thing.  It needs no particular training.  I suggest that the Minister should give a directive to all telephone operators that they should take that simple line.</P>
    <P>We have a jazz band on the telephone in County Wexford.  This band is quite impartial.  It does not confine itself to any particular area.  On Monday the jazz may be heard in the Wexford area and on Tuesday they may have it in Enniscorthy.  I have been told that the ESB are responsible for it.  Last week I was endeavouring to <Col N="2375" /> get on to one of the larger hospitals on the north side of Dublin.  I tried from morning until night one day and I tried the next day as well.  I could not get on.  I was told that it was due to the fact that the ESB had been carrying out major reconstruction in the area.</P>
    <P>Some years ago in the Courtown area of County Wexford at the height of the tourist season the jazz band was playing almost continuously.  This caused a great deal of indignation among business people who were staying there for the holiday season and wanted to transmit urgent calls, some of them cross-channel.  They could be heard at the other end but they could not hear.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs responded immediately to my representations and sent down experts to check the thing.  It was a considerable time before it was discovered that the trouble was due to the ESB.  I would ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to consider referring the matter to the Minister for Transport and Power and see if the Department of Posts and Telegraphs could stop the Department of Transport and Power or the ESB from interfering with our telephone service.</P>
    <P>We have before us here a telephone bill for £50 million.  The position as I know it is that it is not very easy to get a telephone.  That I can understand because of the shortage of skilled staff, because of the heavy demand for telephones and because of the overloading of the existing structures.  When my constituents apply for a telephone they are told that they will have to pay seven years rental in advance.  I had a case recently of a comparatively small farmer who was asked to pay, I think, £105 down to get his telephone.  Apart from the fact that this is an undue hardship, it seems to me very bad policy.  Are we not spending seven years in advance the rental?  The rental is paid over then.  Are we not absorbing the national revenue that would be due to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs over the next seven years? It does not seem to me to be good business.  The thing about this is that people who are situated in outlying districts, and very often those are the <Col N="2376" /> people who particularly require telephones because of aged relatives living with them or something like that, have to pay far in excess of anybody else. If a person is looking for a telephone and requires maybe half a dozen posts if he happens to live a long way from the beaten track he has to pay an almost prohibitive sum.  This is a point to which the Minister should give attention.  I have had innumerable complaints about it.  They say they have to do that to make the service economic. We have got the telephone bill before us.  I think it is £50 million over five years.  I think that is the sum that is being allocated for the development of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, mainly concerned with telephones. This is a smaller matter the Minister should give serious consideration to and he should stop this advance because economically it is entirely wrong to take away your income for seven years ahead.  This, in effect, is what is happening.</P>
    <P>A mart is being built for the farmers' co-operative in Wexford. There are a considerable number of people employed there and the contract is held by Willoughby Brothers of Gorey who are already telephone subscribers. The contract is a big one.  It runs to £34,000.  There is a lot of employment involved.  They have applied for a telephone.  I made personal representations to either the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs or the Parliamentary Secretary to get a telephone for them.  I have been told down in the contracts department that this telephone went for contract a fortnight ago. I do not live very far from there and I know that telephones have been installed alongside the mart.  There is no need for me to tell the Minister how extremely important it is that a big contract like this running to £34,000 should have a telephone.  To be without one is a hardship not only for the people who are building the mart but for the employees and all the people concerned.  I want the Minister to give that his immediate attention.  I intend to put down a Parliamentary question but I would like if the Minister could give me an assurance that he will give the telephone straight away and he can do that by taking up the telephone and <Col N="2377" /> ringing the people in the area and asking them to install a telephone straight away because they are working there.</P>
    <P>We have in rural Ireland, in County Wexford anyway, antediluvian letter boxes.  They are too small.  One can get an ordinary letter in but the Minister will appreciate that in the modern world there are many forms and maps and so on that must be posted.  Recently in Rosslare Harbour I looked for a bigger letter box.  There was a very small one there.  Somebody sent down another letter box from Dublin or Waterford about two inches bigger. With a herculean struggle one might get the local paper into it and a few letters.  Surely to goodness if we are encouraging people to use the mails more we should give them something they can put their correspondence into?</P>
    <P>As I am on Rosslare Harbour I should like to refer to the telephone we are seeking for Kilrane.  I have been assured by the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary that there is no need for it.  As Minister for Transport and Power, the Minister knows of the increase in incoming traffic at Rosslare Harbour due to the cross-channel ferry on the Fishguard-Rosslare route.  There is a public telephone in Rosslare Harbour, perhaps two, but what people do when they get off the car ferry is go to the next village to make a telephone call because more than likely there will be a queue for the telephone at Rosslare Harbour. Kilrane is a mile or less from there. There used to be a sub-postoffice there but it is now closed.  I cannot understand why the unfortunate people have been denied the facility of a public kiosk.  I can assure the Minister that is is very detrimental to Irish tourism to have no telephone there. I believe that Irish tourism is as dear to the heart of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs as it is to the heart of the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be as brief as possible in my contribution to this important debate.  The Minister has said as much as needs to be said in <Col N="2378" /> connection with his Department but I should like to thank him for circularising the Members of the House with information considerably in advance of the discussion on the Estimate.  The information we received from him was most helpful and the Minister is to be thanked for giving us as much information in advance as he possibly could. We are most grateful to him for the manner in which he dealt with the House in this regard.</P>
      <P>There are a number of points which I wish to raise in connection with telephones, kiosks, television aerials and subterranean telephone lines in my own constituency.  Coming from a suburban constituency, and with the growth of housing estates, public and private, I would urge the Minister to put in underground telephone wires where physically possible.  There are a number of estates in my own locality in Blackrock and it is grotesque to see them festooned with telephone and electricity wires.  I do not know what the scientific problems are in connection with electricity wires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is grotesque on going into some of the new estates to see the scenic amenities of these estates destroyed by the ghastly crisscrossing of telephone and electricity wires, not to mention the electricity and telephone poles.  I am sure the Minister is well aware of these matters and I know that he is anxious to improve the amenities of our cities and countryside.  I do not know what the problems are, but if at all possible he should have subterranean telephone wires laid in all new estates, public and local authority.  Our local authority estates in the vast number of cases are magnificent and it is a pity to have them sullied by this proliferation of wires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any suburban Deputy coming into newly erected suburban estates can see the ugly mass of television aerials destroying the rooftops of beautiful houses.  If we could have a law to the effect that in all future housing estates a master aerial would be erected to give proper reception to the various <Col N="2379" /> houses it would be a great improvement. It is a pity that these things are not thought of when we are talking about the beautification of our cities and countryside.  Dublin is no beauty and anything we can do to beautify it we should do it.  A beautiful city has its effect on the people; psychologically they are sharper and better people.  Where at all possible the Minister should encourage the erection of master aerials in new housing estates.</P>
    <P>On the question of telephone boxes, it has happened to me that I go to a telephone box and I find I have only three pennies where the call costs six pennies.  That is a matter for the person making the call but if one is looking for a person named Lawlor and looks up the telephone directory one finds that there is no page for the Lawlors.  This is infuriating.  I know the Minister and his officials are not responsible for that but part of the problem is the binding of the telephone book itself.  It is too easy to tear out a page, which is a savage thing to do, but it is an infuriating thing to find that the book is not there or to find that it is in a complete mess because the binding has come off through over use.  I would ask for a better binding for the telephone books to help counter the uncivilised approach of some people to property which does not belong to them.</P>
    <P>I have received complaints about the condition of the telephone boxes themselves, about the windows being broken and so on.  Are there people employed full-time to look after the broken telephone kiosks, to replace broken windows and to clean them? The stench one gets on entering some of these kiosks is pretty dreadful to say the least of it.  They should be disinfected from time to time, especially the receiving instruments.  That should be part of a programme of public health safety.</P>
    <P>On the question of sub-postoffices in suburban areas, I have brought the matter of the necessity for one in Cabinteely to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary who received <Col N="2380" /> me in his usual courteous fashion, but unfortunately he could not accede to my request.  However, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider the possibility of having a sub-postoffice in Cabinteely.  In regard to the constituency of Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown generally, there is a tremendous building boom out there, and the sub-postoffices which yesterday would have catered adequately for the needs of the residents have now become completely overcrowded and understaffed. Therefore, I would ask the Minister to investigate the need for more sub-postoffices in the Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown area.</P>
    <P>On the subject of telephones, I should like to pay a tribute to the Chief Contracts Manager in Hammam Buildings.  One hears from time to time of the inefficiency of the telephone service itself, but one receives the utmost courtesy from this Contract Manager and his staff, and I would be failing in my duty as a public representative if I did not mention that.  I agree one does suffer extreme irritation from time to time when one picks up the phone and finds it is not working or seems to be engaged, and when you ring up the operator you find the phone is not engaged but is giving the engaged tone.  Anything that can be done to improve the speed of contact from point A to point B in our telephone service would be welcome.</P>
    <P>We had from Deputy O'Leary a long lecture in the nature of a sermon on what Christian socialism is and how it is propagated by the Labour Party and he related this to the type of programmes put out by Telefís Éireann.  I interjected to say there is a difference between Cuban socialism and Christian socialism and maybe he could not distinguish between them.</P>

Depuy O'Leary said his Party had not received sufficient coverage on Telefís Éireann.  All we have to do is switch on the set and we see the beaming face of the great socialist, Deputy O'Leary, peering into our drawingrooms.  He has a very pleasant face and I do not want to be personal, but let us be fair in talking about coverage on Telefís Éireann.  I remember in the referendum there was a very fair distribution of time given to the three political Parties and, indeed, given to people who were not aligned to a political Party one way or the other.

      <P>They are very good people, and the Deputy is very welcome out there any time.  He will receive great courtesy.  In relation to sports programmes there is one point I have been asked to mention and which I raise on my own account as well.  A fortnight ago when watching the rugby international I was very irritated in regard to the controversial try secured by Bresnihan.  Barry McGann threw the ball over his head and Bresnihan got it and the suggestion was that McGann was in touch.  If we could have had, as they have on the BBC, an instantaneous reply of the action it would have helped.  Let me say in fairness to Telefís Éireann that the match was shown on subsequent programmes and it was clear that McGann was not in touch and that the try should not have been disallowed.  I did not see the replay of the match myself. If Telefís Éireann were able to replay this incident immediately, it would stop controversy getting out of hand and we would not have to wait for a week to find out whether our excellent outhalf, Barry McGann, was in touch or not.  Indeed all the very best to the Irish team in the Arms Park on Saturday next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The standard of Telefís Éireann sports programmes has come up considerably over the years.  However, on Sunday night when one is looking at, say, a GAA match, one has the impression the camera is very far away from <Col N="2383" /> the actual play. and that, in fact, there is only one camera on the ground.  This is a pity because in my view the nearer the camera is to the actual action the better and the further away the camera from the action the less interest one has in the game itself.  Perhaps, the answer to the problem in regard to the GAA &mdash; the same applies to soccer matches I have seen in Milltown where there may be only one camera and the action too far away&mdash;is to have a series of cameras around the sports arena.  This is a matter that might be taken up with Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>There has been a suggestion that television be brought into Dáil Éireann. I do not feel very strongly about it one way or another.  Perhaps, it should be brought in for the opening day of Dáil Éireann.  I have not been here for a dissolution of the Dáil, at least not yet.</P>

      <P>On occasions such as that when President Kennedy came here I think it is important to have television cameras here and as an extension to that, perhaps, we could have the cameras in for Question Time once in each Dáil term.  That might encourage some of us to behave ourselves. These are just suggestions as I go along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore mentioned the &ldquo;radio university of the air&rdquo; in a Dáil question and got a reply from the Minister which I do not think was particularly encouraging.  We should try to encourage this kind of development, as something that would help to educate people at little or no expense and make education easier.  The Fianna Fáil backbenchers would strongly urge the Minister to examine Deputy Moore's proposal which we welcome and which we think should receive serious consideration. We have a Telefís Scoile series dealing with schools and the <Col N="2384" /> Minister has approved an extension of programme time to the present total of 5½ hours weekly.  The Minister goes on to say that the current series is planned to comprise 246 programmes aimed at secondary schools and covering a wide range of subjects selected in consultation with the Department of Education which bears the costs involved.  This is admirable and must receive the praise of the House but we also ask the Minister to examine Deputy Moore's proposition because there are people who cannot afford a £5 TV licence but can possibly afford a radio licence. This should be looked into.</P>
    <P>Near the end of his speech the Minister rightly makes the point that he understands the Authority have taken steps to modify the recent trend in interviewing people of all political and social opinions &ldquo;in a manner which has aroused the strongest criticism&rdquo;.  I support the Minister wholeheartedly here.  Deputy O'Leary, however, said&mdash; there is a certain amount of substance in it&mdash;that if politicians or public figures generally go on television they should be able to take the rough with the smooth, particularly politicians.  I agree with him there.  If there is a television interviewer who is getting out of hand, I think the answer is to bring the matter to his attention and ask him to cool down a bit.  By definition, television is a communication medium and if a politician has a row with an interviewer the whole idea of the actual interview is defeated.  The more anonymous an interviewer remains the better since the purpose is to get information from the politician.  We do not need speech-long questions from interviewers. Who is it that the people want to hear or see?  Speech-long questions do nothing.  I think the professional journalists who, from time to time, interview on Telefís Éireann do a very good job in that respect.  They ask the question in a short sentence and get the information.  This is basically what I think interviewing is all about.  The Minister's point is quite valid when he says this sort of thing must cease and that we must eliminate bad manners. One party should not snarl at the other party.  Having seen a television programme one can hear the reaction: &ldquo;That was a marvellous row on television <Col N="2385" /> last night.&rdquo;  In my opinion that was a bad TV programme from the point of view of communication.</P>
    <P>If the reaction to the programme is: &ldquo;Did you hear what Deputy Tully said last night?&rdquo;  Was he not good, or fair or bad?  I would consider that a successful programme because it communicated what Deputy Tully had to say, or any other Deputy who might be concerned. On the other hand, if there is great amusement&mdash;and that is what happens generally when people snarl at each other on television the night before &mdash;the whole basic concept of television is defeated.  There is no question but that a few Minister and individuals who went on television recently were treated rather shabbily.  We hear a lot about adult audiences.  Our audiences are adult because in the main these interviews are conducted after the children have been put to bed.  Such audiences expect adult behaviour and courtesy from both parties.  In recent times, as the Minister said, this trend has appeared in a number of interviews, of being discourteous.  I do not believe in pillorying anyone and I have no intention of mentioning names.  I think we all know whom we are talking about.  I should not like to think that we are in any way whipping these people but I would ask them to cool down a bit, examine their consciences in this context and make sure in future that they conduct interviews calmly and dispassionately and not let their own prejudices enter into a discussion between A and B.  If an interviewer offends in that respect, he ceases to be what he represents himself to be, an impartial seeker of answers to impartial questions.  We are not indulging in public executions.  These people should be allowed to continue but should be requested to engage in unprejudiced and unbiassed interviewing, if at all possible and, if they do not do it, then the answer is to tell them to bring their contracts to an end.</P>
    <P>With regard to news programmes, first of all, what is news?  The news programmes leave me cold.  I often wonder if our excellent newscasters&mdash; Messrs.  O'Mahoney, Mitchell, Timlin and company leave Telefís Éireann depressed.  It must be very depressing <Col N="2386" /> for them to have to read out this continuous stream of car crashes, burning buildings, plane crashes, revolutions, strikes and all the rest of it.  I can imagine them going home and their wives asking: &ldquo;What are you depressed about this evening?&rdquo;  It is all bad news. Is there any hope of just one line of good news being interposed between the car crashes, the trade figures, the fires, and all the rest of it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Something like that or &ldquo;Deputy Tully was in good humour today&rdquo;.  It seems to be all bad news that is served up.  That is why I ask the question: What is news?  Must it always be bad news?  Our excellent newscasters must be going around in a continuous state of depression.  I have the greatest sympathy for them.  Perhaps the Authority would consider interposing a ray of sunshine, as Deputy Tully said.</P>
      <P>With regard to television courses for TDs, Telefís Éireann has been getting a little bit of criticism recently but, in fairness, I think it should be said that any Deputy who took part in these courses was very impressed.  Perhaps, these courses could be extended and conducted during the holiday period when it would be more convenient for Deputies.  The courses were most constructive. We were all agreed on that. There is so much to be learnt that we could spend weeklong seminars on these courses.  As it is, one is a nervous wreck.  That was certainly my experience. I am always very nervous on television and I think part of that nervousness is engendered because one does not have the technique.  That is the general experience.  A little more instruction in technique would be an excellent thing.  People also want to see politicians smiling instead of cringing. It is a dreadful experience to want to articulate and put a point of view and find oneself, through nerves, unable to do so because of the insidious little eye looking over the camera at one.  If the courses could be extended for the benefit of Members of the House it would be all the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like now to make a special plea for Irish actors and actresses.  At <Col N="2387" /> all times the policy should be to ensure the employment of our own actors and actresses.  The profession should have the status it deserves.  It seems to be emerging from the mist into the clear air now.  Actors and actresses are receiving the respect they deserve. Salaries commensurate with that respect should be a <i>sine qua non</i>.  The profession is excellent.  It is tragic that people like Cyril Cusack and Milo O'Shea should have to emigrate because there is no work for them here. It would be a pity if we lost the younger people because of lack of work.  They will give their lifetime to the profession and they should be encouraged to do that here instead of elsewhere.  Dublin is noted for its theatre.  We should concentrate on our own Irish acting profession.</P>
    <P>Once more, I should like to thank the Minister for circularising all the information he did beforehand.  Other Departments might follow his lead.  I think the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have done this but, since I come from a constituency which has very little relation to agriculture and fisheries, I did not find much use for the documents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss to know what it was Deputy Andrews was talking about.  He spent most of the time lecturing Telefís Éireann on the presentation of programmes, the programmes he would like to see, and he ended by admitting the usefulness of the programmes the Authority put on for the convenience of Deputies and said these programmes would benefit not alone him but other Deputies.  I cannot understand what point he was trying to make.  He criticised Opposition Deputies in relation to Christian socialism and in the same breath he talked about looking in at a Labour Deputy in a drawingroom atmosphere. Here in Dublin some people have not got even indoor toilets and running water let alone drawingrooms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Enough for Deputy Andrews and his Christian socialism. Deputy Moore has probably more appreciation of Christian socialism <Col N="2388" /> than Deputy Andrews because he was brought up in an atmosphere which enabled him to know these things at first-hand.</P>
      <P>Television is a means of communication and a medium which can serve society very well.  It has great educational value.  In the recent past the people in control of this medium have realised that it is of greater value in the field of education than they had thought.  It has an entertainment as well as an educational value.  Television can also be misused.  I do not drink, but I feel there is too much advertising of intoxicating liquor on television, not so much in regard to the sale of intoxicating liquor, but in putting across the idea that you are missing something by not partaking of those wonderful concoctions.</P>
      <P>In the United States of America no company which sells intoxicating liquor is allowed to advertise before a certain time.  These companies can only advertise the bottle, and they are not allowed to send across a message which would convey the idea that someone is drinking something which other people should want to drink. The Minister should pay attention to that point.  It is bad to brainwash the coming generation with the idea that someone is drinking some substance and that they are missing something if they do not drink it themselves.  I have no objection to these companies advertising the sale of their wares, but I protest in the strongest possible term at the brainwashing which takes place. Some day someone will draw the line for this type of advertising.  The Minister should warn the television Authority that intoxicating liquor should not be advertised before a certain time, and that the advertising should be done in such a way that it does not convey to the viewer, and particularly the younger viewer, that he is missing something by not drinking what is advertised in a glass or a bottle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the advertising of cigarettes is to be curtailed in the future.  I am glad of that.  The most important aspect of television is its educational value not only for schools but for the older generation.  It gives them a sense of the geography of the <Col N="2389" /> world.  I do not want to lecture the television producers in the manner in which some Deputies lectured them. I have been critical of the Authority in the past and I now wish to put on record that I recognise the progress which has been made.  I want to compliment the Authority and say that RTE can now measure up to UTV or the BBC.</P>
    <P>The reception we get in Donegal is not what it should be.  I suppose we are fortunate in having a selection of three programmes, but we only pay for one and that is the one which gives us the least satisfaction in the matter of reception.  Perhaps, there are technical difficulties which I do not appreciate but, if there are, perhaps, the engineering section of RTE would take note of them and attend to them at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>With the advent of television the radio has been relegated to second place.  I should like to see better use being made of radio.  There has been a move in that direction recently. Radio should be a more intimate form of communication and give information with regard to road conditions and fatal accidents for the benefit of motorists with radios in their cars. There has been a tendency to move in that direction.  On BBC radio, information is given about road conditions almost every half hour.  There are reports on road conditions, on icy roads, on fogs, on serious accidents.  There is information about major repairs which are being carried out and alternative routes are indicated.  This is most helpful, particularly in built-up areas and congested traffic areas.</P>
    <P>In the USA virtually every 15 minutes there are brief news bulletins giving local information.  RTE could pay more attention to this.  They could incorporate programmes, too, designed for the entertainment of people who have not got the pleasure of looking at television.  Patients in hospital and people living on their own would have their loneliness alleviated by this type of radio programme.</P>
    <P>In Donegal we are not satisfied with the telephone service.  The service is bad, through no fault of the telephonists <Col N="2390" /> or the engineers, but because of bad planning by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and a lack of communication between the Department and the Northern and British authorities. When Deputy Brennan was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, I raised with him the possibility of using Belfast as a link between Great Britain and Donegal.  I cited a number of examples of the bad service in Donegal when we are forced to use Dublin as a link for cross-Channel calls.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is no harm to repeat one example.  It was a simple story of a girl who was nursing in a hospital in London and was involved in a minor accident.  Her father received a message to this effect and not knowing the details, tried to communicate with the hospital.  He was a bus driver from a very northern part of Donegal.  From a sub-office he tried to contact a telephone number in London and he was told there would be a delay of from two to four hours.  He could not wait because he was a bus driver.  He proceeded to Letterkenny where he again tried to make the call, but he was told there would be a similar delay, the Letterkenny office being the office that controlled the sub-office.  He proceeded to Derry city where he used a coin-box telephone and in two minutes was able automatically to contact the telephone number he required.  It is very difficult to explain this position to anxious parents of a girl involved in an accident.</P>
    <P>At the time I took the matter up with the Department and was informed that negotiations were proceeding with a view to using either Derry or Belfast as a link for cross-Channel calls servicing County Donegal.  Nothing has happened.  Indeed, on a few occasions that I have tried to call my own home from Dublin I have been told the Sligo line was out of order.  Because of the urgency of contacting my home I had to &ldquo;sweet talk&rdquo; telephonists to use Belfast as an alternative route and was told that this was highly irregular.  If we have telephone link-up between Northern Ireland and the Republic, there should be some type of communication between the British authorities and the Department here so that if there is not a clear line through <Col N="2391" /> Sligo to Donegal, Belfast or some other route should be available.  If there cannot be co-operation on these lines we should stop talking about other things which are more delicate and not so easy to organise.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to make representations to or to enter into negotiations with the British authorities so that persons in County Donegal who wish to contact any British city by phone can receive the same service as is available to callers in the city of Dublin who can contact any British city by phone virtually within seconds.  This type of service is not available to subscribers in Donegal who are paying just as much for the telephone service and in many cases are paying more than the Dublin subscriber. An applicant in the city of Dublin can have a telephone installed at a nominal charge, whereas in rural Ireland a deposit of as much as £100 is required as a guarantee that the subscriber will retain the telephone.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the logic of this.  I cannot say I am totally against it.  I agree with it to a certain degree.  On the other hand, if persons are asked to pay a deposit for the installation of a telephone up to as much as £100, it is not too much to ask that they should get the same service as is available to subscribers in the city of Dublin who do not have to pay anything like that amount.  In rural Ireland also there are many subscribers who have not got a 24 hour telephone service.  Some of the villages that come to mind are Creeslough, Malin and Churchill, where there are subscribers who pay the same rental as other subscribers pay but whose use of the telephone is limited. I do not think this is good enough. People in these areas should have the same service as anyone else.  They pay the same charges.</P>
    <P>Last week I tried to contact a constituent in a sub-office in Portsallon in County Donegal.  I could hear the Dublin operator spelling the name to the operator at the other end of the line and repeating the spelling two or three times.  When she rang Letterkenny it was a Liverpool operator who came on the line.  I know that lines get <Col N="2392" /> crossed but it is difficult to imagine how when a Dublin operator rings Letterkenny a Liverpool operator answers and cannot locate the post office asked for.  The Liverpool operator said that she could not contact Portsallon.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly made representations to the Department about the siting of letterboxes in rural Ireland for the convenience of the public.  For instance, there should be a letterbox at Drumaweel national school.  A few people are anxious that there should be a letterbox in that situation.  There was a letterbox there a number of years ago but it was removed.  A letterbox in that location would convenience the public but for some stubborn reason the Department refused to replace the letterbox that was removed.  Such a letterbox would facilitate people in that locality and its nearness to the national school would mean that school children could post letters there rather than have to go to Greencastle or Moville.  I have spoken to the Parliamentary Secretary about this matter on a couple of occasions but without result.  I have spoken to him in relation to the installation of various telephones.  At the beginning he was more than helpful but of late&mdash; maybe it is becoming more difficult for him&mdash;he is not just as obliging.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe that is the explanation. There are many points I wished to make but most of them have been made already in this debate.  Finally, I wish to make an appeal on behalf of auxiliary postmen.  This is a body of men who have given good and loyal service to the Department, without any great thanks.  We have had a lecture by Deputy Andrews on Christian charity which Deputy O'Leary missed.  I think Deputy Andrews was taking Deputy O'Leary to task on the ethics of Christian charity.  If Deputy Andrews is sincere in the compliments he has paid to the Minister, perhaps he would be more concerned about Christian charity and pay a little attention to the conditions which auxiliary postmen must tolerate.  I have a letter which I <Col N="2393" /> received from one auxiliary postman the other day.  I quote:</P>
      <P>I will give you another glaring example of the system.  I know of an auxiliary postman.  He works 34½ hours and gets £11 15s Od per week. The other postman in the same office works 39 hours and receives £17 7s Od per week.  For 4½ hours he receives £5 4s Od extra.</P>
      <P>When the auxiliary postman retires he has no pension rights.  He has given the same service and in many cases more service than the established postman.  I cannot understand why the Department should accept the services of men and put them into the category of auxiliaries and pay them a substandard wage and then do not recognise the service on retirement under the age limit. Many auxiliary postmen are ex-Army men.  Many of them are now depending solely on social welfare benefits of as little as £3 5s Od a week.  The case has been made by various speakers for auxiliary postmen; the facts have been placed before the Department and the Minister on many occasions by members of this Party including myself.  I do not wish to go over the same ground again but I would like to make this appeal on their behalf to the Minister. Something must be done at some stage and he might as well get the credit for it by doing something positive to help these men and by recognising their services.  After 40 years they leave the service of the Department of Posts &amp; Telegraphs and must line up on the first day of their retirement for old age pension or dole.  It is not good enough.  I sincerely hope the Minister will take note of this matter and do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I always feel there is a certain freshness about this Department's Estimates.  As Deputy Andrews mentioned, the approach of the Minister in sending out his Estimate beforehand is appreciated by the back bench Members of the House who may not be as deft with Estimates as their more senior colleagues.  The workers of this Department on the street seem to have a certain expert appearance.  Perhaps this is something that is common throughout the whole Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2394" /> The Department covers many services. One small one is district post offices.  I know they are not directly controlled by the Department in the matter of decoration but most of them are painted dark green and look comparatively dowdy, uninspiring and uninviting.  We might start a &ldquo;brighten our post offices campaign&rdquo;.  It might encourage people to save more or to utilise post offices more.  It would do no harm and, at least, a new colour would brighten our lives.</P>
    <P>I suppose the whole hub of this Department in recent years has been Telefís Éireann.  Here we have one of the most potent influences for good or evil.  Radio Telefís Éireann generally are doing a good job.  It is impossible to broadcast day after day the whole year round and please people all the time or at least not offend them.  Even politicians complain at times that they do not get sufficient coverage either as Parties or as individuals.  Sometimes this can be true.  On the First Stage of the Trade Union Bill there were three speakers&mdash;one from the Fianna Fáil Party, one from Fine Gael and one from the Labour Party.  That night on the news bulletin the only speaker not mentioned was the Fianna Fáil speaker. Maybe he had not spoken as intelligently as the other people.  I mention this point because it knocks the Opposition's criticism that Fianna Fáil dominate the service.  We do not do anything like that.  Here is an instance of a very important Bill and only the views of two Parties given.  Perhaps it will happen next week that one of the other Parties will be dropped and Fianna Fáil will be mentioned. Generally speaking they try to do their best in Montrose but there have been instances where they have not done their best.</P>
    <P>Telefís Éireann, because of its great influence on the lives of the people, can be a force for good or evil.  I feel that some people there want to give it a kind of cosmopolitan outlook and by doing this they sacrifice the national outlook on certain matters.  The vast majority of people want to see Telefís Éireann portray not perhaps the country we have but the country we would like to have, the Ireland of Pearse and <Col N="2395" /> Emmet, the young men and the old men who today are building the economy up to what we wish it to be.</P>
    <P>Telefís Éireann put on something like the international song contest. There is tremendous ballyhoo for weeks beforehand.  Then they come up with the winner eventually and this person&mdash;I do not know whether she is a good singer or a bad singer&mdash; could represent Liverpool or London or anywhere else.  There is nothing Irish or national about it.  This is a great tragedy.  We take part in this competition with the French, the Spanish, the Dutch and all the rest and our entry&mdash;I do not just mean our entry this year but other years as well &mdash;will sing a song, which is neither a very good song, nor is it representative of the culture we wish to see. People may say: &ldquo;Telefís Éireann do not pick the winner, other people do that&rdquo; but Telefís Éireann organise the contest and perhaps some other agency could do a better job in this instance.</P>
    <P>Wherever there is a row Telefís Éireann have their cameras.  This shows they are a live organisation. Every day of the week we see student meetings, student rows or students doing something unusual.  They always seem to have a grievance.  I feel that Telefís Éireann do not probe student life deeply enough.  In this city there is a group of students who each Saturday afternoon go out and repair and decorate the homes of old and destitute people who cannot do it themselves. These students from the Dublin universities get no mention on Telefís Éireann.  They do not want mention but I am just mentioning it for them to show that there is more to student life than sit-ins or talk-ins or whatever other &ldquo;ins&rdquo; they have.  Telefís Éireann could do a great job here by giving a balanced view of what students mean to the city and to the country.</P>
    <P>I had a question down last week asking the Minister if Radio Telefís Éireann could establish a university of the air as has been done in another country.  Telefís Éireann has done a good job with things like Telefís <Col N="2396" /> Scoile, Céim ar Aghaidh, Ceist agam Ort and the Italian programme.  These show the great potential for education. Education is a major part of the lives of people today.  We may discover that we have been wrong about education all along in many ways and if after 90 years of compulsory education we have a complete upheaval in our educational institutions we must start thinking afresh on this whole subject. If we could bring education into the home through Telefís Éireann it could be a tremendous step forward.</P>
    <P>There are thousands of people who, because they have not got the means or the ability, cannot go to university but we can bring education to the people as we are doing in the programmes I have mentioned.  This will mean that Telefís Éireann is a part of our lives, a very good part and that it is not there merely to amuse us, to bring us song contests and comedians. Telefís Éireann has a much deeper purpose for existence than that.  Television could also be used to give us true education.  Today, with the overcrowding in the universities this may be a method to provide a new type of university which does not need expensive buildings or libraries costing millions of pounds.  RTE can be used to give university programmes.  This has been done in Britain.  We can see what they have done over there and then come up with our own ideas in the matter. People would benefit from it.</P>
    <P>The general level of programmes on RTE is very good despite the obvious faults.  I do not think that any politician is afraid of any interviewer in RTE but what politicians may be afraid of is that they may be met with a lack of courtesy on the part of the interviewer.  It has happened.  The politician may not be afraid of the lack of courtesy but he does not welcome it.  He goes on a programme to do a job and he wants to get on with that job.  While we have some very excellent interviewers in RTE some of them appear to be influenced by a young man in England who is known to be rude and who is sometimes crude.  In this country we have our own image and an interviewer is there to ask the <Col N="2397" /> question which will draw the answers which the people want from the politician. Some years ago the Head of the Government appeared on a programme with some young people and was subject to the worst display of bad manners I have ever seen.  It was stopped after that but there is nobody, no matter what his political views are, who would not condemn these young people for their bad manners on that occasion.</P>
    <P>Some time ago we got from Telefís Éireann a course of Irish history.  It was read by Mr. O'Mahony and was a classic example of what an educational programme should be.  It attracted a tremendous viewing audience both because of the content of the programme and because of the excellence of Mr. O'Mahony.  It did more to familiarise many of our people with Irish history than could be done by thousands of textbooks.  The more we get of this type of programme the more the people will benefit and the higher will be the regard for Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>With regard to advertisements for alcohol and spirits, I do not drink but I am not a pussyfoot and for adults the matter of drinking is their own business.  In my opinion these advertisements have always been geared to attract the young.  This is deplorable and Telefís Éireann should use more finesse in regard to these matters.  I hope the time will shortly come when Telefís Éireann will be able to get along without advertisements of any kind but until that time, and if we must have advertisement, this advertising should be done in good taste.</P>
    <P>It has frequently been stated that people brought for interview by Telefís Éireann are not representative of the general mass of the people but are sometimes rather of the odd type. This has been so but it is probably due to the fact that Telefís Éireann is trying to show how impartial it is. If the odd type is given an opportunity to express his views the onus is on Telefís Éireann to see that the views expressed are in keeping with the thinking of the people and that the person interviewed is not some odd person with a chip on his shoulder putting forward subversive or foreign <Col N="2398" /> doctrines.  The mass of interviewers do not want this type of thing and while a small section of those who call themselves intellectuals may want it the mass of the people are opposed to it.  What they would prefer to see are interviews with young people serving in hospitals or on the missions, people working in factories or young businessmen who have made the grade.  That is what Telefís Éireann should try to give, our own Irish image, and they should not allow themselves to be influenced from Continental or other sources.</P>
    <P>Most of the films shown by Telefís Éireann are imported.  I can see the difficulty here because it must be very difficult to keep up a supply of films. The films shown may not be good but I regard most of them as harmless.</P>
    <P>My final word has to do with the telephone service.  There is a long delay in the installation of telephones and here again I know the difficulties. However, I think that we should tell the people that there is a waiting list of thousands and that we are doing our best to get it down to the region of two or three hundred.  Every Deputy in this House is being pestered by people asking to have telephones installed and we just cannot do it although telephones today are as much a part of the home as a television set.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister have his engineers design a telephone kiosk which would stand up to the wanton destruction being wreaked by vandals? Even in the city here we see the telephone kiosks smashed and the instruments themselves broken or stolen.  We see these things done in the heart of the city and somebody must see them being done but apparently nobody interferes. I do not know what kind of kiosk would stand up to this destruction but Telefís Éireann might well give us a few lessons in civics.  These vandals are the enemies of society and it is our duty to stop them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House for any great length of time.  I will go baldheaded straight away for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  The statement made here <Col N="2399" /> recently by the Minister in relation to Telefís Éireann is something this House should not pass lightly.  There was a hint or something stronger than a hint that there was an application in from the Authority for the Minister's consideration and that of the Minister for Finance to increase the cost of television licences.  He went on to give a reason why this increase might be considered. It was not to give increases to the staff of Telefís Éireann or to provide any further travelling or other allowances.  It was just to improve existing programmes.</P>
      <P>Might we enquire from the Minister from where the demand is coming for improving the programmes of Telefís Éireann?  The existing standard of programmes, to me as a viewer, is excellent. There may be demands from certain sections of the public for a better standard of programme or a more expensive type of programme.  There may be people like the Minister himself who require the most expensive programmes for their leisure.  However, the ordinary taxpayer down the country feels he is getting good value for his £5 licence.  I have a feeling there will be a revolt among the majority of licence holders if the licence is increased to £6 or thereabouts on the grounds that it is for the purpose of improving the standard of the programme.  I do not believe that.  The licence holders do not believe it, and the people down the country do not believe it.  There is something far deeper in all this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did go on to make reference, directly or indirectly, to the manner in which the interviewers in Telefís Éireann interview certain people, namely, men in public life who present themselves before the television cameras for interview.  There are associated with Telefís Éireann what I consider to be, and what are generally considered, not alone in this country but outside it, the best type of radio or television interviewers that can be obtained by any network in the world.  They may be a little too good for Fianna Fáil.  They may cause embarrassment to the Party and to the Minister and his colleagues at times.  However, the real test of a good <Col N="2400" /> interviewer on television or radio is his ability to extract the information he wants, and he may put the same question in three or four different ways for the purpose of soliciting all the information he wants.</P>
    <P>The public men of all Parties who present themselves before these people must admit that these interviewers are past masters at their job.  If they are to be successful interviewers they must try to embarrass and to puzzle the public man who presents himself, if he is foolish enough to go unarmed, if he is foolish enough to allow himself to be made a monkey of by these interviewers. That is his lookout.  All of us know and no one knows better than the viewing public that the greatest number of duds that appear from time to time on television interviews are, unfortunately, our Ministers.  They have not created a very good image.  One of the reasons why they have not created a very good image is that on numerous occasions they have allowed themselves to be bogged down by the interviewer and full marks went every time to the interviewer.</P>

This effort is on the way, and the Minister just wanted to break the ice by referring to it here last week.  If public men are to be knocked off the interview list by Telefís Éireann, it will be no loss to Fianna Fáil, because they generally lose on every appearance they make and Members on this side of the House who are not afraid of these interviewers will be available to be interviewed.  It must be embarrassing to be interviewed by these people who can carry out a very thorough crossexamination, and not to be able to tell them the truth or for some reason or other not to want to tell them the truth, not to have glaring admissions of their own failures.  I can well understand how embarrassing it must be for any Minister to have to appear before television cameras and undergo severe cross-examination and finally have to admit his own failure.</P>

      <P>The <i>Irish Times</i> on Friday, 28th February, 1969, had a leading article headed &ldquo;The Childers Submission.&rdquo;  This was a leading article of great intelligence and common sense.  Either the editor must be very confused about what the Minister said or I must be very confused about what the editor has written in this leading article.  The leading article goes on:</P>
      <P>Mr. Childers raised many points in his statement on the Estimates for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs which will be taken up on another day, but the most topical, and in many ways the most vital, concerns his remarks on interviewing and the general handling of news and current affairs on the national television and radio system.  He is on dangerous ground.</P>

The Telefís Éireann authority has many other ways of meeting and consulting the Minister besides going through the official files of the Department.</P>
      <P>From time to time the Minister meets these people socially, as he is entitled to do.  He has been seen in their company; they are all his own Party colleagues and his own Party clique, so to speak.  I give the Minister credit as regards the Authority that there is at least one individual, who shall be nameless, in the Authority who knows his job.

      <P>He is responsible for those he appoints and their conduct when appointed and he is also responsible for the speech he made here last week.  This may be an attempt to silence these interviewers.  The Minister has many ways of saying this.  He wants to convey to the House that there has been a lack of courtesy. The Minister may have had instances from time to time of a lack of courtesy. I saw the Reverend Ian Paisley on television being the subject of lack of courtesy but it did not deter him from answering what he was asked.  I saw Captain O'Neill on more than one occasion being subject, in my opinion, to a lack of courtesy.</P>
      <P>It is extremely difficult to be courteous if you have a group of interviewers, four or five or six, all speaking at the one time, all anxious to get in their questions and to get answers from the person being interviewed.  It is easy for the Minister to say that in the past public men, such as Ministers, have been subjected to discourtesy.  We have seen occasions when Ministers and others in high positions were being interviewed and they did not display the courtesy I think was called for to the interviewer.  We have heard the short and snappy replies and seen the efforts made to evade a straight question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If that is so perhaps the Minister will be manly enough to tell the House that the Taoiseach has been offended.  If that has happened and if an apology is sought I have no doubt that if there was any misunderstanding between the interviewer and the Taoiseach it can very easily be straightened out.  I have not heard from the Taoiseach at any time that he was treated with any degree of discourtesy.  I did read that the Minister for Agriculture was not offered a chair when he got out to Montrose and that he and his officials were left standing.  Naturally enough, if, through an oversight, a chair was not provided with speed and efficiency for the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, that little social bêtise was very easily corrected because there has since been an apology to the Minister. Apart from the fact that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries was not provided with a chair to sit down on with the speed and efficiency which he would have liked, when he arrived at Montrose, are there any other discourtesies to be disclosed by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs?  I do not know of any.</P>

They are exposing the incompetency of Ministers to the country and, because they are, and this is appreciated by the public, they must get the mallet on the head.  That is really the position.

Everyone who read the Minister's pronouncement here last week knows perfectly well that he is dissatisfied with the manner in which public men are being interviewed on Telefís Éireann.  The Minister wants to change the pattern.  He wants to have a greater degree of courtesy and a higher standard of manners.  If you ask me, he wants to have loaded questions asked, questions to suit himself, questions to suit Fianna Fáil, questions like (a), (b) and (c) so that the simpleminded people in Fianna Fáil will be able to cope with them.</P>

The Deputy is not going to go on falsifying what I have said and what I believe.  Nothing could be worse for Fianna Fáil than a series of loaded questions addressed to Ministers.  That sort of thing is very quickly seen through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows that an effort was made to have a series of questions asked of certain people who presented themselves for interview before television.  We all know that.  The Minister knows it quite well and, on one occasion, when an interviewer put his own question in between the prepared questions, he got the works.  A good many know that that happened.  Naturally enough, the interviewer upset the Minister by his interposition.  Then we have the spectacle of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs telling us here now that there is nothing as bad for his Party as loaded questions.  I most certainly agree because loaded questions do not work with people who have a job to do, people who are not interested in Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, or anyone else.  They are interested only in bringing out the best from the point of view of the viewing public.  On the pretext of lack of courtesy, we now have the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs telling us that he has got in touch with the Authority, or is about to get in touch with the Authority, with a view to improvement and getting a greater degree of courtesy for public men who present themselves.</P>
      <P>Let me conclude by saying that any man in public life who is foolish enough to go on television, not knowing what is in store for him, not knowing what the consequences may be if he makes a fool of himself before the cameras, deserves everything he gets.  Any public man who goes before the television cameras should be sufficiently thick-skinned not to become annoyed if he is not addressed as &ldquo;Minister' or &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; or &ldquo;Your worship&rdquo; or &ldquo;Your honour&rdquo; or whatever distinguished titles Fianna Fáil would like interviewers to bestow on them.</P>

      <P>If a person presents himself before the cameras and is not prepared to answer questions, he has no business going before <Col N="2409" /> them.  As an excuse for a failure to answer questions, we are told that there was a degree of bad manners, that there was not the customary saluting and salaaming, and bending of the knee, or doffing of the cap. Seemingly that is what Fianna Fáil want.  Seemingly that is what Fianna Fáil feel they have not got.  They think that enough courtesy has not been extended to them, but I fail to see that there has been such a lack of courtesy by the interviewing staff of RTE.</P>
      <P>These men are well trained and extremely well educated.  Nine times out of ten they have a greater degree of educational qualifications than the people to whom they are putting the questions.  For that reason, it illbehoves the Minister to comment on the standard of their courtesy or manners.  Whether on Seven Days, the Late Late Show or any other show presented to the public I have yet to see one single glaring case of discourtesy being meted out to any guest. I want to tell the Minister that I agree very fully with the Editor of the <i>Irish Times</i> in his leading article on Friday, 28th February.  The Minister is treading on very dangerous ground if he is trying to tie up interviewers, to silence them, to handcuff them and deprive them of their freedom to address any questions they like, in what manner they like, and how they like&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I repeat, in what manner they like, and how they like, because they are the best judges of the manner in which questions should be put.  Does the Minister want a situation in which the person interviewed is to ask the questions, answer the questions and dictate as to how, and in what form, and by what means, and in what terms questions are to be put?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a duty to protect their full freedom so that all Parties can enjoy that freedom.  If a man is appointed subject to the authority of RTE, he should carry out <Col N="2410" /> his interviews in accordance with his own standards and qualifications without interference either from the Authority or the Minister.  If he is not suited to the job I have very little doubt but that he will be told to seek a vacancy elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I want to say again for the record that people from abroad have commented very favourably on our interviewing staff and news readers in RTE and said they are equal to, if not superior to, the interviewers and news readers in Canada and the USA.  They are most certainly far ahead of the British.  Anyone who tunes in frequently to UTV or the BBC can judge that for himself.  Our job should be to concentrate on keeping those people here and giving them a greater degree of security with a guarantee of no interference from the top so that the renewed confidence which the public have in them may be continued.</P>
      <P>What puts real life into a broadcasting system and what interests the public is how people conduct themselves before interviewers and the manner in which the interviewers acquit themselves with their questions. We want that to continue.  It may not have been pleasing to Fianna Fáil. Admittedly it has not, but who are they to speak for the whole country?  For that reason I make a very sincere and genuine appeal to the Minister to keep off this dangerous ground.  If any interviewer has been guilty of an act of discourtesy, the Director General has his own office and he can call in the interviewer privately and explain to him that an act of discourtesy has taken place, if it has.  That is the job of the Director of the Authority, not the job of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should not make complaints to suit himself or his Party colleagues, with a view to bringing a cloud of silence over these men who are doing a job and doing it well.  I trust the Minister will leave it alone. He has made his point in his Estimate speech.  If any attempt is made to change the attitudes of the interviewers or to silence them, I could well see this country losing their services.  If that happens the Minister, through his own <Col N="2411" /> action and the action of his own Department, will be bringing misfortune upon our own television service. That should be avoided at all costs.  I am prepared to leave the matter at that, and I am sure the Minister will also be prepared to leave it at that and let it rest.</P>
    <P>Hands off these people who are doing a good job and doing it independently. No matter if they may cause embarrassment. That is their job.  The public know that the reason for the Minister's outburst last week was that he and his colleagues have come badly out of this. There are many ways in which revenge can be taken, but this is a despicable way to take revenge, because of the educational programmes connected with the referendum or because of the display of discourtesy shown to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in that a chair could not be had with greater speed and efficiency for him to sit on.</P>
    <P>Telefís Éireann deserve the greatest credit for the coverage which they gave recently to the Six County election. That was an outstanding piece of work. The reporters covered the important centres of count.  It was well conveyed, highly educational to the public and deeply appreciated by them.  The coverage of the results of the referendum can be described as one of the masterpieces of television even though the news may not have been as encouraging for the Government as they would have liked.  Nevertheless, it was well covered and a good job was carried out.</P>
    <P>Telefís Éireann in my opinion have done a terrific job to further the Irish language.  Their programmes have undoubtedly aroused a certain interest in the language that was not evident before television.  That is a good thing. I hope it will continue.  It is something that is to be encouraged.  The reading of the news in Irish both on television and on radio is something that should not go without comment. Because of the simplicity of the Irish phrases used it is possible for school children to clearly follow every item of news.  I know many homes in which the children assemble for the purpose of translating the news in Irish into <Col N="2412" /> English.  Can anything be of more educational value than the interest created by this?  It is something we should encourage.  Whoever is responsible in the Newsroom of Telefís Éireann for presenting the news in Irish in such simple and understandable phraseology deserves a tribute.  The same can be said of our Irish newsreaders as has been said about the English newsreaders. They are the right people in the right jobs and are doing an excellent job but no matter how well they do it I suppose like the Deputies they will be open to some criticism.</P>
    <P>I want to make one comment on a programme I was rather disappointed by.  It was &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; in which a number of young people were asked to come forward and give an account of their activities and their capabilities of drawing knives and using them on each other.  There may have been a good motive behind the programme but it was rather disturbing. It was of immense educational value to many people in rural Ireland who never thought that such people existed, young people who would come before a television camera and announce to all and sundry that they carry knives for the purpose of making vicious attacks on their friends and colleagues if there is any effort made to put up a fight.  Even the knives were presented.  To take a more broadminded view of it, maybe it was reality. We could not deny these were real people and real knives and these knives were in action.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, there is no purpose in trying to deceive the public that the like never took place but I can assure the Minister that that programme had a most disturbing effect.  Maybe it had a sobering effect as well as a disturbing effect but before we bring a grand parade of those who participate in crime before television we ought to look twice because to use a knife, no matter how skilfully, in a row and then to boast about the number of stitches the victim had to have is appalling and deplorable on television.  Nevertheless, perhaps, this programme had a sobering effect on some people.  To me it was horrifying because I could not possibly bring myself to believe that in the city of Dublin in the middle of the 20th <Col N="2413" /> century there are people so untrained or so callous as to carry knives and boast on television that they are carried for the purpose of maiming and disfiguring anyone who comes in their way.</P>
    <P>The fewer programmes of that kind we have the better because they could very easily create a false sense of pride within the knife carrier, the feeling that he was a television star and that because he was courageous enough to carry and use a knife skilfully he was worthy of appearance before the cameras.  If it created such an impression it would be very dangerous; if it created the impression that those fellows were going to be considered as heroes worthy of publicity it would be dangerous.  The Telefís Éireann Authority ought to be careful about the mentality of such people.  The exercise in which they participate is no credit to themselves, their city or the country. On the contrary, it is an exercise of shame and dishonour.  The skilful use of knives was the subject of what I consider to be the most horrifying programme I have seen on Telefís Éireann and one which caused me a certain amount of dismay and alarm but after calm consideration I decided that maybe it served a good purpose by giving people sober thoughts as to what actually was in our midst.</P>
    <P>May I leave the television service for a moment to make a brief reference to the Post Office and may I ask the Minister what is happening in the post offices?  Are they now understaffed or are more people using them with the same number of staff?  It must be that there are more people using the post offices because in all our provincial towns and in this city there seem to be queues awaiting attention all the time. I have seen long queues of people anxious to get their business done in the General Post Office and I have seen &ldquo;Dúnta&rdquo; displayed across the cubicles and no activity going on behind them.  I think that workers, housewives and business people who have business in the post office, whether it is to buy a penny stamp or a postal order for the crossword puzzle, are entitled to have these <Col N="2414" /> offices sufficiently staffed to cope with the demand.  Perhaps, I have selected inconvenient times to go to the General Post Office but I have seen there long queues of people and the cubicles closed with &ldquo;Dúnta&rdquo; written across them.  I am satisfied that these offices are not as fully staffed as they might be.</P>
    <P>Is there an effort on the part of the Department to cut down on staff?  Is there an effort to get one person to do the work of two or is there some arrangement of the time that bring additional staff on duty at particular times and a lesser number at other times?  I am surprised that the Post Office Workers' Union have not made some representations to the Department on this matter.  The post office workers whom I saw at work could not possibly cope with any great degree of efficiency with the crowds they were being asked to serve.  Some of the cubicles which were closed on these occasions should have been open and there should have been more assistants on duty to attend to the public.</P>
    <P>Our postage rates must now rank as the dearest in the world.  There was a time when the post office seemed to give good value and good service but I am afraid that now the post office is becoming very expensive indeed.  I cannot understand the high cost of telegrams.  Perhaps, it is that the post office wants to discourage the use of them and to encourage the use of the telephone instead.  If one wants to despatch an urgent message to any part of the country where there is no telephone, the only way it can be done is by telegram but it seems to me that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have killed the goose that laid the golden egg.  There might be greater use made of the telegram service if it was cheaper but the cost is prohibitive at present.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by other Deputies to the telephone service and I will not enlarge on it.  It is not bad but something should be done to expedite delays at the exchanges.  Perhaps, this is due to the greater use of the telephone and to the greater number of subscribers but there does seem to be <Col N="2415" /> a definite clogging up of the lines. There is still a big backlog of telephones to be installed and a greater effort should be made to instal a telephone quickly once the application comes in.  The question of the deposit that has to be put down before a telephone is installed is a considerable hindrance.  The telephone is now a piece of household furniture.  Every efficiently run home must have one and one would imagine that with the rentals coming in, and with the greater number of subscribers, the service would become cheaper.</P>
    <P>The unreasonably high rate of the deposit is a great hindrance, particularly to people in the rural districts. The Minister should have another look at that.  Applications are now being made in great number because telephones are a necessity and while no objection seems to be raised to the rental, grave exception is taken to the deposit of the rental in advance.  Perhaps, the Minister could have this matter examined again, because the deposit is a hindrance and a handicap to telephone development.</P>
    <P>May I, in conclusion, pay tribute to the Minister's engineering staff throughout the country who are always available and on call to repair and restore broken down services to normal?  These are highly dedicated men who never fail to do their duty.  Deputies on all sides of the House should salute the enthusiasm with which they brave the elements after an electric storm, a snowstorm or any other kind of storm to repair the lines and restore the service.  The Minister has on many occasions expressed his appreciation of the efforts and services of these workers but no words that could be said inside or outside this House in appreciation of their efficiency and services would be sufficient.  They are men who do their job well.  They are a credit to the Department with which they are associated in the exercise of the skills which they possess.  I can assure the Minister that all telephone subscribers, whether business, commercial or private, appreciate the outstanding efforts that have been made at all times by the most useful and helpful <Col N="2416" /> section of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the engineering section, who come to the aid of all subscribers when they are in difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few brief comments on the television aspect of this Estimate.  I do so because I believe it is my duty to do it.  Before I make any comment on the political end of it, may I just mention that programmes which are really more suitable for children are screened at times when it is a little bit too late for children to be up to see them?  I do not see a great deal of television myself and I cannot pretend to be very familiar with what these programmes are, but this is a constant complaint made to me both by my own family and my constituents' families.  One such programme is &ldquo;Here's Harry&rdquo; which is a comedy show.  It does not come on until 10.5 p.m.  If the children do not see the programme because it is considered too late for them to stay up, it causes a little disharmony in the house; or if they do stay up it is equally unsatisfactory because they have to be up early for school next day.  This domestic conflict could be avoided if whoever is responsible for arranging these programmes could give a little more consideration to the timing of them.</P>
      <P>The news programmes, by and large, are pretty fairly put over.  Sometimes I feel a rather trivial incident is a little over-emphasised or a group who are not really representative of anybody and who have done very little to deserve any great admiration get too much publicity.  The agitation in UCD is a case in point.  I do not mean that exclusively, but this is the type of thing I have in mind.  If they got a little less publicity they would tend to be more responsible.  It is the fun of the news value these incidents have which is largely responsible for this activity. There are many other worthwhile causes which could be given time in preference to these unrepresentative groups.  A playing down of the activities of these people might put the matter in perspective, because they are getting a false sense of values.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What really induced me to speak today was the political programmes.  In <Col N="2417" /> this regard I am 100 per cent behind the Minister.  For a long time I felt that something should have been done about this.  The public at large have reacted against the type of political commentators we are enduring at the moment.  One of the faults which many of us have found is the plain boorishness and bad manners of these interviewers. Like people driving motorcars they think they are not expected to conform any more and that good manners are no longer expected from them.  This sort of cheap, blatant career-building at the expense of the public and the person whom they are interviewing is bad for the image of television.  This rapid asking of questions and the shyster lawyer manner which they adopt and which one normally associates with second-rate films from America is not good enough for a national television service.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of what the person being interviewed represents, whether we agree with him or not, he is a guest on television and should be treated as a guest.  The last speaker seemed to indicate that if you are foolish enough to go on television you cannot expect good manners or courtesy and anything you get is too good for you.  I do not accept this.  I do not think anybody is afraid of being asked questions or explaining their point of view.  Most people are more than happy to do this, but they do expect a reasonable time to answer the question.  This is one of the gimmicks: if you think a person is going to answer a question put in another one and throw him off.  This is the type of abuse which is being indulged in and more or less accepted as a way of life.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister said something had been done about this and this type of interviewing was being stopped.  It has not been stopped completely because I had experience of it myself on the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; programme recently.  I am not concerned about this for myself.  The only defence against rudeness is to be rude back, but I did not think it was desirable to adopt that course.  This has not been stopped and whatever steps have been taken by the Minister to deal with this situation are not sufficient. <Col N="2418" /> I would suggest that a little more pressure should be applied and that, if these people find it difficult to conform, a little more assistance be given.</P>
    <P>There are some people who know the answers to everything and have instantaneous cures for every problem in the world.  They can shoot out rapid answers to every question that is thrown at them.  Other people like to have a moment to consider before they answer questions.  The question that is being put to them is new and they may need time to consider it.  If the question is worth asking at all, surely it is worth answering well and the person is entitled to have, not a long period, but a second or two, to gather his thoughts and decide what is the best way to present what he wants to say?</P>
    <P>At the risk of embarrassing our popular news correspondent, Mr. Fahey, I wish to quote him as proof that it is possible to be courteous and efficient on television.  He frequently interviews people.  There is no gangster type of interview about it.  If they evade the question he will come back on that a second time.  He is efficient and courteous; he gets the answers and the public are satisfied.  This is the type of person and the type of manners and tradition we want to build up, not these foreign imitations which have been foisted on us in some of the other programmes of news and comment.  It is an abuse of their position and I think it should cease.</P>
    <P>One of the other problems that we face with this type of programme is that of having a proper balance of views.  It is not unusual to find a problem discussed and there is somebody to discuss one side but no proper coverage from an alternative point of view.  We get too many one-sided interviews and discussions.  These are passed over to the public as if there was no contrary point of view.  This should not be allowed.  I have heard it said that it is sometimes difficult to get people to represent the opposite point of view. This may be true but it is one of the problems of presenting this type of programme and those in charge will have to become more skilful at spreading their net sufficiently wide to get in <Col N="2419" /> people to represent the opposite point of view.  If they cannot do that they will have to reconsider how best to put out the programmes, but it is not good enough that onesided points of view should be put out.  Frequently, it is a point of view which is not acceptable to the people generally.  It may suit the rarified atmosphere of Montrose but does not go down in the country at large.  This is one of the responsibilities the authorities have in broadcasting this type of programme.  Unless we can get a proper balance these programmes should be recast in a different way.  It is not good enough to let this continue.</P>
    <P>Sometimes one wonders, from the slanting of views and news out there, if some type of infiltration has not taken place.  It would not be unusual to find that a medium as important as television would be the type of target that would recommend itself for infiltration. I do not know whether it is that or just arrogance on the part of the interviewer who likes to air his opinions with complete disregard of the person who is supposed to be interviewed and has come to give his opinions. Whatever the reason this is something that needs to be looked into. Much of this I know has already been said and I merely repeat it to emphasise to the public and the Minister how serious the matter is so that it will not be lightly cast aside on the basis that when the matter was debated in the Dáil there were very few people to support the Minister.  The public at large support the Minister irrespective of what any particular newspaper may say.  Newspapers frequently have their own axes to grind and I would not take them as unbiassed people always. No matter what they say I am quite convinced that the public at large are behind the Minister on this.  I have heard much comment from different areas and from various strata and I believe the Minister has public sympathy in this matter.  In order to be fair I think the Minister has in previous years leaned over backward in order not to appear to be unreasonable.  I think the Minister's position should be upright.  It is just as unreasonable to <Col N="2420" /> some people if you lean backwards as it is to others if you lean forwards.  The Minister should try to be quite fair but not over-liberal.  He should not try to be too understanding of the problems that are presented.</P>
    <P>Recently a Deputy suggested that because these interviewers are better educated than the people they are interviewing, they should more or less be allowed to say what they like and do what they like.  I do not think this is true.  I am not overawed by the educational attainments of interviewers nor do I fancy myself as a sort of television gladiator prepared to rush in and take on anybody who comes along.  The natural balance of advantage lies with the interviewer in these programmes.  It is his everyday way of life.  He has more experience and he is asking the questions and I think the least the guest can expect is time to consider the answer and to make it.  Anything less is an abuse of power.  We are not the only ones with this problem.  The BBC at the moment are having difficulties with a certain Mr. Dimbleby who apparently felt that he was joining the ranks of the almighty tin gods and did not have to conform anymore.  Unfortunately, this is one of these world-wide trends but I think we shall have to stop it.</P>
    <P>Recently before the Northern Ireland elections we had a programme on television&mdash;I think it was &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo;; I am not sure&mdash;devoted exclusively to the political life of Mr. Gerry Fitt.  I do not mind if they devote a series of programmes to his life but I think that a week or ten days or whatever it was before the election was not the time to run it.  This was a great personal election campaign for him.  This is unfair and I do not think the television people should do this for anybody. If they do it for Mr. Fitt why not for Mr. McAteer or Mr. Paisley or any other candidates in the election?  This is the type of situation where they do not seem to have a sense of balance or proportion and realise that they pick out one individual for whatever reason or whatever connections he might have in the station so that it suits somebody to run this programme.  This is not good enough.  I do not know if anything <Col N="2421" /> has been done about that or if anybody has commented on it.  I think it is not reasonable that this should be allowed.  With our own election apparently facing us in the near future, I should hate to think that these personal relationships which do exist in Montrose might be allowed to give some people more publicity on the screen than others.  This is something that at any time would be objectionable but in the next few months with the election coming it is something we must be very concerned about because quite apart from politics and other things personal friendships make a great difference to those who appear on television.  If you watch the people who appear you find that they are connected relatively speaking in a fairly small group; they tend to live in the same area or they have the same friends.  There is a certain circle which is unhealthy to say the least of it.  This sort of situation might lead to abuses in the forthcoming election.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by suggesting to the Minister that it is his duty to do something, irrespective of what has been said about this either by removing the political programmes altogether, which seems a little bit drastic or by reducing the number of times the individual commentators appear or possibly by reducing the number of times the programme is screened or by increasing the panels sufficiently to ensure that the individuals will only appear at relatively rare intervals and, therefore, will not be able to build up any personal following.  They should put somebody in charge who is more responsible and who will see that these abuses will not happen.</P>
    <P>Television has enormous power as we know, going into every home in the country.  It is the most powerful means of communication.  We all know that power tends to corrupt.  As politicians we live with this saying which is repeated to us frequently.  Power does not reside entirely in the hands of politicians. It also resides, and on a much larger scale, in the hands of a few people in television studios.  I hope the Minister will now take some serious step to see that the whole matter is not only dealt with but dealt with quickly <Col N="2422" /> and efficiently in the next few weeks, rather than months, before the election comes and we are subjected to more abuse from these people who have no respect for anybody.</P>

      <P>This problem of the function of television in our present society is one which is not peculiar to this country alone.  It is one which affects most democratic societies in the world today.  I listened last year to a broadcast by the BBC of an interview with Mr. Menzies of Australia.  He had a great many interesting things to say about the television medium and politicians. He made one very important point: he said it is a medium which does not suit all politicians, least of all the politician who thinks with his heart.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been explained on previous occasions figures of gross emigration are not available, <Col N="2424" /> while accurate figures of net emigration, that is the excess of the number of emigrants over that of immigrants, are available only for the periods between Censuses of Population.</P>
      <P>For periods subsequent to the last Census of Population, namely that taken in April, 1966, the only indicators available of net emigration are the figures for net outward passenger movement by sea and air.  However, the passenger balance figures do not take account of cross-Border movement; they are derived as the differences between the very large aggregates of the outward and inward passenger movement figures which themselves contain some margin of error, the overall level of which is unknown, and must be regarded as providing only a rough guide as to the level of net emigration.</P>
      <P>In the 1961-66 inter-censal period the aggregate net outward passenger movement by sea and air was about 45 per cent larger than net emigration in the same period.  If one makes the assumption that net emigration, in the period 1st April to 31st March, in later years bears the same ratio to the net passenger movement by sea and air as for the 1961-66 inter-censal period, it may be estimated that net emigration in the years to April, 1967 and 1968, amounted to 15,000 and 18,000 persons respectively.</P>

      <P>Surely it is reckless at a time when prices for cattle are most unsatisfactory and when it is most important that the free flow of cattle exports should be maintained to leave this matter on the long finger?  If there is any doubt in the Minister's mind about this business why should he not for, say, a three-month or six-month period suspend the necessity for having a licence to carry livestock while he is excogitating the advice he is receiving, fixing everybody with notice that at the end of that period a permanent arrangement may take a different form?  <i>Ad interim</i> it simply is not possible to shift the cattle without the assistance of unregistered transport.</P>

      <P>I accept that, but may I urge on the Minister most strenuously to consult with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, and consider whether <i>ad interim,</i> for three months or for six months, the whole licensing regulations could be suspended, fixing all with notice that a new scheme is in contemplation and that at the end of this period of general freedom a new scheme may come into operation because, in these critical months when very large quantities of cattle may be moved, there may be serious hindrances <Col N="2427" /> to an exceptionally profitable cattle trade that is available to us in contemplation of the new price review in Great Britain and, if there is any hold up in cattle shipments, we may lose a very precious market?

These letters note the plans of the Government <Col N="2431" /> of Ireland for the export of pigmeat to the UK, give an assurance that it is not the intention of the UK Government to impose restrictions on imports of pork, and provide that in the event of any arrangements becoming necessary to control imports of pork there will be consultation between the two Governments with a view to seeking an equitable solution for any difficulties that might be involved for Ireland.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2435" /> On the basis of the use of 75 per cent of native wheat in the grist, the annual requirement of the flour milling industry is at present approximately 240,000 tons of dried native wheat.  If in any year a surplus of millable wheat is produced it can be readily disposed of on the home market for animal feed, thus reducing our dependence on imported grain.  This is financed by the levy arrangements introduced in the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) (Amendment) Act 1958 on the suggestion of the representatives of the wheat growers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>We can take it, then, that the Minister does not condone any of these statements made by specific newspapers and journals which would deter farmers from growing wheat this year?  They have been saying that the reason for this is that we are overstocked in relation to wheat acreage.</P>

      <P>Is it not true that if farmers grow the same amount of wheat this year as last year the price can go down by from 10/- to 15/- a barrel?  The Minister said we can dispose of our surplus wheat for animal feeding.  Would it not be better to grow barley?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Deputy talked to anybody recently about the economics, the financial advantage, of switching from wheat to barley on the existing arrangements?  I do not think you could sell farmers the idea that, if they can grow wheat satisfactorily on land which is suitable and where they can have a rotation to suit, they should switch.  Apart from that, it is necessary to say again, this time by way of correction, what figure was paid for wheat grown last year.  We had accepted it at £12½ million.  It now exceeds £15 million and this for 219,000 acres grown.  The yield, at 36 cwt. average, is phenomenal in any country in the world which grows wheat, and the return per acre on average is indicative of the rising trend in the earnings of our farming community as a whole. <Col N="2436" /> It has generated, perhaps unfortunately, conacre bidding this year for land for wheat, putting a cost on conacre beyond £40 an acre and in some cases as high as £50.  It is an amazing figure but last year's outturn generated this demand for land.</P>
      <P>In addition, last year we paid out of the Exchequer £1½ million that in fact should not have been paid out were it not that the levy arrangements under the 1958 Act were not workable &mdash;the principle was good but the practicality was bad.  The Exchequer paid last year as bonus £1½ million. When we consider further that 240,000 tons of wheat is our maximum millable home requirements for the 75 per cent grist as against world prices available for comparable wheat, that the community are contributing another £4 million to be added to the £1½ million bonus, it will be seen we contributed towards wheat growing £5½ million last year.  Farmers will grow more wheat and will continue to grow it if the harvests are good, even if there is a levy.</P>

      <P>Thanks very much for reminding me.  The levy system is not new.  It was put into legislative affect by the Oireachtas at the instance of the wheat-growing representatives in 1958. I have not changed the law.  I have merely used commonsense to make the levy work.  The levy was agreed in legislative form and it was requested by the representatives of the wheat growers more than 10 years ago.  There is no question of penalising anybody. It is a question of putting into effect what the House put into legislation at the time.  I am making it work this year whereas it was impossible to make it work in the past.</P>

Its control must be regarded as a part of normal husbandry, advice on which is available in the ordinary way through the agricultural advisory services.

      <P>Can I take it from the Minister's figures that rates have doubled in the last ten years?  The Minister must remember the time when we were promised complete de-rating but he is still blistering and crucifying the people with this taxation.  I remember the time when we were told that de-rating was coming.  The man in the Park told us that and the rates were only 5/6 in the £ then.</P>

    <P>Claims were served on my Department on 26th April, 1968, and 3rd May, 1968, for a Sunday allowance, a night allowance, a wage increase and a five-day 40-hour week.  The union was replied to on the 2nd May, 1968, and again on 29th May, 1968.  On the latter date, my Department reminded the union that, in considering claims of this nature, it was the practice to have regard to concessions granted in voluntary hospitals in Cork and said that on receipt of notification of the terms of settlement of any similar claims made <Col N="2446" /> on the voluntary hospitals the matter would be further considered.</P>
    <P>The claims in question were dealt with as a group.  Confirmations from the union that agreement had been reached with the FUE in relation to the voluntary hospitals in respect of all the relevant items were completed on the 6th February, 1969, and the claims in respect of the items mentioned, except night allowance, have now been sanctioned. The staff concerned in Cork Military Hospital are not required to work at night and the payment of night allowance does not, therefore, arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is inquiring about the payments pursuant to the Agreement made on 3rd December, 1925, between the British Government and the Government of the Irish Free State.  Under that agreement, the Irish side contracted to pay the British Government (a) a sum of £150,000 on 1st January, 1926, and (b) an annuity of £250,000 for 60 years, of which the first payment became due on 1st April, 1926, and subsequent payments on the 1st April in each succeeding year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount paid to date is almost £10,000,000.  The reason for the discrepancy between the actual payments and the amount of £10,900,000 which would be the total if calculated as stated above is that on the date of the agreement the British Government owed about £900,000 to this country and this figure was offset against the <Col N="2450" /> £150,000 mentioned above and the first three instalments of the annuity. The result of this was that the first payment on foot of the agreement was made in 1929.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Dr. Hillery) (for the Minister for Education)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made it clear on numerous occasions that it was never contemplated even for one moment that the religious orders should not continue to play a foremost part in the provision of secondary education.  The fact that there are now far more generous grants than ever before, capital and otherwise, available for all secondary schools, the vast majority of which are being conducted by religious orders, should of itself be sufficient evidence of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware of the widespread anxiety among religious as to what are the long term <Col N="2452" /> intentions of the Government in this regard and is the Minister not aware that possibly due to the appearance of certain articles in a periodical in respect of which I have asked questions recently of the Minister for Education the view is crystallised in the minds of many that the long term policy of the Department is to create a school structure which makes it impossible for the religious to continue to function?  May we take it as absolutely certain that any school at present operated under the direction of a religious order may assume that its present functions will be sustained and supported by the Government in the future as they have been in the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I think everybody is aware of the unease in the minds of the owners of these schools, and this is not just something that happened recently.  Some years ago when the Government studied the educational system from a social aspect they found that there was an excellent educational system available to a fraction, a big fraction but still a fraction, of the population and they decided on making education, post-primary and other types, available to all the children in the community.  This required the taking of action which caused anxiety in the minds of the owners of the established system.  The Government in no way intend to take from these people what they have.  Our intention has always been to give every child a chance.  We have never, at any time, belittled the contribution made by these orders and the excellence of it for those who got it.  I do not know how I can give a stronger assurance than the Minister had prepared here but which he was unable to give himself.</P>

      <P>With your permission, <Col N="2454" /> a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>My information is that the sanitary accommodation in Saint John the Baptist Girls' National School, Clontarf, is adequate and that the system, though not up to modern standards, is in satisfactory working order.  It may be, however, that some works of a maintenance nature require to be carried out.  I am having enquiries made in this regard and shall take whatever steps may be necessary to ensure that there will be no reasonable cause for complaint during the few months in which the present school building will remain in use.</P>
      <P>The new school at present being built at Seafield Road, Clontarf, will replace the existing Saint John the Baptist Senior Girls' and Infant National Schools.  The contract for this building was placed in August, 1966, and provided for the completion of the building within two years.  I understand, however, that progress on the building was rather slow in the earlier stages, and that a decision by my Department in June, 1968, to provide at the request of the parents accommodation additional to that covered by the original tender occasioned further delay in completing the building.  I am informed that it is now expected that the building will be completed early in May of this year.</P>

      <P>It is an underlying principle of the comprehensive social insurance scheme that only one type of benefit should be paid to a claimant in respect of any period even though more than one of the contingencies for which benefit is provided has arisen in that period in a particular case.  This principle has, however, been departed from to the advantage of widows by the Social Welfare (Overlapping Benefits) Regulations, 1953 to 1967, under which disability or unemployment benefit can be paid in addition to widows' contributory or non-contributory pension.  Under the regulations, a widow in receipt of a contributory pension at the full rate who qualifies for disability or unemployment benefit is paid half the appropriate personal rate of disability or unemployment benefit; if she is in receipt of contributory pension at a reduced rate the half-rate of disability or unemployment benefit is increased by the amount of the reduction in the pension.  If her pension is non-contributory, the rate of benefit payable depends on the rate of pension and can range from half the appropriate personal rate of disability or unemployment benefit to as much as the full rate, plus appropriate adjustments in respect of any dependent children.</P>

In view of this arrogant approach and the dictatorial manner of this particular individual&mdash; he has refused both at the labour level and at the higher ministerial level to meet anybody to discuss the problem and reopen the industry&mdash;is it not incumbent on the Minister, bearing in mind the responsibility he has to the nation generally, to bring people such as this individual to heel?

However, the firm did not see its way to agreeing with my request.  I have made it clear in a public statement that I disapproved of the firm's action and, as I said in reply to the Deputy's question, I have done what was open to me to try to alleviate the position by allowing cement to be imported free of duty.  I would point out again to the Deputy that nationalisation of this industry would not obviate industrial disputes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a most important industry and the fact that the Minister is allowing cement to be imported free of duty does not make any difference good, bad or indifferent because the imported cement will not be handled; it will be blacked by the workers.  That is No. 1.  Secondly, I know the Minister did everything possible to try to settle this dispute.  We all know in Limerick that the Minister did everything a man could do to try to get this man to see reason and bring him to heel.  The workers are well aware of that and they appreciate what the Minister tried but failed to do.  The Minister having done all that, we are now faced with the position that an industry such as this, in which there is no dispute of any kind with maintenance staff, have locked out the staff and have continued to lock them out and will starve them into submission, if necessary, in order that this individual will gain his own ends because of his close relationship with the FUE. Bearing all this in mind, is it not incumbent on the Minister now to move in and introduce legislation similar to the legislation that was introduced in the thirties in connection with foreign insurance companies?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that it was an instruction given by the FUE in January to all firms <Col N="2471" /> involved to dismiss all members of two unions that has caused this trouble and, in view of that, would the Minister consider now that the FUE should be asked to withdraw that instruction immediately?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing only with this particular problem in this particular question.  I would point out that in any industrial dispute there are two sides and, under the system that we operate of free collective bargaining and the right to strike, people may do unreasonable and irrational things.  If we stand over the right to strike and free collective bargaining, then we are standing for that too: we are saying people have the right to do irrational and unreasonable things and, if we suffer as a result of that&mdash;most people are suffering at the moment&mdash;we have to recognise that that is because we have decided, so far at any rate, as a people to have this kind of system and, if we want to avoid the consequences of this situation, then we will have to change the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it was, in fact, as a result of an instruction given by the FUE that this firm did what it did and, if that is so, would the Minister not consider that the FUE should be asked &mdash;they might be more reasonable than the particular individual&mdash;to withdraw their instruction?  That would have the result of settling the dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister inquire?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out again that the conciliation services of the Labour Court are available to settle the dispute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different thing altogether.  There is no dispute. This is carrying out an instruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two sides to it and the employers' side is that it is <Col N="2472" /> part of the dispute; the workers maintain it is a separate dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must realise that, if this attitude is persisted in, there will be a national strike?  If the employer locks out people who have nothing at all to do with the dispute, surely he must realise that every worker in the country will react in the only way in which he can react?  In order to avoid that, I appeal again to the Minister to ask the FUE to withdraw that letter, which had no effect except with the one firm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that Cement Ltd. refused to meet the men at discussion level?  Is he aware that there is no dispute on one side and there is no dispute on the other side either?  This situation has been brought about because of this man's close association with the FUE. Surely to heaven, before ever a strike takes place in any industry, there are discussions between management and labour.  In this instance this arrogant man, who is in receipt of over £30,000 a year to do his job, has refused to discuss the matter with his workers and locked them out.  Will the Minister stand for that kind of conduct?  Will the Minister give me an answer?</P>

      <P>As the information requested by the Deputy is in the form of a tabular statement I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, <Col N="2473" /> to have it circulated with the Official Report.  I am not in a position to list the directorships in private concerns held by those covered in the reply.  As to any cases of directorships in semi-State bodies for which other Ministers <Col N="2474" /> are responsible, time did not permit of a check being made, but a comparison with the replies to the questions submitted to other Ministers will indicate any such cases.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, St. Patrick's Copper Mines have been kept on a care and maintenance basis since their closure in 1962 with a view to exploring the possibility of resumption of mining.</P>
      <P>An option exercisable over a period of 30 months to purchase the assets of St. Patrick's Copper Mines Ltd., was granted on 16th September, 1966, to an international consortium. Until the consortium have assessed the results of their investigations and indicated their intentions for the future, I am not in a position to comment on the possibility of the mines being reopened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The religious orders engaged in hospital nursing have made most valuable contributions to our health services over the years and I am convinced that in the field of nursing the sick where religious and charitable motivation is so relevant we should seek to ensure that they will continue to play an important role.  There is no question of altering the present policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to give the Minister an opportunity to clarify this situation in the minds of many people.  Is the Minister aware of the extent of the anxiety that is spreading amongst religious arising out of the belief which is growing amongst them, that the long-term policy of the Department is designed to remove their authority and their effective functions in their own hospitals, and substitute for them virtually lay control under which they would be required to function <Col N="2484" /> under lay direction?  May we say to the religious who approach us in that regard that it is the long-term purpose of the Government to ensure the control of hospitals operated by the religious will continue to remain in the hands of the religious?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, yes is the answer to that.  May I say I was not impressed by Deputy Ryan in replying on the Private Members' motion last week when he sought, in my opinion, to make mischief on this issue which is a very important one?  I should like to assure the Deputy and the House, as I said in my reply, that there is no question of altering the present policy in regard to religious orders.  One could certainly see over the next 20 years certain changes taking place I hope in the hospital structure generally, as recommended in the Fitzgerald Report. There is not any question, and there will not be any question, of removing from the purview of the sisters or the orders the hospitals they now control. This will continue to be the policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to help the Minister to clarify the position as it is. Therefore, I venture to ask him if he has used the word &ldquo;purview&rdquo; advisedly, or may I reply to inquirers who approach me in this regard by saying that it is no part of Government policy to interfere with the control of the hospitals by the religious who own them as at present operated, subject to whatever agreed adjustments may be made between him and the religious orders concerned?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The appointment of Public Health Nurses is a matter for the Health Authority.  My function is limited to approving the creation of posts of public health nurse.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested to health authorities that, as a general policy, they should aim at providing one nurse for each 4,000 of their population rather than providing a nurse in each dispensary district.  A recent review of the service, undertaken in conjunction with County Medical Officers, showed that this policy was in general proving satisfactory.  The number of posts of public health nurse approved for Galway Health Authority area is somewhat better than the recommended ratio.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy's question relates to the services provided at the Dublin Dental Hospital for adult patients eligible for services from the Dublin Health Authority.</P>
      <P>I am informed that there is usually no delay in dealing with those patients who require extractions and that the waiting period for other forms of treatment is brief, except in the case of dentures where the waiting time may be as long as 12 months.  As the hospital's primary function is to train students in dentistry, the extent of the denture services it can provide for patients sent by the Dublin Health Authority is limited by the necessity to provide an adequate range of treatments in which students can be instructed.</P>
      <P>I have received no proposals from the Dublin Health Authority to supplement the denture services provided by the Dental Hospital for eligible adults.</P>

      <P>I understand from the estimates of the Donegal County Council that it costs almost twice as much to keep a child in a special home as was being paid to maintain a child in the home of foster parents.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health what future plans there are for the improvement of accommodation and surgical and medical facilities for the county hospital, Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be familiar with the report of the Consultative Council on the general hospital services which has made recommendations for the more effective organisation of these services so that the public would be given a better service than is possible under the present system.  I have accepted these recommendations in principle and I have been engaged in discussions about their implementation with representatives of many of the interests concerned including the Wexford County Council.</P>
      <P>It is clear that in planning the long term development of our general hospital services we must depart from the system of County Hospitals related to the needs of the population within the county whether it be large or small. The developments which have taken place in medicine demand a larger catchment than the average county if adequate consultant staffing and the provision of necessary equipment and specialised facilities is to be made available.</P>
      <P>While I have agreed that a new hospital should be provided in Wexford town the issue to be determined is the range of services to be given in it with particular reference to surgery.  I am obtaining information about the extent of the demand for emergency surgery in the county and I will take this into account in arriving at a final decision.</P>
      <P>As regards the immediate prospect, the Deputy is aware of the improvements recently carried out at the County Hospital.  Additional works to improve facilities for the obstetrical service in the hospital are at present under consideration in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the strong feeling there is in the whole of the county of Wexford at the suggestion that the hospital should be downgraded.  I think I intimated this to the Minister in conversation in the recent past.  The Minister <Col N="2490" /> says he has accepted the report in principle. I trust, therefore, that when he says he has accepted it in principle, he has not made up his mind what is to happen to the various county hospitals in the country at the present time, and in this case in Wexford.  Will the Minister say if he is satisfied that the members of that commission, apart from their medical information and their qualifications, which are very high, were in a proper position and had the proper experience of local government, to make such a recommendation to the Government? Will he not agree that it would have been preferable there should have been included some members of local authorities and of the various other organisations in a particular area?  I am sure the Minister has a similar reaction to that in Wexford from various other parts of the country.  I ask him to make immediate arrangements to discuss this matter of the Wexford County Hospital with the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of not having a first-class hospital in Wexford in the future.  The only question is what will be the range of the facilities available in that hospital. On the question of the council, this was a council of consultants recommending on the specialised aspects of medicine and the structure that should develop in the country to give the best results to the people from specialities. There is no question of arbitrary decisions being made in regard to any area. I should be most happy to have discussions in Wexford or elsewhere in regard to the implementation of these recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I can take it, therefore, that it is not intended to reduce the Wexford County Hospital, as suggested in the report, to a health centre concerned with obstetrics and medical cases.  The Minister should also have regard to the social matters, the health effects and economic effects.  He and the Government should appreciate that there appears to have been a deliberate attempt to run down this part of the country recently.  I do not say the Minister for Health has sole responsibility for this.  I appreciate the Minister's <Col N="2491" /> suggestion that this commission approached the problem from a specialist viewpoint, but there are other things to be considered.  There is the question of inconvenience to people who have to visit hospitals, particularly in emergency cases.  In Wexford, if there is a case of acute appendicitis the patient would have to travel a distance of more than 40 miles and in weather like we have had in January and February this could prove fatal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we take it now that the Wexford County Hospital will not close?  I wish to thank the Minister personally for giving us this guarantee. I should like to make one comment on Deputy Corish's speech.  I do not know who ran down industry in Wexford but it was not any of our Party.  Again, I sincerely thank the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Allen has the right end of the stick. The Minister has no intention of closing down the hospital.  What we are objecting to is the degrading of it to a health clinic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have every intention to close down Wexford County Hospital and I hope to close it down quickly along with every other county hospital in the country, but Wexford Hospital will not be closed.  One of the points in the report is that we have to get away from the county idea in regard to the treatment of acute cases. The guarantee I am giving is that there will be in Wexford a first-class hospital and I shall be glad to discuss the range of its facilities with the people concerned.  It will not be a <Col N="2492" /> county hospital.  There will not be any county hospitals any more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state, in relation to his statement in circular HSG 221, addressed to managers of health authorities on 12th February, 1969, that he felt that in the health services substantial economies could be found, in what sections of the health services members of health authorities should seek for these substantial economies; and how it is intended to maintain services that must be statutorily provided under the Health Act, 1953, and at the same time greatly decrease expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The circular letter to which the Deputy refers explained the circumstances in which health authorities were asked to re-examine their estimates.  These were, briefly, the unprecedented increase in the total of estimated requirements for the year 1969-70 as compared with the preceding year and the difficulties which are anticipated by the Minister for Finance in the general Budget situation for the coming year.  As no substantial extensions of the health services had to be provided for, the exceptionally large increases in the overall health costs would not have been realised by individual health authorities, and for that reason, I considered it necessary to explain the situation to each authority and to ask for a re-examination of estimates.  I did not assume that any particular sections of the health services would afford a common basis for reduction of demands on the rates and Exchequer, and, accordingly, I left it to the bodies administering the services to use their own judgment as to what items might be reduced without detriment to the effectiveness of the services.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the suggestion, implicit in the question, that any economies effected by a health authority in view of the particular difficulties of the coming financial year must necessarily influence the maintenance of the statutory services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the largest proportion of the increase is due to salaries and wages and to exorbitant drug prices over which the health authorities have no <Col N="2496" /> control?  Where does he suggest we can make reduction?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he has adverted to the statement made by his predecessor in the Seanad on 12th January, 1966, that the Government were not then happy that the local share of health cost was being equitably distributed between the various health authorities and that he was discussing the problem with the Minister for Local Government; and what steps the Government took as a result of those discussions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already told the House that I have asked health authorities to re-examine critically their estimates for the coming financial year and to endeavour to achieve reductions in projected expenditure, without detriment to the efficiency or availability of the services.  When the replies to my request and other data relating to estimated increases in rates next year have been considered, I shall be in a position to make a statement on the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

Is he aware that in 1965 the late Deputy O'Malley, as Minister for Health, promised to stabilise the health rate in every health authority in Ireland at that time?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The security precautions referred to by the Deputy are primarily a matter for the Health Authorities concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2498" /> Early in December last I wrote to all health authorities regarding the safe custody and supervision of stocks of drugs liable to misuse.  Amongst other things, I advised them to review critically, in consultation with the Garda, their existing precautionary arrangements regarding drugs to ensure that they were satisfactory.  The health authorities are keeping me informed of the results of their reviews.</P>
    <P>I presume the Deputy is particularly concerned with the situation in Dublin. My Department has been in consultation with the Health Authority in the matter.  The authority are fully alive to the situation and have taken steps to improve the security arrangements at their dispensaries.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not well aware that drug abuse definitely seems to be on the increase, that there were 90 prosecutions last year and it is now estimated that there will be at least 500 drug addicts in this country this year?  In view of the number of precautions taken in this <Col N="2499" /> country during the foot and mouth crisis when we were dealing with cattle and for which every credit is due to the Government, does he not think it is more necessary to take precautions now in view of the fact that we are dealing with human beings and that this is a crisis?  Does the Minister not agree that something should be done immediately?  The longer action is delayed the more young people, unfortunately, will become drug addicts. This is a great scourge?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will arrange that all health authorities should provide medical cards for old age pensioners, both contributory and non-contributory, without a means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Health Authorities already grant medical cards automatically on application, to any person receiving a non-contributory old-age pension.  Automatic eligibility is acceptable in these instances, as the pensioners have already undergone a means test to qualify for the non-contributory pension.</P>
      <P>In the case of a contributory pension, however, there is no means test for the pension and it is not necessary for the person to have retired from work. Accordingly, I do not consider that the automatic award of medical cards to such pensioners would be justified.</P>
      <P>Contributory pensioners are frequently granted a medical card after the usual means test to determine if they are able to afford a general practitioner service for themselves or their dependants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister recall that his illustrious predecessor, the late Deputy O'Malley, announced that all old age pensioners should automatically qualify for a medical card?  Is the Minister aware of the fact that this statement lodged in the public mind and many people, who are in receipt of contributory old age pensions who are not working and who are entirely dependent on the contributory pension in order to survive, cannot understand why it is, when they apply for cards, they are subjected to rigorous means tests which are by no means uniform throughout the country and, indeed, often appear to be governed by the attitude of individual investigation officers?  In the light of that, will the Minister consider again the advisability, as a general principle, of making free health treatment available for contributory old age pensioners, <Col N="2502" /> especially bearing in mind the fact that the cost could not be very great?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking at a BBC television programme some time ago, I heard Mr. Robert Menzies, former Prime Minister of Australia, talking about how television affects politicians and how politicians are affected by television.  Since so much of this debate has been taken up with this matter, it strikes me that his remarks may have some relevance because Mr. Menzies was a man with a lifetime of parliamentary experience behind him, all of which has not been conducted at the debating society level as has been the lot of so many of the more fortunate Members of this House.  In the course of what he had to say, Mr. Menzies remarked that for politicians, television had very grave dangers and, of course, that it had some possible advantages also but he felt that the dangers of the television camera by far outweighed the advantages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is frightening us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>This man made an interesting comment on the part that television plays in the life of politicians the world over&mdash;this new thing, television, which has changed the whole face of parliamentary discussion and which has brought the politician right in to sit down beside one at the fireside, as it were, whereas formerly he was a distant figure lecturing from a height whose words of wisdom were to be read in the newsprints suitably corrected grammatically, of course, by the better educated whose job it was to go over the notes they had taken down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the politician has become a feature of the television screen in this <Col N="2510" /> country, as in every other country and quite rightly so because it enables people to establish what this word&mdash; perhaps it could be referred to as a <i>cliché</i>&mdash;&ldquo;communication&rdquo; means. Mr. Menzies agreed that there are politicians who are excellent men&mdash;I should say that in this country, too, there are some excellent men in every Party&mdash;but when these men appear on television, the impression which has very often been created is that they are stupid men.  This may spring from the unsuitability of the men to the medium whereas in fact some of them might be highly intelligent.  Therefore, as far as impressions are given on television, luck plays a great part.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, the ever present temptation for the Establishment to make the maximum use of television to foster support for itself.  I use the word &ldquo;establishment&rdquo; as it was one used by the Minister who I suppose meant that the Government is the main factor in the Establishment.  When an authority is set up by a Government, it is only natural that that authority will consist of people who are Government supporters and that their thoughts and ideas will certainly not run counter to Government policy.  Therefore, the temptation to use the TV medium for propaganda purposes for the Government is very strong.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that there are, independent of the Government, over-anxious individuals in positions of authority who operate, and who are prepared to operate, as apostles of the Government without any suggestion whatever from overhead and who see it as their duty to push the Government line and to suppress so far as they can opposition to the Government.  I think this happened so far as the referendum was concerned.  There was documentary proof which I adduced here in the House of an attempt to stifle discussion prior to the referendum.  The fact that there was proof had the opposite effect to that wished for by the promoters of the document.  They had, willy-nilly, to permit a discussion of the referendum to take place and that discussion had to be of the freest possible character.</P>
    <P>Our television station has been <Col N="2511" /> operating for several years.  I would think that for its size, the size of the country, and the amount of money available to run it, it must surely compare favourably with any similar institution in the world.  We have been extremely lucky that we have been able to obtain in our own population people of such varied talents and abilities as we have seen staffing Telefís Éireann.  We have been extremely lucky.</P>
    <P>The odd thing that strikes me is that the first word of criticism of Telefís Éireann which has come from the Government has come at a time when the Government representatives in the persons of the Taoiseach and the Ministers have not emerged from interviews too creditably, speaking politically.  It is very odd that this comment should be made in these circumstances.  The Minister takes up the position that the television interviewers, particularly on current affairs, should take the utmost care to be impartial and not to take sides.  I believe that they do that so far as is humanly possible.  Certainly they compare well with the BBC interviewers because I have seen the tactics being operated by people like Robin Day on the BBC who would ask what you had for your breakfast and things even more disconcerting and irrelevant.  We have not any great room for complaint in this regard.</P>
    <P>We are politicians in this House. I do not go along with the somewhat crudely expressed sentiments of Deputy O. J. Flanagan who says a politician must have a thick skin.  I do not think any human being should be required to have a thick skin about anything. We are all the same as the people outside and it is because we are the same as the people outside that we are in here.  With all our faults we represent the Irish nation.  We are the people elected by them and it is a great honour to be chosen but we are just the same as the people outside. If we are tickled do we not laugh? If you prick us do we not bleed? If you hurt us do we not cry?  There is no method that has come under my observation of developing a rhinoceroslike exterior which makes one impervious <Col N="2512" /> to insult.  I, certainly, after a fairly long period of time in politics, feel an insult as keenly today as when I was 18 years of age.  Most people will have the same reaction.</P>
    <P>Courtesy is something which is demanded and which one has the right to expect towards all citizens in all situations and circumstances because we are said to be living in a more or less civilised condition of society. One should at all times think of the feelings of other people.  We all slip up on these matters, particularly in this House.  How many Members of this House have said things in the heat of discussion which they would very gladly have withdrawn had they the opportunity to take back the spoken word?  This happens to people in outside employment as well.</P>
    <P>One must agree that the first requirement is courtesy, but there are people who regard any kind of contradiction as an insult.  There are people who think what they say is the revealed truth.  If someone takes a different view &mdash;and this is one of the things which I often think is a feature of membership of the Fianna Fáil and Government Party&mdash;it is taken as a personal insult to the member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is this kind of thing which, to my mind, has resulted in the Minister's completely irrelevant references to the television interviewers in Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>God knows, I have felt at times that certain programmes on Telefís Éireann would make one sick to the heart but I have adopted the simple remedy of turning the knob and changing to another station and reducing the blood pressure and forgetting all about it. Take, for instance, the national song contest.  If that does not appal the minds of the average citizen of this country then we have a long, long way to go.  There are other things as well, without going into too much detail. Efforts are made sometimes on entertainment programmes to present politicians as kind of &ldquo;song-and-dance&rdquo; men or to make &ldquo;song-and-dance&rdquo; men out of them.  It was suggested recently that not alone should politicians go on the Late, Late Show but that their wives should go on too. <Col N="2513" /> For what?  A duet?  I suppose it was that or some such performance.  Did you ever hear the like of it?  When politicians do not accept suggestions they are accused of being afraid of appearing on the medium.  Our trouble is in the reverse.  We have too many people anxious to go on.  Everybody in Ireland wants to be on television. Nearly everybody in Ireland has been on television in some shape or form. Even if you do not get on one way you will get on in another way.  There are various lines of approach, as we all know.</P>
    <P>We can fall into the grievous national error of taking ourselves too seriously. We begin to believe our own publicity, particularly our tourist publicity.  This is fatal.  It is the first sign of decadence in a country.  It is a sure sign of defeat in an election.  Of necessity, the picture is overpainted with perfection.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the programmes on Gerry Fitt.  It is not because he is a friend of mine that I would rush to commend Telefís Éireann for their production in regard to him.  I think he is a northern phenomenon.  The programme showed his family background, the kind of work he does in Belfast, the political circumstances in which he has to operate.  To my mind, it was an excellent job.  It showed us here in the South the facts as they had to be faced by a young working-class man who had a distinct ambition to be in politics. He was quite frank and open about it. He wanted to be a politician.  He wanted to serve the people.  We were informed of the difficulties he had to contend with.  We were able to compare his kind of activities with the activities in which we engage here as politicians.</P>
    <P>I am sure the people here were interested to see our fellow-country-men in Belfast and to note that 99 per cent of the ground they have to cover there is the very same as we have to cover here.  Very largely, they had the same social problems and have to find similar answers to similar questions which are posed daily, hourly and nightly for an active politician in this country.  That kind of programme was beneficial.  That it happened at election time&mdash;well, at what other time would it <Col N="2514" /> happen?  It was at a time when interest in the North was most active.</P>
    <P>Then we had that other compulsive personality, Mr. Paisley.  It was most interesting to watch him, to observe his techniques of mob oratory and to know how successful they were.  It enabled us, I think, to look over the wall, which is the Border, and to see the kind of grotesque thing which still remains there and which is typified by Mr. Paisley, pictured in its most extreme form.  This, in itself, too, was a job well done by Telefís Éireann. I would particularly say that the young man with a southern accent who stood under Mr. Paisley's elbow and put a microphone up to him and asked him questions should be decorated for courage because if ever there was a threatening situation it was obvious that this reverend gentleman was creating one for anybody from south of the Border.</P>
    <P>The comments, therefore, that have been made here by Deputy Norton, in his maiden Fianna Fáil speech, regarding the coverage of Gerry Fitt and the others in the recent election in the North are, I think, very inappropriate. I think Telefís Éireann did a good job there.</P>
    <P>At column 1884 of the Official Report of 27th February, 1969, the Minister, in the course of his introductory remarks, is reported as saying, in relation to television generally:</P>
    <P>There are countries where there is among young people a pervasive unrest whose principal cause is the absence of any philosophy to replace religious doctrine.  Having regard to the majority view in this country on such matters, I will not have RTE used to create a murky, cynical atmosphere in regard to what, ultimately, are problems due to inadequacies in character in people as a whole.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to know what the Minister meant by that.  One could take half a dozen meanings out of it.  Did he mean that we are a nation inadequate in character and that, if we have social problems, these are attributable to our weaknesses?  Did he mean that there is a disappearance of religious influence from this country?  If so, it <Col N="2515" /> has not been apparent to me.  He suggests that Radio Telefís Éireann is being used to create a murky, cynical atmosphere.  Here again, I would suggest that his view is based upon the Fianna Fáil attitude which develops following the initial injections that citizens get when they join that Party, and which are increased as they go along, that anything that is said which is in contradiction of the Party line is insulting, traitorous, treacherous and, as my learned and distinguished colleague from County Dublin would say, not in the national interest.</P>
    <P>There has been developing in the country, for quite a while, a false concept of the politician.  I think it is far deeper&mdash;perhaps I am not entirely in order in referring to it here&mdash;it goes far beyond the images projected by Telefís Éireann.  There is a concept of the politician as a corrupt person which has been fostered not by Telefís Éireann but by people who seem to delight in decrying our institutions, for one reason or another. There are, furthermore, Hollywood concepts, and others, which are totally and utterly fallacious.  One could have a lot to say in that regard.  I fear I would stray outside the Rules of Order and I have no wish to do that.</P>
    <P>As one who has had the privilege of appearing on television&mdash;sometimes emerging feeling disgusted with one-self&mdash;I am always conscious of the extreme good manners of those whom I meet on television: I never meet with anything else.  I cannot hear what Deputy Fitzpatrick of Dublin South-Central is saying.  It is something about Ballyfermot and Ballyfermot is very close to my heart.  I am glad he mentioned it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>All are welcome because it is a very big place&mdash;and we shall see what we shall see.  I must say, however, that I have often felt that the people who have to run the discussions, who have to chair a discussion, Dr. Thornley or anybody who has the job of &ldquo;keeping the ring,&rdquo; as it were, between politicians in the studio, have a <Col N="2516" /> most unenviable task because we have amongst us what would appear to be gentlemen who are camera-hoppers, who will talk forever once they are let out: like runaway horses, they cannot be stopped; whose sole idea would be to consume the maximum amount of the 15 minutes, half-hour or three-quarters of an hour, if that were possible, to the exclusion of the other two unfortunates who may be also present.</P>
      <P>I had an experience of that kind and it was most difficult to draw the attention of the viewing public to the fact that there were more than two people present in the studio, that there was a third Party represented.  On one occasion very recently a Minister, a leading member of the Fine Gael Party and myself, were invited to discuss the Labour Party proposals to reform procedures of Parliament.  We spent the first 15 minutes in a discussion with the Minister, who is a lawyer, and the Fine Gael Deputy, who is also a lawyer, to the utter exclusion of all other subjects, a long discussion on two pieces of legislation which had nothing at all to do with the subject we were called upon to discuss.  It was only by the expertise of the chairman and perhaps a little activity of my own that eventually I was enabled to be permitted to intervene at all and bring the attention of the learned gentlemen to the matters on hand which were of far more interest than the highly technical things they were talking about, but which were no doubt vitally compelling to themselves but for the public generally had little or no interest.</P>
      <P>On the matter of good manners and courtesy I have never seen it absent in Telefís Éireann I must say.  All of us are capable of discourtesy on the spur of the moment.  The thing which is distasteful is calculated discourtesy, the planned insult, the well thought out phrase which is designed to hurt and there has never been, to my knowledge, any evidence of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be said also in regard to the interviewers on Telefís Éireann that they themselves came in for some pretty scurrilous attacks at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis.  These attacks were shown in full on the screen and <Col N="2517" /> the attackers were shown in action&mdash; pretty scurrilous efforts.  Things were said at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis concerning some of the current affairs interviewers with which I am certain many members of the Fianna Fáil Party could not find themselves in agreement.  Nonetheless, they went on. Unlike us, these public servants, for that ultimately is what they are, have not the freedom to reply that we have here in the Dáil, protected as we are by privilege.  Regardless of what is said about us we can reply in kind if we are so minded.  At any rate we can make a reply.  We are protected by the law but these people are not and if they are slandered as I believe they were slandered on that occasion, by ignorant talking about things they know nothing about they have no recourse except to the courts and who is going to take things to the courts? What sensible man would willingly become a prey to the legal apparatus if he could possibly avoid it?</P>
    <P>I listened to Mr. Grimond of the Liberal Party in England last Saturday night giving a very civilised view on this whole question.  He was asked on the Late Late Show by Mr. Byrne what his views were in regard to the probing or abrasive interview and he has had his share of this kind of thing and much more assiduous than anything we have seen here.  He said something which was very true.  He said he would be inclined to welcome that kind of onslaught by an interviewer because, contrary to what is thought, the public are sympathetic to the man whom they feel is being badgered or being taken advantage of. If there is a politician being put in a spot and being snapped and snarled at and made to appear a fool the public, rather than go along with the point of view that the interviewer is trying to put over, will sympathise with the victim.  That is very true.</P>
    <P>Nothing shows as clearly on television as the brusque question too rapidly asked, the lack of time given for a proper reply.  These things show up and they do not do the person who <Col N="2518" /> uses that kind of approach any good at all.  For the moment the politician may feel that he has been badly used but in the heel of the hunt the good sense of the people triumphs and regardless of how cynical people may become concerning the manner in which people form their opinions or conclusions there is present among ordinary people&mdash;and I speak now of ordinary working people&mdash;deep in their minds, a common denominator which determines that they take a commonsense view and a generous view of life and all the problems of life.  They see things, particularly those of them who have had experience of the struggle for existence, for what they really are and not for what they are painted to be. You do get the fringes of course now and again, fringes of hysterical thought. These diminish and vanish and commonsense remains and in the long run wins out.</P>
    <P>I believe that not alone in so far as politicians are concerned but in so far as any current affairs programme is concerned we should aim for the maximum exposure and maximum discussion, free discussion consonant with the bounds of good taste on all these matters because any other policy must necessarily mean censorship and repression. It is contrary to our whole idea of freedom and democracy that we should lend our thought for a moment to the imposition of restraints of that kind particularly on free discussion in a nation which is famous for its ability to deploy words, deservedly or undeservedly is a matter of opinion.  It would be a sorry day for us if we, even by the implications of a speech made by the Minister responsible in this House, were to suggest limitations on the methods of presentation.  Time, experience and the people will weed out the undesirables.  This is true of television. It is true of every activity in life.</P>
